The moisture ratios changes during the drying time were compared by 38 different mathematical models and evaluated by different statistical criteria such as coefficient of determination (R²), reduced chi‐square (χ²), root mean square error and mean relative percentage error (P). According to the results, drying time was between 18 and 38 min at drying temperatures of 60–80C. The lightness and yellowness of the dried mint leaves were significantly increased when compared with fresh samples. The high drying temperature yielded in darker, less green and more yellow mint leaves. When the 38 models compared according to the statistical values, the rational function model (model‐32) for drying temperatures of 60 and 70C and Modified Henderson Pabis‐II model (model‐5) were superior to the others. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Mint essential oil is extracted either from freshly harvested mint leaves or from semi dried or dried leaves through distillation process for industrial use. Therefore, mint drying by using infrared provides many advantages.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3adrying temperature 3aessential oils 3aleaves 3amathematical models1 aHeybeli, Nursel0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2014 Aug., v. 38, no. 4 p.1480-1490dBlackwell Pubx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.121073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005400166300001600220520092200236592002801158650001201186650001301198650001101211650001201222700001801234700002101252773011401273856008201387990002301469852000901492655001201501IND60095165320221120121750.0141104e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009516532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsphaug, Erik10aChondrule formation during planetesimal accretion  ap. 369-379.  aWe explore the idea that most chondrules formed as a consequence of inefficient pairwise accretion, when molten or partly molten planetesimals ~30–100km diameter, similar in size, collided at velocities comparable to their two-body escape velocity ~100m/s. Although too slow to produce shocks or disrupt targets, these collisions were messy, especially after ~1Ma of dynamical excitation. In SPH simulations we find that the innermost portion of the projectile decelerates into the target, while the rest continues downrange in massive sheets. Unloading from pre-collision hydrostatic pressure P₀~1-100bar into the nebula, the melt achieves equilibrium with the surface energy of chondrule-sized droplets. Cooling is regulated post collision by the expansion of the optically thick sheets. on a timescale of hours–days. Much of the sheet rains back down onto the target to be reprocessed; the rest is dispersed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3adroplets 3aenergy 3amelting1 aJutzi, Martin1 aMovshovitz, Naor0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 308, no. 3-4 p.369-379dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008100170300001400251520160000265592002801865650002001893650001701913650001101930650002701941650001501968650001201983651001101995653002002006653002802026653003102054653002002085700002302105773010202128856008502230852000902315655001202324IND60546261320221121020907.0160903e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054626132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.11.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIveroth, Einar10aChanging behavior towards sustainable practices using Information Technology  ap. 59-68.  aThis article addresses the question of how to change individuals' behavior towards more sustainable practices using Information Technology (IT). By following a multidisciplinary and socio-technical perspective, this inquiry is answered by applying a new framework—The Commonality Framework for IT-enabled Change—on a case study of sustainable behavioral change. The framework is grounded in practice theory and is used to analyze the implementation of an IT-system aimed at changing citizens' behavior towards more sustainable transport logistics and procurement in Uppsala, Sweden. The article applies case study research design and the empirical data consists of surveys, in-depth and semi-structured interviews, observations and archival documents. The results show how the change towards sustainable practices is an entanglement of both social and technical-structural elements across time. In this process, structures such as IT are the enablers, and the actors and their social activities are the tipping-point factors that ultimately determine the success of changing individuals' behavior towards a more sustainable direction. This article provides a more balanced view of how both actor and structure related properties interact during the on-going work with change towards greater sustainability practices than earlier research has offered. More specifically, the article offers both a lower-level theory and a method from which we can analyze change processes where technology is seen in its context, and where both technology and the human actor is brought forth to center stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3acase studies 3ahumans 3ainformation technology 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3aSweden 0aBehavior change 0aTechnology based change 0aSociotechnical perspective 0aPractice theory1 aBengtsson, Fredrik0 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 June 15, v. 139 p.59-68dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.11.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007800166300001600244520184700260592002802107650001702135650001302152650001002165650001402175650002002189650002502209650001902234650001102253650001502264650000902279653002202288653002402310653002102334653001802355653001802373700001602391700001702407700001602424700001702440700001302457773011202470856008202582852000902664655001202673IND60532632720221120073758.0190411e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053263272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2013.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yonghui10aModeling morphological dynamics and color characteristics of rice panicle  ap. 279-290.  aThis paper was to develop the models for predicting the dynamics of panicle geometric morphology, panicle and branch curves and panicle color, and to visualize rice panicle in three dimensions (3D). Based on three experiments with different rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, the time-course data were collected on the panicle geometric morphology, (including the number of branches and spikelets, the lengths of panicle and branches, and the diameter of panicle axis), the spatial coordinates of panicle axis and branches, and the RGB (red, green and blue) values of panicle color in rice. The dynamics of rice panicle morphology, panicle and branch curves, and RGB values of panicle color with thermal time (TT) were then characterized and simulated. The derived models were further used to visualize rice panicle in 3D. The results indicated that some appropriate functions (quadratic, logistic, exponential and Gaussian) could be chosen to describe the dynamics of the panicle geometric morphology and the RGB values of panicle color with time (growing process) and space (distributions of panicle organs) during panicle development. Combining the above models with the topological structure of rice panicle, rice panicle was visualized with Microsoft.Net and OpenGL (a graphics library). Validation of the models with the independent data indicated that all relative root mean square errors (RRMSEs) between the measured and simulated values were below 20%. Comparison of virtual and real panicles at different development stages showed that the virtual rice panicles were quite similar to real panicles. Overall, the present study could effectively simulate the dynamic changes of 3D morphology and color characteristics of rice panicle, and would provide a key technological support for fulfilling visualization of the whole rice plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abranches 3acolor 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adevelopmental stages 3ainflorescences 3amodels 3aprediction 3arice 0aRice architecture 0aArchitectural model 0aPanicle geometry 0aVirtual plant 0aCrop modeling1 aTang, Liang1 aLiu, Xiaojun1 aLiu, Leilei1 aCao, Weixing1 aZhu, Yan0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2014 Jan., v. 52 p.279-290dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2013.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245011900204300001600323500002000339520170300359592002802062596003902090650001202129650001902141650001902160650001502179650001702194650001602211650001602227650001702243650001602260650001802276650002102294650001402315650002502329650002502354650001502379650001802394650001902412650001002431650001002441700002002451700002202471700001702493773013302510856007902643852000902722655001202731IND60649080320221116143504.0190702e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064908032DNAL7 a10.1111/1747-0080.125212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolley, Sinéad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8468-125010aThinking about going wheat‐free? Evidence of nutritional inadequacies in the dietary practices of wheat avoiders  ap. 305-312.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To assess dietary intake and nutritional adequacy amongst self‐identified symptomatic wheat‐avoiders. METHODS: Thirty‐four self‐identified symptomatic avoiders of wheat‐based products without a diagnosis of coeliac disease or wheat allergy were recruited to participate in a dietary assessment study. Dietary intake was assessed via a three‐day weighed food record. Participants were aged 33 to 83 years, were predominantly women (n = 30) and had been avoiding wheat for a mean of six years. Nutrient intakes were compared with Nutrient Reference Values. Food group intakes were assessed and consumption of wheat‐containing and wheat‐free cereal‐based foods described. RESULTS: Inadequate intakes of key protective nutrients such as fibre and calcium were common; many participants reported avoiding dairy as well as wheat. Intakes of total and saturated fat exceeded recommendations. Although 85% of the sample reported avoiding all wheat products, at least one third of cereal products and dishes consumed in this group, comprising mostly discretionary‐type foods, were wheat based. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake patterns and resulting nutrient imbalances in individuals restricting or eliminating wheat to manage symptoms are cause for concern. The situation is likely exacerbated by the tendency for many wheat avoiders to report also avoiding other foods, especially dairy products. A bi‐disciplinary approach from medical practitioners and dietitians to individuals experiencing unexplained gastro‐intestinal symptoms and strategies to support informed food choice is needed to combat longer‐term health consequences of a diet with this nutritional profile.  aPublisher supplied data  cGrains & Legumes Nutrition Council 3acalcium 3aceliac disease 3adairy products 3adietitians 3afood choices 3afood groups 3afood intake 3afood records 3agrain foods 3anormal values 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional adequacy 3aphysicians 3apublic health 3asaturated fats 3awheat 3awomen1 aBaird, Danielle1 aHendrie, Gilly A.1 aMohr, Philip0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2019 July, v. 76, no. 3 p.305-312dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3613350x1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013300167300001400300520105600314536020101370592002801571596004401599596007301643596005701716650003401773650001201807650001801819650002501837650001701862650001401879650001201893650001401905650001801919650001701937650001201954650002301966650002101989650001902010650001402029650001102043650002002054653002002074653002502094653001502119653002702134653002702161653002302188700001402211700001302225700001502238773013602253856008502389852000902474655001202483IND60627686120221121085316.0190128e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062768612DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2018.15615702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Wuyin10aAntioxidant Properties and Arsenic Speciation of Ultrafiltration and Nanofiltration Derived Abalone Viscera Hydrolysate Fraction  ap. 64-73.  aA fraction with molecular weight of 0.2–1.0 kDa was prepared from abalone viscera hydrolysate by ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. The contents of protein, carbohydrate, and fat in abalone viscera were 45.75%, 18.19%, and 13.60%, respectively. The protein in abalone viscera hydrolysate faction (AVHF) reached up to 75.73%, while carbohydrate and fat fell to 1.80% and 0.20%, respectively. The leucine (Leu) content was the highest in the AVHF. On the other hand, the hydroxyl and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activities and reducing power increased with increased concentration of AVHF. The inhibiting ability of AVHF on lipid peroxidation was higher than that of ascorbic acid. The total content of K, Na, and P in AVHF was 9.78 g/100 g, and total arsenic content reached 16.23 mg/kg. The proportion of arsenobetaine and arsenocholine accounted for more than 96%, while the proportion of arsenate was 0.47%, and arsenite was not detectable. It is concluded that the AVHF from abalone viscera is a safe natural antioxidant.  aThis work is sponsored by National Natural Science Fund (31571835), Special Scientific Research Fund of Marine Public Welfare (201405016) and Xiamen Science and Technology Project (3502Z20173032).  aPublisher supplied data  a31571835cNational Natural Science Fund  a201405016cSpecial Scientific Research Fund of Marine Public Welfare  a3502Z20173032cXiamen Science and Technology Project 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aabalone 3aanimal organs 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3aascorbic acid 3ahydrolysates 3aleucine 3alipid peroxidation 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3apotassium 3asodium 3aultrafiltration 0aAbalone viscera 0aenzymatic hydrolysis 0afiltration 0aamino acid composition 0aantioxidant properties 0aarsenic speciation1 aLi, Jieyu1 aLi, Ting1 aYe, Yanjun0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 28, no. 1 p.64-73dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2018.15615703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245013000164300001800294520188000312592002802192650001402220650002302234650002102257650001502278650002202293650001402315650004402329650000902373700004102382700002502423773010602448856007502554852000902629655001202638IND60577852620180718000000.0170810e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057785262DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401332k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaffredo, Cédric
G.10aPoly(hydroxyalkanoate) Block or Random Copolymers of β-Butyrolactone and Benzyl β-Malolactone: A Matter of Catalytic Tuning  ap. 6765-6776.  aThe controlled copolymerization of racemic β-butyrolactone (BL) and racemic benzyl β-malolactone (MLABe) has been achieved under mild operating conditions (in bulk at 60 °C) with various systems derived either from a metal-based (pre)catalyst associated with isopropanol (ⁱPrOH) acting as a co-initiator and a chain transfer agent or more simply from a neat basic organocatalyst. Among the metallic systems evaluated, only the neodymium triflate-based catalyst system, Nd(OTf)₃/ⁱPrOH, enabled the preparation, upon simultaneous addition of the two monomers, of poly(benzyl β-malolactone-ran-β-butyrolactone) random copolymers (P(MLABe-ran-BL)) with Mₙ,NMR up to 5800 g mol–¹ (ĐM = ca. 1.4) as evidenced by ¹H and ¹³C NMR. Simultaneous copolymerization of the comonomers mediated by the zinc β-diketiminate [(BDI)Zn{N(SiMe₃)₂}]/ⁱPrOH system only afforded PMLABe, leaving BL unreacted. Also, the sequential copolymerization with this zinc catalyst proceeded effectively only when BL was introduced prior to MLABe. In contrast, both the Nd-based system and basic organocatalysts of the guanidine (1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene, TBD), amidine (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene, DBU), and phosphazene (2-tert-butylimino-2-diethylamino-1,3-dimethylperhydro-1,3,2diazaphosphorine, BEMP) type effectively copolymerized MLABe and BL in a sequential approach, regardless of the order of comonomers addition, forming the corresponding P(MLABe-b-BL) block copolymers, with segments of significant length (ca. 88 BL and 360 MLABe units; Mₙ,NMR up to 73 500 g mol–¹ with ĐM = 1.44). Remarkably, BEMP afforded P(MLABe-b-BL) from either a simultaneous or a sequential approach and regardless of the order of the comonomers addition. Kinetic and microstructural control in copolymerization of MLABe and BL can thus be achieved via catalytic tuning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3aguanidines 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aneodymium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3azinc1 aCarpentier, J.-F.q(Jean-François),1 aGuillaume, Sophie M.0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 46, no. 17 p.6765-6776dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma401332k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150242010500171245010900276300001400385520101400399592002801413650002901441650002601470650001001496650001301506650001901519650001301538653002701551653002601578653003801604653002501642653002101667653002401688653002501712653003201737653002301769653001901792700001801811700003901829773010501868856008401973852000902057655001202066IND60121890320221121100951.0150325e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012189032DNAL7 a10.1080/12538078.2012.6716432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimpouni, Victor10aVariation de la composition floristique des fruitiers traditionnels après abandon en zone de savane10aVariation of the floristic composition of the traditional fruit-lofts after abandonment in savannah zone  ap. 53-65.  aThe floristic diversity of two batches of traditional orchards of ± 20 and ± 40 years were studied according to the degree of anthropogenic activity. Installed in savannah, the orchards of ± 20 years are maintained, whereas those of ± 40 years are abandoned since more than one score of year. The inventory counts 24 species of which 21% are common to both batches of orchards. The respective average densities are of 94 ± 3.46 trees.ha-1 and 102 ± 2 trees.ha-1. The coefficients of similarity of Jaccard and Sørensen discriminate the two batches, whereas the diversity indexes of Shannon (0.79 ± 0.38 and 0.93 ± 0.02) and of Simpson (5.63 ± 1.05 and 13.74 ± 1.79), underline their weak diversification. As for the index of Pielou (0.42 ± 0.17 and 0.46 ± 0.02), it marks a predominance in the two batches of orchards. The phytogeographic data characterise the Guineo-Congolian basic element (29.16%), although the flora is being dominated by the settler species (50%) of pantropical distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abotanical composition 3aflora 3aorchards 3aphytogeography 3asavannas 0adiversité floristique 0avergers traditionnels 0aindices de diversité floristique 0aindices écologiques 0aphytogéographie 0afloristic diversity 0atraditional orchards 0afloristic diversity indices 0aecological indices 0aphytogeography1 aApani, Ernest1 aMotom, Victor Kouvoukana et Marcel0 tActa botanica Gallica.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 159, no. 1 p.53-65dRoutledgewJournal:2135x2166-34087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12538078.2012.6716433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165300001600251520170100267592002801968650001401996650001302010650001202023650001302035650002202048650001402070650001102084650001202095650001502107650002002122650002302142650002402165650001802189650004302207650001202250650001102262650001102273650001902284650001202303650001402315650001502329650002102344650001702365650001802382650001402400650001102414700002002425700001802445700002202463700002302485700002102508773008902529856008102618852000902699655001202708IND60572837720221119035746.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057283772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9801-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, Nam V.10aHigh-Throughput Profiling of the Fiber and Sugar Composition of Sugarcane Biomass  ap. 400-416.  aLignocellulosic biomass from sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) could potentially be a major feedstock for second-generation biofuel production. Consequently, selecting sugarcane varieties with favorable biomass characteristics, typically less enzymatic recalcitrance and better saccharification yield without sugar-yield penalty, will be important in sugarcane breeding. Economical and high-throughput techniques for profiling the major biomass components of this complex system will facilitate selection of clones with ideal lignocellulosic composition from large numbers of genotypes in breeding programs. We used a combined high-throughput profiling approach to evaluate the biomass composition of samples from a sugarcane germplasm collection. This employed near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for fiber characterization and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for determining the sugar content in juice. The results for 331 samples, from a diverse sugarcane population of 186 genotypes, derived from 143 parents of different genetic backgrounds, showed that high-quality NIR spectroscopic predictions were feasible for cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives values in fiber, and sugars in juice were suitably analyzed by HPLC. The analysis of total biomass indicated that this NIR- and HPLC-based high-throughput method allowed a robust phenotypic assessment of a large number of samples for the key biomass traits in the sugarcane system, including total dry biomass, fiber, sugar content, and theoretical ethanol yields, and could potentially become the method of choice for sugarcane germplasm screening in breeding programs targeting the support of biofuel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acellulose 3aclones 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agenetic background 3agermplasm screening 3ahemicellulose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahybrids 3ajuices 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3asaccharification 3aspectroscopy 3asugar content 3asugarcane 3asugars1 aFurtado, Agnelo1 aDonnan, Laura1 aKeeffe, Eloise C.1 aBotha, Frederik C.1 aHenry, Robert J.0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.400-416dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9801-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245005100162300001600213520168200229592002801911650001901939650001201958650002201970650001201992650001102004650001102015650001802026650001802044700002102062700001502083700001502098773011402113856008202227990002302309852000902332655001202341IND60095165520221120121645.0141104e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009516552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.epsl.2011.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrott, M.10aVolcanic outgassing of CO₂ and H₂O on Mars  ap. 391-400.  aVolcanic outgassing is one of the main sources of volatiles for the martian atmosphere and degassing of the martian interior potentially influenced the early martian climate. Using a parameterized thermo-chemical evolution model and considering two end-member melting models, we self-consistently calculate the amount of CO₂ and H₂O outgassed during the martian evolution. Outgassing rates are found to depend primarily on a factor describing the outgassing efficiency, the bulk mantle water content, the mantle oxygen fugacity, and the local melt fraction in the magma source regions. We find that significant outgassing ceased around 3.5–2Gyr ago, depending on the adopted melting model. A total of 0.9–1bar CO₂ is outgassed during this time period if a mantle oxygen fugacity corresponding to one log₁₀ unit above the iron–wustite buffer is assumed. Additionally, a total of 17–61m of water is delivered to the surface. Outgassing is most efficient in the pre-Noachian (up to 4.1Gyr), but still significant during the Noachian, and 5–15m of water and ∼250mbar of CO₂ are outgassed between 4.1 and 3.7Gyr. Although this amount is probably insufficient for an appreciable greenhouse effect, pressures are found to be sufficient to stabilize transient liquid water on the surface well into the Hesperian period. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that rather than being warm-and-wet, the martian climate was probably cold-and-wet. Outgassing is found to strongly decline during the Hesperian, and is insignificant during the Amazonian period. A simple parameterization for the outgassing of CO₂ and H₂O as a function of time is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3agreenhouse effect 3amelting 3amodels 3aoxygen 3asurface water 3awater content1 aMorschhauser, A.1 aBreuer, D.1 aHauber, E.0 tEarth and planetary science letters.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 308, no. 3-4 p.391-400dElsevier B.V.x0012-821X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2011.06.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245008000203300002000283520150800303592002801811596009701839650001501936650002101951650001401972650001501986650001902001650001402020650001502034650001302049650002302062650002102085650001402106650001102120700005702131700005902188773017302247856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60786453020221122224439.0220803e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078645302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c014932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZolghadr, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5799-269110aEvaluation of Pyrolysis Wax as a Solvent in Polyolefin Pyrolysis Processing  ap. 11080-11088.  aA lack of recycling-process technologies has led to plastic pollution becoming one of the world’s greatest environmental crises. Plastic fast pyrolysis is a recycling technology that may enable the conversion of waste plastic into virgin-quality plastic resin, thereby contributing to a circular economy for plastics. In this study, pyrolysis wax, a byproduct of the plastic pyrolysis process, was evaluated for its use as a solvent for plastic waste in preparation for pyrolysis. The viscosity of a 1:1 ratio mixture of pyrolysis wax with HDPE and PP at 220, 240, and 260 °C was measured. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed at three different weight percentages of the samples (25, 50, and 75 wt %) to determine the solubility and characterize the thermal behavior of HDPE/pyrolysis wax, LDPE/pyrolysis wax, and PP/pyrolysis wax mixtures. A unique semibatch pyrolysis pilot plant, including a dissolution tank and a tubular pyrolysis reactor, was used to convert pyrolysis wax/plastic feed at 600 °C. The reaction exhibited a complete conversion with a residence time of approximately 2 s, while GC-MS analysis demonstrated pyrolysis of both the wax and HDPE in the feed. Plastic waste and pyrolysis wax are soluble at 240 °C for up to 75 wt % of plastic. The pilot plant experiment, with its semibatch system involving a dissolution tank, verifies the feasibility of using pyrolysis wax as a viscosity-reducing strategy prior to pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data  aHR00112020033cDefense Advanced Research Projects Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000185 3abyproducts 3acircular economy 3apollution 3apolyolefin 3aprocess design 3apyrolysis 3asolubility 3asolvents 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3aviscosity 3awastes1 aKulas, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3165-38161 aShonnard, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5719-254X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 July 20, v. 61, no. 30 p.11080-11088dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c014933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012100167300001600288520143800304592002801742650002801770650001501798650001201813650001601825650002201841650001401863650002801877650001101905650001201916650002301928650001801951650001101969650001901980650001201999650001402011653002802025653001602053653003502069653002502104700001902129773012502148856008402273852000902357655001202366IND60726719420221119231309.0210705e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072671942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jobab.2021.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Amisha10aIntegrated lignocellulosic biorefinery: Gateway for production of second generation ethanol and value added products  ap. 108-128.  aAn increasing demand for energy and depleting petroleum sources has elevated the need for producing alternative renewable resources. Owing to the prominence of lignocellulosic biomass as bio-renewable and the most abundant resource on Earth, this critical review provides perceptions into the potential of lignocellulosic biomass for production of second generation (2G) ethanol and value added products in a biorefinery manner. The efficient utilization of all three components of lignocellulosic biomass (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) would play a significant role in the economic viability of cellulosic ethanol. The pretreatment method is the key to the success of bioconversion processes and greatly influences the economics of biorefinery process. Biotechnology tools and process engineering play pivotal roles in development of integrated processes for production of biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials from lignocellulosic biomass. Although, lignocellulosic biorefinery has ample scopes, commercial production of biofuels and chemicals is still challenging. In this context, this review entails concept of lignocellulose biorefinery, latest developments in 2G ethanol production process, importance and market potential of 2G ethanol as renewable fuel and value added chemicals, integration of processes, challenges for integrated production of fuel together with value added chemicals and future directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acellulose 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amarkets 3apetroleum 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aBiorefinery 0aSecond generation (2G) ethanol 0aValue added products1 aShah, Amita R.0 tJournal of bioresources and bioproducts.g2021 May, v. 6, no. 2 p.108-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27491x2369-96987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobab.2021.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100002200198245014400220300001600364500000900380506017300389520136200562592002801924650003401952650003801986650001302024650003102037650001402068650001002082650002002092650002502112650002302137650002802160650001202188650001402200651000902214651001302223700001702236700002402253700003002277700002502307773014302332856011202475856008402587956010302671961000902774852000902783655001202792IND50066105820221214223509.0191122e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006610582DNAL7 a2864582aris7 a10113/563082hdl7 a10.3198/jpr2012.09.0033crgs2doi8 ans1444  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattler, Scott E.10aRegistration of N614, A3N615, N616, and N617 Shattercane Genetic Stocks with Cytoplasmic or Nuclear Male Sterility and Juicy or Dry Midribs  ap. 245-249.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aFour shattercane [Sorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii (Nees ex Steud.) de Wet ex Davidse] genetic stocks—N614 (Reg.

Flow cytometry (FCM) is an excellent tool for measuring fluorescence and physical proprieties of particles but it has seldom been used in photosynthetic studies and thus the full extent of its potentialities, in this field of research, remains unknown. To determine the suitability of FCM in photosynthesis studies, pea plants were exposed to Paraquat and their status was analyzed during 24 h. FCM was used to evaluate the integrity (volume and internal complexity) and the relative fluorescence intensity (FL) of chloroplasts extracted from those plants. To elucidate which type of information the FL conveys, FL values were correlated with the minimum fluorescence level (F0), maximum fluorescence level (Fm) and maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), obtained by using Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation (PAM) fluorometry. Results indicate that: (1) the biomarkers used to evaluate the structural integrity of the chloroplasts were more sensitive to Paraquat exposure than the ones related to fluorescence; (2) the variation of the chloroplast’s structure, as time progressed, pointed to a swelling and subsequent burst of the chloroplast which, in turn, compromised fluorescence emission; (3) FL presented a high and significant correlation with the Fv/Fm and to a lesser degree with Fm but not with F0; (4) pigment content did not reveal significant changes in response to Paraquat exposure and is in agreement with the proposed model, suggesting that the cause for fluorescence decrease is due to chloroplast disruption. In sum, FCM proved to be an outstanding technique to evaluate chloroplastidal functional and structural status and therefore it should be regarded as a valuable asset in the field of photosynthetic research.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorometry 3aplant biology 3apeas 3abiomarkers 3afluorescence 3aflow cytometry 3aphotosystem II 3aparaquat 3acase studies 3achloroplasts 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aAzevedo, R.1 aCosta, A.1 aSerôdio, J.1 aSantos, C.0 tPhotosynthetica.g2012 June, v. 50, no. 2 p.197-205dSpringer-Verlagx0300-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11099-012-0022-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245009100207300001800298506007600316520107700392592002801469596003001497596003701527596003201564506003701596650001301633650001801646650001901664650001001683650001101693650000901704650002001713650002601733700002401759700001701783700002101800700001501821700001901836773012001855856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60624856320221207094813.0181206e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062485632DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx0162doi7 aPMC58600502pmcid7 a281693952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xing10aannoPeak: a web application to annotate and visualize peaks from ChIP-seq/ChIP-exo-seq  ap. 1570-1571.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSummary: We developed annoPeak, a web application to annotate, visualize and compare predicted protein-binding regions derived from ChIP-seq/ChIP-exo-seq experiments using human and mouse cells. Users can upload peak regions from multiple experiments onto the annoPeak server to annotate them with biological context, identify associated target genes and categorize binding sites with respect to gene structure. Users can also compare multiple binding profiles intuitively with the help of visualization tools and tables provided by annoPeak. In general, annoPeak will help users identify patterns of genome wide transcription factor binding profiles, assess binding profiles in different biological contexts and generate new hypotheses.

Constructed wetland units with cobble-stone and broken-stone material as filter media were planted with common reed (Phragmites spp.) plants. Water samples collected from inlets and outlets of the wetland units were analyzed to determine total suspended solids, COD, ammonia-nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. The results show that removal efficiency was quite low with cobble-stone filter media, whereas constructed wetland units with broken-stone filter media led to higher removal efficiency for SS (73.54%), COD (55.48%), NH3-N (81.89%) and TP (57.08%), respectively, but had a TN removal of −29.29% (increase in effluent). Results indicate that overall broken-stone filter media demonstrated better performance than cobble-stone filter media because broken-stone has larger specific surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3aphosphorus 3aplanting 3apollutants 3arunoff 3asubsurface flow 3asurface area 3atotal suspended solids 0aHorizontal sub-surface flow CW 0aHighway runoff 0aRemoval efficiency 0aFilter substrates1 aSingh, Rajendra Prasad1 aJuan, Huang1 aOjha, C.S.P.1 aSurapalli, Rao Y.1 aZhang, Tian C.0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Mar., v. 64 p.193-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013200166500002200298520072900320592002801049650001601077650001401093650002301107650002301130650002501153650002401178650001601202650003001218653001501248653003401263653002701297653001501324700001901339700001501358700001801373700001301391700005301404700005701457773008801514856008501602852000901687655001201696IND60670269520221120222120.0191004e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1512062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Wenjun10aDivergent synthesis of spirocyclopentene-pyrazolones and pyrano[2,3-c]-pyrazoles via Lewis base controlled annulation reactions  aPre-press version  aAn effective Lewis base catalyst-controlled α-regioselective annulation reaction of γ-substituted allenoates with unsaturated pyrazolones has been developed, affording various spirocyclopentene-pyrazolones and pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazoles.

Climatic trends in wood density are recognized, yet their contribution to regional biogeographical patterns or impact on forest biomass stocks is not understood. This study has the following two objectives: (O1) to characterize wood density–climate trends for coarse (i.e., angiosperm versus gymnosperm) and fine (i.e., within‐species) taxonomic units and test a predictive model that incorporates these trends into a model that assumes range‐wide wood density is constant; and (O2) to assess the impact of climate‐driven intraspecific variation on forest biomass stocks for major tree species. LOCATION: We use an assemblage of eastern U.S. tree species for assessing climatic trends (O1), and then apply fitted models to forest inventory data spanning the eastern U.S.A. to assess impacts of forest carbon estimation procedures (O2). METHODS: We compared hierarchical models fitted to the full data to characterize wood density/climate gradients and to assess the impact of within‐species variation (O1). Then, we compared predictions of biomass stocks from the climate‐variable model with those of the static model using the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database (O2). RESULTS: We found among‐ and within‐species trends related to temperature and moisture regimes, with differing responses between angiosperms and gymnosperms. Incorporating within‐species variation in wood density increases the carbon stock of the study region by an estimated 242 Tg when compared with a species‐only model. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Intraspecific variation in wood density across species ranges suggests that climate influences investment in stem wood within tree species and contributes to biogeographical patterns in wood density in the eastern U.S.A. This variation impacts forest biomass stock assessments, and thus contributes refinements to the U.S. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In addition, our work highlights the potential for combining trait data and forest inventory to infer forest ecological processes at broad spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aGymnospermae 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3adatabases 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3aintraspecific variation 3amodels 3anational forests 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3astemwood 3atemperature 3atrees 3awood density 3aEastern United States1 aCurzon, Miranda T.1 aDomke, Grant M.1 aRussell, Matthew B.1 aWoodall, Christopher W.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2017 Oct., v. 26, no. 10 p.1153-1164dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.126253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002100150245008600171300001600257520127700273592002801550650001301578650001101591650001101602650001701613700002201630700002501652700001901677700001701696773009901713856008601812852000901898655001201907IND4447319420221119124023.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444731942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2010.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Robert A.10aConsistent flavor naming predicts recognition memory in children and young adults  ap. 173-178.  aThe relationship between flavor naming and recognition memory was evaluated in groups of children and young adults who either self-generated flavor names or chose flavor names from a list of four alternatives. The adults were more successful at naming and remembering the flavors, with the age differences in naming performance tending to be larger than differences in memory performance. Differences in recognition memory among the age groups were modest, ranging from 3% to 12%. Providing flavor labels improved naming accuracy, but not naming consistency or memory for younger children (4–7years old). Labels improved naming accuracy and consistency for the older children (8–11years old), and showed a trend toward improving memory. Labels improved naming accuracy, consistency and recognition memory in adults. Consistent naming was a powerful predictor of recognition memory for each age group and test condition. Consistently named flavors were remembered correctly on 88% of the trials while inconsistently named flavors showed no evidence of memory. It was concluded that flavor recognition memory and naming consistency were both rooted in successfully matching flavor percepts to a multi-dimensional flavor representation that includes semantic information.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3aflavor 3amemory 3ayoung adults1 aBrearton, Melinda1 aRybalsky, Konstantin1 aCessna, Trevor1 aHowe, Steven0 tFood quality and preference.g2011 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.173-178dElsevier Ltdx0950-32937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2010.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245008500205300002000290520082200310592002801132653001701160653003301177653003101210653003501241653002401276700002101300700002201321700001901343700001901362700002001381773019401401856007901595852000901674655001201683IND60517965720160519000000.0160406e20151013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051796572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15125821122doi7 aPMC46116232pmcid7 a264170792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStangl, Thomas10aMesoscopic quantum emitters from deterministic aggregates of conjugated polymers  ap. E5560-E5566.  aSignificance Bright and stable single-photon sources, based on molecular objects, have contributed to exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics and measurement theory. Because the photon emission rate scales with molecular size, the most direct approach to increasing brightness is to enlarge the molecular object itself. But how big can it become while still retaining molecular characteristics of a deterministic photon source? We tackle this question by growing defined aggregates out of single chains of a conjugated polymer. Multichain aggregates show discrete single-photon emission, even when the individual chains display multiphoton emission. Single-aggregate spectroscopy reveals how coherent and incoherent excitonic intermolecular coupling mechanisms, known from the bulk, evolve with aggregate size.  aPublisher supplied data 0aphotophysics 0asingle-molecule spectroscopy 0ainterchromophoric coupling 0astructure–property relations 0aorganic electronics1 aWilhelm, Philipp1 aRemmerssen, Klaas1 aHöger, Sigurd1 aVogelsang, Jan1 aLupton, John M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Oct. 13, v. 112, no. 41 p.E5560-E5566dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15125821123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013500172300001600307520182400323592002802147650002202175650002302197650001802220650001202238650002402250650001302274650001502287650001702302650002102319650001002340650002002350650002202370650000702392650001402399650001002413650002002423650001602443650001102459650001102470650001402481650002302495650001802518650001502536651001202551653001302563653001702576653001102593653001202604653001302616653001402629700002002643700002402663700002202687700001802709700002102727700002102748700001902769700001602788700002602804773010302830856008602933852000903019655001203028IND60537858620221122234046.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053785862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolkkinen, Mikko10apH-levels in intensively drained and peatland-dominated river basin: Paleolimnological approach to detect impacts of past land use  ap. 367-376.  aPeatland drainage can have major ecological and biogeochemical impacts on aquatic environments in boreal regions. In the Sanginjoki river catchment in North Ostrobothnia, Finland, peatland drainage is suspected to increase the acidity of recipient waters. Possible reasons are acid sulphate soils (ASS) or black schist deposits, which occur especially in lower parts of the river basin, or increased transport of humic substances. It is not known how long acidification has affected water quality and biota in the river. To study historical pH levels, we examined sediment cores from two ponds in the main channel of the Sanginjoki river and one small lake in the Sanginjoki catchment. Diatom and geochemical analysis and 137Cs-derived chronology were combined to estimate historical pH levels and changes in land use practices. The results suggest that changes in land use in the 1970s have affected runoff acidity. During that period, there was a change in diatom communities and sediment geochemistry, indicating that land use in the catchment area, most likely peatland drainage, had probably changed suspended sediment fluxes and pH conditions. The results also showed that changes in pH levels probably did not originate from ASS or black schist horizons, but rather mainly from humic substances leached from the catchment area. However, ASS and black schist deposits may have had an influence on pH levels in lower parts of the Sanginjoki river during dry/wet periods. Thus, the findings suggest that future changes in land use and land management are likely to cause increased acidity in the Sanginjoki catchment. Therefore actual or potential acidification of river water should be included in risk assessments and future land use practices, and should be avoided by not changing natural humic-rich ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aacid sulfate soils 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aaquatic environment 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3ageochemistry 3ahumic substances 3alakes 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3apH 3apeatlands 3aponds 3arisk assessment 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aFinland 0aSediment 0aGeochemistry 0aDiatom 0aAcidity 0aLand use 0aCatchment1 aMarttila, Hannu1 aSaukkoriipi, Jaakko1 aMartinmäki, Kati1 aTammela, Simo1 aTertsunen, Jermi1 aHeikkinen, Kaisa1 aTuohino, Jukka1 aIhme, Raimo1 aKløve, B.q(Bjørn),0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Mar., v. 64 p.367-376dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011000166300001600276520168900292592002801981650001102009650002302020650002402043650001402067650003102081650001902112650002002131650001502151650001102166650001602177650001802193700002302211700002402234700002702258700001902285773011802304856008202422852000902504655001202513IND60563090120221121095521.0170212e20170126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056309012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b068822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantha, Sriteja10aElectrostatic Interactions Govern “Odd/Even” Effects in Water-Induced Gemini Surfactant Self-Assembly  ap. 565-576.  aGemini surfactants comprise two single-tailed surfactants connected by a linker at or near the hydrophilic headgroup. They display a variety of water-concentration-dependent lyotropic liquid crystal morphologies that are sensitive to surfactant molecular structure and the nature of the headgroups and counterions. Recently, an interesting dependence of the aqueous-phase behavior on the length of the linker has been discovered; odd-numbered linker length surfactants exhibit characteristically different phase diagrams than even-numbered linker surfactants. In this work, we investigate this “odd/even effect” using computer simulations, focusing on experimentally studied gemini dicarboxylates with Na⁺ counterions, seven nonterminal carbon atoms in the tails, and either three, four, five, or six carbon atoms in the linker (denoted Na-73, Na-74, Na-75, and Na-76, respectively). We find that the relative electrostatic repulsion between headgroups in the different morphologies is correlated with the qualitative features of the experimental phase diagrams, predicting destabilization of hexagonal phases as the cylinders pack close together at low water content. Significant differences in the relative headgroup orientations of Na-74 and Na-76 compared to those of Na-73 and Na-75 surfactants lead to differences in linker–linker packing and long-range headgroup–headgroup electrostatic repulsion, which affects the delicate electrostatic balance between the hexagonal and gyroid phases. Much of the fundamental insight presented in this work is enabled by the ability to computationally construct and analyze metastable phases that are not observable in experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical structure 3acomputer simulation 3acylinders 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquid crystals 3aprediction 3asodium 3asurfactants 3awater content1 aMcDaniel, Jesse G.1 aPerroni, Dominic V.1 aMahanthappa, Mahesh K.1 aYethiraj, Arun0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 26, v. 121, no. 3 p.565-576dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b068823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007100166300001800237520146800255592002801723596008201751596003501833650001301868650001901881650001501900650001001915650002201925650002001947650001501967650001701982650002501999650001802024650001402042650001302056700001802069700001502087700001802102700001502120773012002135856008502255852000902340655001202349IND60624856520221119221927.0181206e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062485652DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Feng10aLarge-scale 16S gene assembly using metagenomics shotgun sequences  ap. 1447-1456.  aMotivation: Combining a 16S rRNA (16S) gene database with metagenomic shotgun sequences promises unbiased identification of known and novel microbes. Results: To achieve this, we herein report reference-based ribosome assembly (RAMBL), a computational pipeline, which integrates taxonomic tree search and Dirichlet process clustering to reconstruct full-length 16S gene sequences from metagenomic sequencing data with high accuracy. By benchmarking against the synthetic and real shotgun sequences, we demonstrated that full-length 16S gene assemblies of RAMBL were a good proxy for known and putative microbes, including Candidate Phyla Radiation. We found that 30–40% of bacteria genera in the terrestrial and intestinal biomes have no closely related genome sequences. We also observed that RAMBL was able to generate a more accurate determination of environmental microbial diversity and yield better disease classification, suggesting that full-length 16S gene assemblies are a powerful alternative to marker gene set and 16S short reads. RAMBL first realizes the access to full-length 16S gene sequences in the near-terabase-scale metagenomic shotgun sequences, which markedly improve metagenomic data analysis and interpretation.

In contrast to submerged soils, desiccation of lake sediments happens only rarely. However, some predictions suggest that extreme events of drying will become more common in the Amazon region, and this will promote an increase in sediments drying and exposure. We asked whether and how such methanogenic communities can withstand desiccation stress. Therefore, we determined the rates and pathways of CH₄ production (analysis of CH₄ and δ¹³C of CH₄, CO₂ and acetate), the copy numbers of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes and mcrA genes (quantitative PCR), and the community composition of Archaea and Bacteria (T‐RFLP and pyrosequencing) in oxbow lake sediments of rivers in the Brazilian Amazon region. The rivers were of white water, black water and clear water type. The measurements were done with sediment in fresh state and after drying and rewetting. After desiccation and rewetting the composition of both, the archaeal and bacterial community changed. Since lake sediments from white water rivers exhibited only negligible methanogenic activity, probably because of relatively high iron and low organic matter content, they were not further analysed. The other sediments produced CH₄, with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis usually accounting for > 50% of total activity. After desiccation and rewetting, archaeal and bacterial gene copy numbers decreased. The bacterial community showed a remarkable increase of Clostridiales from about 10% to > 30% of all Bacteria, partially caused by proliferation of specific taxa as the numbers of OTU shared with fresh sediment decreased from about 9% to 3%. Among the Archaea, desiccation specifically enhanced the relative abundance of either Methanocellales (black water) and/or Methanosarcinaceae (clear water). Despite the changes in gene copy numbers and composition of the microbial community, rates of CH₄ production even increased after desiccation‐rewetting, demonstrating that the function of the methanogenic microbial community had not been impaired. This result indicates that the increase in extreme events of drying may increase methane production in flooded sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridiales 3aMethanocellales 3aMethanosarcinaceae 3aacetates 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3acarbon dioxide 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3airon 3alakes 3amethane 3amethane production 3aorganic matter 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arivers 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 2aDehydration 2aEuryarchaeotaxgenetics 2aGene Dosage 2aGenes, Archaeal 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aGram-Positive Endospore-Forming Rodsxgenetics 2aLakesxmicrobiology 2aMethanexbiosynthesis 2aMicrobiotaxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStress, Physiological 3aAmazonia 0aBrazil1 aJi, Yang1 aNoll, Matthias1 aKlose, Melanie1 aClaus, Peter1 aEnrich‐Prast, Alex0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2014 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.1682-1694dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.12267  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010400171520056000275592002800835650001700863650002800880650001400908650003600922650001700958650001700975650001100992650001901003650002301022650002201045653003101067653002001098653002401118653002301142700001801165700001801183700001801201700001701219700001601236700001401252700001301266700005401279700001701333773009801350856008801448852000901536655001201545IND60773031720221122031529.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077303172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1131872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Chunyu10aAbietane diterpenes from the twigs and leaves of Cephalotaxus oliveri Mast. with antitumor activity  aTwenty one abietane diterpenes were isolated from Cephalotaxus oliveri Mast.

The four criteria that were used in this study to construct a fishway at low-head submerged weirs located in the Han River of Korea are established based on previous studies. The criteria include, the farthest point toward upstream, the vicinity of the thalweg, the vicinity of the primary velocity, and a point of less erosion and deposition. Among these, the third and fourth criteria are revealed by means of flow and sediment transport analysis. In particular, the entrance and exit of a fishway have often been closed due to the action of erosion and deposition resulting from extreme flood events that occur in the monsoon season of Korea. Numerical models of two-dimensional flow and sediment transport are used to reveal the structure of the flow field and characteristics of erosion and deposition. The propriety of location of the fishway is verified based on the four criteria using the numerical simulation at the Gapyeng Stream, which has many fishways. The efficiency of the fishway is evaluated indirectly by monitoring the fish. The criteria are also used to locate the best position of a fishway at a weir located in the Wangsuk Stream, which is a tributary of the Han River and does not have any fishway.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3afish 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3araceways 3arivers 3asediment transport 3astreams 3aweirs 3aKorean Peninsula 0aFishway 0aLow-head weir 0aNumerical simulation 0aFlow field 0aSediment transport1 aKim, Young Do0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Mar., v. 64 p.222-230dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245018200177300001400359520128300373592002801656650003201684650001101716650001401727650002801741650002501769650001301794650001801807650001101825650001401836650001701850650001101867650001101878650001601889650001001905650001501915650001601930650001501946650004401961650002402005650000902029650002902038650001002067653002302077653001902100653001802119653001102137653000802148653001102156653001702167653000802184653000702192653000902199653000902208653001102217653000702228653000902235700002002244700002202264700002902286773009002315856008202405852000902487655001202496IND60704612220221120043356.0200809e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070461222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nfs.2020.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontoya-Arroyo, Alexander10aOral administration of Costa Rican guava (Psidium friedrichsthalianum) juice induces changes in urinary excretion of energy-related compounds in Wistar rats determined by 1H NMR  ap. 48-57.  aPsidium friedrichsthalianum fruits have in vitro antioxidant activity and their intake has been suggested to have potential health benefits; however, there is still no evidence on the potential in vivo effect of their consumption.We aim to study the effect of the oral administration of a P. friedrichsthalianum juice on the urinary metabolome of adult male Wistar rats.Acute and short-term interventions were carried out and urine sample metabolites were analyzed in a 600 MHz NMR instrument with a NOESY-presat sequence.and post-treatment effects were identified by comparison against control conditions.Acute administration caused a decrease in the excretion of citrate and allantoin in the 0 to 6 h period and citrate and α-ketoglutarate in the 6 to 12 h period. Lactate and Krebs cycle intermediates showed reduced excretion in the 12 to 24 h period. Short-term administration (for 7 days) decreased the excretion of Krebs cycle intermediates together with lactate and allantoin. The effect was stronger after short-term administration suggesting a dose-dependent effect.P. friedrichsthalianum juice caused a change in rat excretion of energy metabolites, probably associated with an increase in aerobic metabolism, suggesting in vivo modulation of the redox balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsidium friedrichsthalianum 3aadults 3aallantoin 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aantioxidant activity 3acitrates 3adose response 3aenergy 3aexcretion 3afruit juices 3afruits 3aguavas 3alactic acid 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoral administration 3arats 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aurine 0aUrine metabolomics 0aPhytochemicals 0aRedox balance 0a1H NMR 0aNMR 0a1H NMR 0aNOESY-presat 0aRPM 0aBW 0aHMBC 0aHSQC 0aDqCOSY 0aTE 0aORAC1 aDíaz, Cecilia,1 aVaillant, Fabrice1 aTamayo-Castillo, Giselle0 tNFS journal.g2020 Aug., v. 20 p.48-57dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23304x2352-36467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nfs.2020.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010900169520173000278592002802008650000802036650002402044650001502068650002102083650001502104650001902119650001302138650001102151650002502162650002202187653001702209653003302226653002502259653002502284700001302309700001602322700002002338700005302358700005302411773009802464856008702562852000902649655001202658IND60672202720221116164557.0200117e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067220272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1139592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zirong12aA comprehensive proton exchange membrane fuel cell system model integrating various auxiliary subsystems  aA comprehensive proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system model is developed, including a pseudo two-dimensional transient multiphase stack model, a one-dimensional transient multiphase membrane humidifier model, a one-dimensional electrochemical hydrogen pump model, an air compressor model with proportion-integral-derivative control and a ribbon-tubular fin radiator model. All sub-models have been rigorously validated against experimental data to guarantee the system model accuracy. The effects of stack operating temperature, gas flow pattern and humidifier structural design are investigated to cast insights into the interaction among stack and auxiliary subsystems. The results indicate that the stack is successfully maintained at required operating temperatures (60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C) with help of the radiator when the whole system starts from ambient temperature (25 °C). However, the stack is likely to suffer from membrane dehydration when operated at 70 °C, and the problem becomes more severe at 80 °C, causing significant performance deterioration. The water and temperature distribution inside the system are further demonstrated. The co-current flow pattern contributes to better water utilization of the whole system which may lead to higher output performances. But the counter-current flow pattern has positive effects on parameter distribution uniformity inside fuel cell, which is beneficial for the stack durability. As regards the membrane dehydration, it is found that optimizing membrane humidifier area does not fundamentally solve the problem. Increasing humidifier area contributes to higher water vapor transfer rate, however, it results in much slower humidification responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3ahumidification 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3awater utilization 0aPEMFC system 0aVarious auxiliary subsystems 0aMembrane dehydration 0aCounter-current flow1 aDu, Qing1 aJia, Zhiwei1 aYang, Chunguang1 aXuan, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6718-90181 aJiao, Kui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1296-13300 tApplied energy.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 256 p.113959-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1139593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245007400175520201900249592002802268650001702296650002202313650001802335650001002353650001202363650001502375650001302390650001202403650001102415650001802426650003102444650001202475650002202487650002402509650002102533653002802554653002102582653002302603653003202626653002302658700001502681700002102696700003002717773011502747856008202862852000902944655001202953IND60670269920221120222049.0200228e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067026992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2019.1784152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChintersingh, Kerri-Lee10aHeterogeneous reaction kinetics for oxidation and combustion of boron  aNon-isothermal thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was used to study the oxidation kinetics for 95% pure amorphous boron powder. Commercial boron powders were pre-treated with acetonitrile and water to reduce the thickness of their initial hydrated oxide layer and to achieve a narrower particle size distribution. The samples were oxidized at different heating rates in an oxygen-argon gas mixture. Boron particles comprising aggregates of finer primary particles were modeled as spheres with porous shells and solid cores. Experimental TG traces were split among particles of different sizes. The split was based on the measured particle size distribution and accounted for the fraction of the measured mass gain assigned to different powder particle size bins using the core-shell particle model. Further, the reactive shell was assumed to consist of densely packed spherical primary particles. The reaction kinetics was quantified to obtain both activation energy and pre-factor describing oxidation of the primary particles. The early stage of oxidation is well described with the activation energy of 148 ± 6 kJ/mol. The oxidation rate of boron particle of any size can be obtained considering the rate of oxidation of the primary particle and the introduced core-shell particle structure. The obtained oxidation model was extrapolated to the range of temperatures typical of boron combustion. A change in the particle morphology occurring when boron melts and the aggregates of primary particles coalesce into a single droplet was accounted for. Burn times predicted at different temperatures were close to those measured for boron particles burning in room air. Comparisons suggest that the particle surface temperature varies in the range of 3500–4500 K, approaching boron boiling point. It is concluded that the same heterogeneous kinetics governs both low-temperature oxidation of boron when the oxide film thickness is small and its full-fledged combustion occurring at much higher temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aactivation energy 3aboiling point 3aboron 3aburning 3acombustion 3adroplets 3amelting 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apowders 3areaction kinetics 3asurface temperature 3athermogravimetry 0aHeterogeneous reactions 0aThermal analysis 0aFractal aggregates 0aParticle surface morphology 0aReactive materials1 aSun, Yalun1 aSchoenitz, Mirko1 aDreizin, E.q(Edward L.),0 tThermochimica acta.g2019 Dec., v. 682 p.178415-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2019.1784153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245019500163300001800358500002000376520119200396592002801588650001201616650001201628650001801640650001501658650000901673650002601682650002201708650001601730650001401746650001301760650001101773650002701784650001301811650001801824650001501842700002301857700002201880700002401902773011501926856007802041852000902119655001202128IND60580554720221119160310.0170921e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058055472DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2017002872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProsen, Helena10aDetermination of seven drugs of abuse and their metabolites in surface and wastewater using solid‐phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography with high‐resolution mass spectrometry  ap. 3621-3631.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA method based on liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization high‐resolution mass spectrometry (Exactive Orbitrap) combined with solid‐phase extraction using a strong cationic exchange mixed‐mode sorbent has been developed for the determination of seven drugs of abuse, including two synthetic cathinones, as well as some of their metabolites in environmental water samples. The method provides low detection limits and a high confirmation power thanks to the diagnostic and two fragment ions monitored for each compound in high‐resolution mass spectrometry, providing six identification points for each analyte. The clean‐up step based on methanol in the extraction step adequately decreased the matrix effect, mainly for river and effluent water, and provided suitable process efficiency. Method detection and quantitation limits for environmental waters were at low nanogram per liter. The method was applied to analyze the samples of influent and effluent wastewater, as well as surface water. Codeine, methadone, and its metabolite were determined in all samples of wastewater and the metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, was found at the highest concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acocaine 3acodeine 3aillicit drugs 3aionization 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amethadone 3amethanol 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3asurface water 3awastewater1 aFontanals, Núria,1 aBorrull, Francesc1 aMarcé, Rosa Maria,0 tJournal of separation science.g2017 Sept., v. 40, no. 18 p.3621-3631dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2017002873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013700162300001300299520090100312592002801213650002301241650001901264650001401283650001501297650001301312650001101325650002301336650002201359650001301381650001901394650001101413650001601424651001401440700001901454700001901473773012201492856007501614852000901689655001201698IND60793380120221123011359.0220915s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079338012DNAL7 a10.1071/MF20344_CO2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinlayson, C.

These conditions will face further pressures owing to reduced flows and higher sea levels associated with climate change. Policy decisions to retain present target conditions could be reconsidered to improve habitat conditions for wetlands, native fish and waterbirds. Contrary to many views, this would be permissible under the Ramsar Convention and, by increasing the diversity of conditions, may assist managers to retain functional systems. This paper encourages a new conversation across the broader community to develop pathways to prepare for emerging pressures on the riverine ecosystems, and move into anthropogenic futures for the Lower Murray.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aclimate change 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3awater birds 3aAustralia1 aGell, Peter A.1 aConallin, John0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2021, v. 73, no. 10 p.1245-1245dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957320x1323-16507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF20344_CO3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245012200206300001800328506007600346520119900422592002801621596002401649596004701673596003701720506003701757650001901794650002501813650002201838650001601860650002401876650002901900650001001929650001101939650001501950650001901965700001401984700002001998700001902018700001502037773012002052856008502172852000902257655001202266IND60624856920221207094857.0181206e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062485692DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btx0222doi7 aPMC54234522pmcid7 a281084502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jing10aNetLand: quantitative modeling and visualization of Waddington’s epigenetic landscape using probabilistic potential  ap. 1583-1585.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSummary: Waddington’s epigenetic landscape is a powerful metaphor for cellular dynamics driven by gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Its quantitative modeling and visualization, however, remains a challenge, especially when there are more than two genes in the network. A software tool for Waddington’s landscape has not been available in the literature. We present NetLand, an open-source software tool for modeling and simulating the kinetic dynamics of GRNs, and visualizing the corresponding Waddington’s epigenetic landscape in three dimensions without restriction on the number of genes in a GRN. With an interactive and graphical user interface, NetLand can facilitate the knowledge discovery and experimental design in the study of cell fate regulation (e.g. stem cell differentiation and reprogramming).

On the one hand, the influence of heavy oil composition on the viscosity of heavy oil is discussed. The results show that the influence rate of composition on viscosity is Asphaltenes (0.11377) > resins (0.07566) > saturated hydrocarbon (−0.06027) > aromatics (−0.07536), and the influence range of composition on viscosity is Asphaltenes (3.5348%) > resins (2.828%) > saturated hydrocarbon (0.861%) > aromatics (0.167%). On the other hand, the structural changes of heavy oil before and after viscosity reduction were studied by elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on Yen's heavy oil colloid model, the hypothesis of the three-dimensional network gel structure model is put forward. The possible reason for forming the gel structure is that the system contains a large number of gel factors, which can spontaneously aggregate and assemble into ordered structures in the solvent. What's more, the hypothesis of heavy oil gel structure was verified by rheological experiments. Rheological tests showed that resins and Asphaltenes were packed together by hydrogen bonds and π-π bonds, forming a tight gel network structure. Saturates and aromatics were dispersed in heavy oil as solvents. The essence of heavy oil viscosity reduction is that the π-π bonds and hydrogen bonds are destroyed, disintegrating the heavy oil gel structure, which is transformed into a sol structure model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aasphaltenes 3aelectron microscopy 3agels 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoils 3asolvents 3aviscosity 0aViscosity reduction of heavy oil 0aGelling factor 0aRheological properties 0aThree-dimensional network gel structure 0aSol structure1 aDuan, Wenmeng1 aXu, Ke1 aZheng, Cunchuan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.130060-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245011800213500002200331500001500353506007600368520129000444592002801734506003701762650002301799650004301822650002201865650003501887650001801922650001101940650002001951650001101971650001201982650001201994650001702006653001802023653001702041653000802058653001002066653001102076700002102087700002302108700003602131700002302167700003102190773007602221856008602297852000902383655001202392IND60581536220221207123239.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058153622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.09.0082doi7 aPMC61122362pmcid7 a289180732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWooley, Dawn P.12aA directed evolution approach to select for novel Adeno-associated virus capsids on an HIV-1 producer T cell line  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA directed evolution approach was used to select for Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids that would exhibit more tropism toward an HIV-1 producer T cell line with the long-term goal of developing improved gene transfer vectors. A library of AAV variants was used to infect H9T cells previously infected or uninfected by HIV-1 followed by AAV amplification with wild-type adenovirus. Six rounds of biological selection were performed, including negative selection and diversification after round three. The H9T cells were successfully infected with all three wild-type viruses (AAV, adenovirus, and HIV-1). Four AAV cap mutants best representing the small number of variants emerging after six rounds of selection were chosen for further study. These mutant capsids were used to package an AAV vector and subsequently used to infect H9 cells that were previously infected or uninfected by HIV-1. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to measure cell-associated AAV genomes. Two of the four cap mutants showed a significant increase in the amount of cell-associated genomes as compared to wild-type AAV2. This study shows that directed evolution can be performed successfully to select for mutants with improved tropism for a T cell line in the presence of HIV-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adirected evolution 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aDependoparvovirus 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aT-lymphocytes 3acapsid 3agenetic vectors 3agenome 3aviruses 3amutants 3aAdenoviridae 0agene transfer 0aDependovirus 0aAAV 0aHIV-1 0aT cell1 aSharma, Priyanka1 aWeinstein, John R.1 aNarayan, Poornima Kotha Lakshmi1 aSchaffer, David V.1 aExcoffon, Katherine J.D.A.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300002000279520182900299592002802128650001302156650001102169650001102180650001102191650002102202650001402223650001702237650001202254650002202266650001802288650001502306650001402321650001102335650001302346700001702359700001602376700001802392700001702410773014502427856007402572852000902646655001202655IND60642621520221119095424.0190507e20170919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064262152DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05466a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Minhong10aPerovskite framework NH₄FeF₃/carbon composite nanosheets as a potential anode material for Li and Na ion storage  ap. 19280-19288.  aTransition metal fluorides (TMFs) have received increasing attention as promising electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their resource abundance, low-cost and high specific capacities. However, TMFs usually suffer from low electron conductivity and high Li/Na ion diffusion resistance, which lead to rapid capacity fading. In order to further improve their electrochemical performance, designs of carbon-based TMFs with crystal topologies favorable for Li/Na ion diffusion are greatly needed. Here, NH₄FeF₃/carbon nanosheet (NH₄FeF₃/CNS) composites were prepared via a facile co-pyrolysis of ferric acetylacetonate and NH₄F. NH₄FeF₃ has an open framework structure with a perovskite topology, in which FeF₆ octahedral monomers are connected with each other via F⁻ anions to form cavities, and NH₄⁺ cations reside inside the cavities. The interesting perovskite structure is favorable for Li/Na ion storage. When used as an anode for LIBs, the NH₄FeF₃/CNS exhibits a specific capacity of 1000 mA h g⁻¹ at 200 mA g⁻¹ after 300 cycles, which is much higher than those of other reported TMFs. When used as an anode for SIBs, the NH₄FeF₃/CNS also exhibits a high specific capacity of 504 mA h g⁻¹ as well as better rate-performance and cycling stability. The better electrochemical performance of NH₄FeF₃/CNS composites for both LIBs and SIBs should be ascribed to, on one hand, the fact that the perovskite framework structure of NH₄FeF₃ with NH₄⁺ fillers has kinetically favorable Li/Na ion channels so as to be helpful to alleviate volume expansion during the cycling process and, on the other hand, the fact that carbon nanosheets can act as a conductive network to improve the conductivity of NH₄FeF₃ nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanions 3aanodes 3acarbon 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorides 3aion channels 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3apyrolysis 3asodium 3atopology1 aLiu, Kunhong1 aNing, Jinyu1 aZhou, Jisheng1 aSong, Huaihe0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Sept. 19, v. 5, no. 36 p.19280-19288dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta05466a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245011800202300001600320506007600336520036900412592002800781506003700809650001300846650002300859650001500882650001000897650003100907650001300938650001800951650002200969700002100991700001901012700002101031700002101052773013101073856007401204852000901278655001201287IND60638597820221207123742.0190430e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063859782DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc06565h2doi7 aPMC46794762pmcid7 a265055582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVistain, Luke F.10aTargeted delivery of gold nanoparticle contrast agents for reporting gene detection by magnetic resonance imaging  ap. 160-163.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDetection of protein expression by MRI requires a high payload of Gd(iii) per protein binding event.

The technologies have been broadly developed and are at the edge of a mass roll-out. The barriers that Power-to-Gas faces are no longer technical, but are, foremost, regulatory, and economic. This study focuses on a Power-to-Gas pathway, where electricity is first converted in a water electrolyzer into hydrogen, which is then synthetized with carbon dioxide to produce synthetic natural gas. A key aspect of this pathway is that an intermittent electricity supply could be used, which could reduce the amount of electricity curtailment from renewable energy generation. Interim storages would then be necessary to decouple the synthesized part from hydrogen production, to enable (I) longer continuous operation cycles for the methanation reactor, and (II) increased annual full-load hours, leading to an overall reduction in gas production costs. This work optimizes a Power-to-Gas plant configuration with respect to the cost benefits using a Monte Carlo-based simulation tool. The results indicate potential cost reductions of up to 17% in synthetic natural gas production by implementing well-balanced components and interim storages. This study also evaluates three different power sources which differ greatly in their optimal system configuration. Results from time-resolved simulations and sensitivity analyses for different plant designs and electricity sources are discussed with respect to technical and economic implications, so as to facilitate a plant design process for decision makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aelectricity 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane production 3anatural gas 3aproduction costs 3arenewable electricity 3arenewable energy sources 0aPower-to-Gas 0aHydrogen interim storage 0aDynamic operation 0aOptimization 0aCost reduction 0aOperation strategy 0aAEL 0aBoP 0aCAPEX 0aCH4 0aCO2 0aH2 0aPEM 0aPtG 0aPV 0aRE 0aRES 0aSCR 0aSNG 0aSOEL1 aRuoss, Fabian1 aKarjunen, Hannu1 aSchaffert, Johannes1 aTynjälä, Tero0 tApplied energy.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 257 p.113967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1139673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245016600171300001800337500001500355520141300370592002801783650001401811650001101825650001001836650001301846650001601859650001601875650002601891650001601917650002101933650001601954650002301970650001301993650000902006650001302015650001602028650001702044650001102061650001402072650001202086653001902098653001502117700002202132700002202154700001802176700002202194700001702216700001702233700001702250773010702267856005502374852000902429655001202438IND4465371820221121042308.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446537182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02783.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakaoka, Osamu10aEffect of rotifer enrichment with herbal extracts on growth and resistance of red sea bream, Pagrus major (Temminck & Schlegel) larvae against Vibrio anguillarum  ap. 1824-1829.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of the dietary medicinal herbs Massa medicata, Crataegi fructus (Cf), Artemisia capillaries, Cnidium officinale and their mixture (HM), on growth and resistance against Vibrio anguillarum were examined using larval red sea bream, Pagrus major. The methanol extracts of Cf and HM inhibited the proliferation of seven infectious bacterial strains including the genera Aeromonas, Edwasiella, Photobavterium, Pseudomonas and Vibrio. Rotifers enriched with emulsified bonito oil containing extracts of Cf and HM lowered the bacterial counts in their body on TCBS medium for the genus Vibrio in comparison with rotifers enriched by emulsified bonito oil alone. Although statistically not significant, larvae fed rotifer fortified with Cf from 3 to 20 days after hatching showed the best growth and final body weight followed by those given rotifer with HM and control enrichment. However, final body length of larvae fed rotifer with Cf was significantly larger than larvae fed on rotifers enriched with other herb extracts. After a challenge test with V. anguillarum, survival of larvae fed rotifer with Cf and HM was significantly higher than for the control treatment. These results revealed that Cf and HM in rotifer is useful to promote growth and resistance against V. anguillarum in red sea bream larvae, providing a new technology for mass production of disease‐resistant fry and fingerlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3abonito 3aherbs 3amethanol 3abody weight 3aPseudomonas 3aproduction technology 3afingerlings 3amedicinal plants 3aplate count 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aRotifera 3aoils 3ahatching 3abody length 3aPagrus major 3alarvae 3aAeromonas 3aCnidium 0anew technology 0atechnology1 aJi, Seung‐Cheol1 aIshimaru, Katsuya1 aLee, Si‐Woo1 aJeong, Gwan‐Sik1 aIto, Junichi1 aBiswas, Amal1 aTakii, Kenji0 tAquaculture research.g2011 Nov., v. 42, no. 12 p.1824-1829dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02783.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006300138245010600201300001800307500001900325500002000344520175300364592002802117596006702145650002002212650001902232650002802251650001502279650004302294650002402337650001902361650001302380650001902393650002402412650001602436650001102452650001402463650001202477700005902489773013602548856007202684852000902756655001202765IND60714454420221120111620.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071445442DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.36652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNallaperuma, Bhagya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2595-701214aThe long‐term legacy of riparian vegetation in a hydrogeomorphologically remodelled fluvial setting  ap. 1690-1700.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe typical Japanese river maintains a vegetation‐suppressive effect on riparian habitats. During recent decades, most Japanese rivers have encountered extensive human‐induced alterations, and over time, the rivers have been transformed from unvegetated to vegetated. The lower Tedori River, which is a representative case of this phenomenon, is located in a region that exhibits signs of global climate change. According to quantitative analyses of sediment, the river corridor has historically reached an equilibrium since the prohibition of heavy sediment extraction activities, and the water discharge is stable because of dams. The contemporaneous vegetation encroachment was observed in a historical imagery survey and the vegetation dynamics of the river reach for the past 18 years were analysed to identify forcing hydro‐climatic variables. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was adopted for the surveillance of vegetation dynamics, and multiple regression analysis was employed to evaluate its relationship with predictor variables. River water level was the strongest determinant of NDVI, with both Pearson correlation and standardized β coefficients of −0.405, while air temperature was next, with values of 0.363 and 0.288, respectively. These findings were supported by the spatial distribution of temporally advancing vegetation patches determined using the aerial imagery and pixel value maxima of NDVI bands. In addition, the development of vegetation patches will presumably give rise to more pro‐vegetation surroundings in the riparian zone through reciprocal linkages with hydrogeomorphic processes. These objective predictions may help inform the proactive planning for river and coastal management.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acoastal zone management 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3ariparian vegetation 3ariver water 3arivers 3asediments 3asurveys1 aAsaeda, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7349-41740 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Oct., v. 36, no. 8 p.1690-1700dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.36653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011400210500001900324500002200343520152400365592002801889650001901917650001001936650001201946650001501958650002601973650001101999650000702010650001302017650001102030650001002041650001502051650002502066650001002091651001202101651001302113653001702126653000802143653000802151653001802159653001802177700002302195700001802218700001802236700002502254700001902279773008202298856008502380852000902465655001202474IND60670270520221122030433.0191002e20190919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067027052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.1151012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Barbara J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7018-694210aEvaluation of conceptual model and predictors of faecal sludge dewatering performance in Senegal and Tanzania  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPre-press version  aUnpredictable dewatering performance is a barrier to the effective management and treatment of faecal sludge. While mechanisms of dewatering in sludges from wastewater treatment are well understood, it is not clear how dewatering of faecal sludge fits into the framework of existing knowledge. We evaluate physical-chemical parameters, including EPS and cations, and demographic (source), environmental (microbial community), and technical factors (residence time) as possible predictors of dewatering performance in faecal sludge, and make comparisons to the existing conceptual model for wastewater sludge. Faecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater than sludge from other sources, and had turbid supernatant after settling. Slow dewatering and turbid supernatant corresponded to high EPS and monovalent cation concentrations, conductivity, and pH, but cake solids after dewatering was not correlated with EPS or other factors. Faecal sludges with higher EPS appeared less stabilised than those with lower EPS, potentially a result of inhibition of biological degradation due to high urine concentrations. However, distinct microbial community compositions were also observed in samples with higher and lower EPS concentrations. Higher EPS faecal sludge was comparable in dewatering behaviour and EPS content to anaerobically digested and primary wastewater sludges. However lower EPS faecal sludges had different dewatering behaviour than wastewater sludges and may be governed by different mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acakes 3acations 3adewatering 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3apH 3aresearch 3asludge 3aurine 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater 3aSenegal 3aTanzania 0aFecal sludge 0aEPS 0aCST 0aStabilization 0aPublic toilet1 aTraber, Jacqueline1 aGueye, Amadou1 aDiop, Bécaye1 aMorgenroth, Eberhard1 aStrande, Linda0 tWater research.g2019 Sept. 19, dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1151013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010700173300001600280520112100296592002801417650001501445650001501460650002801475650001201503650000701515650002601522650003301548650001801581650002901599650002301628650001601651700003301667773009501700856004801795852000901843655001201852IND50066457220221121020930.0130516e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006645722DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293130501652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansod, Babankumar S.13aAn application of PCA and fuzzy C-means to delineate management zones and variability analysis of soil  ap. 556-564.  aWithin-field variability is a well-known phenomenon and its study is at the centre of precision agriculture (PA). In this paper, site-specific spatial variability (SSSV) of apparent Electrical Conductivity (ECₐ) and crop yield apart from pH, moisture, temperature and di-electric constant information was analyzed to construct spatial distribution maps. Principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm were then performed to delineate management zones (MZs). Various performance indices such as Normalized Classification Entropy (NCE) and Fuzzy Performance Index (FPI) were calculated to determine the clustering performance. The geo-referenced sensor data was analyzed for within-field classification. Results revealed that the variables could be aggregated into MZs that characterize spatial variability in soil chemical properties and crop productivity. The resulting classified MZs showed favorable agreement between ECₐ and crop yield variability pattern. This enables reduction in number of soil analysis needed to create application maps for certain cultivation operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acrop yield 3aelectrical conductivity 3aentropy 3apH 3aprecision agriculture 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil analysis 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil heterogeneity 3atemperature1 aPāṇḍeya, Oma Prakāśa,0 tEurasian soil science.g2013 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.556-564dSpringer-Verlagx1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229313050165  aDNAL 7aarticle04279naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245015600165300001800321500001500339520268100354592002803035650002003063650002603083650001103109650000903120650001403129650001103143650002703154650003003181650001303211650001403224650001103238650001003249650003703259650001003296650001303306650002203319650002103341650001203362651001103374653006003385700001803445700001403463700001803477700001603495700001303511700001803524773010103542856008503643852000903728655001203737IND4469005920221118063431.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446900592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2011.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBugarel, M.10aGenetic diversity in monophasic (1,4,[5],12:i:- and 1,4,[5],12:-:1,2) and in non-motile (1,4,[5],12:-:-) variants of Salmonella enterica S. Typhimurium  ap. 1016-1024.  a2019-12-06  aMonophasic variants of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, lacking either the second phase H-antigen with the antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:i:- or lacking the first phase H-antigen with the antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:-:1,2, and a non-motile variant lacking both flagellar phases were phenotypically and genotypically characterised. The genetic diversity of a collection of 58 isolates of Salmonella enterica 1,4,[5],12:i:- (n=23), 1,4,[5],12:-:1,2 (n=17), 1,4,[5],12:-:- (n=18) mainly from swine, bovine and poultry sources using a novel multiplex real-time PCR to simultaneously target different classes of genes (i.e. 10 loci) was investigated in regards to antimicrobial resistance and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. The majority of the S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- strains were genotypically confirmed to be variant of serotype Typhimurium, except two mdh negative isolates. Five fljB positive S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- variants were detected and could be considered as “inconsistent” variant. Moreover, presence of the fliC and fljB amplicons in the phenotypically monophasic S. 1,4,[5],12:-:1,2 and non-motile isolates suggest that their expressions should be blocked by mutation or deletion in the promoter regions linked to the flagellar phase expression. Based on the combination of detection of the following markers: Salmonella Pathogenic Islands (SPI-2 to SPI-5), virulence plasmid (spvC), antimicrobial resistance markers (blaTEM and sul1), Salmonella Genomic island (SGI-1 left junction), the integrase from class 1 integron (intI1) and DT104 16S-23S spacer region, thirteen different genotypes were identified among the 58 isolates. All investigated isolates showed virulence potential as determined by the presence of four SPI markers, which was exhibited in the genotype A9 mainly encountered for S. 1,4,[5],12:-:1,2 isolates. In contrast, high-frequency of markers were encountered for S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- assigned to genotypes B7 gathering almost all 10 markers except SGI-1. Frequencies of SGI-1 markers typically detected in serotype Typhimurium strains differed strongly among the three variants ranging from 0% for fljB negative S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- to 58.8% for S. 1,4,[5],12:-:-. The three variants were clearly phenotypically and genotypically distinct and varied in their resistance-types as well as in their PFGE types and genotypes newly described in this study. This first study on the French collection from non human sources could suggest presence of the Spanish clone in France as well as, to a lesser extent, some “inconsistent” variants exhibiting the resistance-type AM S SSS TE previously described in different European countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenomic islands 3aantibiotic resistance 3ahumans 3aloci 3aserotypes 3acattle 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amutation 3avirulence 3aclones 3aswine 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3apromoter regions 3apoultry 3aFrance 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium1 aGranier, S.A.1 aBonin, E.1 aVignaud, M.L.1 aRoussel, S.1 aFach, P.1 aBrisabois, A.0 tFood research international.g2012 Mar., v. 45, no. 2 p.1016-1024dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002900186245008200215300002000297520057000317592002800887653003200915653002200947653001200969653002700981653002601008700002001034700002201054700002701076700002101103700002501124773019401149856007901343852000901422655001201431IND60517966620160519000000.0160406e20151013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051796662DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15143791122doi7 aPMC46116412pmcid7 a264208732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Elisabetta A.10aWrinkles and splay conspire to give positive disclinations negative curvature  ap. 12639-12644.  aSignificance Diblock copolymers, polymers made by covalently bonding two otherwise immiscible polymers together, are prized for their robust ability to self-assemble into highly ordered geometric structures.

Segments of all components interact with the surface via the hard wall potential whereas interactions between the segments are described by Lennard–Jones (12-6) potential. The structure of the bonded phase is investigated. The distribution of different solutes in the stationary phases is determined.

Such newly developed AuNPs/rGO/AC modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) provided rich active centers with efficient electrochemical reductive activity that led to promote the adsorption and diffusion of 4-NP molecules onto the active surface electrode, enabling better electrochemical detection of the target analyte. With the amperometric technique, the current modified electrode is capable to detect the 4-NP with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.36 µM at (S/N=3), a high sensitivity of 0.03436 μAµM⁻¹ in a wide linear dynamic range (LDR) of 18-592 µM, and a rapid response time <10 s. The present AuNPs/rGO/AC modified GCE exhibited excellent selectivity in the presence of various common interfering chemicals, good repeatability and reproducibility and sufficient storage stability. The current sensor electrode also exhibited satisfactory analytical recovery results of 4-NP from spiked real samples. The current developed AuNPs/rGO/AC nanocomposite can represent a promising active electrode material for efficient detection of various environmental pollutants by the electrochemical approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3apollutants 3asensors (equipment) 3astorage quality 0aAuNPs 0arGO 0aActivated carbon 0a4-Nitrophenole sensor 0aLinear sweep voltammetry 0aAmperometry1 aRashed, Md.

Despite the Ramsar Convention requirement to maintain the ecological character of wetlands listed as internationally important, there is little guidance for wetland managers to actually do this, let alone plan for and implement adaptation to climate change. This study developed a checklist for planning climate change adaptation and used it to consider adaptation options for the Muir&#x2013;Byenup System Ramsar site in Australia. Under climate change the site will be subject to future warming and drying, affecting hydrology, bird breeding and feeding, vegetation, peat and threatened species. Fire and wetland acidification are likely to increase. The study found that planning for climate change adaptation had not been widely undertaken for Ramsar sites and, where it had, managers mainly planned information gathering activities and &#x2018;no regrets' actions rather than innovative or transformative approaches. New management approaches and policy settings that encompass the dynamic nature of wetlands are needed because maintaining wetlands in their current state will be difficult under climate change. The development and sharing of targeted information and training for wetland managers and stakeholders could facilitate a better understanding and uptake of adaptation at wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abirds 3aclimate change 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3apeat 3aresearch 3arisk 3astakeholders 3athreatened species 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aAustralia 0aclimate change adaptation 0aecological character 0aRamsar Convention 0awetland management1 aFinlayson, C.

Substantial scientific effort has been devoted to understanding every part of this cycle. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to study some of the key processes involved in cellular respiration: O₂ permeation through alveolar monolayers and cellular membranes, its binding to hemoglobin during transport in the bloodstream, as well as its transport along optimal pathways toward its reduction sites in proteins. Moreover, MD simulations can help interpret the results of several imaging techniques in which O₂ is used because of its paramagnetic nature. However, despite the widespread use of computational models for the O₂ molecule, their performances have never been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we assess the performances of 14 different models of O₂ available in the literature by calculating four thermodynamic properties: density, heat of vaporization, free energy of hydration, and free energy of solvation in hexadecane. For each property, reliable experimental data are available. Most models perform reasonably well in predicting the correct trends, but they fail to reproduce the experimental data quantitatively. We then develop new models for O₂, with and without a quadrupole moment, and compare their behavior with the behavior of previously published models. The new models show significant improvement in terms of density, heat of vaporization, and free energy of hydration. However, quantitative agreement with water–oil partitioning is not reached due to discrepancies between the calculated and measured free energies of solvation in hexadecane. We suggest that classical pairwise-additive models may be inadequate to properly describe the thermodynamics of solvation of apolar species, such as O₂, in apolar solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3ablood flow 3acell membranes 3acell respiration 3aheat 3ahemoglobin 3ahexadecane 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3asolvents 3avolatilization1 aVattulainen, I.q(Ilpo),1 aMonticelli, Luca0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 26, v. 121, no. 3 p.518-528dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b111833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011800173300001600291520106900307592002801376650001501404650002101419650001401440650001901454650002001473650001501493650002401508650002501532650001201557653001401569653002501583653003201608653003101640653002301671653002501694700001801719700002401737700002301761700002601784700002901810773010501839856008601944852000902030655001202039IND60592953220221120100340.0200427e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059295322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZubaidi, Salah L.12aA Novel approach for predicting monthly water demand by combining singular spectrum analysis with neural networks  ap. 136-145.  aValid and dependable water demand prediction is a major element of the effective and sustainable expansion of municipal water infrastructures. This study provides a novel approach to quantifying water demand through the assessment of climatic factors, using a combination of a pretreatment signal technique, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation algorithm and an artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique was adopted to decompose and reconstruct water consumption in relation to six weather variables, to create a seasonal and stochastic time series. The results revealed that SSA is a powerful technique, capable of decomposing the original time series into many independent components including trend, oscillatory behaviours and noise. In addition, the PSO-ANN algorithm was shown to be a reliable prediction model, outperforming the hybrid Backtracking Search Algorithm BSA-ANN in terms of fitness function (RMSE). The findings of this study also support the view that water demand is driven by climatological variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimatic factors 3ahydrology 3ainfrastructure 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3apublic water supply 3atime series analysis 3aweather 0aMelbourne 0aNeural network model 0aParticle swarm optimization 0aSingular spectrum analysis 0aUrban water demand 0aWater sustainability1 aDooley, Jayne1 aAlkhaddar, Rafid M.1 aAbdellatif, Mawada1 aAl-Bugharbee, Hussein1 aOrtega-Martorell, Sandra0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 June, v. 561 p.136-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013500172300001600307500001400323520194200337592002802279650003002307650001602337650002002353650001402373650001802387650002902405650002302434650001902457650001402476650001102490650001302501650001402514650001102528650001402539650001402553650002502567650001302592650001502605650001702620650001402637650003102651650001102682653003902693653001702732653001502749653001702764653002002781700005602801700002202857700001702879700001902896700002102915773010402936856008503040852000903125655001203134IND60704613420221121051929.0200831e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070461342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasabuchi, Yusuke12aA survey on total parenteral nutrition in 55,000 hospitalized patients: Retrospective cohort study using a medical claims database  ap. 198-205.  aNAL-light  aIdentifying the prevalence of underfed patients and risk factors for underfeeding in patients with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is essential to improve the management of patients receiving TPN. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors for underfeeding using a medical claims database.In this retrospective cohort study using a medical claims database, we analyzed patient characteristics, timing and duration of nutrition prescription, daily dose of nutrients, and types of parenteral nutrition products administered after central venous catheter (CVC) insertion in hospitalized Japanese patients between 2009 and 2018. The mean prescriptions of energy <20 kcal/kg/day, amino acids <1.0 g/kg/day, and fat <2.5 g/day received by patients between the 4th and 10th day after CVC insertion were regarded as underfeeding. To study the association between nutritional adequacy and body mass index (BMI) with TPN, the proportions of patients with a prescription of energy ≥20 kcal/kg/day or amino acids ≥1.0 g/kg/day were calculated and categorized according to BMI, and the Cochran-Armitage trend test was performed.Of 54,687 patients included in the study, 70.3% were aged ≥70 years, and 31.3% had a BMI <18.5. The mean prescription of energy was insufficient in 49.9% of patients, and 82.9% were insufficiently prescribed with amino acids. In addition, 44.4% of the patients were never prescribed a single dose of fat emulsion during their hospital stay. On the 10th day after CVC insertion, the majority of patients used commercial 2-in-1 compounds containing carbohydrates and amino acids. A higher BMI was associated with underfeeding of energy and amino acids (both p < 0.001).It is important to adjust the nutrition dose according to the patient's body size and weight, and it is necessary to supplement inadequate nutrients by single-nutrition solutions in addition to compounded solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aamino acids 3abody mass index 3abody size 3acarbohydrates 3acentral venous catheters 3aclinical nutrition 3acohort studies 3adatabases 3adosage 3aduration 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3ahospitals 3anutrients 3anutritional adequacy 3apatients 3aprevalence 3arisk factors 3asolutions 3atotal parenteral nutrition 3aweight 0aPrescription practice of nutrients 0aUnderfeeding 0aAmino acid 0aFat emulsion 0aReal-world data1 aOno, Sachiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4378-25781 aKamoshita, Satoru1 aTsuda, Tomoe1 aMurano, Haruka1 aKuroda, Akiyoshi0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2020 Oct., v. 39 p.198-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245013400215520220200349592002802551650001902579650002802598650001702626650001802643650001402661650000902675650000902684651001602693653004802709700002602757700002002783700002002803700001702823700006002840773011002900856008803010852000903098655001203107IND60747440920221119215415.0211219e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074744092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1058352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearson, Stuart G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3986-446910aTracking fluorescent and ferrimagnetic sediment tracers on an energetic ebb-tidal delta to monitor grain size-selective dispersal  aSediment tracer studies use uniquely identifiable particles to track the pathways and fate of individual sand or silt grains in marine environments. These techniques are best applied to assess connectivity between potential sediment sources and sinks, such as between a sand nourishment and an ecologically sensitive area. Significant challenges exist when applying sediment tracing techniques to further understanding of systems with complicated hydrodynamic, sediment, and morphological regimes. Ebb-tidal deltas are highly dynamic coastal environments shaped by the complex interplay of waves and tides, but have been under-explored. In this study, we use dual signature (fluorescent and ferrimagnetic) sediment tracers to simulate the dispersal of dredged sediment placed as a sand nourishment on an energetic ebb-tidal delta (at Ameland Inlet, the Netherlands). After deployment, sediment dispersal and grain size sorting behaviour were monitored via the collection of seabed grab samples and magnetic sampling of sediment transported in suspension. The tracer content within collected samples were put in context with hydrodynamic conditions observed during the study period. Here we show that the use of such dual signature tracers, in addition to novel tracer recovery and analysis techniques, enables the dispersal of sediment to be monitored even in such complex settings and energetic conditions as an ebb-tidal delta. Our observations show that tracers transported in suspension are significantly finer than tracers that accumulated in the seabed. These suggest that preferential transport as a function of grain size is a key process in shaping the morphology of ebb-tidal deltas and thus governing the dispersal of sand nourishments there. The findings of this study and the approach used here provide valuable tools for assessing the baseline conditions of complex coastal environments today, and for planning the interventions which may be necessary in future responses to climate change. Lessons learned from the application of sediment tracers in this study are provided to assist future researchers and practitioners in applying this technique in dynamic coastal environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoastal zone management 3afluorescence 3ahydrodynamics 3amagnetism 3asand 3asilt 3aNetherlands 0aSediment tracers nourishment sand transport1 avan Prooijen, Bram C.1 aPoleykett, Jack1 aWright, Matthew1 aBlack, Kevin1 aWang, Zheng Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8787-45300 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 212 p.105835-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1058353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245005500177300001600232520115600248592002801404650001101432650002301443650001101466650001901477650002201496650002901518650001001547650001301557650002201570650004101592650002401633650001501657650001301672650001201685650001601697650001001713650002501723650001101748650002501759650001201784650001101796650001201807650001101819650001001830650002301840650000901863650001401872650001401886650002001900650002601920650002601946650000901972650001401981650001101995650001102006650001002017650001502027650000902042651001102051653001902062653001802081653002002099653001702119700001902136700002902155700002202184700002302206773011802229856008402347852000902431655001202440IND60121887320221117233532.0150325e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012188732DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2011.6079072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrero-Cervantes, M.10aMineral content in range forages from north Mexico  ap. 102-107.  aNative forages such as trees Quercus eduardii and Quercus grisea; shrubs such as Atriplex canescens, Acacia constricta, Acacia shaffneri, Cassia wislizeni, Celtis pallida, Condalia lycioides, Cordia parvifolia, Flourencia cernua, Larrea tridentata, Mimosa biuncifera and Prosopis leavigata; forbs such as Coldenia greggii, Dalea bicolor, Jatropha dioica and Parthenium incanum; cacti such as Opuntia imbricata, Opuntia leptocaulis and Opuntia leucotricha; red and white fruits from O. leucotricha; fruits from O. leptocaulis, O. imbricata and A. canescens; pods from P. leavigata; pods from A. shaffneri and flowers from Yucca spp. were collected to estimate and compare the mineral content.

The Ca, Mg, K, Fe and Mn content of most plants were in sufficient amounts to satisfy adult range requirements; however, P, Na, Cu and Zn resulted with marginal deficiencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aAtriplex canescens 3aCassia 3aCeltis pallida 3aCordia parvifolia 3aCylindropuntia imbricata 3aDalea 3aJatropha 3aLarrea tridentata 3aMimosa aculeaticarpa var. biuncifera 3aOpuntia leucotricha 3aParthenium 3aProsopis 3aQuercus 3aSpermolepis 3aYucca 3aZiziphus obtusifolia 3aadults 3acacti and succulents 3acalcium 3acopper 3aflowers 3aforage 3aforbs 3aindigenous species 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient requirements 3apods 3apotassium 3ashrubs 3asodium 3atrees 3awet season 3azinc 3aMexico 0anative forages 0adigestibility 0amineral content 0anorth Mexico1 aRamírez, R.G.1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, H.1 aCerrillo-Soto, A.1 aJuárez-Réyes, A.0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2012 June 1, v. 40, no. 2 p.102-107dTaylor & Francis Groupx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2011.6079073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003400148245010700182300001400289520120900303592002801512650001701540650001601557650001101573650001601584650002801600650001801628650001401646650000901660650001601669651001501685653003101700653003301731653002601764653000901790653002601799700002301825700002301848700002401871700001501895700002101910773014301931856008302074852000902157655001202166IND60532630020221122225636.0190415e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053263002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2015.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIftekharuddaula, Khandakar Md10aDevelopment of New Submergence Tolerant Rice Variety for Bangladesh Using Marker-Assisted Backcrossing  ap. 16-26.  aSubmergence tolerant high yielding rice variety was developed using BR11 as a recipient parent applying foreground, phenotypic and background selection approaches. Recombinant selection was found essential to minimize linkage drag by BC2F2 generation. Without recombinant selection, the introgression size in the backcross recombinant lines (BRLs) was approximately 15 Mb on the carrier chromosome. The BRLs were found submergence tolerance compared to the check varieties under complete submergence for two weeks at Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, and produced higher yield compared to the isogenic Sub1-line under controlled submerged condition. The BRL IR85260-66-654-Gaz2 was released as BRRI dhan52 in 2010, which was the first high yielding submergence tolerant variety in Bangladesh. BRRI dhan52 produced grain yield ranging from 4.2 to 5.2 t/hm2 under different flash flood prone areas of Bangladesh in three consecutive seasons. The study demonstrated the efficiency of recombinant selection and better adaptability of the newly released submergence tolerant high yielding variety in flash flood prone different areas of the country with respect to submergence tolerance and yield potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackcrossing 3achromosomes 3afloods 3agrain yield 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aintrogression 3aphenotype 3arice 3asubmergence 3aBangladesh 0abackcross recombinant line 0amarker-assisted backcrossing 0arecombinant selection 0arice 0asubmergence tolerance1 aAhmed, Helal Uddin1 aGhosal, Sharmistha1 aMoni, Zakiah Rahman1 aAmin, Al-,1 aAli, Md Shamsher0 tRice science.g2015 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.16-26dElsevier B.V.aChina National Rice Research InstitutewJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsci.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016700168520158500335592002801920650001301948650002001961650002501981650001602006650003302022650001102055650000902066650001302075650002102088653002302109653002902132653004102161653001502202653001702217700001802234700002702252700002302279700002002302700004302322773009402365856008202459852000902541655001202550IND60726716420221119230958.0210820e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072671642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1068542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaheem, Muhammad10aBig Data acquired by Internet of Things-enabled industrial multichannel wireless sensors networks for active monitoring and control in the smart grid Industry 4.0  aSmart Grid Industry 4.0 (SGI4.0) defines a new paradigm to provide high-quality electricity at a low cost by reacting quickly and effectively to changing energy demands in the highly volatile global markets. However, in SGI4.0, the reliable and efficient gathering and transmission of the observed information from the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Cyber-physical systems, such as sensors located in remote places to the control center is the biggest challenge for the Industrial Multichannel Wireless Sensors Networks (IMWSNs). This is due to the harsh nature of the smart grid environment that causes high noise, signal fading, multipath effects, heat, and electromagnetic interference, which reduces the transmission quality and trigger errors in the IMWSNs. Thus, an efficient monitoring and real-time control of unexpected changes in the power generation and distribution processes is essential to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) requirements in the smart grid. In this context, this paper describes the dataset contains measurements acquired by the IMWSNs during events monitoring and control in the smart grid. This work provides an updated detail comparison of our proposed work, including channel detection, channel assignment, and packets forwarding algorithms, collectively called CARP [1] with existing G-RPL [2] and EQSHC [3] schemes in the smart grid. The experimental outcomes show that the dataset and is useful for the design, development, testing, and validation of algorithms for real-time events monitoring and control applications in the smart grid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adata collection 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectricity 3aelectromagnetic interference 3aenergy 3aheat 3aindustry 3apower generation 0aInternet of things 0aWireless sensor networks 0aMultichannel wireless sensor network 0aSmart grid 0aIndustry 4.01 aFizza, Ghulam1 aAshraf, Muhammad Waqar1 aButt, Rizwan Aslam1 aNgadi, Md.

In this study, we applied dendrochronological methods to the L. chinensis tree-ring series from Mt. Taibai and investigated the relationships between tree-ring widths and NDVI/climate factors using Pearson correlation analysis. On the basis of the remarkable positive correlations (r = 0.726, p < 0.01, n = 23) between local July normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) and tree-ring width indices, the regional 146-year annual maximum vegetation density was reconstructed using a regression model. The reconstructed NDVI series tracked the observed data well, as the trans-function accounted for 52.8% of observed NDVI variance during AD 1991–2013. After applying an 11-year moving average, five dense vegetation coverage periods and six sparse vegetation coverage periods were clearly presented. At a decadal scale, this reconstruction was reasonably and negatively correlated with a nearby historical-record-based dryness/wetness index (DWI), precisely verifying that local vegetation cover was principally controlled by hydrothermal variations. Spectral analysis unveiled the existence of 2–3-year, 2–4-year, 5–7-year and 7–11-year cycles, which may potentially reflect the connection between local NDVI evolution and larger-scale circulations, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and solar activity. This study is of great significance for providing a long-term perspective on the dynamics of vegetation cover in the Qinling mountains, and could help to guide expectations of future forest variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix 3aclimate change 3adendrochronology 3aevolution 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3aregression analysis 3aspectral analysis 3atreeline 3avariance 3avegetation cover 3aChina1 aBai, Hongying 1 aZhao, Pei 1 aFang, Shu 1 aXiang, Yuanlin 1 aHuang, Xiaoyue 0 tForests.g2022 Mar. 11, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130304433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245017200197300001600369500002000385520143600405592002801841596006101869596004501930596004101975596007602016596006302092650003002155650000802185650001402193650001702207650001802224650001602242650002002258650001702278650001302295650001502308650001302323650001902336650002602355650001602381650002102397700006402418700006002482700006102542773013302603856007302736852000902809655001202818IND60649077820221119223047.0190702e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064907782DNAL7 a10.1111/pre.123682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSathe, Santosh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4952-144310aTemporal and metabolic overlap between lipid accumulation and programmed cell death due to nitrogen starvation in the unicellular chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 173-183.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLipid accumulation due to nitrogen depletion has been studied extensively in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the metabolic changes that lead to triacylglycerol biosynthesis have been of particular interest to researchers in the biodiesel industry. The induction of programmed cell death (PCD) in response to nitrogen starvation has also been documented in related chlorophytes. Here, we examined the temporal and metabolic overlap of lipid accumulation and PCD in response to nitrogen starvation in the important model organism C. reinhardtii. Nitrogen starvation induced physiological stress, measured by the progressive decline in chlorophyll a fluorescence, reduced photosynthetic efficiency and decreased growth. In keeping with previous reports, cells accumulated lipids reaching a peak after 2–3 days. At the same time, DNA nicking and caspase‐like protease activity was observed in a proportion of cells, and ultrastructural observations confirmed that death was via PCD. Our results demonstrate that DNA nicking and caspase‐like activity are observed during PCD in C. reinhardtii in response to nitrogen starvation, and that death occurs at the same time as lipid biosynthesis. Microalgal lipid production due to nitrogen depletion in C. reinhardtii is limited by the decrease in culture growth and knowing that the loss of culture density is, at least in part, due to PCD is important for the biotechnology industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cDurand Foundation for Evolutionary Biology and Phycology  aMCB 1316206cNational Science Foundation  a1606206cNational Science Foundation  cCentre of Excellence in Palaeosciences, University of the Witwatersrand  aRA151217156515cNational Research Foundation, South Africa 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aDNA 3abiodiesel 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3aindustry 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aprogrammed cell death 3aproteinases 3atriacylglycerols1 aOrellana, Mónica V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5990-93801 aBaliga, Nitin S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9157-59741 aDurand, Pierre M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9614-13710 tPhycological research.g2019 July, v. 67, no. 3 p.173-183dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3867101x1322-08297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.123683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006600173300001800239520080700257592002801064650001801092650001301110650002301123650002801146650002101174650002101195650002501216650001401241650001501255650002401270650002101294653001701315653001701332653002701349653002001376700001801396700001901414700001901433700001901452700002701471700002401498700002701522773014501549856008501694852000901779655001201788IND60565671920221121065440.0180522e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056567192DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2014.9185332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Ashok Kumar10aAdhesion of Lactobacilli and their anti-infectivity potential  ap. 2042-2056.  aThe probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria primarily point toward colonizing ability of Lactobacilli as the most important attribute for endowing all the known beneficial effects in a host. Lactobacillus species exert health-promoting function in the gastrointestinal tract through various mechanisms such as pathogen exclusion, maintenance of microbial balance, immunomodulation, and other crucial functions. It has been seen that many surface layer proteins are involved in host adhesion, and play significant role in the modification of some signaling pathways within the host cells.

The trends toward healthier eating have increased the interest in low-fat cheese (LFC). The objective of this study is to enable an understanding and provides a baseline of the effect of fat reduction on sensory analyses and consumer acceptability of cheeses made from raw goat milk with three different fat contents and ripened for 28 days using an artisanal method. Odour and flavour intensity was lower as fat decreased in cheese, and LFC and reduced-fat cheese (RFC) were firmer, friable, grainier, drier, acidic and less adhesive and sweet than full-fat cheese (FFC). Both judges and consumers preferred the FFC, mainly because of the greater intensity and the combination of this with excessive hardness and high masticability was likely the main cause of non-acceptance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acheese milk 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer preferences 3aflavor 3agoat cheese 3agoat milk 3ahardness 3aingestion 3alow fat cheeses 3amarkets 3amilk 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3atraditional technology 0agoat milk 0alow-fat cheese 0asensory profile 0aconsumer acceptance1 aMoreno-Indias, Isabel1 aAlvarez, Sergio,1 aClevelan, Megan1 aCastro, Noemi1 aArgüello, Anastasio1 adel Rosario Fresno, María0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2012 June 1, v. 40, no. 2 p.124-132dTaylor & Francis Groupx0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2011.6338803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007500168520134500243592002801588650002601616650001201642650002401654650001401678650001301692650001801705650001101723650002601734651001201760653001501772653002301787653002501810653001701835653001301852700001701865700001701882700001901899700002101918773009101939856008502030852000902115655001202124IND60745297520221119070939.0220207e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074529752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.1002942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhoden, Kelly10aTwenty years of waterborne and related disease reports in Florida, USA  aFlorida represents a unique challenge for preventing and responding to infectious disease associated with water. This study cataloged the prevalence of reportable waterborne and water-related disease within Florida residents over the last twenty years and identified relationships between confirmed cases by location and additional risk factors. Data was collected through FLHealthCHARTS for confirmed cases between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2019. Case records were compiled and analyzed by year, county, pathogen name and disease category, patient age, and where the infection was acquired. During this time, 218,707 cases of water-related disease were recorded with 214,745 due to waterborne disease, 3255 cases of water-related vector-borne disease, and 707 cases caused by a water-based toxin. Children aged 0–4 and the elderly demonstrated a higher proportion of waterborne disease while 45–49 year olds had increased rates of water-based toxins and water-related vector-borne disease. Most cases were reported in the southeast region. Across the state, opportunities for water contact have led to high rates of water-related infectious disease. Public health initiatives and response efforts should target the pathogens of greatest impact for each region, largely zoonotic waterborne diseases, using a One Health approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOne Health initiative 3aelderly 3ainfectious diseases 3apathogens 3apatients 3apublic health 3atoxins 3avector-borne diseases 3aFlorida 0aOne health 0aWaterborne disease 0aVector-borne disease 0aWater toxins 0aZoonoses1 aAlonso, Jose1 aCarmona, Meg1 aPham, Michelle1 aBarnes, Amber N.0 tOne health.g2021 Dec., v. 13 p.100294-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23485x2352-77147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.1002943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010000169520107400269592002801343650002201371650003501393650003001428650001901458650001701477650002201494650003101516650001801547650001101565650001801576650001201594650001601606650001201622653002701634653001301661653002201674653002101696653002001717700002201737700002001759700002501779773009201804856008601896852000901982655001201991IND60701490920221118011703.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070149092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1213452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupuis, Erwan10aHyphenation of capillary electrophoresis with MC-ICP-MS – A novel tool for uranium age dating  aCapillary electrophoresis (CE) was hyphenated to multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) to determine the model age of a highly enriched uranium (HEU) sample using the ²³⁴U/²³⁰Th radiochronometer. The use of hydroxymethylbutyric acid (HMBA) as the CE electrolyte was investigated, and a complexation stacking method was developed to increase the thorium signal obtained. The age of the material was determined by measuring the ²³⁰Th content of the HEU sample using isotope dilution in conjunction with the CE-MC-ICP-MS protocol. The CE-MC-ICP-MS protocol and a standard offline protocol using gravitational chromatography both gave results in accordance within uncertainties with the production date of the HEU sample (March 1965). Liquid waste production was only of a few microliters with the use of CE. The hyphenation of CE with MC-ICP-MS render the measurement of the age of the HEU material in less than one day possible.

This study compared the groundwater quality across an urban gradient, in Onitsha, a notable urbanized region and beehive of commercial activity in southeastern Nigeria. Groundwater samples (n = 120) from sixty boreholes tapping into aquifers spanning major settlement clusters at upper Iweka, Mgbuka and Nkpor, were sampled over 5-months from August to December 2019. Faecal coliforms, water-soluble metals, and nutrients (nitrates and phosphates) were estimated in groundwater samples. Noncarcinogenic risks of heavy metals in ground water samples was estimated for Average daily dose (ADD) and Total Hazard Quotient (THQ) using both deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Concentrations of mercury and heavy metals (Fe, Pb, and Cd) estimated in water samples revealed a general exceedance of World Health Organization (2009) standards for drinking water. However, significantly higher Hg, Pb and faecal coliform levels (0.122 ± 0.03 mg/L, 0.115 ± 0.014 mg/L, 2.3 × 10⁶ ± 300 MPN respectively) in groundwater of the more built-up areas of upper Iweka highlight increased chances of metals and pathogens impacts on water quality with increased urbanization. High incidence of nutrients (nitrates: 258.40 ± 62.1 and phosphorus: 33.05 ± 4.06 mg/L) in groundwater of less urbanized areas suggests impacts of fertilizer applications from greater agricultural activity. Probabilistic estimates for heavy metals in ground water from Onitsha via ingestion route, showed that Upper Iweka had the highest HQ (3.262) followed by Mgbuka (2.1233) and Nkpor (2.0187). On the other hand, estimates showed that Mgbuka had the highest HQ (0.0241) followed by Nkpor (0.016) and Upper Iweka (0.014) for dermal exposure routes. Strategic mitigation measures including urban planning and infrastructural upgrade are recommended to protect the water resources, prevent further groundwater contamination and reduce population health risks emanating from poor drinking water sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aaverage daily intake 3abeehives 3acase studies 3acoliform bacteria 3adermal exposure 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahealth effects assessments 3aingestion 3amercury 3aphosphorus 3apopulation growth 3asustainable development 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awater solubility 3aNigeria 0aMulti-index approach 0aLand cover/use mapping 0aSentinel-2A 0aBare land 0aBuilt-up area1 aIloegbunam, Gerald Onyeka1 aChukwuka, Azubuike1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2654-14061 aOgbeide, Ozekeke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3699-15150 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2021 Aug., v. 14 p.100642-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2021.1006423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014600168520176800314592002802082650002602110650001302136650001602149650001802165650002102183650002102204650001202225650002202237650001202259650001102271650001302282650002002295650002002315653000802335653002402343653001702367653001702384700001502401700001902416700001802435700001602453700001502469700001502484700001702499700001602516773009202532856008602624852000902710655001202719IND60701491020221118011549.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070149102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1213462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xiaoxue10aRelative content detection of oligomannose modification of IgM heavy chain induced by TNP-antigen in an early vertebrate through nanoLC-MS/MS  aN-glycan modification is reported to be important in regulating the structure and function of immunoglobulins in mammals. While, the study on teleost immunoglobulin glycosylation is still limitted. In this study, we constructed a TNP-antigen driven model, and detected the site-specific N-glycans of PBS-immunized and TNP-specific Oreochromis niloticus serum IgM through ¹⁸O-labeling and nanoLC-MS/MS. These methods are widely used for peptide enrichment and protein modification identification, but rarely used in detecting the level of N-glycosylation in teleost Igs that driven by specific antigen. The results revealed that there are four N-glycosylation sites in O.niloticus IgM heavy chain, namely, the Asn-315 site in the CH2 domain, the Asn-338 site in the CH3 domain, and the Asn-509 and Asn-551 sites in the CH4 domain, All of the four residues were efficiently N-glycosylated. After immunized with TNP-antigen, the signal strength of oligomannose in the TNP-specific IgM in primary mass spectrometry was significantly higher than that in the PBS-immunized IgM. Notably, the TNP-specific IgM had an Asn-509 site fully occupied with oligomannose, while only a small amount of oligomannose was found in the PBS-immunized IgM of this site. N-glycans in other sites were mainly complex-type with a low content of fucosylation and sialylated. The oligomannose in TNP-specific IgM was further verified to be essential for the binding of IgM and MBL. These results demonstrated that the TNP-antigen induced the site-specific oligomannose modification of O.niloticus IgM heavy chain, and played an important role in the interaction of IgM and MBL, which provided insights into the evolutionary understanding of the IgM oligomannose modification and function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aglycosylation 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aisotope labeling 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3amethane 3amodels 3apeptides 3asignal strength 3astable isotopes 0aIgM 0aAntigen recognition 0ananoLC-MS/MS 0aOligomannose1 aLi, Xiaoyu1 aMu, Liangliang1 aHan, Kailiang1 aWu, Hairong1 aWu, Liting1 aWang, Anli1 aYing, Wantao1 aYe, Jianmin0 tTalanta.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 219 p.121346-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1213463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002200158245008800180300001600268520090200284592002801186650002701214650001301241650001201254650001801266650001501284650002701299650001201326650003701338650001101375650000901386650003501395650003701430650003301467650005301500650004201553650003901595650004401634700002601678773009201704856007901796852000901875655001201884IND4484864420221119182949.0120502e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448486442DNAL7 a216730732pmid7 a10.1530/REP-11-01132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleene, Kenneth C10aMaybe repressed mRNAs are not stored in the chromatoid body in mammalian spermatids  ap. 383-388.  aThe chromatoid body is a dynamic organelle that is thought to coordinate the cytoplasmic regulation of mRNA translation and degradation in mammalian spermatids. The chromatoid body is also postulated to function in repression of mRNA translation by sequestering dormant mRNAs where they are inaccessible to the translational apparatus. This review finds no convincing evidence that dormant mRNAs are localized exclusively in the chromatoid body. This discrepancy can be explained by two hypotheses. First, experimental artifacts, possibly related to peculiarities of the structure and function of the chromatoid body, preclude obtaining an accurate indication of mRNA localization. Second, mRNA is not stored in the chromatoid body, because, like perinuclear P granules in Caenorhabditis elegans, the chromatoid body functions as a center for mRNP remodeling and export to other cytoplasmic sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3agranules 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3aspermatids 3atranslation (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMammalsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Biosynthesisxphysiology 2aRNA Interferencexphysiology 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptionalxphysiology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messenger, Storedxmetabolism 2aSpermatidsxmetabolismxultrastructure.1 aCullinane, Danielle L0 tReproduction.g2011 Sept., v. 142, no. 3 p.383-388dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-11-01133Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100001900196245016700215300001200382506007600394520171600470592002802186506003702214650002202251650001202273650001602285650001402301650002502315650004302340650002502383650001602408650001502424651001302439653001102452653001002463653001502473653001502488653001902503653000802522700001902530700002002549773010602569856009002675852000902765655001202774IND60590504320221207114236.0190318e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059050432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.02.0082doi7 aPMC58639192pmcid7 a295766682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMennis, Jeremy10aUrban greenspace is associated with reduced psychological stress among adolescents: A Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA) analysis of activity space  ap. 1-9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigates the momentary association between urban greenspace, captured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat imagery, and psychological stress, captured using Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA), in the activity spaces of a sample of primarily African American adolescents residing in Richmond, Virginia. We employ generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the effect of exposure to urban greenspace on stress and test for moderation by sex, emotional dysregulation, season, neighborhood disadvantage, and whether the observation occurs at home or elsewhere. Results indicate that urban greenspace is associated with lower stress when subjects are away from home, which we speculate is due to the properties of stress reduction and attention restoration associated with exposure to natural areas, and to the primacy of other family dynamics mechanisms of stress within the home. Subjects may also seek out urban greenspaces at times of lower stress or explicitly for purposes of stress reduction. The greenspace-stress association away from home did not differ by sex, emotional dysregulation, neighborhood disadvantage, or season, the latter of which suggests that the observed greenspace-stress relationship is associated with being in a natural environment rather than strictly exposure to abundant green vegetation. Given the association of urban greenspace with lower stress found here and in other studies, future research should address the mediated pathways between greenspace, stress, and stress-related negative health outcomes for different population subgroups as a means toward understanding and addressing health disparities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aLandsat 3aadolescents 3aequations 3agreen infrastructure 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apsychological stress 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3aVirginia 0aStress 0aUrban 0aGreenspace 0aVegetation 0aActivity space 0aEMA1 aMason, Michael1 aAmbrus, Andreea0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2018 June, v. 174 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245014100208300002000349520241200369592002802781596009902809650002202908650001202930650002002942650001102962650001402973650001902987650001603006650001603022700005903038773017303097856008103270852000903351655001203360IND60786450420221122135207.0220803e20220725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078645042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c011232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaharana, Abhishek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5764-351210aEffects of Ultrasound and Its Amplitude on the Metastable Zone Width, Induction Time, and Nucleation Kinetics of Pyrazinamide in Acetone  ap. 11262-11275.  aA systematic investigation is carried out to analyze the effect of ultrasonic amplitudes (10, 30, and 50%) on the metastable zone width (MSZW) and induction time (tᵢₙd) for unseeded batch cooling crystallization of pyrazinamide from its acetone solution. The MSZW is measured at five different saturation temperatures (293.15, 298.15, 303.15, 308.15, and 313.15 K) with different cooling rates. Five cooling rates (30, 24, 18, 12, and 6 K/h) were selected for the silent case, and three cooling rates (24, 18, and 6 K/h) were selected for sonicated cases with three different ultrasonic amplitudes (10, 30, and 50%). The induction time is measured at five different supersaturation ratios (1.05, 1.10, 1.15, 1.20, and 1.25) at three different saturation temperatures (293.15, 303.15, and 313.15 K) for both silent and sonicated cases. For the silent cases, at a given saturation temperature, the MSZW increases by 63–73% with increase in cooling rate from 6 to 30 K/h. Again, at a given cooling rate, the MSZW decreases by 19–40% with increase in saturation temperature from 293.15 to 313.15 K. For sonicated cases, at a given saturation temperature and cooling rate, the MSZW is decreased by almost half at a higher ultrasonic amplitude (50%). The MSZW data are analyzed using four different approaches (Nyvlt’s approach, Kubuto’s approach, Sangwal’s self-consistent Nyvlt-like equation approach, and Sangwal’s classical three-dimensional nucleation theory approach) to calculate various nucleation parameters. The application of ultrasound reduces the apparent nucleation order significantly, and the nucleation rate was increased by 2–3 times compared to the silent cases with increasing ultrasonic amplitude. The data obtained from the induction time are analyzed using classical nucleation theory to calculate important nucleation parameters such as interfacial energy (1.05–1.29 mJ/m²) and various nucleation parameters such as nucleation rate (5.23 × 10²²–7.28 × 10²⁵ #/m³ s), critical radius (0.34–1.91 Å), and critical free energy (0.05 × 10²⁰–1.91 × 10²⁰ J). Furthermore, the concept of nucleation potential is used to estimate MSZW from the measured induction time data. The estimated values are seen to be 80–85% accurate at low saturation temperatures and 66–72% accurate at higher saturation temperatures for the pyrazinamide–acetone solution.  aPublisher supplied data  aEMR/2015/002266cScience and Engineering Research Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001843 3aGibbs free energy 3aacetone 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3aequations 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3aultrasonics1 aSarkar, Debasis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0132-60800 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 July 25, v. 61, no. 30 p.11262-11275dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c011233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245011900155300001600274500002000290520139300310592002801703650001101731650002701742650001101769650001301780650001101793650001501804650001101819650001401830651001101844700002501855700001601880700001901896773013301915856007202048852000902120655001202129IND60588183120221121021654.0180103e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058818312DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.30832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagliara, S.10aBlock Ramps in Curved Rivers: Morphology Analysis and Prototype Data Supported Design Criteria for Mild Bed Slopes  ap. 427-437.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEco‐friendly river restoration structures are a valid solution for river training projects. Among this structure typology, block ramps have been successfully tested to solve problems related to river sediment control, bed stabilization and energy dissipation. Despite the conspicuous literature dealing with block ramps design in straight rivers, there are no studies analysing the erosive process occurring in the stilling basin downstream of a block ramp in a curved river bend. Therefore, this paper represents the first systematic analysis of their behaviour and of the resulting downstream equilibrium morphology in such geometric configuration. A dedicated model was built to simulate a wide range of hydraulic conditions. Experimental data analysis allowed describing the erosion dynamics occurring in the stilling basin and, at the same time, to derive a useful design relationship by which it is possible to estimate the maximum scour depth. Furthermore, the model results were successfully validated by using field measurements collected in the Porębianka River (Poland). Both field data and laboratory experimental results allowed furnishing a comprehensive description of the scour phenomenon. The proposed relationship represents the first trustable and valid tool for hydraulic design of such structure typology in curved rivers.

A.10aMechanistic Insight Into the Application of Alumina-Supported Pd Catalysts for the Hydrogenation of Nitrobenzene to Aniline  ap. 10712-10722.  aTwo Pd/γ-Al₂O₃ catalysts are examined for the vapor phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over the temperature range of 60–200 °C. A 1 wt % catalyst is selected as a reference material that is diluted with γ-alumina to produce a 0.3 wt % sample, which is representative of a metal loading linked to a candidate industrial specification aniline synthesis catalyst. Cyclohexanone oxime is identified as a by-product that is associated with reagent transformation. Temperature-programed infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programed desorption measurements of chemisorbed CO provide information on the morphology of the crystallites of the higher Pd loading catalyst. The lower Pd loading sample exhibits a higher aniline selectivity by virtue of minimization of product overhydrogenation. Reaction testing measurements that were undertaken employing elevated hydrogen flow rates lead to the proposition of separate reagent and product-derived by-product formation pathways, each of which occurs in a consecutive manner. A global reaction scheme is proposed that defines the by-product distribution accessible by the grades of catalyst examined. This information is helpful in defining product purification procedures that would be required in certain heat recovery scenarios connected with large-scale aniline production.  aPublisher supplied data  aEP/N509668/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000266  aEP/R513222/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000266  aNAcUniversity of Glasgowdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000853  aPGRS-3/4cHuntsman Polyurethanesdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aaniline 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3acyclohexanones 3adesorption 3aheat recovery 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3anitrobenzenes 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3avapors1 aMcCullagh, Annelouise M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8612-53461 aCampbell, James W.1 aMitchell, Chris1 aCarr, Robert H.1 aLennon, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8397-05280 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 July 14, v. 61, no. 30 p.10712-10722dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c011343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245011000173300001800283520151600301592002801817650001201845650002301857650001501880650002401895700002701919700002601946700002401972700002001996700002702016773010602043856007502149852000902224655001202233IND60577850620180802000000.0170810e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057785062DNAL7 a10.1021/ma401011f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnastassopoulos, Dimitrios
L.10aNeutron Reflectivity Study of End-Adsorbed Bimodal Polymer Systems under Static Conditions and Shear Flow  ap. 6972-6980.  aThe behavior of end-adsorbed bimodal PS–PEO block copolymer systems was studied with neutron reflectivity experiments, both under static conditions (zero shear rate) and under a stepwise-increasing shear flow, up to a critical shear rate where desorption occurs. It is found that when the height of one kind of chain in the bimodal brush is significantly greater than that of the other, the longer chains desorb first, while if the heights of the two constituent kinds of chains in the brush are similar, then the bimodal system responds as a whole and both kinds of chain desorb simultaneously. In particular, when the chain height ratio of the two components of the bimodal system is less than 0.80, the reflectivity spectra under static conditions are best fitted by two parabolas, and under shear flow each component desorbs at a different shear rate. Above this value, the bimodal system reacts en bloc, and desorption occurs at the same shear rate for both copolymers. It is further observed that the critical shear rate for desorption, in all bimodal systems studied in the present investigation, scales with s–³, where s is the mean interanchor distance, in accord with the behavior of monodisperse brushes reported previously [Anastassopoulos et al. Macromolecules 2006, 39, 8901–8904]. In addition, careful measurements under shear flow up to and in the vicinity of the critical shear rate for desorption show no evidence of any measurable change in the brush height or volume fraction profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrushes 3acomposite polymers 3adesorption 3aneutron diffraction1 aSpiliopoulos, Nikolaos1 aVradis, Alexandros A.1 aToprakcioglu, Chris1 aMenelle, Allain1 aCousin, F.q(Fabrice),0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 46, no. 17 p.6972-6980dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma401011f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245013200155300001600287500002000303520197300323592002802296650002902324650001102353650001102364650000902375650003102384650001002415650001102425650001502436650001202451650002502463650001502488650002202503650001302525651001502538700001802553700001302571773013302584856007202717852000902789655001202798IND60588183220221121021705.0180103e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058818322DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.30982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCowan, W. R.10aEvaluation of Central Valley Spring‐Run Chinook Salmon Passage Through Lower Butte Creek Using Hydraulic Modelling Techniques  ap. 328-340.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRiver2D was used to develop a hydraulic model of an upstream passage impediment for adult spring‐run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) on Butte Creek, Tehama County, California. Topographic data were collected by using a total station, survey‐grade real‐time kinematic global positioning system, and terrestrial light detection and ranging. Stage‐discharge relationships were developed at the upstream and downstream ends of the site to use as boundary conditions and to calibrate the 2D model. A pressure transducer was installed at the downstream boundary of the site to provide a time series of flow and water temperatures. Parameters of the hydraulic model were examined to assess upstream passage including minimum thalweg depth along the least width‐limiting pathway, velocity, and water surface elevation above and below a jump, and flow partitioning between a split in the main flow paths through the site. The results of the River2D model were used to identify flow levels that met the minimum depth and width thresholds needed for adult spring‐run Chinook salmon (SRCS) to migrate upstream through the study reach. A minimum passage depth criterion of 0.27 m was used for adult SRCS. Site‐specific passage width criteria were derived from the literature for the study site and ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 m. Model results indicated that a flow of 3.40 cms met the depth criterion and the lower bound of the width criterion. A flow level of 6.8 cms met the depth criterion and the upper bound of the width criterion. Data from the VAKI Riverwatcher fish passage counting device installed just upstream of the study site were related to the stage/passage limiting width and water temperature monitoring data. The monitoring data and results of the predictive modelling will be used by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to recommend flow criteria that protect migrating adult SRCS.

We evaluated the effects of thinning, pruning season and girdling intensity on tree growth and vigor in an old Larix kaempferi seed orchard. Even after four years, tree size (crown width and tree height) increased, resulting in light intensity of an un-thinned class decreasing. Thinning counteracted the decrease in light intensity associated with tree growth, but it had no effect on promoting tree growth. Tree crown status was scored based on vigor and health. No significant difference in crown vigor was observed between unpruned and winter-pruned trees, but the summer-pruning class showed significantly lower vigor. Five years after girdling, trees with low and moderate girdling levels maintained high crown vigor, similar to intact trees, while the crown vigor of trees subjected to severe girdling was significantly lower. This is the first study to quantitatively model trends in remaining girdling depth over time, and to show that the half decay period was ca. 2–3 years. Our findings suggested that management procedures that combine moderate-level girdling, winter pruning and thinning to maintain rPPFD at 50% are well-suited to balancing tree vigor and reproduction in seed orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix kaempferi 3alight intensity 3areproduction 3aseed orchards 3asustainable forestry 3atree crown 3atree growth 3atree height 3atrees 3avigor1 aNishikawa, Hiroki 1 aTamura, Akira 0 tForests.g2022 Mar. 12, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130304493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012400162300001800286520131100304592002801615650000901643650002801652650000701680650002301687650001101710650002001721650002101741700003301762773011801795856007401913852000901987655001201996IND60080387220221121143530.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008038722DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.121552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowder, Austin C.10aImpact of High Pressure Processing on the Functional Aspects of Beef Muscle Injected with Salt and/or Sodium Phosphates  ap. 1840-1848.  aThis study aimed to determine the interactions among salt (NaCl), sodium phosphate (SP) and mild high pressure processing (HPP) in brine‐injected beef. Beef strip loin segments were injected to 10% over initial weight with solutions containing water and various levels of salt (0, 2 or 4% of solution) and/or SP (0 or 4% of solution).

Use of SP and pressure application increased pH by ∼0.2 units. L* values were increased by pressure and decreased by SP. Redness (a*) increased at 303 MPa. Purge increases due to pressure were mitigated by SP. Pressure application at 303 MPa reduced total and sarcoplasmic protein solubility by 24 and 32%, respectively. There were no beneficial interactions among salt or SP and HPP. However, results indicate SP may prevent yield loss due to HPP. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study has demonstrated that beneficial interactions between HPP and salt are not achieved in brine‐injected whole muscle beef when salt levels are at or below 0.4% of final product weight. However, use of sodium phosphates prevented reduced yields and alleviated some of the color change incurred by HPP at mild pressures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3ahigh pressure treatment 3apH 3aprotein solubility 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium phosphate1 aMireles Dewitt, Christina A.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2014 Aug., v. 38, no. 4 p.1840-1848dBlackwell Pubx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.121553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011700155300001800272520125900290592002801549650002201577650001501599650001301614650002301627650001601650650001501666650000901681650001901690650001801709650004401727650001901771650002701790650002401817650001301841650003701854650000901891650001501900700002101915700002001936700001601956700002401972700001801996773010602014856007502120852000902195655001202204IND60577850720180731000000.0170810e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057785072DNAL7 a10.1021/ma40102962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKos, Tomaž10aZinc-Containing Block Copolymer as a Precursor for the in Situ Formation of Nano ZnO and PMMA/ZnO Nanocomposites  ap. 6942-6948.  aWe report on the synthesis of highly transparent and UV-absorbing PMMA/ZnO nanocomposites prepared by hydrolysis of a ZnO precursor, the A-b-(AB) diblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate-co-(zinc methacrylate acetate)), PMMA-b-P(MMA-co-ZnMAAc), synthesized by RAFT polymerization. The zinc content of the block copolymers was in the range from 3 to 13 wt %. The PMMA block provides inherent compatibility with the PMMA matrix, whereas the second block, P(MMA-co-ZnMAAc) with zinc ions, acts as a polymeric precursor for the formation of ZnO nanoparticles. The amphiphilic block copolymer self-organizes in THF and THF/H₂O in ordered nanostructures, thereby influencing the nanoparticle formation during the hydrolysis of the precursor block copolymer with KOH in a solvent mixture THF/H₂O. The ZnO nanoparticles were rod-shaped with lengths up to 80 nm and a diameter of 14 nm and were redispersible in THF. Dispersions in THF and thin films of PMMA/ZnO nanocomposite exhibit excellent transparency in the visible range and good absorption in the UV range below 400 nm. The block copolymer was characterized by SEC, NMR, DLS, and TGA, while PMMA/ZnO nanocomposites were characterized by IR, XRD, UV–vis, and STEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aacetates 3acomposite polymers 3adispersions 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apotassium hydroxide 3asolvents 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aAnžlovar, Alojz1 aPahovnik, David1 aŽagar, Ema1 aOrel, Zorica

The sliding cross-correlogram approach was used in this study to correlate the amount of water infiltrating the subsurface with changes in water table levels that were monitored at six piezometers. The results showed a significant variation of aquifer response times over the study area; this finding indicates that the hydraulic behavior of an aquifer may differ from one location to another within the same aquifer. Aquifer response times were found to be influenced by the variations of the vadose zone thickness. These variations, however, were not observed to be a significant factor controlling the spatiotemporal changes in the aquifer response times. Instead, it was the intensity of the vertical inflow events and the local recharge rate that were found to exert an impact on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquifer response times. It was assumed that large amounts of vertical inflow increase the soil's volumetric water content above the water table, leading to higher values of hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils, thus contributing to shortening aquifer response times. A better understanding of the effects of aquifer characteristics on aquifer response times is useful for groundwater resource management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial aquifer 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3apiezometers 3aresource management 3asustainable development 3avadose zone 3avolumetric water content 3awater table 0aCross-correlation 0aSliding-window 0aWater table level 0aWater infiltration 0aSnowmelt 0aCanada1 aChesnaux, Romain1 aWalter, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2514-61801 aMeghnefi, Fethi0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2021 Aug., v. 14 p.100647-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2021.1006473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245010100156300001600257500002000273520211800293592002802411650001102439650001502450650001202465650001202477650001102489650001602500650001302516650001202529650001502541650001102556650002002567650001602587700001602603700001502619700002302634700001402657700001802671700001702689700001702706773013302723856007202856852000902928655001202937IND60588183420221121021543.0180103e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058818342DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.30792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, M.12aA Fuzzy Rule‐based Model for the Assessment of Macrobenthic Habitats under Hydropeaking Impact  ap. 377-387.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHydropeaking presents one of the large impacts on river ecology and is gaining importance because of an increasinlgy volatile energy market with high portions of new renewable energies dependent on local climate conditions. This study presents the application of a fuzzy logic model for the investigation of macrobenthic habitats under hydropeaking conditions in the Norwegian river Surna. Preference data of the three taxa Baetis rhodani, Hydroptila spp. and Allogamus auricollis with distinctively different habitat requirements related to near‐bottom flow forces (high/low forces, and narrow range) are used. These data are transferred into the multivariate fuzzy rule‐based physical habitat model Computer Aided Simulation of Instream flow and Riparia in order to integrate water depth and river bed substrate as additional parameters. Permanently available habitats (persistent habitats) are assessed for different scenarios of hydropeaking operation. It is found that the amount of persistently high‐quality habitat is closely related to the size and range of fluctuations in hydraulic conditions occuring during hydropeaking events. Effects are much more distinct for species with a narrow range of hydraulic preference. The integration of water depth in the simulations has a noticable impact on the amount and quality of predicted habitats. Substrate conditions in the investigation site are homogeneous and, in the specific case considered, do not have a significant impact. The study suggests persistent habitats as a suitable indicator of hydropeaking impact on organisms with low mobility. The persistent habitat approach takes into account that organisms with a low mobility and a distinct range of tolerance related to hydraulic stress tend to settle in areas with permanently stable conditions. Multivariate aspects are accounted through the fuzzy rule‐based approach and do clearly affect habitat predictions. Habitat requirements of species particularly sensitive to hydropeaking are proposed for the investigation and application in the future.

Roasting is one of the most important unit operations in the cocoa‐based industries which reduces the antioxidant properties. Cocoa beans were subjected to roast at 150, 200 and 250C for 10–50 min using superheated steam method. The effect of roasting temperature and times on the total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant properties was investigated. The TPC and TFC were evaluated using gallic acid and epicatechin, respectively. The free radical scavenging activity was measured using 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and antioxidant properties were evaluated using ferric reducing antioxidant power assay. The total phenols and total flavonoids decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing time and temperature. The cocoa beans showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant properties at higher temperature and time. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The chocolate industry is global and economically important worldwide. The main raw material of chocolate is cocoa beans. The introduction of a new method for roasting cocoa beans may interest cocoa production industries that may be beneficial to consumers as well as to industry. Effective roasting of cocoa beans using superheated steam considerably brings about lucrative prospects in cocoa product manufacturing. As a new method for food processing, superheated steam roasting is more convenient and flexible than conventional method because the higher total phenol and antioxidant properties are preserved. At the same time, the favorable characteristics of food in terms of antioxidant properties are maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepicatechin 3agallic acid 3acrop production 3achocolate 3afoods 3asteam 3aphenol 3aTheobroma cacao 3araw materials 3afree radical scavengers 3acocoa beans 3amethodology 3aroasting 3atemperature 3aantioxidant activity 0anew methods1 aBhat, R.1 aYang, Tajul A.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2014 Aug., v. 38, no. 4 p.1932-1938dBlackwell Pubx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.121663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011000169300001600279520117000295592002801465650002401493650001801517650002101535650001401556650001401570650001601584650001301600650001001613650001601623650001401639650001101653650002001664650004301684650001701727650001001744700001701754700001601771700001801787700001301805700002101818700001701839773014301856856008201999852000902081655001202090IND60743396320221122093354.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074339632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-021-00637-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuerdi, Mayinuer10aEngorgement of Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides ticks blocked by silencing a protein inhibitor of apoptosis  ap. 623-636.  aInhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are regulators of cell death and may play a role in the salivary glands of ticks during blood-feeding. We cloned the open reading frame (ORF) sequence of the IAP gene in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides (RhIAP). The RhIAP ORF of 1887 bp encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids, which contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a RING finger motif. A real-time PCR assay showed that RhIAP mRNA was expressed in all the tick developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adults) and in all tissues examined (midgut, ovary, salivary glands, fat body, and hemolymph). Western blot showed that the protein level of RhIAP in salivary glands increased during tick blood-feeding and decreased towards the end of tick engorgement. RhIAP gene silencing in vitro experiments with salivary glands demonstrated that RhIAP could be effectively knocked down within 48 h after dsRNA treatment, and as a consequence, salivary glands displayed apoptotic morphology. RhIAP gene silencing also inhibited tick blood-feeding and decreased the engorgement rate. These data suggest that RhIAP might be a suitable RNAi target for tick control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRING finger domains 3aRhipicephalus 3aWestern blotting 3aacarology 3aapoptosis 3aengorgement 3afat body 3agenes 3ahematophagy 3ahemolymph 3amidgut 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atick control 3aticks1 aHu, Shanming1 aWang, Yanan1 aZhou, Yongzhi1 aCao, Jie1 aZhang, Houshuang1 aZhou, Jinlin0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2021 July, v. 84, no. 3 p.623-636dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl37160x0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00637-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04129naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245013900161300001600300500002000316520258900336592002802925650001002953650001502963650001202978650001502990650002603005650002603031650001903057650002103076650001503097650001303112650001303125650001503138650001003153650001303163650002303176650001303199650002103212650001503233650001103248650001403259650001303273650001503286650001503301700002003316700001803336700001903354773013303373856007203506852000903578655001203587IND60588183520221121005249.0180103e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058818352DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.30812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberholster, P.

The overabundance of benthic filamentous algae mats in river systems due to nutrient enrichment can modify the habitats of macroinvertebrate and fish communities as well as clogging irrigation crop sprayers of downstream water users. The current study examined over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) the interplay between physical and chemical river characteristics and epilithic filamentous algae biomass in two South African agricultural influenced rivers. The study area consisted of the Touw and Duiwe Rivers, which run into a proclaimed Ramsar site, namely, the Wilderness Lake System. A strong positive correlation was observed between the maximum filamentous algae biomass (97 chl‐a mg m⁻²) observed during the dry season and the average water column alkalinity >30 mg l⁻¹. The benthic trophic status of the nine sampling sites during the dry seasons indicated the highest benthic algae biomass with mesotrophic (1.7–21 chl‐a mg m⁻²) to hypertrophic (>84 chl‐a mg m⁻²) conditions. During the dry season, only three sampling sites were below the suggested guideline value (35 µg l⁻¹) for total phosphorus (TP), while four sampling sites were below the total nitrogen guideline of 252 µg l⁻¹. In the wet season, two sites were below TP values with five sites below total nitrogen guideline values. From the data gathered, it was evident that water column alkalinity and hardness were the main drivers for the formation or absence of benthic filamentous algae mats in the two river systems and that nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations was overshadowed by the physical and chemical characteristics of the river systems at certain sites. Nutrient results for the river bottom sediments revealed that the sediment qualities were variable at the different sampling sites, but more specifically along the longitudinal paths of flow. It was apparent that the high TP concentrations in the water column and bottom sediment, which were lowest during the dry season, were associated with the highest epilithic filamentous algae mat formation. The outcome of the current study shows that a more holistic approach must be followed for the development of future eutrophication guidelines and nutrient thresholds in South African rivers influenced by agriculture land use activities.

J.14aThe Anopheles gambiae alpha‐tubulin‐1b promoter directs neuronal, testes and developing imaginal tissue specific expression and is a sensitive enhancer detector  ap. 79-88.  aA knowledge gap in mosquito functional genetic analysis is the dearth of characterized regulatory regions that can target tissue specific transgene expression. To broaden the tools available, a promoter region of the Anopheles gambiaeα‐tubulin1b gene has been assayed following fusion to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene and stable transformation of An. gambiae. In eight transgenic lines, the Angtub α1b regulatory region directed a core profile of tissue specific expression in the head, chordotonal organs, ventral nerve cord and testes. This profile overlaps those seen for α2‐tubulin expression in Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori. In addition, widespread position dependant expression was observed in other specific tissues that were unique to each line. For example, in different lines, expression was observed in larval and adult muscles, fatbody, cuticle and midgut secretory cells. The majority of genomic transgene insertions were mapped to within 10 kb of a gene, suggesting that the Angtub α1b basal promoter is particularly sensitive to enhancers and may be suitable to form the basis of a sensitive enhancer trapping construct, in combination with a binary expression system such as Gal4‐UAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aBombyx mori 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amidgut 3amuscles 3apromoter regions 3areporter genes 3atestes 3aventral nerve cord 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modifiedxmetabolism 2aAnophelesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aImaginal Discsxmetabolism 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aNervous Systemxmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTestisxmetabolism 2aTubulinxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aAmenya, D.1 aLynd, A.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2012 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.79-88dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2011.01112.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002400185245014700209300001600356520159500372592002801967650002501995650002402020650001202044650001302056650001502069650001802084650001402102650001202116650001202128650001902140650002102159650001502180650001502195650000902210651000902219651000902228700001802237700002102255700001802276700002002294700002102314773010702335856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60572835620221123015604.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057283562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9808-12doi7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9808-12chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonin, Catherine L.10aImproved Feedstock Option or Invasive Risk? Comparing Establishment and Productivity of Fertile Miscanthus × giganteus to Miscanthus sinensis  ap. 317-328.  aThe perennial grass genus Miscanthus has great promise as biomass feedstock, but there are concerns about potential invasion outside production fields. While the sterile hybrid Miscanthus × giganteus is currently one of the leading feedstock options due to its low invasive potential, fertile varieties are being developed to reduce establishment costs, and their invasive risks need to be further assessed. We performed seed addition experiments in Ohio and Iowa, USA to examine the establishment, flowering, persistence, and shoot biomass per plot of a fertile M. × giganteus biotype (‘PowerCane’) and two Miscanthus sinensis biotypes, one feral, and one ornamental. Seeds were added to small, replicated plots in each of the 2 years under two seeding densities and two competition treatments, and plots were monitored for 2–3 years. The ‘PowerCane’ biotype established better, survived better, and produced greater amounts of biomass per plot than both M. sinensis biotypes. All three biotypes flowered by the second or third year after establishment, with inflorescences more numerous in ‘PowerCane’ and the Ornamental M. sinensis biotypes. Effects of seeding density and competition on these patterns were minor in most cases. Our research suggests that ‘PowerCane’ exhibits many traits shared by both biomass crops and invasive species: multi-year persistence, high biomass potential, and fertility. We suggest that the benefits of a seeded M. × giganteus should be carefully weighed against its increased invasive risk prior to deployment across the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3abiomass 3abiotypes 3afeedstocks 3aferal animals 3aflowering 3agrasses 3ahybrids 3ainflorescences 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aperennials 3arisk 3aIowa 3aOhio1 aMutegi, Evans1 aSnow, Allison A.1 aMiriti, Maria1 aChang, Hsiaochi1 aHeaton, Emily A.0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.317-328dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11406x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9808-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010200170300001600272520154200288592002801830650001201858650001201870650002701882650001501909650002001924650002601944650001901970650001101989650001302000650001402013650001602027650001102043650001502054650002002069650002002089650001402109650001902123653002002142653002502162653001402187653002202201653001202223653003102235653000902266700001302275700001402288700001502302700002002317700001302337773014502350856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60532631120221117164723.0190415e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053263112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2015.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng-gang, Liang10aLow Light During Grain Filling Stage Deteriorates Rice Cooking Quality, but not Nutritional Value  ap. 197-206.  aTo investigate the effect of low light (LL, 50% natural light) during grain filling (GF) stage on rice transamination, amino acid (AA) accumulation, nutritional value, and cooking quality in three different rice genotypes, transaminase activities and AA levels in grains during GF stage and the traits that significantly affected rice quality (physical appearance, cooking quality, and nutritional value) were analyzed. LL did not disturb transamination in rice grains during GF stage, as minimal impact was found on alanine and aspartate transaminase activities. Nevertheless, most AAs in caryopses, including lysine and threonine, increased in response to LL, except for sulfur-containing AAs. These results suggest that AA metabolism and accumulation in rice grains were rarely suppressed by LL during GF stage. Rice nutritional ingredients at harvest, such as major protein components including glutelin and most important essential amino acids (EAAs) including lysine and threonine, increased significantly in response to LL, whereas most protein and EAA ratios were rarely affected. However, LL markedly affected physical appearance of rice grains by reducing brown rice rate, milled rice rate, and 1000-grain weight and increasing the chalkiness rate. In addition, cooking qualities decreased in response to LL, while breakdown values and amylose levels decreased and setback values increased. We concluded that LL during GF stage decreased the cooking quality of rice, but could potentially improve the nutritional value of rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aamylose 3aaspartate transaminase 3abrown rice 3acooking quality 3aessential amino acids 3afilling period 3afruits 3agenotype 3aglutelins 3aingredients 3alysine 3ametabolism 3anutritive value 3asolar radiation 3athreonine 3atransamination 0acooking quality 0aessential amino acid 0alow light 0anutritional value 0aprotein 0arapid visco-analyzer value 0arice1 aJia, Liu1 aYan, Wang1 aDan, Xiong1 aChun-bang, Ding1 aTian, Li0 tRice science.g2015 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.197-206dElsevier B.V.aChina National Rice Research InstitutewJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsci.2015.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014800171300001600319520151800335592002801853650002701881650001301908650001701921650002601938650002001964650001301984650002201997650002602019650002102045650001202066650001502078650001502093651001502108653002602123653002302149653002602172653001402198653001802212773010402230856008502334852000902419655001202428IND60546259820221117223125.0160903e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054625982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.01.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComerford, Emma10aUnderstanding why landholders choose to participate or withdraw from conservation programs: A case study from a Queensland conservation auction  ap. 169-176.  aEnsuring adequate participation by private landholders in a conservation scheme is a challenge for program managers around the world. This paper uses a case study of the Vegetation Incentives Program from Queensland, Australia, to contribute additional information to the literature on influences on participation in conservation, and to offer insight into ways to improve program design to optimise participation. The research is particularly of interest to programs that include a tender mechanism or conservation covenant in their designs. Participation in the Vegetation Incentives Program was limited outside two small geographic areas, with the result that the budget was not expended. A survey of participants revealed that a narrow subset of the rural population was attracted to participate, namely highly educated, experienced landholders with positive environmental attitudes and a low opportunity cost of participation. The research also investigated why some landholders chose to withdraw from the program before full participation. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in the analysis. There were a variety of reasons for making the decision to leave, including disliking the requirement for permanent protection, the tender mechanism employed, and not understanding the process well enough. This information can help improve conservation outcomes by understanding where to target limited efforts in a catchment, and clarifying the likely limitations of some aspects of scheme design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aauctions 3acase studies 3aconservation programs 3adecision making 3amanagers 3aopportunity costs 3aquantitative analysis 3arural population 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aQueensland 0aVegetation protection 0aIncentive programs 0aConservation covenant 0aAttitudes 0aParticipation0 tJournal of environmental management.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 141 p.169-176dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245017300198300002000371500001900391520131300410592002801723650001801751650002901769650001501798650001401813650002601827650001301853650001501866650001301881650002601894650002301920700001201943700002001955700002501975773014302000856007902143852000902222655001202231IND60713679120210804000000.0201023e20200914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071367912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c037942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, You1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8523-351313aDe Novo Development of a Quantitative Adverse Outcome Pathway (qAOP) Network for Ultraviolet B (UVB) Radiation Using Targeted Laboratory Tests and Automated Data Mining  ap. 13147-13156.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUltraviolet B (UVB) radiation is a natural nonchemical stressor posing potential hazards to organisms such as planktonic crustaceans. The present study was conducted to revisit the lethal effects of UVB on crustaceans, generate new experimental evidence to fill in knowledge gaps, and develop novel quantitative adverse outcome pathways (qAOPs) for UVB. A combination of laboratory and computational approaches was deployed to achieve the goals. For targeted laboratory tests, Daphnia magna was used as a prototype and exposed to a gradient of artificial UVB. Targeted bioassays were used to quantify the effects of UVB at multiple levels of biological organization. A toxicity pathway network was assembled based on the new experimental evidence and previously published data extracted using a novel computational tool, the NIVA Risk Assessment Database (NIVA RAdb). A network of AOPs was developed, and weight of evidence was assessed based on a combination of the current and existing data. In addition, quantitative key event relationships in the AOPs were developed by fitting the D. magna data to predefined models. A complete workflow for assembly and evaluation of qAOPs has been presented, which may serve as a good example for future de novo qAOP development for chemical and nonchemical stressors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aadverse outcome pathways 3aautomation 3adatabases 3aenvironmental science 3aplankton 3aprototypes 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 3aweight-of-evidence1 aXie, Li1 aLee, YeonKyeong1 aTollefsen, Knut Erik0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Sept. 14, v. 54, no. 20 p.13147-13156dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c037943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245015400165300002000319520144400339592002801783596008501811650001501896650001201911650002001923650001101943650001901954650000901973650001601982700005601998700001802054700001402072773017302086856008102259852000902340655001202349IND60786451120221120115039.0220803e20220720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078645112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c012182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaolong10aNumerical Investigation on the Progressive Evolution of Regeneration Pattern with Feed Temperature in a Wall-Flow-Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filter  ap. 10736-10746.  aA two-dimensional transient model for wall-flow-catalyzed diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration is applied to investigate the regeneration process of DPF. User-defined subroutines are coupled to the commercial computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS Fluent to implement soot oxidation kinetics. Numerical results reveal that filter regeneration can proceed in three modes depending on the feed temperature: uniform combustion mode (Pattern I), transition mode (Pattern II), and propagating front mode (Pattern III). Pattern I is characterized by a small temperature rise of 20–160 K and a long regeneration time of about 600–2400 s. In contrast, Pattern III is characterized by a high peak temperature greater than 1400 K and a short regeneration time smaller than 40 s. Pattern II is the transition (mixed) mode in which the filter is regenerated by a moving reaction front which cannot conquer the whole filter length. For Pattern III, the propagating front originates from the downstream (sub-pattern a) to the midstream (sub-pattern b) to the upstream (sub-pattern c) as the feed temperature is increased from 893 to 943 K. Sub-pattern c results in the maximum peak temperature under all investigated operation conditions, while not shortening the regeneration time compared to sub-pattern a and sub-pattern b. These findings help to attain more favorable schemes for the thermal management optimization in DPF regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020JJ26SN065cDalian Science and Technology Innovation Funddhttps://doi.org/NA 3acombustion 3afilters 3afluid mechanics 3amodels 3aprocess design 3asoot 3atemperature1 aDeng, Yangbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7194-07321 aYan, Tingting1 aLiu, Yang0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 July 20, v. 61, no. 30 p.10736-10746dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c012183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011500170300001600285500001500301520141000316592002801726650002101754650001501775650001201790650001501802650002901817650001701846650001301863650002401876650002101900650003301921650001801954650001201972650002001984650001002004650002502014650001002039651001302049653001902062653001102081700002502092700002602117700002502143700002502168773008902193856008102282852000902363655001202372IND60572835820221120152506.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057283582DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-016-9810-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdez, Zachary P.10aSoil Carbon and Nitrogen Responses to Nitrogen Fertilizer and Harvesting Rates in Switchgrass Cropping Systems  ap. 456-464.  a2019-12-06  aThe environmental sustainability of bioenergy cropping systems depends upon multiple factors such as crop selection, agricultural practices, and the management of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and water resources. Perennial grasses, such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), show potential as a sustainable bioenergy source due to high yields on marginal lands with low fertilizer inputs and an extensive root system that may increase sequestration of C and N in subsurface soil horizons. We quantified the C and N stocks in roots, free particulate, and mineral-associated soil organic matter pools in a 4-year-old switchgrass system following conversion from row crop agriculture at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station in southwest Michigan. Crops were fertilized with nitrogen at either 0, 84, or 196 kg N ha⁻¹ and harvested either once or twice annually. Twice-annual harvesting caused a reduction of C and N stocks in the relatively labile roots and free-particulate organic matter pools. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly reduced total soil organic C and N stocks, particularly in the stable, mineral-associated C and N pools at depths greater than 15 cm. The largest total belowground C stocks in biomass and soil occurred in unfertilized plots with annual harvesting. These findings suggest that fertilization in switchgrass agriculture moderates the sequestration potential of the soil C pool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aharvesting 3agrasses 3aperennials 3arenewable energy sources 3aroot systems 3anitrogen 3asoil organic carbon 3acropping systems 3aenvironmental sustainability 3asoil horizons 3abiomass 3awater resources 3aroots 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acrops 3aMichigan 0aorganic matter 0acarbon1 aHockaday, William C.1 aMasiello, Caroline A.1 aGallagher, Morgan E.1 aPhilip Robertson, G.0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.456-464dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-016-9810-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012900168520138800297592002801685650003501713650002401748650001101772650001701783650002001800650001401820650001701834650002101851650001901872650001501891653002301906653003301929653002501962653004901987653001902036700001602055700001902071700001402090700002002104773009202124856008602216852000902302655001202311IND60701491920221118011553.0201118e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070149192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1213552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, An-Qi12aA fluorescence imaging protocol for correlating intracellular free cationic copper to the total uptaken copper by live cells  aA variety of fluorescence probes have been developed for fluorescence imaging of metals in biological cells. However, accurate quantification of metals with fluorescent approaches is challenging due to the difficulty in establishing a standard calibration curve in living cells. Herein, a fluorescence imaging protocol is developed for imaging intracellular Cu²⁺ and its correlation with the cellular uptake of copper. The total amount of intracellular Cu is detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in parallel. Fluorescence imaging of Cu²⁺ is accomplished with Rhodamine B derivative modified carbon dots (CDs-Rbh) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from CDs to rhodamine. Intracellular Cu²⁺ is correlated with fluorescence ratio at λₑₘ 500–600 nm (rhodamine) to λₑₘ 425–475 nm (CDs) with excitation at λₑₓ 405 nm. It is found that Cu²⁺ is linearly correlated with the total intracellular uptaken copper content, with a linear correlation between the relative fluorescence ratio in fluorescence imaging and intracellular Cu derived from ICP-MS, including both Cu(I) and Cu(II) species. The linear calibration equation is lg(F₂/F₁) = 0.00148 m[Cu]-0.3622. This approach facilitates further investigation and elucidation of copper transition in live cells and the evaluation of their cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon quantum dots 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy transfer 3aequations 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3arhodamines 0aIntracellular Cu2+ 0aIntracellular uptaken copper 0aFluorescence imaging 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aQuantification1 aHao, Ya-Nan1 aGuo, Ting-Ting1 aShu, Yang1 aWang, Jian-hua,0 tTalanta.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 220 p.121355-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1213553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005800172300001400230520098700244592002801231650001701259650001801276650001201294650000901306650001401315650001001329650001101339653000801350653000801358653002201366653001401388653001401402653002501416700002101441773010101462856008601563852000901649655001201658IND60581533920221118132730.0190318e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058153392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGauteplass, Asle10aConflict and cooperation in an age structured fishery  ap. 35-45.  aThe literature on ‘fish wars', where agents engage in non-cooperative exploitation of single fish stocks or interacting fish stocks is well established, but age and stage structured models do not seem to have been handled within this literature. In this paper we study a game where two agents, or fishing fleets, compete for the same fish stock, which is divided into two harvestable age classes. The situation modelled here may be representative for many fisheries, such as the Norwegian North Atlantic cod fishery where the coastal fleet targets old mature fish while the trawler fleet targets young mature fish. We analyze the game under different assumptions about the underlying information available to each fleet and the actions of the agents. The outcomes of the games are compared to the optimal cooperative solution. The paper provides several results, which differ in many respects from what are found in biomass models. The analysis is supported by numerical examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGadus morhua 3aage structure 3abiomass 3afish 3afisheries 3agames 3amodels 0aQ22 0aQ58 0aFishery economics 0aAge model 0aConflicts 0aOptimal exploitation1 aSkonhoft, Anders0 tFisheries research.g2018 July, v. 203 p.35-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245017600156300001800332520125600350592002801606650002701634650001601661650002501677650000901702650001401711650002301725650001301748650001601761650001501777650001401792700001801806700002901824700001401853700001601867700001601883773009901899856007301998852000902071655001202080IND50090268020221122212114.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009026802DNAL7 a10.1111/are.120682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yongxin10aEffect of replacing dietary fish meal with silkworm (Bombyx mori L) caterpillar meal on growth and non‐specific immunity of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka)  ap. 1246-1252.  aThe effect of dietary substitution of silkworm (Bombyx mori L) meal (SM) for fishmeal (FM) on the growth performance and non‐specific immunity of sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) (initial weight: 12.8 ± 0.16 g) was determined. Four isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets were formulated: Diet 1, which served as the control diet, contained 5% FM; Diet 2 contained 3.75% FM and 1.25% SM; Diet 3 contained 2.5% FM and 2.5% SM; and Diet 4 contained 5% SM. Other ingredients in each of the four diets were kept in the same proportion. After 8 weeks of feeding, the results showed that sea cucumbers fed Diet 2 had 18.7% increases in weight over those fed the control diet, but no significant difference was observed. No obvious difference in body wall composition was detected among the sea cucumbers fed the four different diets. Immunity analysis indicated that phagocytosis and serum alkaline phosphatase activity were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected when FM was partially or completely replaced with SM. Serum lysozyme activity of sea cucumbers fed Diet 4 showed a significant (P < 0.05) growth increase compared with those fed control diet. The results revealed that SM could be an effective substitute for FM in sea cucumber diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aBombyx mori 3aalkaline phosphatase 3adiet 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3aimmunity 3aingredients 3aintegument 3asilkworms1 aChang, Alan K1 aWeingartner, Fredric F.,1 aLi, Yajie1 aDu, Xingfan1 aLi, Shuying0 tAquaculture research.g2014 June, v. 45, no. 7 p.1246-1252dBlackwell Sciencex1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.120683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245006400177300001600241520131800257592002801575650002401603650002701627650000901654650001301663650001401676650001701690650001101707650001101718650001301729650002501742650001101767650002501778650001901803653002701822653001701849653002201866653001801888700001801906700002201924773010301946856008602049852000902135655001202144IND60581534020221118132451.0200601e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058153402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpurgeon, Jonathan J.10aMixed-origins of channel catfish in a large-river tributary  ap. 195-202.  aAn understanding of factors responsible for population structure including the origins of individuals from among habitats is fundamental to conservation and management of large-river fishes. The prevalence of population mixing of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus was evaluated within a large-river tributary environment using information from recent environmental history and natal origin derived from otolith microchemistry. Trace elements in water and otoliths were assessed using univariate and multivariate statistical approaches. Water and otolith trace elements differed among river segments facilitating classification of channel catfish to the river segment of capture. Accuracy of the classification tree model for juvenile channel catfish ranged from 44% to 88%. Recent environmental and natal origin microchemistry signatures suggested the channel catfish population within a large-river tributary comprises individuals from multiple locations. Population demographics of channel catfish is likely influenced by mixing of individuals from across the riverine-network. Consideration of the importance of connectivity between main-stem and tributary systems may, therefore, benefit conservation and management of channel catfish and other large-river fishes displaying similar life-history strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIctalurus punctatus 3ademographic statistics 3afish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amixing 3amodels 3aotoliths 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3astatistical analysis 3atrace elements 0aOtolith microchemistry 0aConnectivity 0aPopulation mixing 0aRiver network1 aPegg, Mark A.1 aHalden, Norman M.0 tFisheries research.g2018 Feb., v. 198 p.195-202dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010700160300002000267520119900287592002801486650001501514650001301529650002201542650001201564650001701576650001601593650001601609650001501625700001801640700001501658700001401673700001601687700001701703700002101720700001801741700001701759700001401776700001901790700001601809700001601825773014401841856007401985852000902059655001202068IND60642618920221118022812.0190507e20170822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064261892DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ta05366e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Jahangeer10aLow-temperature-processed SnO₂–Cl for efficient PbS quantum-dot solar cells via defect passivation  ap. 17240-17247.  aColloidal quantum dots (CQDs) exhibit extraordinary features due to their bandgap tunability and solution processing. Instead of the ZnO layer usually used as the electron transport layer (ETL) in CQD heterojunction devices, we developed, for the first time, tin dioxide (SnO₂) as the ETL in colloidal quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs). Its wider bandgap and higher electron mobility, as well as appropriate band alignment with PbS QDs, could favor light absorption and photocarrier extraction. Our low-temperature processed SnO₂ film could retain chlorine atoms (SnO₂–Cl) to achieve interface passivation in QDSCs. Utilizing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII) as the absorber ligand, our superior device obtained a power conversion efficiency of 9.37%, which was 44% higher than that of a control device. Physical characterizations revealed that this remarkable improvement could be ascribed to the chlorine passivation of the SnO₂/QD interface contact and to the EMII ligand passivation effect on the QD surface. Our newly developed ETL, along with an efficient interface passivation technique, is expected to enhance the performance of full solution-processed colloidal QDSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achlorine 3aelectron transfer 3aligands 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells 3atin dioxide 3azinc oxide1 aYang, Xiaokun1 aQiao, Keke1 aDeng, Hui1 aZhang, Jian1 aLiu, Zhiyong1 aAḥmad, Vaqār,1 aZhang, Jihong1 aLi, Dengbing1 aLiu, Huan1 aSong, Haisheng1 aCheng, Chun1 aTang, Jiang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Aug. 22, v. 5, no. 33 p.17240-17247dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ta05366e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002600169245008100195300001700276520074700293592002801040650001501068650001601083650001701099650001401116650001101130650002201141650001101163650001701174650001301191650001701204650001401221650002001235650002101255650001701276650001101293650004601304650003701350650003401387700002301421773009001444856008601534852000901620655001201629IND4465495820221123004012.0141111e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446549582DNAL7 a229538162pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.05.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosińska, Agnieszka,10aCocoa polyphenols are absorbed in Caco-2 cell model of intestinal epithelium  ap. 999-1005.  aCocoa is an abundant source of polyphenols, mainly flavan-3-ol monomers and polymers.

Additionally, the results suggest that compounds of cocoa powder purified extract are able to affect tight junction functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acocoa beans 3acocoa powder 3aflavanols 3ahumans 3aintestinal mucosa 3amodels 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aprocyanidins 3asecretion 3atight junctions 2aCacaoxchemistry 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacokinetics 2aPolyphenolsxpharmacokinetics1 aAndlauer, Wilfried0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 135, no. 3 p.999-1005dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.05.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245012000170300001400290520108000304592002801384650002701412650001001439650001101449650002401460650001701484650001001501650001501511650000801526650001101534650001201545650000901557650001101566700002201577700002401599700002501623700002101648700001901669700001901688700002701707773009701734856008601831852000901917655001201926IND4447317520221121235324.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444731752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2010.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrutulyte, Rasa10aPerceived fit of different combinations of carriers and functional ingredients and its effect on purchase intention  ap. 11-16.  aScientific research that can support the consumer-oriented development of functional food products is still scarce. Up until now, only few studies have investigated consumer acceptance of different carrier–ingredient combinations in food products. The present study aims to identify which functional ingredients are accepted by consumers in selected food product categories such as yoghurt, muesli bars, fish balls, tuna salad, baby meals, rye bread and bacon liver pâté. Intentions to purchase different carrier–ingredient combinations are explained by perceived fit of a particular carrier–ingredient combination, as well as respondents’ general attitudes towards functional foods and their health concerns. A sample of Danish consumers (n=959) participated in a survey. Results show that perceived carrier–ingredient fit is strongly related to purchase intentions. In addition, small effects of attitudes towards functional food were found. Perceived carrier–ingredient fit was related to familiarity with the combination and healthiness of the carrier food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abacon 3abreads 3aconsumer acceptance 3ahealth foods 3aliver 3apurchasing 3arye 3asalads 3asurveys 3atuna 3ayogurt1 aGrunert, Klaus G.1 aScholderer, Joachim1 aLähteenmäki, Liisa1 aHagemann, Kit S.1 aElgaard, Peter1 aNielsen, Brian1 aGraverholt, Jens Peter0 tFood quality and preference.g2011 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.11-16dElsevier Ltdx0950-32937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2010.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01420naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010700159300001600266520041900282592002800701650002300729650002300752650002000775650002600795650001500821650002000836700001600856700002000872773013100892856007401023852000901097655001201106IND60638595420221122134630.0190430e20151223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063859542DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03245h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuckton, L.

At present these ‘trophic interaction modifications’ are rarely included in ecological models despite demonstrations that they can drive system dynamics. Here, we advocate and extend an approach that has the potential to unite and represent this key group of non‐trophic interactions by emphasising the change to trophic interactions induced by modifying species. We highlight the opportunities this approach brings in comparison to frameworks that coerce trophic interaction modifications into pairwise relationships. To establish common frames of reference and explore the value of the approach, we set out a range of metrics for the ‘strength’ of an interaction modification which incorporate increasing levels of contextual information about the system. Through demonstrations in three‐species model systems, we establish that these metrics capture complimentary aspects of interaction modifications. We show how the approach can be used in a range of empirical contexts; we identify as specific gaps in current understanding experiments with multiple levels of modifier species and the distributions of modifications in networks. The trophic interaction modification approach we propose can motivate and unite empirical and theoretical studies of system dynamics, providing a route to confront ecological complexity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aecosystems 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3atrophic relationships1 aMorris, Rebecca J.1 aBonsall, Michael B.0 tEcology letters.g2017 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1219-1230dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.128243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245010100204300001600305520139800321592002801719650002501747650001001772650002301782650001301805650001801818650001601836650000901852650000901861650001101870650002201881650001501903650001201918651001001930653002201940653002501962653002301987653001802010653002302028700001802051700001702069773010302086856008602189852000902275655001202284IND60537857020221123012407.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053785702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusa, Ala1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5075-564214aThe applicable density of sand-fixing shrub plantation in Horqin Sand Land of Northeastern China  ap. 250-254.  aCaragana microphylla is the dominant perennial shrubs and widely used to stabilize shifting sand dunes in semi-arid, north China. To confirm the influence of plantations on soil water condition, we determined the soil moisture and evapotranspiration under different densities of sand-fixing C. microphylla shrubs during growth period. Result showed that the soil moisture under shrubs continued decreasing with the increasing of plantations densities. Soil moisture under 0.5m×1m and 1m×2m densities of C. microphylla shrubs are under wilting humidity (1.55%) level, however, soil moisture under 2m×2m densities and savageness C. microphylla shrubs always keep above 1.6% during growth season. Evapotranspiration of all shrubs are low than rainfall and occupied above 90.3–98.5% of rainfall during growth phases, and continually increased with the increasing plant densities. The 0.5m×1m density shrubs have the highest evapotranspiration, about to 298.3mm (2009)/235.7mm (2008) and occupied above 98.5% (2009)/94.4% (2008) of rainfall at the same time. The 2m×2m density shrubs have the lowest evapotranspiration, about 283.4mm (2009)/230.7mm (2008), and soil moisture surplus 20.8mm (2009)/19.0mm (2008) at the end of growth season.

By increasing intermolecular interaction of silica precursor, peptides can induce the formation of biosilica usually under neutral and basic but not acidic conditions, and here, they are defined as silica-forming peptides (SFPs). In addition, the silica-forming capability of most putative SFPs has not been evaluated. To address both questions, we developed molecular descriptors to simulate and predict the silica-forming capabilities of SFPs under a wide range of pH values. We used van der Waals and electrostatic interactions as molecular descriptors to probe the physisorption between amino acid residues and proto-silicate. We then performed multiple-dimensional simulations using the canonical R5 peptide and three novel SFPs from the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme. Finally, we experimentally validated the silica-forming capability of the four SFPs at pH values from 4 to 8. Our results showed that the molecular descriptors provide accurate predictions on the adsorption of proto-silicate by SFPs. Thus, the method can be used to screen SFPs that are capable of inducing the formation of silica in a wide pH range more importantly including acidic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum fusiforme 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3achemical interactions 3amedicine 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apeptides 3aprediction 3asilica 3avan der Waals forces 3awastewater treatment 0aSilica forming peptide 0aMolecular descriptor 0aProto-silicate 0aAcidic condition1 aXu, Yi-Cheng1 aYang, Yun1 aLi, Nan1 aZou, Hui-Xi1 aWen, Hai-Hong1 aYan, Xiufeng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Nov. 20, v. 653 p.130030-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1300303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013100172300001300303520113900316592002801455650002501483650002001508650001301528650001201541650001901553650001201572650001301584650002501597650001101622650001201633650000901645650001401654650001401668650001101682650001401693650001101707650001001718650001301728650001001741650001401751650001301765650001101778650001101789650000801800650000901808651001101817653002001828653002001848653001301868653002901881653001701910653001901927700002001946700002001966700001701986700001702003773010002020856008602120852000902206655001202215IND60537857120221123012303.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053785712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalem, Zohra Ben10aMetal accumulation and distribution in the organs of Reeds and Cattails in a constructed treatment wetland (Etueffont, France)  ap. 1-17.  aConcentrations of trace elements were studied in roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves and flowers of cattails (Typha latifolia L.) and reeds (Phragmites australis L.) and in corresponding samples of water and sediment. Samples were taken from the inflow/outflow points in the fourth of four interconnecting lagooning ponds in constructed treatment wetlands, developed as an integrated pilot system for the treatment of leachates in a domestic landfill site at Etueffont (Territoire de Belfort, France). The elements considered were Ag, Al, As, B, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se, Sn and Zn. The highest average of above-ground water biomasses of Typha latifolia and Phragmites australis was recorded in fall with 0.85 and 1.13kg dry weight m−2 respectively. The greatest mean concentrations of metals were found during spring in roots and to a lesser extent in the rhizomes of the two species. T. latifolia and P. australis can be used as bioindicators of Al, As, Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr and Cd and more specifically of Ni and Zn for T. latifolia and of B for P. australis. These two species may be considered promising alternatives for bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aTypha latifolia 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abioremediation 3acadmium 3achromium 3aconstructed wetlands 3acopper 3aflowers 3airon 3alandfills 3aleachates 3aleaves 3amanganese 3anickel 3aponds 3arhizomes 3aroots 3asediments 3aselenium 3asilver 3aspring 3atin 3azinc 3aFrance 0aT. latifolia L. 0aP. australis L. 0aSediment 0aPotentially toxic metals 0aPlant organs 0aBioremediation1 aLaffray, Xavier1 aAshoour, Ahamed1 aAyadi, Habib1 aAleya, Lotfi0 tEcological engineering.g2014 Mar., v. 64 p.1-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2013.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245007600207300002000283520081600303592002801119653002401147653002601171653002501197653002201222653002601244700002001270700002001290773019401310856007901504852000901583655001201592IND60517964420221120155346.0160406e20151013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051796442DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15100711122doi7 aPMC46116722pmcid7 a263925362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBratulic, Sinisa10aMistranslation drives the evolution of robustness in TEM-1 β-lactamase  ap. 12758-12763.  aSignificance Translation is a fundamental biochemical process in which ribosomes use an mRNA’s nucleotide sequence as a template to synthesize a protein with a specific amino acid sequence. Errors in this process are deleterious because they can alter a protein’s structure. Yet such errors are surprisingly frequent. Here we ask whether and how evolution can affect the ability of proteins to cope with these errors. In principle, evolution could reduce the rate of such errors, or it could leave this rate unchanged but reduce the damaging effects of errors. We find that populations of proteins evolving in the laboratory pursue the second route, increasing their robustness to translation errors. Evolution may preferentially mitigate damage to a biological system than reduce the source of this damage.  aPublisher supplied data 0amolecular evolution 0amutational robustness 0aphenotypic mutations 0aprotein stability 0aantibiotic resistance1 aGerber, Florian1 aWagner, Andreas0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Oct. 13, v. 112, no. 41 p.12758-12763dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15100711123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169300001600322520129800338592002801636650001601664650001801680650001101698650001101709650001901720650001101739650002001750650003001770650000901800651001001809651001701819700001801836700002001854773009801874856008501972852000902057655001202066IND60563088920221118020433.0170211e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056308892DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2016.12783082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSravanthi, N.10aMerging gauge data and models with satellite data from multiple sources to aid the understanding of long-term trends in chlorophyll-a concentrations  ap. 419-428.  aSeveral studies have analysed the long-term trends of chlorophyll- a (chl- a) concentration and related its intensity to sea surface temperature (SST) and wind forcing. In this article, we present trends of chl- a concentrations for the period 1997–2016 derived from multi-merged satellite data and analysed the role of SST, wind mixing (WM) and surface incoming short wave flux (SISF) and river discharges in the distribution of chl- a in the coastal waters of southwest India. The results show decreasing trend of anomalies for chl- a . Chl- a shows negative trend, though not significant, with all other variables, i.e., WM, SISF and river discharge over the last two decades in the study area. Whereas, an increasing trend of SST has recorded for the region during the same period. Our results suggest that the warming of sea surface as observed from SST, decreased river input, weakening of winds and reduced solar radiation are among the most prominent reasons for decline in chl- a concentration for the study region. Further, the positive relation between chl- a with WM and SISF and negative correlation with SSTs suggest that these trends are driven by enhanced ocean stratification due to rapid warming in the Indian Ocean, which suppresses nutrient mixing from subsurface layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3amixing 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3asurface water temperature 3awind 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean1 aAli, P.

Climate governs pedogenesis, yet how climate modulates responses of soil food webs to soil ageing remains unexplored because of the paucity of appropriate model systems. We characterised soil food webs along each of four retrogressive soil chronosequences situated across a strong regional climate gradient to show that belowground communities are predominantly shaped by changes in fertility rather than climate. Basal consumers showed hump‐shaped responses to soil ageing, which were propagated to higher‐order consumers. There was a shift in dominance from bacterial to fungal energy channels with increasing soil age, while the root energy channel was most important in intermediate‐aged soils. Our study highlights the overarching importance of soil fertility in regulating soil food webs, and indicates that belowground food webs will respond more strongly to shifts in soil resources than climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage of soil 3achronosequences 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3afungi 3amodels 3asoil fertility 3asoil food webs 3asoil formation 3asoil resources1 aKardol, Paul1 aDidham, R.

During storage and processing, it is often affected by various factors to undergo interactions between components, which lead to its quality change. In this experiment, seed watermelon kernels were used as research objects, and the effects of 2′-Azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) on seed watermelon kernel protein isolates (WMP) were investigated. The structure and digestion characteristics of WMP after oxidation were studied. The results showed that with the increase of AAPH concentration (0.05−5 mol/L), WMP showed obvious aggregation, and its solubility decreased from 6.76 mg/mL to 9.59 mg/mL. The free sulfhydryl content of WMP was 18.24 mmol/g decreased to 11.25 mmol/g, α-helix decreased and β-sheet decreased in secondary structure, and its disulfide bond increased by 43.06 mmol/g from 39.57 mmol/g, enthalpy (ΔH) and denaturation temperature increased (Td) (P < 0.05). By mass spectrometry results of simulated gastric digestion products, it was found that oxidation adversely affected the digestion characteristics of WMP. It can be seen that the lipid oxidation product APPH of seed watermelon kernel can significantly affect the structure and function of the protein extracted from the seed kernel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus 3adenaturation 3adigestion 3adisulfide bonds 3aenthalpy 3alipid peroxidation 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aprotein content 3aprotein isolates 3aseeds 3asolubility 3atemperature 3awatermelons 0aSeed watermelon kernel protein 0aDigestion characteristics 0aAAPH oxidation1 aLi, Zhihao1 aLi, Xiuting1 aWang, Ping1 aYu, Xiongwei1 aFu, Qinli1 aGao, Sihai0 tFood science and human wellness.g2020 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.402-410dElsevier B.V.aKeAi Communications Co.

Globally, rapid land surface warming since the 1970s is reproduced by some models but others warm too slowly. In the tropics, air-sea coupling allows models to reproduce the Southern Oscillation but its strength varies between models. We find a strong relationship between the Southern Oscillation in global temperature and the rate of global warming, which could in principle be used to identify models with realistic climate sensitivity. This relationship and a weak response to ENSO suggests weak sensitivity to changes in sea surface temperature in some of the models used here. In the tropics, most models reproduce part of the observed Sahel drought. In the extratropics, models do not reproduce the observed increase in the North Atlantic Oscillation in response to forcings, through internal variability, or as a combination of both. 3aEl Nino 3aSahel 3aclimate models 3adrought 3aglobal warming 3asurface temperature 3atropics1 aKucharski, F.1 aFolland, C.

The uncultivated microbe was identified as a deeply branching member of the Deltaproteobacteria through phylogenetic analyses of two conserved genes: the 16S rRNA-encoding gene (rrs) and the β-subunit of topoisomerase (gyrB). Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that the rRNA gene sequence originated from bacteria with the tightly coiled morphology. Microscopy and PCR amplification with pathogen-specific primers confirmed infections by this bacterium in four species of DAPHNIA: Daphnia dentifera, D. magna, D. pulicaria, and D. retrocurva. Extensive field surveys reveal that this bacterium is widespread geographically and able to infect many different cladoceran species. In a survey of populations of D. dentifera in lakes in Michigan, we found the bacterium in 17 of 18 populations studied. In these populations, 0 to 12% of the individuals were infected, with an average of 3% during mid-summer and early autumn. Infections were less common in rock pool populations of D. magna in southern Finland, where the pathogen was found in 5 of 137 populations. The broad geographic distribution, wide host range, and high virulence of S. cienkowskii suggest it plays an important role in the ecology and evolution of daphniids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDaphnia 3aautumn 3abacteria 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3ahemolymph 3ahost range 3amicroscopy 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arocks 3asurveys 3avirulence 3aFinland1 aDuffy, Meghan A.1 aTessier, Alan J.1 aEbert, D.q(Dieter)1 aMouton, Laurence1 aSchmidt, Thomas M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Mar. 1, v. 74, no. 5 p.1575-1582dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02438-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03309naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245013600186300001600322520136900338650003001707650002401737650000901761650002901770650001301799650002001812650002101832650001401853650001601867650001101883650003401894650001401928650000701942650001401949650002201963650001501985650001102000650001502011650003502026650002502061650001802086650004502104650001802149650002202167650003802189650003902227653002402266653002002290653002302310700001402333700001702347700001802364700001602382773012802398852000902526856009202535930003302627946001102660655001202671IND4433793220221119115441.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443379322DNAL7 a201324342pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2010.02801.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFall, P.A.10aInhibition of Brochothrix thermosphacta and sensory improvement of tropical peeled cooked shrimp by Lactococcus piscium CNCM I-4031  ap. 357-361.  aTo investigate the antimicrobial spectrum of Lactococcus piscium CNCM I-4031 and its protective effect in cooked and peeled shrimp against Brochothrix thermosphacta. Sixteen pathogenic and spoiling bacteria were inhibited in Elliker, but not in shrimp juice agar plates. In shrimp packed under modified atmosphere and stored at 8°C, B. thermosphacta (10³ CFU g⁻¹) was inhibited by 4·1 log CFU g⁻¹ when co-inoculated with L. piscium (10⁶ CFU g⁻¹). Brochothrix thermosphacta spoiled the product after 11 days, with the emission of strong butter/caramel off-odours. In co-culture with L. piscium, sensory shelf-life was extended by at least 10 days. The inhibition was partially explained by a drop in pH from 6·6 to 5·6. The physicochemical composition of shrimp and shrimp juice was established to identify the inhibition mechanisms involved. Lactococcus piscium CNCM I-4031 has a wide antimicrobial spectrum. The strain inhibits B. thermosphacta in shrimp and significantly prolongs sensory shelf-life. Lactococcus piscium CNCM I-4031 is shown to be a promising agent for improving shrimp quality and may be tested against pathogens and in other food matrices. Knowledge of the physicochemical composition of shrimp and shrimp juice will allow the development of a chemically defined model medium for determining the inhibition mechanisms involved. 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aLactococcus piscium 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiopreservation 3abiopreservatives 3acoculture 3afood matrix 3ajuices 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoff odors 3apH 3apathogens 3aprotective effect 3ashelf life 3ashrimp 2aAntibiosis 2aBacteriaxgrowth & development 2aCoculture Techniques 2aCulture Media 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aLactococcusxgrowth & development 2aShellfishxanalysisxmicrobiology. 0ainhibition spectrum 0aPenaeus vanamei 0ashrimp composition1 aLeroi, F.1 aCardinal, M.1 aChevalier, F.1 aPilet, M.F.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2010 Apr., v. 50, no. 4 p.357-361dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2010.02801.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02783naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245014100192300001600333520085000349650002701199650003001226650001201256650002601268650002101294650001101315650006101326650005401387650003901441650002601480650003101506650004901537650003201586651002501618653001401643653004601657653001601703653001601719700002101735700002001756700001901776700002401795700002301819700002401842700001901866700001801885700002401903773014501927852000902072856009202081930003302173946001102206655001202217IND4438000620221119115041.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443800062DNAL7 a204874282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02548.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasiye, Frank L.10aSensitivity and specificity of the Leishmania OligoC-TesT and NASBA-oligochromatography for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in Kenya  ap. 806-810.  aTo estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the OligoC-TesT and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification coupled to oligochromatography (NASBA-OC) for molecular detection of Leishmania in blood from patients with confirmed visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and healthy endemic controls from Kenya.

In transformed cells, TGF-β1 enhances the capacity to degrade the extracellular matrix, cell invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are crucial steps for metastasis. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are critical components in cell migration and invasion induced by TGF-β1, however, the exact mechanism by which TGF-β1 regulates uPA and MMP-9 is not well elucidated so far. In the present study, we analyzed the role of ROS-NFκΒ, signal as mediator in the cell malignity enhancement by TGF-β1. We found that TGF-β1 activates NFκΒ, through Rac1-NOXs-ROS-dependent mechanism. Our results shows that TGF-β1 stimulation of uPA and MMP-9 expression involve NOXs-dependent ROS and NFκΒ, activation, demonstrated by using DPI, NOXs inhibitor, ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine and SN50, an NFkb inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of ROS and NFκΒ, abrogates TGF-β1 stimulation of EMT, cell motility and invasion. Thus, ROS-NFκΒ acts as the crucial signal in TGF-β1-induced uPA and MMP-9 expression thereby mediating the enhancement of cellular malignity by TGF-β1. 0aTGF-β 0aNFκΒ 0auPA 0aMMP-9 0aEMT 0aMigration 0aInvasion1 aVillar, Victor 1 aSantibanez, Juan F. 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2010 July, v. 340, no. 1-2 p.195-202dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0418-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03157naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012500182300001600307520109000323650002201413650001401435650005201449650004601501650003801547650001201585650002801597650002901625650004701654650003001701650001201731650001501743650005001758650001501808650002001823650006001843650004401903650002101947650000901968650001701977650001801994650002902012653001702041653001502058653000802073653001102081700001402092700001702106700001902123700001502142700001602157700001802173700001602191700001702207700001502224773011802239852000902357856008502366930003302451946001102484655001202495IND4438810720221119115227.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443881072DNAL7 a202321142pmid7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0425-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Zhiming 10aSSeCKS promote beta-amyloid-induced PC12 cells neurotoxicity by up-regulating tau phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease  ap. 257-263.  aIn Alzheimer's disease, Beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) could induce tau hyperphosphorylation which is the major cause of neuron apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms in the process remain unclear. In this study, Aβ-induced apoptosis and tau phosphorylation were investigated in differentiated PC12 cells. This Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation paralleled with the increase of expression and phosphorylation of Src-suppressed protein kinase C substrate (SSeCKS). By knocking down the expression of SSeCKS, Aβ-induced apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation in PC12 cells were partially rescued, and were increased further due to the overexpression of SSeCKS in PC12 cells. Also, the cell apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation were strongly decreased when the cells were pretreated with the protein kinase C inhibitor, Gö6983. In addition, Aβ-induced tau phosphorylation was also partially decreased due to the overexpression of SSeCKS in PC12cells. In summary, our data indicate that SSeCKS may play a critical role in Aβ-induced PC12 cells apoptosis through its phosphorylation. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aapoptosis 2aA Kinase Anchor Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlzheimer Diseasexmetabolismxpathology. 2aAmyloid beta-Peptidesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCarbazolesxpharmacology 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aIndoles 2aMaleimides 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aPC12 Cells 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Kinase Cxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRNA Interference 2aRats 2aTransfection 2aUp-Regulation 2atau Proteinsxmetabolism 0aBeta-amyloid 0aPC12 cells 0aTau 0aSSeCKS1 aTao, Tao 1 aCheng, Chun 1 aYang, Junling 1 aShen, Qin 1 aJi, Yuhong 1 aLi, Xiaohong 1 aLiu, Haiou 1 aShen, Aiguo 1 aLu, Xiang 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2010 July, v. 340, no. 1-2 p.257-263dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0425-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03011naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006800130300001600198500002400214520184300238650001902081650001102100650001902111650001202130650002202142650001802164650001202182650001302194650001602207650002302223650001102246650002002257650000902277650001702286650001602303650001202319650001602331650001702347651001402364700002302378700002302401700002102424700001802445773006902463852000902532655001202541IND4457464820221119115310.0110502s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445746482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKjelgren, Roger10aTropical Street Trees and Climate Uncertainty in Southeast Asia  ap. 167-172.  aIncludes references  aUrban trees are a critical quality of life element in rapidly growing cities in tropical climates. Tropical trees are found in a wide variety of habitats governed largely by the presence and duration of monsoonal dry periods. Tropical cities can serve as a proxy for climate change impacts of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), urban heat island, and drought-prone root zones on successful urban trees. Understanding the native habitats of species successful as tropical urban trees can yield insights into the potential climate impact on those habitats. Species from equatorial and montane wet forests where drought stress is not a limiting factor are not used as urban trees in cities with monsoonal dry climates such as Bangkok and Bangalore. Absence of trees from a wet habitat in tropical cities in monsoonal climates is consistent with model and empirical studies suggesting wet evergreen species are vulnerable to projected climates changes such as lower rainfall and increased temperatures. However, monsoonal dry forest species appear to have wider environmental tolerances and are successful urban trees in cities with equatorial wet climates such as Singapore as well as cities with monsoonal climates such as Bangkok and Bangalore. In cities with monsoonal dry climates, deciduous tree species are more common than dry evergreen species. Although dry deciduous species generally have better floral displays, their prevalence may in part be the result of greater tolerance of urban heat islands and drought in cities; this would be consistent with modeled habitat gains at the expense of dry evergreen species in native forest stands under projected higher temperatures from climate change. Ecological models may also point to selection of more heat- and drought-tolerant species for tropical cities under projected climate change. 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aforest stands 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aheat island 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3aquality of life 3arain 3astreet trees 3atemperature 3atropics 3auncertainty 3awater stress 3aSingapore1 aYongyut Traisurat.1 aPuangchit, Ladawan1 aBaguinon, Nestor1 aYok, Puay Tan0 tHortScience.g2011 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.167-172x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04230naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002800110245010000138300001600238500002400254520316200278650002203440650001403462650002603476650001403502650001403516650001103530650001303541650001103554650001603565650002603581650002103607650001203628650001003640651001203650700001903662700002503681700001803706700001803724773006903742852000903811655001203820IND4457465120221119115302.0110502s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445746512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelak, Gabriela Vuletin10aReproductive Success after Self-pollination and Cross-pollination of Olive Cultivars in Croatia  ap. 186-191.  aIncludes references  aOlive orchard productivity largely depends on the choice of planted cultivars and their pollination needs. Orchard designs in Croatia are changing because a number of valuable foreign olive cultivars, mostly Italian, have been introduced in this region in the last 30 years. The compatibility relationships of introduced cultivars with autochthonous cultivars are unknown. With the objective of studying reproductive behavior of the most important Croatian cultivars (Drobnica, Lastovka, Levantinka, and Oblica) and their cross-pollination to recently introduced Italian cultivars Leccino and Pendolino, initial and final fruit set in self-pollination versus cross-pollination and free pollination were compared during three flowering seasons. Experiments were conducted in three different orchards (Kastela, Mravince, and Brac) to identify the effect of the environment on reproductive behavior of olive cultivars. The differences of fruit set in five olive cultivars after tested pollination treatments appeared at the time of initial fruit set. Increased final fruit set under cross-pollinations was observed when compared with self-pollination for all olive cultivars in all experimental orchards. In the Mravince orchard, a positive response to cross-pollination was consistent, and fruit set increased under cross-pollination in all cultivars and years with the exception of ‘Levantinka’ in which no significant differences were noticed between self-pollination treatment and cross-pollination treatments in 2005. Variable self-fertility behavior from season to season was found for tested cultivars. A self-incompatibility index (ISI) higher than 0.1 was recorded for ‘Levantinka’ in all experimental years and, therefore, classified it as a partially self-incompatible cultivar. Self-incompatibility response was observed for ‘Lastovka’. The positive response to cross-pollination over self-pollination only in some experimental years classified ‘Drobnica’, ‘Leccino’, and ‘Oblica’ as partially self-incompatible. Results obtained from this study indicated that pollination efficiency is strictly combination-specific. The Italian cultivar, Leccino, was a successful pollen acceptor and pollenizer of most Croatian cultivars. Reciprocal high success in cross-pollination was recorded for ‘Levantinka’ and ‘Oblica’. In the Mravince orchard, ‘Lastovka’, ‘Leccino’, and ‘Oblica’ were efficient pollenizers of ‘Levantinka’ where the simultaneous flowering period was in accordance with their cross-compatibility. ‘Levantinka’ was a good pollenizer for ‘Lastovka’ in the Mravince orchard, and both cultivars entered into the flowering period earlier than other studied cultivars, which was not the case in the other two orchards. The variations in flowering timing among orchards were a consequence of differences in environmental conditions. According to the high fruit sets recorded in ‘Oblica’ after pollination with ‘Leccino’ or ‘Levantinka’, an increase in tree productivity of the acceptor cultivar is expected in the presence of selected pollenizers in all olive-growing regions. 3across pollination 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3afruit set 3aolives 3aorchards 3apollen 3apollinators 3areproductive behavior 3aself-pollination 3aselfing 3atrees 3aCroatia1 aPerica, Slavko1 aBan, Smiljana Goreta1 aRadunic, Mira1 aPoljak, Milan0 tHortScience.g2011 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.186-191x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245009700178300001600275520065500291650002300946650001100969650001100980650001900991650000901010650000901019650001401028650001601042650001501058650002301073650001201096650001101108650001101119650003101130650001101161650002701172650000901199650002101208650002001229650003701249650003801286650001501324653002201339653001501361653002101376700001801397700001701415700001401432700001801446700001701464700001801481773011301499852000901612856008501621930003301706946001101739655001201750IND4436728020221119115107.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443672802DNAL7 a202135252pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-010-0232-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Song 10aBovine prolactin promotes the expression of human transferrin in the milk of transgenic mice  ap. 787-793.  aThe bovine prolactin vector was injected directly into the mammary glands of mice carrying the human transferrin transgene to investigate its effect on the production of human transferrin in milk.

Some individually-tagged fish repeatedly occurred in the ladder. A total of 1640 fish represented captures of 595 S. trutta in the fish ladder; 247 fish were caught once and 348 individuals were caught repeatedly. Repeatedly-caught (348) individuals represented 1393 (84.9%) of the 1640 captures. The likelihood of repetitive occurrence decreased with the increase in fish body length. The number of individuals in the ladder was inversely related to temperature, and positively correlated with increasing water flow in the main channel. Fish abundance in the ladder was density-dependent, as the number of individuals was inversely related to fish size and time of residency in the ladder. Spawning migrations were not the best predictor of maximum fish occurrence in the ladder, suggesting that repetitive capture of individuals in the ladder was significantly affected by other factors influencing fish behaviour. Repetitive fish occurrence in ladders can be expected, particularly in rivers with numerous lateral obstructions. 3aSalmo trutta 3abody length 3afish 3afish ladders 3aladders 3arivers 3aspawning 3atemperature 3awater flow 3aCzech Republic1 aBartoš, L.1 aHorký, P.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2009 Feb., v. 25, no. 1 p.67-72dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2008.01164.x 7aarticle02672naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012500145300001600270500001500286520128600301650001001587650001701597650001501614650001901629650001301648650001401661650001201675650004501687650002501732650004101757650002501798650001101823650002901834650001601863650002901879650004101908650002201949650001701971653001801988700001602006700001702022773007102039852000902110930003302119945001302152946001302165655001202178IND2047797920221119115509.0950918e199505  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204779792DNAL7 a76597812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstill, C.T.10aDoes increased PGF2 alpha-receptor concentration mediate PGF2 alpha-induced luteolysis during early diestrus in the pig?  ap. 255-267.  a2019-12-05  aThe mechanism by which multiple injections of PGF2alpha result in premature luteolysis in pigs is unknown. In the present study we evaluated whether PGF2alpha receptor concentrations on large luteal cells changed when gilts were injected IM with 12.5 mg of PGF2alpha every 12 hours from the morning of day 5 of an estrous cycle (estrus = day 0) until ovariectomy on day 6, 7, 8, or 9. Luteal PGF2alpha receptor concentrations remained constant from day 6 through 9 in the PGF2alpha-treated group, but increased linearly (P > 0.05) in control gilts from day 6 to 9. Receptor affinity for PGF2alpha did not change throughout the study in either PGF2alpha-treated or control gilts. Luteal progesterone concentrations were significantly lower in PGF2alpha-treated gilts than in control gilts only on day 9. Histological examination of luteal tissue obtained from PGF2alpha-treated gilts revealed definite evidence of luteolysis by day 8. We conclude that PGF2alpha-induced premature luteolysis is not mediated by an increase in luteal PGF2alpha receptor concentrations and, based on luteal progesterone concentrations and histological features, that the PGF2alpha-based protocol used to shorten the estrous cycle is accompanied by premature functional and structural luteal regression. 3agilts 3aluteal cells 3aluteolysis 3aprostaglandins 3adiestrus 3areceptors 2aAnimals 2aCorpus Luteumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDiestrusxphysiology 2aDinoprostxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEstrusxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aLuteolysisxdrug effects 2aOvariectomy 2aProgesteronexmetabolism 2aReceptors, Prostaglandinxphysiology 2aSwinexphysiology 2aTime Factors 0acorpus luteum1 aBritt, J.H.1 aGadsby, J.E.0 tProstaglandins.g1995 May, v. 49, no. 5 p.255-267x0090-69807nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03632naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245009600172300001800268500002400286520203900310650001602349650001102365650001402376650002702390650002102417650001102438650002902449650002602478650002202504650001802526650001902544650001602563650001702579650001502596650005002611650001102661650001102672650002702683650002402710650003002734650003802764650001602802700002402818700001702842700001702859700002302876773010502899852000903004856007703013655001203090IND4460452620221119115408.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446045262DNAL7 a215345452pmid7 a10.1021/jf200943n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaas, Nina10aStructural Profiling and Quantification of Sphingomyelin in Human Breast Milk by HPLC-MS/MS  ap. 6018-6024.  aIncludes references  aThe sphingolipid composition of food as well as of physiological samples has received considerable interest due to their positive biological activities. This study quantified the total amount of sphingomyelin (SM) in 20 human breast milk samples from healthy volunteers and determined the structures of SM by detailed mass spectrometric studies in combination with enzymatic cleavage. The quantification of SM was performed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) measuring the characteristic fragment ion of the phosphorylcholine group at m/z 184.2 and by using hexanoylsphingomyelin (C6-SM) and heptadecanoylsphingomyelin (C17-SM) as internal standards. The structures of SM species were identified after enzymatic cleavage with alkaline sphingomyelinase (SMase) to the corresponding ceramides. Structure elucidation of the sphingoid base and fatty acid backbone was performed by reversed-phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The method includes the sphingoid bases dihydrosphingosine (d18:0), sphingosine (d18:1(Δ4)), 4,8-sphingadienine (d18:2(Δ4,8)), 4-hydroxysphinganine (phytosphingosine (t18:0)), and 4-hydroxy-8-sphingenine (t18:1(Δ8)) and fatty acids with even-numbered carbon atoms (C12–C26) as well as their (poly)unsaturated and monohydroxylated analogues. The total amount of SM in human breast milk varied from 3.87 to 9.07 mg/100 g fresh weight. Sphingosine (d18:1) was the predominant sphingoid base, with 83.6 ± 3.5% in human breast milk, followed by 4,8-sphingadienine (d18:2) (7.2 ± 1.9%) and 4-hydroxysphinganine (t18:0) (5.7 ± 0.7%). The main SM species contained sphingosine and palmitic acid (14.9 ± 2.2%), stearic acid (12.7 ± 1.5%), docosanoic acid (16.2 ± 3.6%), and tetracosenoic acid (15.0 ± 3.1%). Interestingly, the fatty acid composition of SM species in this study differs from the total fatty acids in human breast milk, and the fatty acids are not consistently distributed among the different sphingoid bases. 3abreast milk 3acarbon 3aceramides 3afatty acid composition 3afood composition 3ahumans 3ahydrophilic interactions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apalmitic acid 3asphingomyelins 3asphingosine 3astearic acid 3avolunteers 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aMolecular Structure 2aSphingomyelinsxchemistry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aYoung Adult1 aSchuurmann, Claudia1 aBartke, Nana1 aStahl, Bernd1 aHumpf, Hans-Ulrich0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.6018-6024x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200943n3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02465naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245012300175300001800298500002400316520101600340650002201356650003801378650003001416650001101446650002601457650001001483650001101493650001201504650001001516650001101526650000701537650001301544650001901557650001201576650002701588650002801615650002401643650005001667651001601717700001601733700001701749700001401766773010501780852000901885856007701894655001201971IND4460454520221119115257.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446045452DNAL7 a215393952pmid7 a10.1021/jf201009t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lingzhao10aExtraction of Proteins with Low Fluoride Level from Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba) and Their Composition Analysis  ap. 6108-6112.  aIncludes references  aThe extraction of proteins with low fluoride level (LFP) from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was investigated in this work. The optimal conditions for protein solubilization were determined to be pH 11.5 and 4 °C. The proteins were solubilized two times; a water/krill ratio (mL/g) of 6 and a time of 30 min were used for the first step, whereas the second used a water/krill residue ratio (mL/g) of 3 and a time of 30 min. The optimum pH for protein precipitation was 4.6. A LFP with fluoride content of 9.86 mg/kg (dry weight) was finally obtained through a fluoride removal program. The protein yield of LFP was 52.68%. Composition analysis of LFP indicated it was composed of 66.96% of crude proteins (dry weight) and 33.01% of total lipids (dry weight),, and all nine essential amino acids were in sufficient amounts to meet FAO/WHO/UNU requirements for adults and infants. In addition, LFP could be taken as a good source of EPA and DHA for consideration of use as a food item for human consumption. 3aEuphausia superba 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3aessential amino acids 3afoods 3ahumans 3ainfants 3akrill 3alipids 3apH 3aproteins 3asolubilization 2aAnimals 2aChemical Fractionation 2aEuphausiaceaxchemistry 2aFluoridesxanalysis 2aProteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 0aAntarctica.1 aXue Changhu1 aWang, Yuming1 aYang, Bao0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.6108-6112x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf201009t3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02983naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002700156245010000183300001800283500002400301520154700325650002301872650001001895650001301905650001201918650001701930650002101947650000701968650001801975650001401993650001502007650001302022650001202035650002902047650001102076650001102087650003102098650001302129650003002142650002802172650002002200700002102220700002202241700002302263773010502286852000902391856007702400655001202477IND4460458520221119115332.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446045852DNAL7 a215575782pmid7 a10.1021/jf10471732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibardi, Silvia Helena10aDeactivation of Ferrylmyoglobin by Vanillin as Affected by Vanillin Binding to β-Lactoglobulin  ap. 6202-6208.  aIncludes references  aVanillin was found to be efficient as a deactivator of ferrylmyoglobin with a second-order rate constant of k2 = 57 ± 1 L mol–1 s–1 for reduction to metmyoglobin with ΔH = 58.3 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1 and ΔS = −14 ± 1 J mol–1 K–1 in aqueous pH 7.4 solution at 25 °C. Binding to β-lactoglobulin (βLG) was found to affect the reactivity of vanillin at 25 °C only slightly to k2 = 48 ± 2 L mol–1 s–1 (ΔH = 68.4 ± 0.4 kJ mol–1 and ΔS = 17 ± 1 J mol–1 K–1) for deactivation of ferrylmyoglobin. Binding of vanillin to βLG was found to have a binding stoichiometry vanillin/βLG > 10 with KA = 6 × 102 L mol–1 and an apparent total ΔH° of approximately −38 kJ mol–1 and ΔS° = −55.4 ± 4 J mol–1 K–1 at 25 °C and ΔCp, obs = −1.02 kJ mol–1 K–1 indicative of increasing ordering in the complex, as determined by isothermal titration microcalorimetry. From tryptophan fluorescence quenching for βLG by vanillin, approximately one vanillin was found to bind to each βLG far stronger with KA = 5 × 104 L mol–1 and a ΔH° = −10.2 kJ mol–1 and ΔS° = 55 J mol–1 K–1 at 25 °C. The kinetic entropy/enthalpy compensation effect seen for vanillin reactivity by binding to βLG is concluded to relate to the weakly bound vanillin oriented through hydrogen bonds on the βLG surface with the phenolic group pointing toward the solvent, in effect making both ΔH and ΔS more positive. The more strongly bound vanillin capable of tryptophan quenching in the βLG calyx seems less or nonreactive. 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acalyx 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3apH 3astoichiometry 3atitration 3atryptophan 3avanillin 2aAnimals 2aBenzaldehydesxchemistry 2aCattle 2aHorses 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLactoglobulinsxchemistry 2aMetmyoglobinxchemistry 2aProtein Binding1 aBorges, Julio C.1 aSkibsted, Leif H.1 aCardoso, Daniel R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.6202-6208x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf10471733Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02261naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245010900148300001600257500001500273520071600288650001001004650002301014650002001037650002701057650001601084650001801100650002901118650002201147650002401169650005301193650003001246650001701276650004701293651001101340651001101351651001801362653001501380653001401395653001801409700001701427700001801444700001701462700001301479700001601492700001501508700001701523700001401540773010001554852000901654939003301663946001101696655001201707IND9201578820221119115208.0920320e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920157882DNAL7 a19095442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarburton, D.W.12aA comparative study of the 'FDA' and 'USDA' methods for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in foods  ap. 105-117.  a2019-12-04  aNineteen laboratories across Canada took part in a comparative study of the 'FDA' and 'USDA' methods for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in foods and environmental samples. The results show that the enrichment period of the FDA method can be shortened from 7 to 2 days without substantially reducing the number of positive samples. With a limited number of samples, the USDA method proved to be slightly more efficient in isolating L. monocytogenes than the FDA method. Fraser broth, in principle, proved to be useful as a screening tool but is not very selective. Oxford agar and lithium chloride-phenylethanol-moxalactam medium were better than modified McBride's agar in isolating this microorganism. 3afoods 3afood contamination 3aselective media 3aListeria monocytogenes 2aAgriculture 2aCulture Media 2aFalse Positive Reactions 2aFood Microbiology 2aGovernment Agencies 2aListeria monocytogenesxisolation & purification 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aTime Factors 2aUnited States Food and Drug Administration 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aUnited States 0aenrichment 0aisolation 0aculture media1 aFarber, J.M.1 aArmstrong, A.1 aCaldeira, R.1 aHunt, T.1 aMessier, S.1 aPlante, R.1 aTiwari, N.P.1 aVinet, J.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g1991 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.105-117x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02608naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245016100175300001800336500002400354520097100378650002501349650001101374650001801385650001401403650001101417650001701428650001601445650001001461650001201471650002301483650002301506650002701529650002801556650002701584650004401611650004401655650002201699650002901721650004401750650001701794700002001811700002001831700002801851700002001879773010501899852000902004856007702013655001202090IND4460457820221119115209.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446045782DNAL7 a215486012pmid7 a10.1021/jf201013k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKevers, Claire10aInfluence of Cultivar, Harvest Time, Storage Conditions, and Peeling on the Antioxidant Capacity and Phenolic and Ascorbic Acid Contents of Apples and Pears  ap. 6165-6171.  aIncludes references  aApple and pear fruits are important sources of secondary plant metabolites and one of the major sources of dietary phenolics consumed all year round. The aim of this work was to identify the main variables influencing phenolic content and antioxidant capacity in apples. Higher phenolic and antioxidant contents were observed in some varieties (such as the Delbar Estival apple and Durondeau pear). Storage conditions were important. Our results also showed that fruits should be consumed rapidly after purchase and with their peel. After one week of domestic storage, the ascorbic acid content was found to decrease by 75%. Peeling led to a more than 25% decrease in total phenolics and ascorbic acid. The harvest time (at normal ripeness) had only a limited impact, but significant year-to-year variations were observed. In conclusion, well-chosen and well-stored apples and pears may contribute to an antioxidant-rich diet if consumed rapidly and with their peel. 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3afruits 3aharvest date 3ametabolites 3apears 3apeeling 3aphenolic compounds 3astorage conditions 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aAscorbic Acidxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFruitxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aMalusxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Extractsxanalysis 2aPyrusxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aTime Factors1 aPincemail, Joel1 aTabart, Jessica1 aDefraigne, Jean-Olivier1 aDommes, Jacques0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.6165-6171x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf201013k3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02930naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002800169245015100197300001800348500002400366520092600390650002201316650001601338650001101354650001201365650001501377650001601392650001101408650001701419650001101436650001601447650002201463650002101485650002701506650002401533650002701557650002101584650003501605650004101640650002301681650002901704650002301733650002301756650003301779650002101812650002901833650003301862650005001895700001801945700002001963700002201983700002902005700002402034700002102058700002102079700001902100773009902119852000902218856005302227655001202280IND4439981820221119115221.0100716e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443998182DNAL7 a205985252pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChundawat, Shishir P.S.10aMultifaceted characterization of cell wall decomposition products formed during ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) and dilute acid based pretreatments  ap. 8429-8438.  aIncludes references  aDecomposition products formed/released during ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) and dilute acid (DA) pretreatment of corn stover (CS) were quantified using robust mass spectrometry based analytical platforms.

After ammonolysis, Maillard reactions with carbonyl-containing intermediates represent the second largest sink for ammonia during AFEX. On the other hand, several carboxylic acids were formed (e.g. 35mg acetic acid/g DA CS) during DA pretreatment. Formation of furans was 36-fold lower for AFEX compared to DA treatment; while carboxylic acids (e.g. lactic and succinic acids) yield was 100-1000-fold lower during AFEX compared to previous reports using sodium hydroxide as pretreatment reagent. 3aMaillard reaction 3aacetic acid 3aamides 3aammonia 3acell walls 3acorn stover 3aesters 3afermentation 3afurans 3alactic acid 3amass spectrometry 3asodium hydroxide 2aAlkaliesxpharmacology 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCarboxylic Acidsxpharmacology 2aCell Wallxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFuransxmetabolism 2aHydrolysisxdrug effects 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aOligosaccharidesxmetabolism 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aSolubilityxdrug effects 2aSulfuric Acidsxpharmacology 2aZea maysxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aVismeh, Ramin1 aSharma, Lekh N.1 aHumpula, James F.1 ada Costa Sousa, Leonardo1 aChambliss, C.

For such an aim, the initial concentrations of the major components (water, total lipids, protein, and PUFAs) and minor pro-oxidant and antioxidant components (ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, hemoglobin, total iron, LMW-iron, copper, and zinc) of different batches of mackerel were characterized. For the study, several batches of mackerel were caught during the spring and summer periods. The different batches were subjected to chilled storage, and the onset of lipid oxidation was statistically related with the initial muscle composition. Results showed significant compositional differences among the mackerel lots, especially for the muscle lipid content (2.83–9.50%). In a first step, a Pearson correlation test was used to check the influence of each component on the progress of lipid oxidation. Results showed a significant relationship between shelf life and water and total lipid contents. Multiple regression was performed to reveal the contribution of each component to the susceptibility to lipid oxidation. The model obtained combines the content of PUFAs, total iron, hemoglobin, and ascorbic acid. An accurate prediction of shelf life in terms of rancidity was achieved by the model created (R2 = 0.9975). These results establish that the levels of endogenous pro-oxidants and antioxidants present in fish muscle together with the polyunsaturated lipids are relevant factors affecting the shelf life of mackerel muscle. 3aScomber scombrus 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acold storage 3acopper 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3alipid content 3alipid peroxidation 3amackerel 3amodels 3amuscle development 3apelagic fish 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprediction 3arancidity 3ashelf life 3aspring 3asummer 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aFood Handling 2aHumans 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMusclesxchemistry 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPerciformes 2aTaste1 aPazos, Manuel1 aMedina, Isabel0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.6284-6291x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200686z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02163naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011700133300001600250500002400266500001500290520110700305650001801412650001001430650001101440650001401451650001201465650001601477650002001493650001001513650001501523650001801538650001301556650001401569650001301583651001501596700002301611700002201634700001901656773006901675852000901744655001201753IND4457467520221119115536.0110502s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445746752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavenport, Joan R.10aSpatial and Temporal Distribution of Bromide as a Nitrate Tracer in Deficit, Drip-irrigated Wine Grape Vineyards  ap. 291-295.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aUnderstanding water and nutrient movement in arid climate-regulated deficit, drip-irrigated vineyards is imperative for understanding grape vine canopy management. However, little research has been conducted in these environments to aid in the understanding of where the vine accesses nutrients and/or soil water and how that translates into soil and/or plant tissue sampling approaches. We used bromide (Br) as a tracer to study nitrate movement in soils as well as into grape leaves in two ‘Merlot’ vineyards in central Washington State. Bromide movement closely followed water movement. Although Br was detectable in grape petioles, it was not detectable in leaf blades, likely as a result of a dilution factor related to the amount of tissue. Relationships between soil Br and soil moisture as well as petiole and soil Br concentrations suggests that soil sampling for nitrate should be taken from a diagonal position between the vine and the emitter, between 20 and 60 cm from the drip line. This is consistent with the recommendation for soil moisture sampling in a published companion study. 3aplant tissues 3avines 3acanopy 3avineyards 3abromine 3awine grapes 3amicroirrigation 3aVitis 3asoil water 3asoil sampling 3apetioles 3anutrients 3anitrates 0aWashington1 aStevens, Robert G.1 aWhitley, Kelly M.1 aWinkler, Tanya0 tHortScience.g2011 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.291-295x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245015100187300001600338520133200354650002401686650002101710650001601731650002101747650000901768650001001777650002101787650001201808650001901820650002001839650001201859650001301871650002101884650001701905650001401922650002201936650001201958650004601970650001802016650004502034650003202079650002802111650001302139650003802152650003002190650003002220650002402250650004502274650006302319650006102382653001502443653001402458700002502472773012002497852000902617856008502626930003302711946001102744655001202755IND4438812620221119113747.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443881262DNAL7 a204803602pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-010-0582-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahiya, Indervesh 14aThe UvrY response regulator of the BarA-UvrY two-component system contributes to Yersinia ruckeri infection of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 541-547.  aTo identify virulence-associated genes of a fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri, we screened a total of 1056 mini-Tn5-Km2 signature-tagged mutants in rainbow trout by immersion challenge. Of 1056, 25 mutants were found survival-defective as they could not be re-isolated from fish kidney 7 days after infection. Mutated gene in F2-4 mutant, one of the 25 mutants, was homologous to uvrY that encodes UvrY response regulator of BarA-UvrY two-component system (TCS). Mutant F2-4 was significantly more sensitive (P < 0.05) to H₂O₂-mediated killing and was less able to infect Epithelioma papulosum cyprini cells. However, UvrY mutation did not affect survival of F2-4 mutant in the presence of non-immune fish serum and its ability to grow under iron starvation. In a time-course co-infection, mutant F2-4 had lower bacterial loads on day 1 itself, and by day 5 there was nearly a 1,000-fold difference in infection levels of the parent and mutant strains. The barA homolog of Y. ruckeri was PCR-amplified and sequence analyses identified four domains that were characteristic of hybrid histidine kinases. To conclude, the BarA-UvrY TCS contributes to the pathogenesis of Y. ruckeri in its natural host rainbow trout, possibly by regulating invasion of epithelial cells and sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by immune cells. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aYersinia ruckeri 3ablood serum 3aepithelial cells 3afish 3agenes 3ahistidine kinase 3akidneys 3amicrobial load 3amixed infection 3amutants 3amutation 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aFish Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aHydrogen Peroxidextoxicity 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOncorhynchus mykissxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Kinasesxgenetics 2aVirulencexgenetics 2aVirulence Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aYersinia Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aYersinia ruckerixdrug effectsxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0aY. ruckeri 0aBarA-UvrY1 aStevenson, R.

These allelic forms were defined according to the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) found in the leader intron 5′ splice site (G to T), exon 6 (A to C) and exon 10 (C to T). The combination of these three SNPs accounted for 89.2% of the variation in apparent amylose content in a pedigree of 85 US rice varieties and 93.8% of the variation among 279 accessions in a European germplasm collection. The allelic forms TAC and TCC were found in low amylose varieties. All varieties with intermediate levels of apparent amylose had the GCC allele. High levels of apparent amylose varieties had either the GAT and GAC allele. The sequence AGTTATA in the intron 1 distinguished the low amylose varieties from the other classes regardless of any other base changes. Intermediate amylose varieties can be distinguished from those with high apparent amylose by changes in either exon 6 or exon 10. However the simplest interpretation of the data is that the tyrosine/serine change in exon 6 is responsible for the lower levels of Granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) protein and thus lower levels of amylose in intermediate vs. high amylose verities. 3aamylose 3agenes 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3apedigree 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astarch synthase 3atyrosine 3aUnited States1 aAyres, Nicolas1 aWalker, Grace1 aPark, Williams D.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 3 p.450-456dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.07.0103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03159naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245019100173300001800364500002400382520150000406650001601906650001401922650002001936650002001956650001701976650002301993650001402016650002202030650001102052650001402063650005302077650005402130650001502184650007402199650001402273650004002287650003902327700001102366700001702377700001702394700001902411700001602430700001602446773010502462852000902567856007702576655001202653IND4460450820221119113639.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446045082DNAL7 a215209502pmid7 a10.1021/jf104873g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiu-Ying12aA Novel Synchronous Fluorescence Spectroscopic Approach for the Rapid Determination of Three Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Tea with Simple Microwave-Assisted Pretreatment of Sample  ap. 5899-5905.  aIncludes references  aMany polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are carcinogenic, and some have been reported to be present in tea. People can be exposed to PAHs through tea consumption. Therefore, there is real importance for the determination of PAHs in tea. Because of the complex matrix of tea, it is hard to detect PAHs in tea without cleanup and chromatographic separation procedures. In this research, for the first time, a novel synchronous fluorescence spectroscopic approach coupling nonlinear variable-angle synchronous and matrix-isopotential synchronous scanning modes has been developed for the rapid determination of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF), and anthracene (AN) in tea with simple microwave-assisted pretreatment of samples. This novel technique is able to resolve the spectra of the three PAHs well, even with interference from other EPA PAHs. The detection limits for BaP, BkF, and AN in tea were 0.18–0.28, 0.55–0.89, and 0.64–3.58 μg/kg, respectively, depending on various teas, with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 77.1 to 116%. The relative standard deviations achieved for BaP, BkF, and AN were 1.5, 6.6, and 8.5% for green tea; 2.9, 7.4, and 2.1% for oolong tea; and 5.6, 5.4, and 5.8% for black tea, respectively. Our results showed good correlation with those of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The approach developed is simple, reliable, and cost-efficient, providing an attractive alternative for the rapid selective screening of PAHs in tea. 3aanthracenes 3ablack tea 3acarcinogenicity 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3agas chromatography 3agreen tea 3amass spectrometry 3apeople 3ascreening 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistryxradiation effects. 2aChemical Fractionationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMicrowaves 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aRadiation 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescencexmethods 2aTeaxchemistryxradiation effects.1 aLi, Na1 aLuo, He-Dong1 aLin, Li-Rong1 aZou, Zhe-Xiang1 aJia, Yu-Zhu1 aLi, Yao-Qun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.5899-5905x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104873g3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03134naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012700128300001400255500002400269520196700293650002802260650002202288650002402310650001302334650001202347650001402359650001002373650001202383650001302395650001602408650002102424650002302445650001202468650001102480650001402491650001402505650003002519650001402549650002002563650001002583700001902593773006702612852000902679655001202688IND4457457220221119113551.0110501s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445745722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbrecht, Ute10aTolerance of the Trifoliate Citrus Hybrid US-897 (Citrus reticulata Blanco x Poncirus trifoliata L. Raf.) to Huanglongbing  ap. 16-22.  aIncludes references  aHuanglongbing (HLB) is a destructive disease of citrus in most citrus-producing countries worldwide. The disease, presumably caused by phloem-limited bacteria of the genus Candidatus Liberibacter, affects all known citrus species and citrus relatives with little known resistance. Typical disease symptoms are the production of abnormal-looking fruit and chlorosis or blotchy mottle of the leaves followed at advanced stages by tree decline and death. Trifoliate orange (P. trifoliata L. Raf.) and some of its hybrids reportedly lack distinct disease symptoms despite infection with the pathogen. US-897 is a hybrid of trifoliate orange and ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin (C. reticulata Blanco), the latter being highly susceptible to HLB. This study investigated whether field-grown, naturally infected trees and greenhouse-grown, graft-inoculated seedlings of this genotype display tolerance or resistance to HLB. It was shown that naturally infected US-897 trees exhibited no distinct disease symptoms commonly associated with HLB, except for the occurrence of few mottled leaves in a small percentage of trees. Analysis of fruit and seed from infected trees did not detect any growth reduction or otherwise negative impact on development. Graft-inoculated US-897 seedlings became polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive for the pathogen but exhibited a superior performance compared with ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin seedlings, which displayed severe disease symptoms soon after inoculation. Despite infection, most US-897 seedlings did not develop leaf symptoms typical for HLB. Foliar symptoms observed in a small number of plants at later stages of the disease were faint and difficult to discern. Contrary to ‘Cleopatra’ seedlings, growth in stem diameter was only moderately reduced or unaffected in infected US-897 seedlings. The superior performance of US-897 plants in greenhouse and field locations suggest tolerance of this genotype to Ca. L. asiaticus. 3aCandidatus Liberibacter 3aCitrus reticulata 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3abacteria 3acalcium 3achlorosis 3adeath 3adecline 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3agreening disease 3agrowth retardation 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3amandarins 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3astem elongation 3atrees1 aBowman, Kim D.0 tHortScience.g2011 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.16-22x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01724naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011200127300001400239500002400253520083500277650002001112650001101132650001901143650001101162650001101173650002601184650002101210650001101231650001801242700001701260700001701277700001601294773006701310852000901377655001201386IND4457457420110526000000.0110501s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445745742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Xue-Min10aWater Relation Parameters of the Cortex Tissue of Fresh ‘Fuji’ Apple Fruit Determined by Centrifugation  ap. 30-34.  aIncludes references  aThis experiment was carried out to obtain a pressure–volume (P-V) curve and Höfler diagram of the cortex tissue of fresh ‘Fuji’ apple fruit (Malus xdomestica Borkh.) with a novel centrifuge method. Based on the P-V curve and Höfler diagram, several water relation parameters of cortex tissue were determined and the interrelationship of these parameters was established. Turgor loss point (TLP) occurred at –1.74 MPa and 73.7% of relative water content (R*). At full hydration, osmotic potential (psi(S)) was –1.30 MPa and symplastic water accounted for 86.8% of R*. Bulk elastic modulus decreased linearly by 28% as pressure potential declined from 1.30 MPa at full hydration to zero at the TLP.

Leaf tissues were dried by sun, oven-dried at 40 °C, or oven-dried at 70 °C and extracted using 80% methanol or 80% ethanol. Total polyphenol (TPP) using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method and antioxidant capacity using the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay were determined. Both drying and extraction conditions significantly impacted TPP content and TEAC in the three herb species. Sun-dried or 40 °C oven-dried herbs exhibited significantly higher TPP content and TEAC capacity than fresh samples, suggesting low-temperature drying may be a good postharvest means to store medicinal/culinary herbs. Exposure to 70 °C oven-drying caused significant antioxidant loss. In addition, the current study showed that with fresh tissue, 80% ethanol extraction had significantly higher TPP and TEAC than 80% methanol extraction for all three herbs, yet for dried herbs, the efficacy of ethanol/methanol extraction varied with different drying treatments. 3aLeonurus cardiaca 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aanalgesics 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adried herbs 3aethanol 3ahealth promotion 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amethanol 3arosemary 3asolar drying1 aWetzstein, Hazel Y.0 tHortScience.g2011 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.70-73x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245007200132300001400204500002400218520190600242650002602148650001502174650002002189650002502209650001302234650001202247650001102259650001402270650001302284650001802297650001102315650002002326650001702346650001102363650003002374650001002404650002002414650002102434650001202455650002402467650002602491650001102517650001802528700001802546700001702564700002302581773006702604852000902671655001202680IND4457457120221119113818.0110501s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445745712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoeckli, Sibylle10aAssociation between Herbivore Resistance and Fruit Quality in Apple  ap. 12-15.  aIncludes references  aEnhanced fruit quality, plant health, and productivity are major objectives in apple breeding. The undesirable fruit quality traits frequently associated with pest- and disease-resistant cultivars may be related to resource allocation tradeoffs. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between insect resistance and fruit quality in apple. The studied 'Fiesta' x ‘Discovery' apple progeny was characterized by reasonable fruit firmness and optimal sugar content and acidity but small fruit size. There was a positive correlation between codling moth (Cydia pomonella) fruit infestation and fruit firmness. Additionally, a positive correlation was detected between shoot infestation by green apple aphid (Aphis pomi), fruit number as well as sugar content. Infestation by the apple leaf miner moth (Lyonetia clerkella), the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea), the leaf-curling aphid (Dysaphis cf. devecta), and the apple rust mite (Aculus schlechtendali) was not significantly related to fruit quality traits. The positive relationship of increased infestation by some pest insects and quality-determining fruit characteristics such as firmness or sugar content points to a possibly increased necessity for plant protection measures in apple cultivars producing high-quality fruits. One possible explanation of higher pest infestation in cultivars producing fruits with high quality is a tradeoff between resource allocation to defensive secondary metabolites or to fruit quality. By identifying a relationship between pest infestation and fruit quality, the present study highlights the need to consider pest resistance when breeding for high-quality apple cultivars. The use of genetic markers for fruit quality and pest resistance in marker-assisted breeding may facilitate the combined consideration of fruit quality and pest resistance in apple breeding programs. 3aAculus schlechtendali 3aAphis pomi 3aCydia pomonella 3aDysaphis plantaginea 3aLyonetia 3aacidity 3aapples 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3amarker-assisted selection 3amoths 3apest resistance 3aplant protection 3aprogeny 3aresource allocation 3asecondary metabolites 3ashoots 3asugar content1 aMody, Karsten1 aDorn, Silvia1 aKellerhals, Markus0 tHortScience.g2011 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.12-15x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245011700197300001800314500002400332500001500356506007600371520117800447506003701625650002901662650002301691650002001714650001801734650001201752650001701764650002401781650002101805650002401826650003401850650001401884650001901898650001001917650000901927650002201936650002801958650002201986650001102008650001102019650000902030650003802039650001602077653000902093700001902102700002502121700002002146773010302166852000902269856007702278655001202355IND4457392020221207112735.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445739202DNAL7 a214115062pmid7 aPMC31145102pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-12212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, Nico S.10aVegetarian Dietary Patterns Are Associated With a Lower Risk of Metabolic Syndrome: The Adventist Health Study 2  ap. 1225-1227.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The study objective was to compare dietary patterns in their relationship with metabolic risk factors (MRFs) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 773 subjects (mean age 60 years) from the Adventist Health Study 2 was performed. Dietary pattern was derived from a food frequency questionnaire and classified as vegetarian (35%), semi-vegetarian (16%), and nonvegetarian (49%). ANCOVA was used to determine associations between dietary pattern and MRFs (HDL, triglycerides, glucose, blood pressure, and waist circumference) while controlling for relevant cofactors. Logistic regression was used in calculating odds ratios (ORs) for MetS. RESULTS: A vegetarian dietary pattern was associated with significantly lower means for all MRFs except HDL (P for trend < 0.001 for those factors) and a lower risk of having MetS (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.64, P < 0.001) when compared with a nonvegetarian dietary pattern. CONCLUSIONS: A vegetarian dietary pattern is associated with a more favorable profile of MRFs and a lower risk of MetS. The relationship persists after adjusting for lifestyle and demographic factors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ametabolic syndrome 3avegetarian diet 3aeating habits 3aglucose 3arisk factors 3aregression analysis 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference 3afood frequency questionnaires 3alifestyle 3ablood pressure 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet, Vegetarian. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexepidemiology. 2aMiddle Aged 0arisk1 aSabaté, Joan.1 aJaceldo-Siegl, Karen1 aFraser, Gary E.0 tDiabetes care.g2011 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.1225-1227dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-12213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02921naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002200119024001900141040001800160100001900178245004200197300001800239500002400257506007600281520137800357506003701735650002001772650001301792650001401805650001701819650002301836650001901859650001001878650002201888650002101910650001301931650002801944650001701972650001201989650004302001650001402044650001702058650001202075650001302087650001402100650001702114650001602131650001602147700001602163773011402179852000902293856007702302655001202379IND4457396220221207112750.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445739622DNAL7 a10.2337/dc11-s2232doi7 aPMC36321902pmcid7 a215254662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCernea, Simona10aTherapy in the Early Stage: Incretins  ap.

Two types of incretin-based therapies are now in use: incretin mimetics (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists that bind specific receptors and mimic the action of natural GLP-1) and incretin enhancers (inhibitors of the enzyme that degrade the incretin hormones and thus prolong their activity). Both offer important advantages over previous agents. In addition to the proven glucose-lowering efficacy, they promote weight loss (or are weight neutral) by slowing gastric emptying and inducing satiety, inhibit glucagon secretion with maintenance of counterregulatory mechanisms, and exhibit cardiovascular benefits, while having a low risk profile. Importantly, short-term studies have shown that incretins/incretin-based therapies protect β-cells (by enhancing cell proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis) and stimulate their function (by recruiting β-cells to the secretory process and increasing insulin biosynthesis/secretion). These therapies have the opportunity to interfere with the disease progression if used as an early intervention, when enough β-cell mass/function can still be preserved or restored.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3acell proliferation 3adisease course 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agastric emptying 3aglucagon 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3areceptors 3arisk profile 3asatiety 3asecretin 3asecretion 3atherapeutics 3aweight gain 3aweight loss1 aRaz, Itamar0 tDiabetes care.g2011 May, v. 34, no.

Pikeperch disappeared from the lake and bleak and white bream decreased to low numbers. The recovery of the populations of other species started immediately when strong year-classes of roach and perch appeared in summer 2003 and onwards. A sharp increase in the growth of perch and roach was recorded, and perch became the dominant fish species during 2004-2006. Consequent responses after the fish kill included increased Secchi depth, expansion of submerged macrophytes, decreased nutrient concentrations and reduction of Cyanophyta from the more eutrophic northern basin of the lake, and a temporary increase in the size of Daphnia in the early summer 2003. However, the ecosystem of the lake returned gradually to the earlier structure and level of eutrophication. Bluegreen algae have returned since 2005, the water has become more turbid, macrophytes declined in 2007 and the fish community was again dominated by small cyprinid fishes in 2008. 3amacrophytes 3anutrient content 3aBlicca bjoerkna 3afish kills 3aDaphnia 3alakes 3awatersheds 3aperch 3asummer 3aeutrophication 3aecosystems 3aCyanobacteria 3aoxygen 3atrophic relationships 3aFinland 0aAlgae1 aRask, M.1 aVesala, S.1 aWestermark, A.1 aOlin, M.1 aKeskitalo, J.1 aLehtovaara, A.0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 June, v. 646, no. 1 p.145-158dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0186-y 7aarticle02646naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245016700128300001400295500002400309500001500333520149100348650001501839650002601854650001001880650002301890650002501913650001801938650001801956650001401974650001901988650001602007650002402023650001502047653001902062700002302081700001702104700002002121700001902141773006702160852000902227655001202236IND4457457920221119113700.0110501s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445745792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jinquan10aAssessment of Yellow-fleshed Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis ‘Hort16A’) Quality in Pre- and Post-harvest Conditions Using a Portable Near-infrared Spectrometer  ap. 57-63.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aDry matter content (DM), soluble solids content (SSC), and flesh hue (FH) are important quality attributes of yellow-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis 'Hort16A'). Rapid non-destructive measurement tools enable effective assessment of quality attributes in the field or in packhouses and offer the potential for selective harvesting and differential postharvest treatments. This study investigates a few practical issues for use of one such tool, a portable near-infrared spectrometer, the FANTEC FQA-NIRGUN. Experimental results indicated that the precision of the NIRGUN in predicting the DM, SSC and FH of 'Hort16A' kiwifruit, given as the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC), is 0.6%, 0.9% and 1.4°, respectively, and is similar to that reported for standard laboratory benchtop spectrometers. These levels of precision are good enough to distinguish differences in fruit quality between fruit from different vines. However, this is only possible when measurements are carried out under similar conditions either within a short period of time in the field when fruit temperature is stable or in a temperature-controlled laboratory. The calibration developed on one instrument could be transferred to another instrument, but bias correction is necessary after the calibration transfer. Hence, the absolute accuracy of predictions from the NIRGUN is limited by significant and variable bias offset issues, particularly for field measurements when fruit are on the vine. 3aharvesting 3apostharvest treatment 3avines 3adry matter content 3atotal soluble solids 3aspectrometers 3afruit quality 3akiwifruit 3apacking houses 3atemperature 3aActinidia chinensis 3aprediction 0asoluble solids1 aMcGlone, Andrew V.1 aCurrie, Mike1 aClark, Chris J.1 aJordan, Bob R.0 tHortScience.g2011 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.57-63x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245010400171300001800275500002400293520114800317650001001465650001501475650001601490650002301506650002301529650001701552650003701569650001301606650001301619650000901632650001901641650002601660650001801686650003201704650001201736650004701748650002901795650003701824650002001861650003401881650001101915650003101926650006501957650003302022650000902055650002502064700001402089700001702103700001902120700001402139700001802153700002102171773010502192852000902297856007702306655001202383IND4460460520221119113902.0110729s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446046052DNAL7 a215240542pmid7 a10.1021/jf200424k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qun-Yi10aGinsenoside Rb1 Inhibits Proliferation and Inflammatory Responses in Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells  ap. 6312-6318.  aIncludes references  aGinsenoside Rb1, a known phytoestrogen, is a major pharmacologically active component in ginseng. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rb1 on fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-evoked inflammatory responses in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The data showed that Rb1 potently inhibited VSMC proliferation and cell growth induced by 5% FBS. These inhibitory effects were associated with G1 cell cycle arrest and down-regulation of cell cycle proteins. Treatment with Rb1 reduced FBS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Furthermore, TNF-α-evoked inflammatory responses were inhibited by Rb1. Reporter gene assay indicated that Rb1 could transactivate ERβ especially. Moreover, Rb1-mediated inhibition of VSMCs proliferation was greatly blocked by transfection of ERβ siRNA. These results suggest that Rb1 inhibits FBS-induced proliferation and TNF-α-evoked inflammatory responses in VSMCs. The findings presented here highlight the possible therapeutic use of Rb1 in cardiovascular disease. 3aPanax 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3afetal bovine serum 3ainflammation 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyocytes 3anecrosis 3arats 3areporter genes 3asmall interfering RNA 3asmooth muscle 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aAortaxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGinsenosidesxpharmacology 2aMyocytes, Smooth Musclexcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aChen, Li.1 aFu, Wen-Huan1 aLi, Zhong-Dong1 aWang, Bin1 aShi, Xiao-Jin1 aZhong, Ming-Kang0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 June 8, v. 59, no. 11 p.6312-6318x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf200424k3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03331naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245010200179300002000281500002400301520159200325650001601917650002001933650001101953650001201964650002001976650001301996650001402009650001102023650001302034650001102047650001202058650002402070650002702094650001602121650001202137650002302149650002802172650002202200650003602222650007902258700002602337700002802363700001602391700002402407700002102431700002502452700002302477700002202500700002602522773011902548852000902667856007702676655001202753IND4460636520221119113420.0110731s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446063652DNAL7 a213416662pmid7 a10.1021/jf104385d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersen, Wendy C.10aBioaccumulation of Melamine in Catfish Muscle Following Continuous, Low-Dose, Oral Administration  ap. 3111–3117.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, catfish muscle was analyzed for melamine (MEL) and cyanuric acid (CYA) residues following experimental feeding with low doses of MEL and MEL and CYA (MEL+CYA) and with the insoluble melamine−cyanurate complex (MEL=CYA). Catfish were daily fed 0.1 mg/kg BW of MEL for 15, 28, or 42 days, 0.1 mg/kg BW of MEL+CYA for 28 days, 2.5 mg/kg BW of MEL+CYA for 14 days, or 400 mg/kg BW of MEL=CYA for 3 days. Residues in the tissue were determined by LC-MS/MS. MEL was extracted with acidic acetonitrile, followed by defatting with dichloromethane, and isolated with cation exchange solid phase extraction (SPE). For CYA analysis, fish were extracted with dilute acetic acid, defatted with hexane, and cleaned up with a graphitic carbon SPE. Catfish fed 0.1 mg/kg BW of MEL reached a maximum muscle residue concentration of 0.33 ± 0.04 mg/kg (ppm) after 28 days of continuous feeding. The same concentration was found for MEL+CYA feeding at the 0.1 mg/kg BW level for 28 days. Feeding at 2.5 mg/kg BW of MEL+CYA yielded muscle concentrations above the 2.5 mg/kg level of concern for most of the study fish. Finally, catfish fed high levels of the MEL=CYA complex (400 mg/kg BW) accumulated relatively little MEL in the muscle (0.14 ± 0.07 mg/kg) and, unlike treatment with MEL+CYA, did not form renal melamine−cyanurate crystals. Appreciable concentrations of CYA were not detected in any of the muscles tested. These studies provide data to model the bioaccumulation of triazine residues into edible fish tissue as a result of the continuous consumption of adulterated feed. 3aacetic acid 3abioaccumulation 3acarbon 3acatfish 3acation exchange 3acrystals 3adefatting 3ahexane 3amelamine 3amodels 3amuscles 3aoral administration 3asolid phase extraction 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aFood Contamination 2aIctaluridaexmetabolism 2aKidneyxchemistry 2aMusclesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTriazinesxadministration & dosagexanalysisxchemistryxpharmacokinetics.1 aTurnipseed, Sherri B.1 aKarbiwnyk, Christine M.1 aEvans, Eric1 aHasbrouck, Nicholas1 aMayer, Tamara D.1 aGieseker, Charles M.1 aNochetto, Cristina1 aStine, Cynthia B.1 aReimschuessel, Renate0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.3111–3117-3111–3117x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104385d3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02942naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002200156245009700178300002000275500002400295520135200319650002001671650001501691650001901706650002601725650002201751650001401773650001001787650001701797650001001814650002701824650001101851650002701862650002401889650002201913650001101935650001501946650002801961650002801989650000902017650002202026650002602048650003902074650001902113700002302132700001802155700002202173773011902195852000902314856007702323655001202400IND4460636420221119113536.0110731s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446063642DNAL7 a213753032pmid7 a10.1021/jf104490z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonato, Barbara10aImmunochemical and Mass Spectrometry Detection of Residual Proteins in Gluten Fined Red Wine  ap. 3101–3110.  aIncludes references  aRecently, wheat gluten has been proposed as technological adjuvant in order to clarify wines. However, the possibility that residual gluten proteins remain in treated wines cannot be excluded, representing a hazard for wheat allergic or celiac disease patients. In this work, commercial wheat glutens, in both partially hydrolyzed (GBS-P51) and nonhydrolyzed (Gluvital 21000) forms, were used as fining agents in red wine at different concentrations. Beside immunoenzymatic analyses using anti-gliadin, anti-prolamin antibodies and pooled sera of wheat allergic patients, a method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry has been proposed to detect residues of gluten proteins. Residual gluten proteins were detected by anti-prolamin antibodies, anti-gliadin antibodies and sera-IgE only in the wine treated with GBS-P51 at concentration 50, 150, and 300 g/hL, respectively, whereas no residual proteins were detected by these systems in the wine treated with Gluvital 21000. In contrast liquid chromatography−mass spectrometry analyses allowed the detection of proteins in red wines fined down to 1 g/hL of Gluvital 21000 and GBS-P51. Our results indicate that MS methods are superior to immunochemical methods in detecting gluten proteins in wines and that adverse reactions against gluten treated wines cannot be excluded. 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3aceliac disease 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ared wines 3awheat 3awheat gluten 2aAdult 2aAntibodiesximmunology 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aGliadinximmunology 2aGlutensxanalysis 2aHumans 2aHydrolysis 2aImmunoenzyme Techniques 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aMale 2aMass Spectrometry 2aProlaminsximmunology 2aWheat Hypersensitivityximmunology 2aWinexanalysis1 aMainente, Federica1 aTolin, Serena1 aPasini, Gabriella0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.3101–3110-3101–3110x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104490z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03072naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245011100175300002000286500002400306520124700330650002101577650002501598650003101623650002301654650001501677650001001692650001101702650002001713650003201733650002501765650003601790650004301826650006801869650002401937650003701961650004001998650002102038650004102059651001002100651001002110700001802120700001602138700001402154700001202168700002302180700001502203700001702218700001402235700001302249700001502262773011902277852000902396856007702405655001202482IND4460635820221119113557.0110731s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446063582DNAL7 a213817492pmid7 a10.1021/jf105017j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hai-Feng10aBiflavonoids from Caper (Capparis spinosa L.) Fruits and Their Effects in Inhibiting NF-kappa B Activation  ap. 3060–3065.  aIncludes references  aCaper (Capparis spinosa L.) fruits have been widely used as food and folk medicine in the Mediterranean basin and in central and west Asia. In this study, two biflavonoids, isoginkgetin, and ginkgetin, together with three other flavonoids, were isolated from caper fruits. Their chemical structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses and comparison with literature. To our knowledge, isoginkgetin, ginkgetin and sakuranetin were identified in caper for the first time. Notably, it is also the first time that biflavonoids have ever been found in the Capparidaceae. Concentrations of the two biflavonoids were measured in caper fruits collected from four major growing areas in northwest China. The anti-inflammatory effects of the flavonoids from caper fruits were evaluated by secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter assay, which was designed to measure nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation. Isoginkgetin and ginkgetin showed inhibitory effects in initial screen at 20 μM, while the effect of ginkgetin was much greater than that of isoginkgetin. In a dose−response experiment, the IC50 value of ginkgetin was estimated at 7.5 μM, suggesting it could be a strong NF-κB inhibitor and worthy of study in vivo. 3aCapparis spinosa 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3achemical structure 3aflavonoids 3afoods 3afruits 3ain vivo studies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacology 2aBiflavonoidsxanalysisxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCapparisxchemistry 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFlavonoidsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aFruitxchemistry 2aNF-kappa Bxantagonists & inhibitors 3aChina 0aChina1 aXie, Chenghui1 aJian, Renji1 aKang, Jie1 aLi, Yan1 aZhuang, Chang-Long1 aYang, Fang1 aZhang, Le-Le1 aLai, Long1 aWu, Tong1 aWu, Xianli0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Apr. 13, v. 59, no. 7 p.3060–3065-3060–3065x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf105017j3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03070naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001900196245016300215300001800378500001500396520150400411650002201915650002401937650002401961650002601985650003402011650001902045650001302064650002402077650001902101650002602120653001702146653002302163653001302186700001602199700001802215700001702233700001502250700002002265700001402285773009002299852000902389856008502398930003302483945002502516946001102541655001202552IND4367474320221119113540.0050307e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436747432DNAL7 a10.1080/026520304000239112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Initial migrant concentration and specific migration  ap. 1203-1216.  a2019-12-04  aThe paper describes a project with the main objective of developing the know how to produce certified reference materials (CRMs) for specific migration testing. Certification parameters discussed are the initial concentration of the migrant in the polymer (C(P,0)) and the specific migration into a food simulant under certain temperature/time conditions. Sixteen preliminary candidate CRMs were defined and produced. The most important polymers (low- and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephtalate (PET), plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC), rigid PVC, polyamides (PA)) and additives as well as monomers representing different physicochemical properties as target substances for migration were chosen. The stability and homogeneity of the migrants in the materials were tested and methods for the determination of the certification parameters were developed and validated. >From the 16 materials produced, the six most suitable CRM candidates (LDPE//Irganox 1076/Irgafos 168, LDPE//1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene (DPBD), HDPE//Chimassorb 81/Uvitex OB, PP homo//Irganox 1076/Irgafos 168, HIPS, 1% mineral oil//styrene, PA 6//caprolactam) were selected. The feasibility of CRM production for the six candidate materials was demonstrated and a trial certification exercise was performed with participation of all four partner laboratories. All six materials showed suitable properties for future production as certified reference materials. 3achemical residues 3aconsumer protection 3apackaging materials 3aproduct certification 3apackaging materials migration 3afood packaging 3aplastics 3areference standards 3afood additives 3afood contact surfaces 0acontaminants 0afood contamination 0apolymers1 aStormer, A.1 aBradley, E.L.1 aBrandsch, R.1 aCooper, I.1 aLinssen, J.P.H.1 aFranz, R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1203-1216x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000239113Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02678naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245012700141300001600268520116800284650001401452650001701466650001601483650001301499650002601512650002701538650000901565650001001574650001201584650003001596650003401626650002701660650001101687650001301698650002001711650001601731650003401747650001501781650002001796650001101816651001001827651001001837653002601847653002701873653003001900700001201930700001801942773009601960852000902056930003302065945001302098946001302111655001202124IND2045603120221119113437.0950417e199502  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204560312DNAL7 a75403112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGamo, M.12aA method evaluating population risks from chemical exposure: a case study concerning prohibition of chlordane use in Japan  ap. 151-157.  aThe proposed method evaluating population risks from chemical exposure is based on estimation of the individual variabilities in the internal concentration of the chemical of concern and estimation of the magnitude of toxic effect caused at a given internal concentration. We assume a log-normal distribution for individual variability and propose loss of life expectancy (LLE) as a measure of the magnitude of toxic effects. We applied it to the evaluation of the governmental action of prohibiting the use of chlordane as a termiticide in Japan. Because the method is applicable to both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic chemicals, the cancer risk due to chlordane and the noncancer risk due to chlorpyrifos, a major substitute, were evaluated and compared. The estimated values of risk represented in terms of LLE are 0.10 days for residents of untreated houses, 1.9 days for residents of treated houses, and 4.4 days for termite control workers when chlordane is used, and 0, 2.8, and 31 days when chlorpyrifos is used, respectively. From the result of the case study, we can see that the prohibition of chlordane is not necessarily effective in reducing risk. 3achlordane 3achlorpyrifos 3acarcinogens 3atoxicity 3aquantitative analysis 3aenvironmental exposure 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aChlordanxadverse effects 2aChlorpyrifosxadverse effects 2aEnvironmental Exposure 2aHumans 2aInsecta. 2aLife Expectancy 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasmsxchemically induced 2aOdds Ratio 2aRisk Assessment 2aSafety 3aJapan 0aJapan 0arisk/benefit approach 0acarcinogenic compounds 0anoncarcinogenic compounds1 aOka, T.1 aNakanishi, J.0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g1995 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.151-157x0273-23007nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01920naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002800110245006800138300001800206500005900224520113700283650002201420700002901442700001201471773010301483852000901586930003301595945001301628946001301641655001201654IND2055915020221119113412.0970314e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205591502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmits-Van Prooije, A.E.10aEmbryotoxicity and teratogenicity study with erythritol in rats  ap.

Erythritol was fed at dietary concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10% to groups of 32 female rats from Day 0 to 21 of gestation. The treatment was generally well tolerated and no mortality occurred in any group. Weight gain during gestation, food consumption, and food efficiency were similar in all groups except for a significantly reduced weight gain in the 10% erythritol group in Week 2 of gestation. Reproductive performance was not affected by the treatment but the fertility index was generally rather low (69% in both control and high-dose group). Examination of the fetuses for external, visceral, and skeletal alterations did not reveal any fetotoxic, embryotoxic, or teratogenic effects. The slightly lower maternal body weight in the high-dose group was interpreted as a trivial result of the consumption of a low-calorie test substance in high amounts. In conclusion, no adverse effects were observed at erythritol doses of up to about 6.11 g/kg body wt/day, i.e., the highest dose tested. 3asugar substitutes1 aWaalkens-Berendsen, D.H.1 aBar, A.0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g1996 Oct., v. 24, no. 2:pt.2 p.S232-S236x0273-23007nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02312naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008100171300001600252500002400268520121800292650001101510650000901521650001101530650001401541650001201555650001001567650001501577650000901592650001001601650000801611650001701619650001001636700002101646700003001667700002401697773009901721852000901820856008501829655001201914IND4447337720221119113425.0110111s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444733772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2010.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoenlechner, Regine10aPseudocereals as alternative sources for high folate content in staple foods  ap. 475-479.  aIncludes references  aTotal folate content was determined in the pseudocereals amaranth (four varieties), quinoa and buckwheat in comparison to four cereal species (eight wheat varieties, four barley varieties, one oat variety, one rye variety). Amaranth and quinoa were found to possess very high total folate contents: in amaranth, total folate ranged from 52.8 to 73.0 and in quinoa it was 132.7 μg/100 g dm, about ten times as much as in wheat. The bran fractions contained on average 124% of total folate, while only 57% on average was present in the flour fractions. Staple foods (bread, pasta and cookies) were produced from pseudocereals and total folate content and its losses were determined in these products as well as in flours stored for three months. Average loss of total folate in flour after storage was 34%, 51% in bread, 24% in noodles and 16% in cookies. Despite these losses, total folate content was 17–98 μg/100 g dm in noodles, 18–62 μg/100 g dm in cookies and 26–41 μg/100 g dm in breads. Quinoa products were characterised by the highest total folate content. The data underpin pseudocereal (in particular amaranth and quinoa) based products as offering a substantial alternative for folate intake. 3abarley 3abran 3abreads 3abuckwheat 3acookies 3aflour 3afolic acid 3aoats 3apasta 3arye 3astaple foods 3awheat1 aWendner, Manuela1 aSiebenhandl-Ehn, Susannne1 aBerghofer, Emmerich0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 3 p.475-479dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.08.0013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03155naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001800181245007900199300001800278500001500296520129000311650001401601650001801615650002801633650002301661650004301684650001801727650001001745650002601755650002401781650002401805650002401829650002001853650002601873650001501899650001501914650005001929650003501979650002702014650003302041650002402074650001102098650003102109650002102140650001902161653001702180653001202197653003802209700001502247700001402262773009002276852000902366856008502375930003302460945002502493946001102518655001202529IND4367469920221119113446.0050307e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436746992DNAL7 a157995592pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000197372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLandete, J.M.10aImproved enzymatic method for the rapid determination of histamine in wine  ap. 1149-1154.  a2019-12-04  aFermented foods are frequently contaminated by histamine generated by microorganisms possessing histidine decarboxylase activity. The ingestion of large amounts of histamine can cause serious toxicological problems in man. Thus, it becomes important to set a reliable method for rapid histamine quantification in foods. The detection of bacteria exhibiting histidine decarboxylase activity is also important to estimate the risk of contamination of food. Previous enzymatic methods used to quantify histamine in fish gave erroneously high values due to interference when applied to wine. A new enzymatic method is described that allows the direct determination of histamine concentrations in this type of sample. It can be used for the detection of histamine in synthetic media, grape must or wine (white, rose, red) without polyphenols or sugar interferences. This new enzymatic method shows a good correlation (R2=0.996, p<0.001) between the histamine concentrations and absorbances in the interval 0.4-160 mg l(-1). Comparison between this enzymatic method and a high-performance liquid chromatography method showed a high correlation (R2=0.9987, p<0.001). A miniaturized enzymatic method is also proposed, which is particularly useful when high numbers of samples must be analysed. 3ahistamine 3afood spoilage 3abacterial contamination 3afood contamination 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3arapid methods 3awines 3asecondary metabolites 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzymatic reactions 3amicrobial detection 3aprocess control 3aprimary-amine oxidase 3aperoxidase 3agrape must 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aClinical Enzyme Testsxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHistaminexanalysis 2aHumans 2aReproducibility of Results 2aVitisxchemistry 2aWinexanalysis 0aoptimization 0aenzymes 0aamine oxidase (copper-containing)1 aFerrer, S.1 aPardo, I.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1149-1154x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000197373Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015300128300001800281500002400299520150800323650001501831650002101846650001201867650001801879650001701897650001601914650001701930650001901947650001101966650001501977651001001992700001602002700001402018773011702032852000902149655001202158IND4447539420221119113501.0110115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444753942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Bingcheng10aSeasonal Root Biomass and Distribution of Switchgrass and Milk Vetch Intercropping under 2:1 Row Replacement in a Semiarid Region in Northwest China  ap. 1959-1973.  aIncludes references  aA root system has the plasticity to adapt to environmental change and species interaction. Root biomass and distribution were studied in three comparable stands in the fifth growth year (2005) in a semiarid region of northwest China: (1) pure switchgrass, (2) pure milk vetch, and (3) mixed switchgrass and milk vetch in 2:1 row replacement. The measurements were carried out three times (April, September, and November) in 2005 during the vegetation period using a soil core method (9 cm). For each species, the vertical distribution of root biomass (RB) was measured in six consecutive layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-90, 90-120, and 120-150 cm deep) between rows, between plants, and at the center of the plant, respectively. Results indicated a flexible distribution strategy of switchgrass that tended to increase soil exploitation and space sequestration efficiency in soil layers. Milk vetch followed a more conservative strategy: its roots reached the same soil depth in the pure and mixed stands but showed greater root densities in shallower soil layers in the latter. Under intercropping, RB input and root/shoot ratio in switchgrass were reduced, while milk vetch put more photosynthate into root growth. The shift toward a more superficially distributed system of milk vetch in the mixture with switchgrass together with the high RB and wide vertical and horizontal distribution of switchgrass in the study indicates the greater belowground competitive ability of switchgrass in the mixture. 3aAstragalus 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiomass 3aintercropping 3amixed stands 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3asemiarid zones 3ashoots 3asoil depth 3aChina1 aLi, Fengmin1 aShan, Lun0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 16-19 p.1959-1973dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006600146300001600212520209800228650001902326650001602345650001602361650001402377650002702391650000902418650001202427650003802439650001402477650001102491650002002502650004102522653001702563653001602580700001802596700001902614700001602633773009602649852000902745930003302754945001302787946001302800655001202813IND2048923320221119113720.0951127e199510  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204892332DNAL7 a85779492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgert, C.J.10aInfluence of soil half-life on risk assessment of carcinogens  ap. 143-151.  aRisk estimates for contaminants in soil are currently calculated assuming that concentrations remain unchanged over time. In reality, biological and physicochemical processes can substantially diminish contaminant concentrations in soil. For exposure periods typically evaluated in USEPA risk assessments, failure to consider the decline in contaminant levels from environmental transport and degradation can result in a significant overestimation of the average daily dose of toxicant. This overestimation may be up to 2- to 3-fold for compounds with long half-lives (15-20 years) in soil and as much as 40-fold for compounds with short half-lives (0.5 years). Overestimation of dosages affects estimation of cancer risks because of the assumption that the probability of cancer increases directly with the cumulative dose of carcinogen. Thus, assuming static contaminant concentrations in soil adds unacknowledged conservatism to cancer risk estimates and target concentration limits. Furthermore, as significant time may elapse before future-use scenarios could possibly occur, soil half-life can affect the estimation of noncarcinogenic health hazards as well. Therefore, an increase in target concentration limits for some compounds could be allowed and corresponding remediation costs reduced by considering how soil half-life changes the dosage calculation. Specific examples of the influence of soil degradation rates on estimates of cancer risk are presented and the degree of added conservatism imparted to risk assessments through assumption of static site contaminant levels is discussed. Considering the potential importance of this parameter for risk assessment and risk management decisions, soil degradation of contaminants under site-specific conditions should be performed whenever possible and incorporated into the risk assessment exercise.

Nutrient sufficiency ranges derived from DRIS norms were 0.688-1.648%, 0.184-0.339%, 1.178-1.855%, 1.064-1.768%, 0.234-0.391%, and 0.124-0.180% for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S) and were 55-205, 26-80, 17-33, and 5-11 mg kg-1 for iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu), respectively. According to these DRIS-derived sufficiency ranges, 79%, 76%, 76%, 75%, 84%, and 72% of samples were sufficient, whereas 13%, 15%, 21%, 14%, 7%, and 18% of total samples were low in N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S, respectively. For micronutrients, 84%, 85%, 77%, and 86% of samples were sufficient, whereas 6%, 3%, 8%, and 2% of samples were low in Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu, respectively. 3aDiagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System 3aarid zones 3acalcium 3acopper 3afruit trees 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anutrient balance 3aorchards 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asulfur 3azinc 3aIndia1 aHundal, H.S.1 aSingh, Dhanwinder1 aBoora, R.S.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 16-19 p.2011-2021dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009400171300001600265500002400281520129600305650001801601650001901619650001101638650001801649650001001667650001601677650001701693773009901710852000901809856008501818655001201903IND4447337820221119113557.0110111s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444733782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2010.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsaffar, Ayten Aylin10aEffect of thermal processing and storage on digestibility of starch in whole wheat grains  ap. 480-485.  aIncludes references  aGelatinisation and retrogradation of starch in wheat flour systems and whole wheat grains were studied using DSC and the impact of these events on starch digestibility was investigated. Gelatinisation of starch was possible in wheat flours with more than 60% moisture content (dwb) and gelatinised samples had higher digestibility values. Retrogradation of starch was studied with partially and fully cooked (boiled at 100 °C for 12 min and 32 min, respectively) wheat grains that were subjected to storage at 22 °C for 48 h. Stored samples had lower digestibility values when compared to the freshly cooked counterparts. The effect of moisture on retrogradation was studied with fully cooked wheat grains that were dried to a range of moisture contents (14.6–35.9%, wwb) and stored at 20 °C for 24 h. Retrogradation enthalpy increased with increasing moisture content; however, digestibility values did not reflect the changes in retrogradation enthalpy. The possibility of estimating the degree of retrogradation in fully cooked grains (32 min cooking) was investigated using a wheat flour-water system. The retrogradation enthalpy of fully cooked grains was slightly higher than the wheat flour-water system (at a moisture content of 49%, wwb) during the course of storage at 22 °C. 3adigestibility 3aretrogradation 3astarch 3awater content 3awheat 3awheat flour 3awheat starch0 tJournal of cereal science.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 3 p.480-485dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2010.08.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03345naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001400232245011100246300001400357520136100371650001701732650002501749650002301774650002701797650002001824650001301844650004301857650002201900650000701922650003501929650001501964650001701979650001901996650002402015650005002039650001902089650003502108650003302143650001802176650002002194650001102214650003102225650004302256650003702299650004902336650004102385700001802426700001502444773008502459852000902544856008502553930003302638945002502671946001102696655001202707IND4368297320221119113546.0050408e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436829732DNAL7 a158956072pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000279382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLin, H.M.10aStability of the insecticide cypermethrin during tomato processing and implications for endocrine activity  ap. 15-22.  aThe thermal and pH stabilities of cypermethrin during food processing were investigated using tomato as a model food system and high-performance liquid chromatography as the analytical method. Cypermethrin was thermally unstable in aqueous conditions, where the hydrolysis of the pesticide was accelerated by heat. The mean proportion remaining after heating cypermethrin in water for 10 min was 66%, falling to 27% after 1 h. Similarly, thermal processing of canned tomatoes caused cypermethrin to degrade, with remaining levels in the final product ranging from 30 to 60% of the original. Cypermethrin was unstable at extreme pHs, with acid hydrolysis occurring faster than alkaline hydrolysis in phosphate buffers. The acidity of tomato paste (pH 4.3) caused cypermethrin levels to decrease by 30% within 12 days at 5 degrees C. The studies indicate that cypermethrin residues are likely to degrade by hydrolysis during food processing, thus reducing the exposure of consumers to cypermethrin. 3-Phenoxybenzaldehyde, a hydrolysis breakdown product of cypermethrin, was detected in the tomato paste and from the heating of cypermethrin in water at 100 degrees C. There is concern that the risk of breakdown products in terms of endocrine activity is unknown since in vitro studies reported that cypermethrin breakdown products display endocrine activity. 3acypermethrin 3ainsecticide residues 3afood contamination 3ainsecticide resistance 3afood processing 3atomatoes 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3athermal stability 3apH 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3apollutants 3atomato paste 3aheat treatment 3athermal degradation 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDrug Stability 2aEndocrine Systemxdrug effects 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handling 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxchemistry. 2aPesticide Residuesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPyrethrinsxchemistryxpharmacology.1 aGerrard, J.A.1 aShaw, I.C.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2005 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.15-22x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000279383Available from publisher's Web site  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02060naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008000130300001800210500002400228520118200252650001001434650001001444650002401454650002301478650001101501650001501512650001101527650001901538650001101557650001901568651002101587773011701608852000901725655001201734IND4447539720221119113603.0110115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444753972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoyergin, Serap10aEffects of Soil and Leaf Treatments to Eliminate Boron Deficiency in Olives  ap. 2004-2010.  aIncludes references  aThis study was implemented to determine effectiveness of various treatments in recovering boron (B)-deficient olive trees in the Marmara region. The study was carried out during the period 2000-2005. The experimental soil was in loamy texture with medium alkaline pH, low organic matter, and low B concentration. The experiment was conducted in a randomized plot experimental design with 12 treatments. In the study, different B fertilizers were applied to soil and leaves. Treatments of 125, 250, and 500 g-1 borax (sodium tetraborate) were applied to the soils at the beginning of the experiment to determine the later effects of sodium tetraborate. Treatments of 125, 250, and 500 g borax were applied to the soils every year in March. Also, 0.4% borax was applied two or three times, 0.8% sodium tetraborate two or three times, and 0.5% bor-track (boron ethanol amine) two times by foliar applications during the growing period. According to the results, two applications of 0.4% sodium tetraborate to the leaves gave the best results. Soil applications of 250 g sodium tetraborate every year and 500 g sodium tetraborate every two years were the most effective treatments. 3aborax 3aboron 3aexperimental design 3afoliar application 3aleaves 3aloam soils 3aolives 3aorganic matter 3asodium 3asoil treatment 3aTurkey (country)0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 16-19 p.2004-2010dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100002100162245013900183300001400322520181000336650001902146650002402165650002002189650002402209650001902233650002202252650003302274650002202307650003102329650002302360650002602383650001602409650001902425700001602444700002102460700001502481700001502496700002302511773008502534852000902619856008502628930003302713945002502746946001102771655001202782IND4368304020221119113731.0050408e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436830402DNAL7 a10.1080/026520304000194142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchothorst, R.C.10aDetermination of trichothecense in duplicate diets of young chidlren by capillary gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection  ap. 48-55.  aTrichothecenes are mycotoxins produced by several fungal genera, mainly Fusarium species, that can contaminate a wide range of cereals used for human and animal consumption. They are associated with various adverse health effects in animals and humans such as feed refusal, vomiting and immunotoxic effects. A method based on capillary gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection was developed and validated in-house for the determination of nine trichothecenes in duplicate diets of young children. The trichothecenes were extracted from the sample matrix by water/ethanol (90/10). The extracts were cleaned by means of ChemElut and Mycosep columns. The cleaned extracts were evaporated to dryness and derivatized to trimethylsilyl ethers at room temperature. The residues were dissolved in iso-octane and washed with water. The final extracts were analysed for trichothecenes by GC-MS. The response was linear in the range tested (1-10 microgram kg(-1)). Recoveries for the trichothecenes were between 70 and 111%, with the exception of nivalenol, which had a low recovery (34%). The limit of quantification for all trichothecenes was below 0.4 microgram kg(-1). Seventy-four food samples from young children collected by 74 respondents in a duplicate diet study were analysed for trichothecenes with the developed method. The mean levels of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, HT-2 toxin and T-2 toxin were 5.8, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.1 microgram kg(-1), respectively. Based on the individual results, dietary intake calculations were made. For deoxynivalenol, the tolerable daily intake of 1 microgram kg(-1) body weight was exceeded by nine respondents. For the combined intake of T-2 and HT-2 toxin, the temporary tolerable daily intake of 0.06 microgram kg(-1) body weight was exceeded by nine respondents. 3ainfant feeding 3acomplementary foods 3ainfant formulas 3amicrobial detection 3atrichothecenes 3atoxigenic strains 3acapillary gas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amaximum permissible intake 3afood contamination 3aquantitative analysis 3afood intake 3agrain products1 aJekel, A.A.1 aEgmond, H.P. van1 aMul, A. de1 aBoon, P.E.1 aKlaveren, J.D. van0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2005 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.48-55x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000194143Available from publisher's Web site  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02078naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245008700136300001800223500002400241520095300265650002001218650001201238650001301250650001001263650001201273650001101285650001501296650001801311650002601329650001101355650000901366650001101375650001401386650002101400650001401421650001401435650001501449650001201464650001001476650001101486650000901497773011701506852000901623655001201632IND4447541620221119113716.0110115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444754162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrewal, Harsham Singh10aAlfalfa Responses to Combined Use of Lime and Limiting Nutrients on an Acidic Soil  ap. 2247-2263.  aIncludes references  aAn on-farm field experiment was conducted on an acidic soil to investigate the effects of combined use of lime and deficient nutrients on herbage yield of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Omitting lime and limiting nutrients led to elevated concentrations of aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) in alfalfa leaves and stems and caused severe reductions in herbage yield of alfalfa. Combined use of lime (2 t ha-1) and nutrients [phosphorus (P): 20 kg ha-1, sulfur (S): 20 kg ha-1, zinc (Zn): 4 kg ha-1, and boron (B): 2 kg ha-1] had the maximum increase in groundcover, root biomass, nodulation, leaf retention, leaf-to-stem ratio, herbage yield, crude protein, and nutrient composition of alfalfa. These beneficial effects were due to raised soil pH; improved calcium (Ca), P, S, Zn, and B nutrition; and reduced Al, Mn, and Fe toxicity. Aluminium and all the nutrients except copper (Cu) were more concentrated in alfalfa leaves than stems. 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aaluminum 3aboron 3acalcium 3acopper 3acrop yield 3acrude protein 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3airon 3aleaves 3amanganese 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3asoil pH 3astems 3asulfur 3azinc0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2010 , v. 41, no. 16-19 p.2247-2263dDekkerx0010-36247nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001600215245013400231300001800365500001500383520104600398650001701444650002601461650002701487650002501514650002301539650001801562650002501580650002501605650002601630650002301656650002601679650001301705650002401718650002101742650003301763650002701796650002401823650002101847650003701868650001401905650001801919650003301937650002601970653001501996700001602011700001602027700001402043700002102057700001502078773009002093852000902183856008502192930003302277945002502310946001102335655001202346IND4369037020221119113533.0050415e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436903702DNAL7 a157643352pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000100662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effect of 'home' washing with tap water and a commercially available vegetable detergent on residue levels was also studied. After treatment, azoxystrobin and pyrimethanil residues on strawberry were on average 0.55 and 2.98 mg kg(-1). respectively, values below the maximum residue level (MRL) fixed by the European Union (2.0 and 5 mg kg(-1), respectively), while fenhexamid residues were on average 2.99 mg kg(-1), which is very close to the MRL of 3.0 mg kg(-1), but some samples were over the MRL. Thereafter, all residues declined, with a half-life of about 8 days (azoxystrobin and fenhexamid) and 4.8 days (pyrimethanil). Washing the fruit with tap water reduced the residues of azoxystrobin and fenhexamid but did not affect pyrimethanil residues. Finally, when fruits were washed with a commercial detergent, greater amounts were removed (about 45% of azoxystrobin and pyrimethanil and 60% of fenhexamid). 3astrawberries 3apesticide application 3amaximum residue limits 3apostharvest diseases 3afood contamination 3amolds (fungi) 3afungicide resistance 3apreharvest treatment 3afield experimentation 3afungicide residues 3apyrimidine fungicides 3aFragaria 2aAcrylatesxanalysis 2aAmidesxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFragariaxchemistry 2aFruitxchemistry 2aFungicides, Industrialxanalysis 2aHalf-Life 2aMethacrylates 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPyrimidinesxanalysis 0afungicides1 aSchirra, M.1 aGarau, V.L.1 aMelis, M.1 aTuberoso, C.I.G.1 aCabras, P.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Nov., v. 21, no. 11 p.1065-1070x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000100663Available from publisher's Web site  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03513naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001800198245015100216300001800367520149900385650000901884650002301893650002401916650002201940650001501962650002601977650003102003650001002034650001802044650001502062650001602077650001602093650001502109650001002124650000902134650002302143650001002166650003802176650001102214650003302225650002202258650005102280650001102331650000902342650001602351650002502367650002402392651001402416651001102430651001002441700001702451700001702468700001702485700002002502700001302522700001502535773009002550852000902640856008502649930003302734945002502767946001102792655001202803IND4369037320221119113455.0050415e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436903732DNAL7 a157643382pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000133182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSolfrizzo, M.10aComparison of urinary sphingolipids in human populations with high and low maize consumption as a possible biomarker of fumonisin dietary exposure  ap. 1090-1095.  aThe increased sphinganine/sphingosine (SA/SO) ratio has previously been shown as a biomarker of fumonisin exposure in experimental animals and has been proposed as a tool to assess human exposure to fumonisin mainly occurring through the dietary consumption of fumonisin contaminated maize-based foods. Sphinganine and sphingosine were measured in urines of humans resident in two areas of North Argentina and South Brazil with high maize consumption and compared with urine samples collected in areas with very low or no maize consumption, such as Central Argentina and Southern Italy. The pattern of SA/SO values in the two groups with no maize consumption (assumed as controls) was similar, with all SA/SO values lower than one. Mean SA/SO ratio was 1.27 in urine of subjects with high maize consumption (n = 123) and 0.36 in controls (n = 66) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The mean fumonisin level in maize samples collected in North Argentina and South Brazil was 0.35 mg kg(-1) (n = 40). Although a similar maize and fumonisin intake was recorded for the two groups of populations, the mean SA/SO ratio in South Brazil (1.57) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of North Argentina (0.69). These data suggest that the higher SA/SO values observed in South Brazil cannot be associated with high fumonisin exposure and further studies are necessary to provide convincing evidence for using the SA/SO ratio as a biomarker of human fumonisin exposure. 3acorn 3afood contamination 3amicrobial detection 3atoxigenic strains 3afumonisins 3asecondary metabolites 3ahealth effects assessments 3aurine 3asphingolipids 3abiomarkers 3asphingosine 3afood intake 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBiomarkersxurine. 2aChild 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFemale 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFumonisinsxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSphingolipidsxurine 2aZea maysxchemistry 0aArgentina 0aBrazil 0aItaly1 aChulze, S.N.1 aMallmann, C.1 aVisconti, A.1 aGirolamo, A. de1 aRojo, F.1 aTorres, A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Nov., v. 21, no. 11 p.1090-1095x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000133183Available from publisher's Web site  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02167naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245004100134300001600175500001500191520137200206650002401578650002001602650002301622653002101645653002301666653002701689773008601716852000901802939003301811945000801844946001301852655001201865991564509490742620221119113616.0840829e198403  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840054572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacoby, Jacob.10aPerspectives on information overload  ap. 432-435.  a2019-12-04  aThe subject of information overload has received a fair measure of attention in consumer behavior literature. Not all writers agree on this subject. Some research studies use only accuracy as the dependent variable, thereby ignoring the possibility that information overload may adversely affect other important mental states and processes. Overload studies must represent the environment confronting the real-world consumer. Simplification of the information environment in the testing situation precludes extension of findings to the real world. Jacoby refutes Malhotra's reanalysis of 3 earlier studies of information overload. Malhotra's own findings, published in 1982, support the thesis that consumers can be overloaded and actually make poorer choices with more information. Jacoby has abandoned his early overload research program in favor of developing a family of information monitoring approaches to model more faithfully the generally accepted conception of how information processing/decision making occurs. Application of these techniques indicates that consumers stop far short of overloading themselves. While it is possible for consumers to overload, in general, they will stop well short of this condition. The critical point for marketing/advertising managers is not how much information is available, but which information consumers access.

  1 aCooper, K.M.10aDetection of 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), a tissue-bound metabolite of the nitrofuran furazolidone, in prawn tissue by enzyme immunoassay  ap. 841-848.  a2019-12-04  aFurazolidone, a nitrofuran antibiotic, is banned from use in food animal production within the European Union. Increasingly, compliance with this ban is monitored by use of analytical methods to detect a stable tissue-bound metabolite, 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ). Widespread use of furazolidone in poultry and prawns imported into Europe highlighted the urgent need for development of nitrofuran immunoassay screening tests. The first enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay for detection of AOZ residues in prawns (shrimps) is now described. Prawn samples were derivatized with o-nitrobenzaldehyde, extracted into ethyl acetate, washed with hexane and applied to a competitive enzyme immunoassay based on a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. Assay limit of detection (LOD) (mean + 3 s) calculated from the analysis of 20 known negative cold and warm water prawn samples was 0.1 μg kg-1. Intra- and interassay relative standard deviations were determined as 18.8 and 38.2%, respectively, using a negative prawn fortified at 0.7 μg kg-1. The detection capability (CCβ), defined as the concentration of AOZ at which 20 different fortified samples yielded results above the LOD, was achieved at fortification between 0.4 and 0.7 μg kg-1. Incurred prawn samples (n = 8) confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection to contain AOZ concentrations between 0.4 and 12.7 μg kg-1 were all screened positive by this enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay. Further data are presented and discussed with regard to calculating assay LOD based on accepting a 5% false-positive rate with representative negative prawn samples. Such an acceptance improves the sensitivity of an ELISA and in this case permitted an LOD of 0.05 μg kg-1 and a CCβ of below 0.4 μg kg-1. 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aveterinary drugs 3afood analysis 3afood contamination 3aseafoods 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afurazolidone 3aantibiotic residues 3ashrimp 3adrug abuse 3adetection 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxmetabolism 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aAntibody Specificity 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFalse Positive Reactions 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFurazolidonexmetabolism 2aNitrofuransxmetabolism 2aOxazolidinonesxanalysis 2aPenaeidaexchemistry 2aShellfishxanalysis 3aEurope 0anitrofurans 0adrug residues 0acontaminants1 aElliott, C.T.1 aKennedy, D.G.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Sept., v. 21, no. 9 p.841-848x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304123312724763Available from publisher's Web site  a20080730b20080801c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03452naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215072001700232100001700249245010800266300001600374520154200390650001001932650000901942650001801951650001201969650001101981650001801992650002502010650002102035650002002056650001602076650002202092650002102114650001002135650002202145650001902167650002802186650002702214650003602241650005002277650002402327650001102351650005502362650002402417650002102441651001002462653001702472653001702489700001702506700001602523773008802539852000902627856008502636930003302721945002502754946001102779655001202790IND4366105920221119113301.0041216e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436610592DNAL7 a157125202pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000068582doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aClarke, D.B.10aDetermination of unusual soya and non-soya phytoestrogen sources in beer, fish products and other foods  ap. 949-962.  aFish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices (30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06 mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized. 3abeers 3afish 3afish products 3acuisine 3aspices 3afood analysis 3achemical composition 3afood composition 3aplant estrogens 3aisoflavones 3atraditional foods 3asoybean products 3aherbs 3aartificial colors 2aBeerxanalysis 2aFish Productsxanalysis 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Coloring Agentsxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aGenisteinxanalysis 2aHumans 2aPhytoestrogensxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aSpicesxanalysis 3aIndia 0aIndian foods 0aIndian meals1 aBarnes, K.A.1 aLloyd, A.S.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.949-962x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000068583Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03164naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001100181245005600192300001600248500001500264520139100279650002201670650003401692650002301726650001301749650002801762650001301790650001601803650002401819650001701843650001401860650001601874650002401890650002601914650003601940650002701976650003302003650001102036650002502047650002602072650003102098650002102129650001902150651001102169651001102180653002602191700001702217700002202234700001502256700001602271773008802287852000902375856008502384930003302469945002502502946001102527655001202538IND4366106220221119113359.0041216e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436610622DNAL7 a157125222pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000006532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNg, W.10aOchratoxin A in wine and grape juice sold in Canada  ap. 971-981.  a2019-12-04  aOchratoxin A (OTA) was determined in 251 samples of wines and grape juice collected over 3 years in Canada. In total, 25/84 samples of red wine, 22/96 samples of white wine, 3/46 red grape juices and 1/25 white grape juices contained OTA levels above the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Canadian wines, when compared with imported products, showed both a lower OTA occurrence, noted as positive (19 versus 48% above the limit of detection (LOD) for wines), and a lower level of OTA contamination (upper bound mean of 17.5 versus 163 pg ml(-1) for wines). Wines from the USA contained no quantifiable levels of ochratoxin A. OTA was found in Canadian and US grape juice samples, with 12.9% above the LOD and an upper bound mean of 13.3 pg ml(-1). It was extracted from a wine or grape juice sample by passing it through an immunoaffinity column. The sample matrix was washed off the column with water. OTA was eluted from the column with methanol and quantitatively determined by liquid chromatography using a fluorescence detector. The presence of OTA was confirmed by esterification with boron trifluoride-methanol. The LOQ of OTA was estimated as 20 pg ml(-1) in white wine (S/N 10:1) and 40 pg ml(-1) in red wine, white grape juice and red grape juice (S/N 20:1). The LOD was estimated as 4 pg ml(-1) for white wine and 8 pg ml(-1) for red wine and white and red grape juices (S/N 3:1). 3atoxigenic strains 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3afood contamination 3aaccuracy 3amicrobial contamination 3avalidity 3agrape juice 3amicrobial detection 3aochratoxin A 3ared wines 3awhite wines 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aOchratoxinsxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aVitisxchemistry 2aWinexanalysis 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aliquid chromatography1 aMankotia, M.1 aPantazopoulos, P.1 aNeil, R.J.1 aScott, P.M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.971-981x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000006533Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01278naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245006200135300001400197520043900211650001500650650001300665650001200678650000900690650001100699651001000710653001400720653001000734653001000744700001600754700001700770773007800787852000900865939003300874945000800907946001300915655001200928991564506920742620221119113344.0841022s1984    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE849245742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPope, C.A.

The results of an extensive survey of Texas hunters and a land valuation model are utilized to develop estimates of the value of wildlife in Texas. Although the value of wildlife cannot be precisely calculated, these estimates clearly indicate that wildlife is an enormously valuable natural resource. 3arecreation 3awildlife 3aleasing 3aland 3amodels 3aTexas 0aresources 0aRural 0aValue1 aAdams, C.E.1 aThomas, J.K.0 tJournal of leisure research.g1984, v. 16, no. 1 p.51-60x0022-22167nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19841022c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle03850naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245017400144300001600318520228300334650001202617650001002629650001902639650002302658650002002681650001102701650000902712650001702721650000902738650001202747650002802759650005602787650001302843650001102856650002302867650003002890650002202920650000902942650003602951650000902987650002502996650001703021653002003038700001803058700002003076700001903096700001703115773009603132852000903228930003303237945001303270946001303283655001203296IND2044166020221119113429.0950119e199410  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204416602DNAL7 a78463022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuoff, W.L.10aBioavailability of cadmium in food and water: a case study on the derivation of relative bioavailability factors for inorganics and their relevance to the reference dose  ap. 139-160.  aPublished studies in which rats were exposed to CdCl2 in standard chow or dnnking water were analyzed to compare the relative bioavailability of cadmium from the two media. Relative bioavailability was assessed from estimates of the rate of accumulation of cadmium in kidney cortex or liver. Data were grouped into tiers based on study design and reponing of data: Tier 1, identical experimental protocols and dosage can be estimated: Tier 2, very similar or identical protocols and dosage can be estimated: Tier 3, protocols may differ and dosage can be estimated; and Tier 4, protocols may differ and dosages cannot be estimated (but concentration of cadmium in food or water is reponed). Tiers were nested, such that Tier 4 contained all relevant studies; Tier 3 included data sets from Tiers 1 and 2: and Tier 2 included the data set from Tier 1. Data within Tiers 1, 2, and 3 were subjected to a linear regression analysis with dosage as the independent variable and tissue accumulation rate as the dependent vanable to determine whether bioavailability of cadmium was significantly different based on medium of administration. The results of this analysis show the following: (1) In rats receiving food and drinking water ad libitum, the bioavailability of cadmium in drinking water is not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the bioavailability of cadmium in food when dosages are less than 4 mg/kg body wt/day. (2) Cadmium decreases food and water consumption: therefore, assessments of relative bioavailability should be made based on actual dosage rather than exposure levels. (3) Diet composition and status of the gastrointestinal tract are probably a more important determinant of the bioavailability of cadmium than is the exposure medium. (4) Studies of the effect of total diet composition on bioavailability of cadmium may be more relevant than are studies of the effect of the exposure medium. It is concluded from this analysis that the bioavailability of cadmium in food is not different from that in water when diet is provided ad llbltum. Therefore, we recommend that distinct RfDs for cadmium in food and dnnking water should not be based on the assumption that the bioavailability of cadmium in drinking water is greater than that of cadmium in food. 3acadmium 3afoods 3adrinking water 3afood contamination 3abioavailability 3adosage 3arats 3acase studies 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aCadmiumxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aDrinking 2aFemale 2aFood Contamination 2aKidney Cortexxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMaximum Allowable Concentration 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRats, Wistar 0areference doses1 aDiamond, G.L.1 aVelazquez, S.F.1 aStiteler, W.M.1 aGefell, D.J.0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g1994 Oct., v. 20, no. 2 p.139-160x0273-23007nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03885naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245007800213300001800291520215300309650002202462650001802484650002002502650001902522650002002541650001802561650001902579650001602598650002302614650001702637650001702654650002402671650002602695650004102721650005002762650002702812650003302839650002702872650002502899650002002924650001102944650002402955653001502979700001602994700001603010700001603026773009003042852000903132856008503141930003303226945002503259946001103284655001203295IND4367474020221119113421.0050307e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436747402DNAL7 a157995622pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000218732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPark, J.W.10aAnalysis of heat-processed corn foods for fumonisins and bound fumonisins  ap. 1168-1178.  aThirty retail samples of heat-processed corn foods, i.e. corn flakes, corn-based breakfast cereals, tortilla chips and corn chips, were analysed for fumonisins - fumonisin B1 (FB1), fumonisin B2 (FB2) and hydrolysed FB1 (HFB1) - as well as for protein- and total-bound FB1. Bound (hidden) fumonisins cannot be detected by conventional analysis. Improved methods for the determination of bound FB1 were developed. The protein-bound FB1 was extracted with 1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) solution. The SDS, which interfered with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, was then separated from protein-bound FB1 by complexing with methylene blue followed by solvent extraction and hydrolysis with 2 N KOH. To measure total-bound FB1, the sample itself was hydrolysed with KOH. In both cases, cleanup was accomplished on an OASIS polymeric solid-phase extraction column and the bound fumonisins were determined by HPLC measurement of HFB1. Fourteen of 15 samples of corn flakes and other corn-based breakfast cereals analysed contained detectable levels of FB1 with a mean in positive samples of 67 ng g(-1) (13-237 ng g(-1)). Two samples also had detectable levels of FB2 (21-23 ng g(-1)). Bound FB1 was found in all samples; the mean protein-bound FB1 measured was 58 ng g(-1) (22-176 ng g(-1)) and the mean total-bound FB1 measured was 106 ng g(-1) (28-418 ng g(-1)), reported as FB1 equivalents after correction for recoveries of HFB1. There was an average of about 1.3 times more FB1 in the bound form compared with extractable FB1, and this was about twice as much as protein-bound FB1. Seven of the 15 samples of alkali-processed corn-based foods, such as tortilla chips and corn chips, contained FB1 and three contained HFB1 with means in measurable positive samples of 78 (48-134) and 29 (13-47) ng g(-1), respectively. Five of these alkali-processed corn foods contained bound FB1; the mean measurable protein-bound FB1 was 42 ng g(-1) (39-46 ng g(-1)) and the mean measurable total-bound FB1 was 100 ng g(-1) (54-209 ng g(-1)). HFB1 derived from bound FB1 in selected samples was confirmed by HPLC with mass spectrometry (MS). 3abreakfast cereals 3acorn products 3aprocessed foods 3aheat treatment 3afood processing 3afood analysis 3atortilla chips 3asnack foods 3afood contamination 3afumonisin B1 3afumonisin B2 3amicrobial detection 3aliquid chromatography 2aCarcinogens, Environmentalxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFumonisinsxanalysis 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aZea maysxchemistry 0acorn chips1 aScott, P.M.1 aLau, B.P.Y.1 aLewis, D.A.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1168-1178x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000218733Available from publisher's Web site  a20071205b20080102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/04/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02854naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245011600176300001600292500002400308520178900332650001102121650002002132650001302152650001602165650001602181650001602197650000902213650001902222650001202241650001102253650001102264651001802275773013302293852000902426856005702435655001202492IND4449867920221119113113.0110225e199311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444986792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7976.1993.tb03748.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, Harvey G.10aFirst, Let's Assume We Have a Can Opener: An Analysis of the Economics of a Single North American Barley Market  ap. 271-281.  aIncludes references  aIn summary, it has been shown that the results of the Carter paper are driven, not surprisingly, by the assumptions that were fed into the model used. In addition, it has been shown that many of the assumptions are highly questionable or unrelated to the problem, and therefore limit the applicability of the findings to any “real-world” prescriptive analysis. The Carter study does not model a change from a single-desk selling structure to a multiple seller environment. It simply assumes: feed barley yields increase, U.S. demand for feed barley increases by 500,000 t and malting barley demand increases by 400,000 t, all barley shipments to maltsters bypass the primary elevator system, and malt selection rates are increased by 50%. Any one of these assumptions would lead an economic model to a result of higher net producer income. Carter, however, fails to connect these assumptions to the institution of a CBM. Further, the modeling errors created in trying to “customize” the CRAM model for this use clearly invalidate the results. There are serious flaws in the structural modeling of how a competitive market for malting barley would operate in North America and they invalidate the Carter's results regarding the prices, producer returns and production of malting barley under the CBM scenario. While it is an interesting academic exercise to examine the possible economic impacts of a policy change by “shocking” an economic model, it is quite another matter to represent the results of such an endeavor as being “an exhaustive and definitive analysis of the issues” (Carter 31 March 1993). Besides the questionable assumptions and modeling errors of this paper, the author clearly misrepresents the power and accuracy of mathematical economic modeling. 3abarley 3aeconomic impact 3aexercise 3afarm income 3afeed barley 3agrain yield 3amalt 3amalting barley 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3aUnited States0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g1993 Nov., v. 41, no. 3 p.271-281dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw19495x0008-39767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7976.1993.tb03748.x 7aarticle02586naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100001900201245008900220300001600309520074100325650001201066650001401078650002301092650001901115650003501134650001701169650001401186650001801200650002601218650002201244650001801266650002001284650002001304650001201324650002401336650003601360650001901396650002701415650003301442650002801475650003101503650003601534650002601570650002701596650003101623650003601654651001201690700001701702773008701719852000901806856008801815930003301903945002501936946001101961655001201972IND4369034720221119113140.0050415e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436903472DNAL7 a152045582pmid7 a10.1080/026520304100016659192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The content of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins was measured by a liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry detection method, and mean levels in the 13 consignments varied from 58 to 243 microgram kg(-1). The distributions of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins in the consignments were relatively homogenous as the relative standard deviation of the content varied from 7 to 19%. The results are discussed in relation to food safety, the uncertainty of sampling and analysis, and the newly introduced European Union maximum levels of marine biotoxins in seafood products. 3amussels 3ashellfish 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3adiarrhetic shellfish poisoning 3aokadaic acid 3adetection 3afood analysis 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amarine toxins 3aquality control 3awater pollution 2aAnimals 2aBivalviaxchemistry 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aEuropean Union 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMarine Toxinsxanalysis 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMaximum Allowable Concentration 2aNeurotoxinsxanalysis 2aOkadaic Acidxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aShellfishxanalysisxstandards. 3aDenmark1 aJensen, L.B.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.341-347x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304100016659193Available from publisher's Web site  a20060325b20060402c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/05/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01413naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229300002100245500001500266520056600281650001900847650002400866650001100890650004300901653001200944700001800956773008200974852000901056939003301065946001301098655001201111IND8903863220221119113315.0890724e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890386322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyalty, R.N.10aReduction in photosynthesis of tomato leaflets caused by tomato russet mite (Acari: Eriophyidae)  ap. 256-260.  ap. 256-260. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThe reduction in net photosynthesis caused by tomato russet mite (TRM), Aculops lycopersici (Massee), feeding was measured.

Studies suggest that destruction of guard cells and subsequent reduction of leaf gas exchange were responsible for photosynthesis reduction, and that no photosynthesis-reducing phytotoxin is present in TRM saliva. 3aphotosynthesis 3aAculops lycopersici 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aSolanum1 aPerring, T.M.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.256-260x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01526naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006500132300001400197520070100211650001500912650002200927650001200949650001600961650001200977651001800989653001101007700001601018773011901034852000901153939003301162945000801195946000901203655001201212991564499080742620221119113417.0810811e198002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE819174392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHottel, J.B.10aReturns to equity capital in the U.S. farm production sector  ap. 51-68.  aExtract: To provide more historical perspective on the returns to farm equity, this report includes the annual estimates back to 1940. Some revisions were made in the procedure used previously and a discussion of the technique follows. An important feature added to the return to equity series is a measure of the real capital gain or loss from changes in the value of farm production assets. Real capital gains or losses reflect both the change in the nominal value of farm production assets during the year and the change in purchasing power of the funds tied up in assets and in debts. Another new feature is the estimation of assets and equity on a book value as well as a market value basis. 3astatistics 3acosts and returns 3acapital 3aaquaculture 3ahistory 3aUnited States 0aEquity1 aEvans, C.D.0 tAgriculture information bulletin - United States Dept. of Agriculture.g1980 Feb., v. 430 p.51-68x0065-46397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810811c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA 7aarticle03158naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100001900184245012400203300001600327520152700343650000901870650001701879650002301896650001901919650002401938650001801962650004101980650002502021650002602046650001702072650002602089650001302115650002202128650002602150650004002176650002702216650003302243650002502276650001102301650002502312650002402337700001502361773008602376852000902462856008802471930003302559945002502592946001102617655001202628IND4369036320221119113159.0050415e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436903632DNAL7 a152045512pmid7 a10.1080/026520304100016701752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShephard, G.S.10aDetermination of the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 in maize by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography: a collaborative study  ap. 498-505.  aA simple and cost-effective method using thin-layer chromatography for the determination of the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 in maize is described. The analytical method consisted of the extraction of ground maize by shaking with methanol/water (75:25) for 60 min and clean-up of the resultant extract by means of strong anion exchange solid-phase extraction. The purified residue, formed by evaporation of the elution solvent, was reacted with fluorescamine and the fumonisin B1-derivative was separated by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography using a developing solution of methanol/aqueous 4% potassium chloride (70:30). The derivatized FB1 was readily visualized as a greenish-yellow spot under long wavelength ultraviolet light and quantified by visual comparison with a set of similarly derivatized standards in the range 20-300 ng FB1 spotted on plate. Based on visual comparison, levels down to 0.5 mg kg(-1) were successfully estimated. The method was collaboratively studied in 14 laboratories using four duplicate maize meal samples (including a blank) and a spiked sample for determination of recovery. No significant difference was observed between mean FB1 levels by high-performance liquid chromatography or thin-layer chromatography. Based on within-laboratory relative standard deviations of 27.1-41.7% and between-laboratory relative standard deviations of 35.0-63.3%, the method can be considered semiquantitative. The mean recovery achieved by participants at a spiking level of 2.00 mg kg(-1) was 74.5%. 3acorn 3afumonisin B1 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3arapid methods 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3acooperative research 3acollaborative testing 3alaboratories 3alaboratory techniques 3aFusarium 3atoxigenic strains 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChromatography, Thin Layerxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFumonisinsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aZea maysxchemistry1 aSewram, V.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.498-505x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304100016701753Available from publisher's Web site  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02285naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010600125300001600231300002100247520145300268650002001721650001901741650002401760650001301784651001301797700001701810700001901827773008201846852000901928939003301937946001301970655001201983IND8904931820221119113317.0890911e198906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890493182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamp, W.O.10aEmpoasca (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) abundance and species composition in habitats proximate to alfalfa  ap. 423-428.  ap. 423-428. ill.  aTo determine the role of habitats close to alfalfa on the population ecology of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris), eight such habitats (e.g., deciduous trees, weedy areas, and forest understory) in east-central Illinois were sampled weekly from May through October, 1982-1984, for potato leafhopper and morphologically similar, congeneric species. Of all Empoasca males collected during 1983 and 1984 outside of alfalfa fields, E. fabae were most abundant (82.8%), followed by E. solana DeLong (7.3%), E. recurvata DeLong (6.8%), E. erigeron DeLong (2.7%), and E. bifurcata DeLong (0.4%). Three-fourths of the E. recurvata males were collected mid-September or later, and all of the E. solana males were collected in the apple orchard habitat. Although alfalfa and some deciduous trees (e.g., oaks and maples) typically were colonized first by adults in May, the first generation of nymphs was able to complete development only outside the alfalfa because the first harvest occurred soon after migratory adults arrived. Abundance in any one habitat was variable during the summer, often fluctuating between high numbers during one week and zero the next. After alfalfa was cut, adults were often abundant in habitats immediately adjacent to the field. These results indicate that potato leafhopper commonly occurs in such habitats, and that these habitats may serve as a population source or sink for adults dispersing to and from alfalfa. 3aMedicago sativa 3aEmpoasca fabae 3apopulation dynamics 3ahabitats 3aIllinois1 aMorris, M.J.1 aArmbrust, E.J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 June, v. 18, no. 3 p.423-428x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03160naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001300198245013200211300001800343500001500361520120100376650002501577650002301602650002001625650003001645650002601675650002501701650002101726650002001747650002701767650001201794650001101806650001301817650002801830650003401858650002701892650002901919650002001948650003801968650003902006650002302045650001002068650002402078650001002102653001702112653002202129700001602151700001702167700001402184700001702198700001402215700001602229773009002245852000902335856008502344930003302429945002502462946001102487655001202498IND4369036620221119113207.0050415e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436903662DNAL7 a157643312pmid7 a10.1080/026520304000193982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHird, H.10aTruncation of oligonucleotide primers confers specificity on real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for food authentication  ap. 1035-1040.  a2019-12-04  aThe advent of real-time polymerase chain reaction has revolutionized the field of molecular biology, but the design and optimization of these assays has been largely overlooked in the literature. This dearth of information is probably in response to the provision of assay design software and robust guidelines issued by the leading manufacturer. However, many applications require highly specific assays with no cross-amplification of non-target DNA and it has been found that the software and guidelines, whilst producing assays of great sensitivity, do not necessarily produce specific assays. Two complementary strategies were used to confer specificity on a real-time assay, first by placing the 3' end of the primers on a point of sequence heterogeneity and, second, by truncating the primers at the 5' end to lower the calculated melting temperature. Using these strategies in concert, a specific assay for a conserved region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was developed that can be used for the unambiguous detection of the target species in a meat mixture. This approach can be used for any real-time polymerase chain reaction assay to increase assay selectivity and specificity. 3aproduct authenticity 3aanimal-based foods 3aanimal proteins 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astandards of identity 3anucleotide sequences 3afood composition 3aprocess control 3amolecular conformation 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aDNAxisolation & purification 2aFood Industryxmethods 2aFood Inspectionxmethods 2aMeatxstandards 2aOligonucleotide Probesxchemistry 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSequence Alignment 2aSheep 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwine 0aoptimization 0aprimer truncation1 aGoodier, R.1 aSchneede, K.1 aBoltz, C.1 aChisholm, J.1 aLloyd, J.1 aPopping, B.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 Nov., v. 21, no. 11 p.1035-1040x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304000193983Available from publisher's Web site  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02932naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100001700184245008200201300001600283520123000299650000901529650002301538650002801561650002301589650002801612650002201640650002601662650001701688650002401705650001101729650002701740650001201767650002601779650003601805650002701841650003301868650002001901650001201921651001001933651001001943700001501953700001601968700001301984700001501997700001702012700001502029700001802044700001602062773008602078852000902164856008802173930003302261945002502294946001102319655001202330IND4369036020221119113359.0050415e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436903602DNAL7 a152045482pmid7 a10.1080/026520304100016778172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNakajima, M.10aOccurrence of aflatoxin M1 in domestic milk in Japan during the winter season  ap. 472-478.  aA total of 208 samples of commercial pasteurized milk gathered from retail outlets across Japan during the winter season were analysed for aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). Japan was divided into 11 regions from north to south, and nine to 45 milk samples from each region were randomly purchased between December 2001 and February 2002. Each milk sample was cleaned up by an immunoaffinity column, and AFM1 was quantified by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection in four independent laboratories. The limit of detection of the method was 0.001 microgram kg(-1). The identity of the putative AFM1 in milk sample was confirmed by the formation of AFM1 hemi-acetal with trifluoroacetic acid. Based on the results obtained with spiked samples (0.05 microgram AFM1 kg(-1)), the mean recovery was 91.4%, the relative standard deviation for repeatability was 4.6%, and the relative standard deviation for reproducibility was 8.0% among four independent laboratories. AFM1 was detected in 207 (99.5%) of 208 milk samples at 0.001-0.029 microgram kg(-1), with a mean of 0.009 microgram kg(-1) and a 90th percentile of 0.014 microgram kg(-1). No significant difference of the level of AFM1 contamination was observed among the regions. 3amilk 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus parasiticus 3atoxigenic strains 3asecondary metabolites 3aaflatoxin M1 3amicrobial detection 3awinter 2aAflatoxin M1xanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSeasons 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aTabata, S.1 aAkiyama, H.1 aItoh, Y.1 aTanaka, T.1 aSunagawa, H.1 aTyonan, T.1 aYoshizawa, T.1 aKumagai, S.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2004 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.472-478x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520304100016778173Available from publisher's Web site  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle01891naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013100124300001600255300002200271520092400293650002001217650001901237650002701256650001701283650002301300651001301323653002801336700001901364700001601383700001701399773008201416852000901498939003301507946001301540655001201553IND9002144620221119113446.0900315e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900214462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, K.S.10aMortality of Hypera postica (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Oklahoma caused by Erynia phytonomi (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales)  ap. 964-969.  ap. 964-969. maps.  aSince first being discovered in Oklahoma during 1983, Erynia phytonomi (Arthur) has been found in 35 counties. Seasonal incidence of the pathogen and the percentage of mortality in populations of the alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), were determined at two locations in Oklahoma from 1983 to 1987. The first infections were usually detected in weevils after accumulation of 200-250 degree-days (base temperature 10 degrees C) from 1 January, coinciding closely with occurrence of peak larval densities. During each year except 1987, rainfall and temperature conditions were favorable to the pathogen, and disease incidence in host larvae exceeded 60% on one or more sampling dates. Incidence of infection in prepupae frequently exceeded 80% and up to 52% of pupae were infected. The pathogen appears to be important as a natural control agent and often reduces the number of insecticide applications required. 3aMedicago sativa 3aHypera postica 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aConidiobolus 3abiological control 3aOklahoma 0aentomophthora phytonomi1 aBerberet, R.C.1 aYoung, L.J.1 aConway, K.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 Dec., v. 18, no. 6 p.964-969x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02778naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245011700174300001600291500014800307520159100455650001302046650001102059650001402070650001102084650001302095650001102108650001002119651001002129700001802139700002002157700001802177700001302195773014402208856005502352852000902407655001202416IND60571788920221119113557.0170712e20170510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057178892DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1160.182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLodolini, E.

Tree height, canopy dimensions, trunk diameter at 0.20, 0.75, 1.5, 2.0 m from the ground, branch intersection height along the trunk, diameter and length of the primary branches were measured in 2010, when trees were 2-year-old. On sampled branches at different height, all the productive and vegetative shoots were spatially described. Tree height, trunk diameter and canopy volume were not significantly different among cultivars, while the number of primary branches was lower in 'FS17' compared to 'Arbequina', 'Arbosana' and 'Koroneiki'. The studied cultivars had different branching patterns along the trunk: a low density between 1 and 1.5 m trunk height in 'FS17' and a high between 1.5 and 2.0 m in 'Arbequina'. Moreover, the length/diameter ratio of the primary branches was low and high in 'Arbosana' and 'Giulia' and in 'Arbequina', respectively. 'Arbequina' also showed a uniform shoot density along the main axis of the primary branch, whereas an alternate shoot density with the presence of empty portions was observed in the other cultivars. A higher shoot density in the medium-proximal portion of the branch was seen for 'Arbosana' and 'FS17'. Results presented in this study supply helpful information about the different canopy and branch architectural characteristics of the six studied olive cultivars with respect to their suitability to high density plantations. 3abranches 3acanopy 3acultivars 3aolives 3aorchards 3ashoots 3atrees 3aItaly1 aTarragoni, A.1 aCioccolanti, T.1 aPollastri, L.1 aNeri, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 May 10, , no. 1160 p.127-134dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1160.18  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013700127300001800264300002400282500001500306520079700321650003001118650002601148650002301174650001701197650002401214651002001238653002601258700002101284700001801305700001801323773008401341852000901425939003301434946001301467655001201480IND9002146320221119113450.0900315e198912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900214632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, T.T.Y.10aSeasonal distribution and abundance of Dacus cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  ap. 1079-1082.  ap. 1079-1082. maps.  a2019-12-05  aDistribution of the melon fly, Dacus cucurbitae Coquillett, was determined by trapping males at 100 sites throughout the island of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

TBZ is extracted from the potato homogenate with ethyl acetate and the extract purified and concentrated on a cation-exchange, solid-phase extraction column. The extract is analyzed for TBZ residues by column LC with a cation-exchange column and fluorescence detection. Recoveries of TBZ from whole white potatoes fortified with TBZ at 0.05-20 ppm and from whole sweet potatoes fortified with TBZ at 0.005-0.1 ppm averaged 100 and 94%, respectively. The method is also applicable for quantitation of TBZ residues in white potato waste (dried peel) used as an animal feed additive. The present method for monitoring TBZ residues in white and sweet potatoes and white potato waste (dried peel) is simple, rapid, and sensitive. 3apotatoes 3asweet potatoes 3afood contamination 3athiabendazole 3afungicide residues 3aquantitative analysis 3aliquid chromatography 3arapid methods 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Contamination 2aFungicides, Industrialxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aSolanum tuberosumxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aThiabendazolexanalysis 0adetermination1 aRahman, H.1 aJohnson, N.A.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1995 , v. 78, no. 6 p.1455-1458x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02499naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245013100146300001600277520129000293650001501583650002301598650002601621650002701647650002701674650001201701650002901713650002001742650002801762650002001790650002401810650001401834650003101848653001601879700001501895700001601910773008301926852000902009930003302018945001302051946001302064655001202077IND2321563620221119113455.0010615e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232156362DNAL7 a113246082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragacci, S.10aImmunoaffinity column cleanup with liquid chromatography for determination of aflatoxin M1 in liquid milk: collaborative study  ap. 437-443.  aA collaborative study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an immunoaffinity column cleanup liquid chromatographic method for determination of aflatoxin M1 in milk at proposed European regulatory limits. The test portion of liquid milk was centrifuged, filtered, and applied to an immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with water, and aflatoxin was eluted with pure acetonitrile. Aflatoxin M1 was separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) with fluorescence detection. Frozen liquid milk samples both naturally contaminated with aflatoxin M1 and blank samples for spiking, were sent to 12 collaborators in 12 different European countries. Test portions of samples were spiked at 0.05 ng aflatoxin M1 per mL. After removal of 2 noncompliant sets of results, the mean recovery of aflatoxin M1 was 74%. Based on results for spiked samples (blind pairs at 1 level) and naturally contaminated samples (blind pairs at 3 levels) the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSD(r)) ranged from 8 to 18%. The relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSD(R)) ranged from 21 to 31%. The method showed acceptable within- and between-laboratory precision data for liquid milk, as evidenced by HORRAT values at the low level of aflatoxin M1 contamination. 3aaflatoxins 3afood contamination 3aliquid chromatography 3aimmunologic techniques 2aAflatoxin M1xanalysis 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aImmunochemistry 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aMilkxchemistry 2aReference Standards 2aSolutions 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 0aliquid milk1 aGrosso, F.1 aGilbert, J.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2001 , v. 84, no. 2 p.437-443x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02350naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014600145300001800291500012400309500001500433520077900448650001801227650002301245650002801268650001901296650001801315650002101333650002601354650001901380650004201399650002101441650003301462650001801495650002201513650003201535650002901567653001901596653001701615700001401632700001701646700001501663700001301678773008501691852000901776930003301785945001301818946001301831655001201844IND2049826720221119113500.0960212e199512  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204982672DNAL7 a86645942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFehrmann, A.10aDairy product analysis: identification of microorganisms by mid-infrared spectroscopy and determination of constituents by raman spectroscopy  ap. 1537-1542.  aPaper presented at the fourth international symposium of AOAC Europe section, September 29-30, 1994, Nyon, Switzerland.  a2019-12-05  aIdentification of microorganisms by traditional microbiological methods is time consuming. The German Federal Health Office has developed a method using mid-infrared spectroscopy to identify microorganisms rapidly. This method has been modified for application to microorganisms important in the dairy industry. Mid- and near-infrared spectroscopies are well-established methods for quantitative measurements of fat, protein, lactose, and solid content in a variety of products. A disadvantage of both methods is the huge absorption due to water; extraction of other components is complicated and can be achived only statistically. With Raman spectroscopy, water causes less absorption. We investigated the use of Raman spectroscopy as a quantitative method for milk powder. 3afood analysis 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3amicroorganisms 3arapid methods 3afood composition 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3adairy products 2aClostridiumxisolation & purification 2aCluster Analysis 2aDairy Productsxmicrobiology 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aSpectrophotometry, Infrared 2aSpectrum Analysis, Raman 0aidentification 0aspectroscopy1 aFranz, M.1 aHoffmann, A.1 aRudzik, L.1 aWust, E.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1995 , v. 78, no. 6 p.1537-1542x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02504naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015100126300001600277300002100293520162500314650001301939650003101952650001601983650001701999650002302016650001002039700001602049773008202065852000902147939003302156946001302189655001202202IND9004960620221119113716.0901009e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900496062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrust, G.E.10aInfluence of soil texture, soil moisture, organic cover, and weeds on oviposition preference of southern corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)  ap. 966-971.  ap. 966-971. ill.  aOviposition preferences of the southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi Barber, were investigated in greenhouse experiments where abiotic and biotic parameters were manipulated. Southern corn rootworm oviposition distance from corn seedlings was quantified. Four soil moistures, four soil textures, and the presence of weeds were examined in caged greenhouse experiments for their effect on southern corn rootworm oviposition preference. Additional experiments were conducted to elucidate southern corn rootworm oviposition preference for corn seedlings in the presence of broadleaf weeds, grass weeds, a wheat straw cover, or bare soil in large-cage experiments in the greenhouse. Southern corn rootworm adults oviposited > 90% of their eggs within 3 cm of a corn stem with <1% oviposited 10-15 cm from the plant. Soil moisture and texture significantly affected oviposition preference. Moist or wet soil and dark soils (moderately high in organic matter and clay) were preferred for oviposition. Significant interactions occurred between these two variables. The presence of weeds significantly increased the number of eggs oviposited and influenced the oviposition preference for particular soil moistures and textures. Southern corn rootworm adults preferred to feed on and oviposition in areas that contained broadleaf weeds compared with grass weeds, wheatstraw, or bare soil. The presence of a wheatstraw cover was significantly (P < 0.05) preferred to bare soil. We discuss how this study elucidates a number of seemingly contradictory field observations of southern corn rootworm infestations. 3aZea mays 3aDiabrotica undecimpunctata 3aoviposition 3asoil texture 3asoil water content 3aweeds1 aHouse, G.J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1990 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.966-971x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02382naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245007000179300001800249500002400267520095000291650002001241650002401261650003701285650001701322650002601339650001701365650001101382650002201393650001201415650001201427650002801439650002601467650001401493650002701507650003301534650001501567650003901582650002901621650002001650650001501670650002201685773009901707852000901806856008501815655001201900IND4385894820221119113730.0061210s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438589482DNAL7 a166098152pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-006-0762-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsgari, S.10aReplication of Heliothis virescens ascovirus in insect cell lines  ap. 1689-1699.  aIncludes references  aAscoviruses (AVs) infect larvae of various insect pests belonging to the family Noctuidae. The result of AV infection in the hosts is cleavage of infected cells into vesicles, a unique feature of AV infection. Since insect cell lines facilitate the study of virus life cycles, attempts were made to analyze Heliothis virescens AV (HvAV3e) infection in several cell lines and compare cell pathology to larval infection. In this study, replication and cytopathological effects of HvAV3e on four different cell lines were investigated. HvAV3e replication was confirmed in three noctuid cell lines from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and Helicoverpa zea (BCIRL-Hz-AM1 and FB33). However, the virus did not replicate in the non-noctuid insect cell line from Pieris rapae (Pieridae). Despite replication of the virus in the three permissive cell lines, the cytopathological effects of the virus were significantly different from that of larval infection. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aHeliothis virescens 3aHeliothis virescens ascovirus 3a 3aPieris rapae 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3avirus replication 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aAscoviridaexphysiology 2aButterfliesxvirology 2aCell Line 2aCell Nucleusxvirology 2aCytopathogenic Effect, Viral 2aMicroscopy 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMothsxvirology 2aSpodoptera 2aVirus Replication0 tArchives of virology.g2006 Sept., v. 151, no. 9 p.1689-1699dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-006-0762-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03085naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168100001600185245018000201300001400381500001500395520120300410650002501613650001501638650002601653650001401679650005001693650002101743650001301764650001701777650002101794650001901815650003701834650001401871650005801885650002401943650003401967650003002001650003602031650002202067650003402089650002902123650003102152650002502183650001902208650002102227651001002248653002002258700001502278700001702293773008102310852000902391930003302400945002502433946001302458655001202471IND4388188420221119113700.0070223e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438818842DNAL7 a173734382pmid7 aPMC32072132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Single-laboratory validation has been performed on the method to determine the repeatability, accuracy, selectivity, limit of detection/limit of quantification (LOQ), ruggedness, and linearity for p-synephrine and 5 other biogenic amines: octopamine, phenylephrine (m-synephrine), tyramine, N-methyltyramine, and hordenine, which may be present in bitter orange. p-Synephrine was found to be the primary biogenic amine present in all materials tested, accounting for >80% of the total biogenic amine content in all samples except a finished product. Repeatability precision for synephrine was between 1.48 and 3.55% RSD. Synephrine recovery was between 97.5 and 104%. The minor alkaloids were typically near the LOQ of the method (300-900 microgram/g) in the test materials, and between-day precision for the minor compounds was poor because interferences could sometimes be mistakenly identified as one of the minor analytes. Recoveries of the minor components ranged from 99.1 to 103% at approximately 6000 microgram/g spike level, to 90.7 to 120% at 300 microgram/g spike level. 3achemical composition 3aoctopamine 3aquantitative analysis 3aalkaloids 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aCitrus aurantium 3atyramine 3asour oranges 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3ahordenine 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3adietary supplements 3aOriental traditional medicine 2aBiogenic Aminesxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aCitrusxchemistry 2aDietary Supplementsxanalysis 2aPlant Extractsxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSynephrinexanalysis 2aThermodynamics 2aUltraviolet Rays 3aChina 0abiogenic amines1 aBetz, J.M.1 aHildreth, J.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2007 , v. 90, no. 1 p.68-81x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/03/12  aOther US 7aarticle02701naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001100164245011400175300001800289500002400307520099700331650002101328650001901349650002401368650003501392650001101427650001201438650001501450650002001465650002401485650001101509650001201520650001401532650004201546650001401588650002901602650003101631650004701662650004201709650003901751650006001790650002201850700001601872700001501888700001601903700001701919700001301936700002101949773009901970852000902069856006902078655001202147IND4385894920221119113650.0061210s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438589492DNAL7 a166098162pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-006-0757-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 at.wei.10aPns4 of rice dwarf virus is a phosphoprotein, is localized around the viroplasm matrix, and forms minitubules  ap. 1701-1712.  aIncludes references  aRice dwarf virus (RDV), a member of the family Reoviridae, has a 12-segmented dsRNA genome. Seven segments, designated S1, S2, S3, S5, S7, S8, and S9, encode structural proteins, while the remainder encode nonstructural proteins. One of the nonstructural proteins, Pns4, which is encoded by S4, was characterized. Pns4 was a phosphorylatable substrate in a phosphorylation assay in vivo; it associated with large cytoplasmic fibrils and formed novel minitubules in infected cultured cells of its leafhopper insect vector, as revealed by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Early in infection, Pns4 was detected at the periphery of the viroplasm, and it was then observed on amorphous or fibrillar inclusions, which were identified as bundles of minitubules, at later stages of infection. Since viroplasms are believed to be the site of RDV replication, the intracellular location of Pns4 suggests that this protein might be involved in the process of assembly of the RDV virion. 3aRice dwarf virus 3acultured cells 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenome 3ainsects 3amicroscopy 3aphosphorylation 3astructural proteins 3avirion 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCytoplasmxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aHemiptera 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aPhosphoproteinsxanalysisxultrastructure. 2aPlant Virusesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aReoviridaexchemistryxphysiology. 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxanalysisxultrastructure. 2aVirus Replication1 aKikuchi, A.1 aSuzuki, N.1 aShimizu, T.1 aHagiwara, K.1 aChen, H.1 aOhmura, Takashi.0 tArchives of virology.g2006 Sept., v. 151, no. 9 p.1701-1712dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-006-0757-43electronic resource 7aarticle01868naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001600218300002100234500001500255520087300270650002001143650001601163650002601179650002001205650001101225650001701236650001801253650002401271651001301295653001401308653001701322700001801339773008201357852000901439939003301448946001301481655001201494IND9005065320221119113648.0901017e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900506532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, M.P.10aFlight and diel activity of the threecornered alfalfa hopper (Homoptera: Membracidae)  ap. 677-683.  ap. 677-683. ill.  a2019-12-05  aThreecornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus (Say), flight activity in alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., and diel activity in alfalfa and soybean, Glycine max (L.)

Amount of activity and numbers of S. festinus increased as alfalfa grew from stubble to harvestable plants. Activity was significantly greatest between 1000 and 1200 hours, during which temperatures averaged from 33.9 to 37.8 degrees C. Limited flight occurred higher than normal during periods of greatest activity in alfalfa. Significantly more male than female S. festinus were trapped on the sticky traps, constrasting with a more balanced sex ratio found in sweep net samples.

It is believed that independent mutations at orthologous loci led to convergent domestication of cereal crops. To investigate genetic relationships of Triticeae shattering genes with those of other grasses, we mapped spike-, barrel- (B-type), and wedge-type (W-type) spikelet disarticulation genes in wheat and its wild relatives. The Br1 gene for W-type disarticulation was mapped to a region delimited by Xpsr598 and Xpsr1196 on the short arm of chromosomes 3A in Triticum timopheevii and 3S in Aegilops speltoides. The spike- and W-type disarticulation genes are allelic at Br1 in Ae. speltoides. The B-type disarticulation gene, designated as Br2, was mapped to an interval of 4.4 cM between Xmwg2013 and Xpsr170 on the long arm of chromosome 3D in Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of common wheat. Therefore, B- and W-type disarticulations are governed by two different orthologous loci on group-3 chromosomes. Based on map position, orthologs of Br1 and Br2 were not detected in barley, maize, rice, and sorghum, indicating multiple genetic pathways for shattering in grasses. The implications of the mapping results are discussed with regard to the evolution of polyploid wheat and domestication of cereals. 3aAegilops speltoides 3aAegilops tauschii 3aTriticum timopheevii 3abarley 3acorn 3aevolution 3agenes 3agrain crops 3agrasses 3aloci 3arice 3aseed dispersal 3aseed shattering 3awheat 3awild relatives 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgenetics 2aHordeumxgenetics 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPoaceaexgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait Locixphysiology 2aSeedsxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aTriticumxgenetics1 aGill, B.

Today, rice stands as a forerunner amongst the cereals in terms of details known on its genetics. Evidence show that salt tolerance in plants is a quantitative trait. Several traditional cultivars, landraces, and wild types of rice like Pokkali, CSR types, and Porteresia coarctata appear as promising materials for donation of requisite salt tolerance genes. A large number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for salt tolerance in rice through generation of recombinant inbred lines and are being mapped using different types of DNA markers. Salt-tolerant transgenic rice plants have been produced using a host of different genes and transcript profiling by micro- and macroarray-based methods has opened the gates for the discovery of novel salt stress mechanisms in rice, and comparative genomics is turning out to be a critical input in this respect. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the genetic, molecular biology, and comparative genomics effort towards the generation of salt-tolerant rice. From the data on comprehensive transcript expression profiling of clones representing salt-stress-associated genes of rice, it is shown that transcriptional and translational machineries are important determinants in controlling salt stress response, and gene expression response in tolerant and susceptible rice plants differs mainly in quantitative terms. 3aclones 3acultivars 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3ainbred lines 3alandraces 3amolecular biology 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress response 2aAcclimatizationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBreeding 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aModels, Biological 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSaltsxadverse effects1 aSingh, Amanjot1 aKumar, Krishan1 aBlumwald, Eduardo1 aGrover, Anil0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2006 Oct., v. 6, no. 4 p.263-284dSpringer-Verlagx1438-793X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-006-0032-53electronic resource 7aarticle03090naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245009500187300001600282500002400298500001500322520091400337650002201251650002101273650002401294650000901318650001101327650000901338650002301347650002001370650002801390650000701418650001501425650001101440650003201451650002101483650002701504650004601531650004601577650006301623650005001686650004001736650004001776650003101816650003001847650003001877650003101907650001501938650003301953650004801986650001602034650002502050650004002075650002302115650003502138653001402173700002002187700003502207773009602242852000902338856006902347655001202416IND4385897620221119111831.0061210s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438589762DNAL7 a168745482pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-005-0475-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWulff, Nelson Arno10aExpression and Purification of Cellulase Xf818 from Xylella fastidiosa in Escherichia coli  ap. 198-203.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aXylella fastidiosa was the first plant pathogen whose complete genome sequence was available. X. fastidiosa causes citrus variegated chlorosis, but the physiological basis of the disease in unknown. Through comparative sequence analysis, several putative plant cell wall-degrading enzymes were identified on the X. fastidiosa genome. We have cloned Xf818, a putative endoglucanase ORF, into expression vectors pET20b and pET28b, and purified a recombinant form of Xf818 containing a His₆ tag. Through biochemical assays, we have characterized the endoglucanase activity of this protein. The best conditions for hydrolysis over carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were on pH 5.2 at 65°C. Xf818 hydrolyzed CMC, acid swollen cellulose, Avicel, birch wood, oat spels xylans, and the oligosaccharides cellotetraose and cellopentaose. Xf818 carried out transglycosylation and had a functional cellulose-binding domain. 3asequence analysis 3aEscherichia coli 3aopen reading frames 3awood 3agenome 3aoats 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aplant pathogens 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3apH 3ahydrolysis 3aBetula 3acitrus variegated chlorosis 3aoligosaccharides 3acarboxymethylcellulose 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarboxymethylcellulose Sodiumxmetabolism 2aCellulasexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Thin Layerxmethods 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aOligosaccharidesxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTemperature 2aTetrosesxmetabolism 2aTransformation, Bacterialxgenetics 2aXylansxmetabolism 2aXylellaxenzymologyxgenetics. 0acellulose1 aCarrer, Helaine1 aPascholati, Sérgio Florentino0 tCurrent microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 53, no. 3 p.198-203dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-005-0475-23electronic resource 7aarticle01148naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245001600131300001400147300002200161500001500183520038900198650001600587650002300603650002300626653001300649653002600662653001300688773007000701852000900771939003300780945000800813946001300821655001200834991564478510742620221119111819.0891024e198905  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890017582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeifman, A.10aFit or fat?  ap. 13-14.  ap. 13-14. charts.  a2019-12-05  aObesity is considered a contributing factor in a number of health problems.

The VP2 genes of 22 isolates were sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared. The results indicated that the isolates belonged to CPV type 2a except four, which belonged to CPV type 2b. Comparison of the VP2 gene sequences revealed that the Indian isolates formed separate lineages distinct from the South East Asian isolates. The canine parvovirus isolates in India appear to evolve independently, and distinct geographical patterns of evolution could not be discerned in the isolates examined. 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aepidemiology 3aevolution 3adogs 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aCapsid Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aDogs 2aGenes, Viral 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aParvoviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aParvovirus, Caninexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology. 0aFeline panleukopenia virus1 aMohana Subramanian, B.1 aHanumantha Rao, N.1 aRangarajan, P.

Hydrolytic enzymes are accepted as key factors for the host penetration step and include chitinases. The characterization of the chi2 chitinase gene from M. anisopliae var. anisopliae is reported. The chi2 gene is interrupted by two short introns and is 1,542-bp long, coding a predicted protein of 419 amino acids with a stretch of 19 amino acid residues displaying characteristics of signal peptide. The predicted chitinase molecular mass is 44 kDa with a mature protein of 42 kDa and a theoretical pI of 4.8. The comparison of the CHI2 predicted protein to fungal orthologues revealed similarity to the glycohydrolase family 18 and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. The chi2 gene is up-regulated by chitin as a carbon source and in conditions of fungus autolysis, and is down-regulated by glucose. This regulation is consistent with the presence of putative CreA/Crel/Crr1 carbon catabolic repressor binding domains on the regulatory sequence. 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aarthropods 3aglucose 3amolecular weight 3aphylogeny 3achitinase 3atranscription (genetics) 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3afungi 3afungal proteins 3asignal peptide 3aautolysis 3agene expression regulation 3aintrons 3abiological control 2aBase Sequence 2aChitinasesxgenetics. 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aHypocrealesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods 2aTranscription Initiation Site 0agenes1 aDutra, Valéria1 aBoldo, Juliano Tomazzoni1 aLeiria, Leonardo Barbosa1 aVainstein, Marilene Henning1 aSchrank, Augusto0 tCurrent microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 53, no. 3 p.217-221dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-006-0078-63electronic resource 7aarticle00939naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245007900133300001100212520015000223650001000373650002300383650001700406650000800423650001000431653002100441700001600462773009800478852000900576939003300585945000800618946001100626655001200637991564476750742620221119112008.0930915e199112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930025192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinnock, C.B.10aSensory analysis and randomized, controlled trial of the milk-mucus belief  ap. 59.  aThe belief that "milk produces mucus" is widespread in the general community, and is associated with a significant reduction in milk consumption. 3amucus 3asensory evaluation 3afood beliefs 3amen 3awomen 0amilk consumption1 aArney, W.K.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society of Australia.g1991 Dec., v. 16 p.59-59x0314-10047nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01738naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245007700123300001600200300002100216520099100237650002301228650001901251650002001270700001701290700001601307773008201323852000901405939003301414946001301447655001201460IND9000875820221119112037.0900228e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900087582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, T.Y.10aCourtship and mating behavior of Bemisia tabaci (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae)  ap. 800-806.  ap. 800-806. ill.  aA description of the courtship and mating behavior of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is presented. Upon emergence, both sexes were clear winged and sexually immature. They matured during the next 24 h and their wings were coated with wax. Newly emerged males were attracted to 1-d-old females and sometimes initiated courtship that rarely persisted Males between 10 and 24 h old readily initiated courtship but failed to complete antennation. Newly emerged adult females were not attractive to males for about 10 h. Females accepted courting males 20-24 h after emergence. The precopulatory, copulatory,and postcopulatory behaviors, including the time spent at each step, are described for mature adults. Unsuccessful sexual encounters included male and female rejection, male-male interference, and misdirected sexual behavior. A comparison of the sexual behavior of B. tabaci and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) suggests that B. tabaci, like T. vaporariorum, may use a sex pheromone. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aBemisia tabaci 3amating behavior1 aVinson, S.B.1 aGerling, D.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1989 Oct., v. 18, no. 5 p.800-806x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00889naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245002500134300001400159300001900173520025000192650001200442650001200454650002300466773007100489852000900560939003300569945000800602946001300610655001200623991564476290742620221119112225.0920318e199201  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920006862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBialkowski, C.14aThe right resolution  ap. 14-15.  ap. 14-15. ill.  aLosing weight can benefit the mind and body.

Larvae of both species were found throughout the year in substrate samples taken from all vegetation types (including Spartina and Distichlis), but their relative distributions apparently changed according to annual tidal dynamics. Maximum larval production occurred when approximately equal flood index values were recorded; i.e., 0.22 (December-April) for Spartina and 0.20 (May-September) for Distichlis.

Mitigation strategies in the USA are typically bottom-up, combining risk assessments for individual poles into a utility-specific avian protection plan. This approach is usually reactive, relying on incidental documentation of electrocutions for initiation, and can allow uncoordinated mitigation strategies among adjacent utilities. A top-down strategy may help solve both problems if maps identifying where distribution power poles occur were available for comparison to range maps for species at risk of electrocution. Range maps exist but pole location data are rarely publicly available in the USA. Pole-density models were previously created for Colorado and Wyoming, the Great Basin, and the Columbia Plateau because pole density can serve as a surrogate for electrocution risk. We used each of these models to predict pole densities throughout four additional areas: the Northwestern Plains, Southwestern Plains, Southwestern Plateaus, and parts of New Mexico not included in other modeled areas. We also applied the Colorado and Wyoming model to portions of the Uinta Basin and Wyoming Basin projecting from Colorado and Wyoming into Idaho and Utah. The Colorado and Wyoming model fit all areas better than other models, except parts of New Mexico not included in other modeled areas, where the Great Basin model fit best. Our model predictions facilitate assessment of pole density across much (2,573,746 km²) of the western USA. To assess whether the models are useful in predicting electrocutions, we compared predicted pole densities throughout White Sands Missile Range to locations of 59 avian electrocutions. Electrocutions occurred at low rates in cells with low predicted pole densities, and at higher rates in cells with moderate and high predicted pole densities. Because the models do not include species-specific information, they have the potential to be applicable to the conservation of a wide variety of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abirds of prey 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aColorado 3aIdaho 3aNew Mexico 3aUtah 3aWyoming 0aGolden Eagle 0aAquila chrysaetos 0aelectric utility 0amodel 0arandom forest 0araptor1 aGerber, Brian D.1 aPetersen, Paul1 aArmstrong, William E.1 aHarness, Richard E.0 tJournal of raptor research.g2020 May 19, v. 54, no. 2 p.93-109dRaptor Research FoundationwJournal:19719x0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356/0892-1016-54.2.933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245009900210300002000309506007600329520140900405592002801814506003701842650001201879650001601891650001001907650001201917650001601929653002301945653002101968700002101989700001602010700002602026700002102052700001902073700002602092700001602118700001902134700001902153700002202172700002802194700001802222700002102240700002402261700002402285700002002309700001902329700001902348700002202367700002202389700001502411700001902426700001602445700001802461700002302479700002102502700002302523700002002546700001802566700002502584700002202609700002202631700002702653773017602680856007902856852000902935655001202944IND60173779820221207112018.0150603e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017377982DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12178121102doi7 aPMC37522042pmcid7 a239183852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEconomides, Aris N.10aConditionals by inversion provide a universal method for the generation of conditional alleles  ap. E3179-E3188.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConditional mutagenesis is becoming a method of choice for studying gene function, but constructing conditional alleles is often laborious, limited by target gene structure, and at times, prone to incomplete conditional ablation. To address these issues, we developed a technology termed conditionals by inversion (COIN). Before activation, COINs contain an inverted module (COIN module) that lies inertly within the antisense strand of a resident gene. When inverted into the sense strand by a site-specific recombinase, the COIN module causes termination of the target gene’s transcription and simultaneously provides a reporter for tracking this event. COIN modules can be inserted into natural introns (intronic COINs) or directly into coding exons as part of an artificial intron (exonic COINs), greatly simplifying allele design and increasing flexibility over previous conditional KO approaches. Detailed analysis of over 20 COIN alleles establishes the reliability of the method and its broad applicability to any gene, regardless of exon–intron structure. Our extensive testing provides rules that help ensure success of this approach and also explains why other currently available conditional approaches often fail to function optimally. Finally, the ability to split exons using the COIN’s artificial intron opens up engineering modalities for the generation of multifunctional alleles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3aengineering 3aexons 3aintrons 3amutagenesis 0agenome engineering 0aconditional-null1 aFrendewey, David1 aYang, Peter1 aDominguez, Melissa G.1 aDore, Anthony T.1 aLobov, Ivan B.1 aPersaud, Trikaldarshi1 aRojas, Jose1 aMcClain, Joyce1 aLengyel, Peter1 aDroguett, Gustavo1 aChernomorsky, Rostislav1 aStevens, Sean1 aAuerbach, Wojtek1 aDeChiara, Thomas M.1 aPouyemirou, William1 aCruz, Joseph M.1 aFeeley, Kieran1 aMellis, Ian A.1 aYasenchack, Jason1 aHatsell, Sarah J.1 aXie, LiQin1 aLatres, Esther1 aHuang, Lily1 aZhang, Yuhong1 aPefanis, Evangelos1 aSkokos, Dimitris1 aDeckelbaum, Ron A.1 aCroll, Susan D.1 aDavis, Samuel1 aValenzuela, David M.1 aGale, Nicholas W.1 aMurphy, Andrew J.1 aYancopoulos, George D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 110, no. 34 p.E3179-E3188dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12178121103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011200166300001600278520079700294592002801091650002101119650003001140650001901170650001501189650001901204650001901223650002401242650001301266650003701279653003001316653002601346653002101372653001801393653001401411700001801425700002101443700001801464773011601482856008601598852000901684655001201693IND60551901220221116161056.0161019e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055190122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Jun10aMurein hydrolase activity of surface layer proteins from Lactobacillus acidophilus against Escherichia coli  ap. 527-532.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the murein hydrolase activities of the surface layer proteins (SLPs) from two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus using zymography.

A systematic review  ap. 797-810.  aREVIEW  aThe role of enteral feeding with fiber‐enriched feeds in minimizing infections, shortening length of hospital stay (LOHS), and preventing or treating feeding complications has been widely researched. However, there is limited evidence to evaluate the role of fiber‐enriched enteral feeding in gastrointestinal surgery patients postoperatively. This systematic review aims to identify the role of fiber‐enriched enteral feeds on postoperative feeding complications of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, flatulence, cramps, LOHS, and infection rates after gastrointestinal surgery. A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. Manual reference lists were searched on identified studies and the SCOPUS database. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted on any gastrointestinal surgery type that included enteral nutrition with high‐fiber enteral feeds and/or fiber supplements were included. All studies included were screened for risk of bias with Cochrane's risk‐of‐bias tool, and data were extracted with Cochrane Collaboration's data extraction tool. In total, 3 RCTs out of 231 screened citations including fiber‐enriched feeds and probiotics were included in this review. No significant effect on LOHS or postoperative infections was found. No safety risks were identified. Limited, low‐quality evidence suggests fiber‐enriched feeds may minimize diarrhea incidence. The effects of fiber‐enriched feeds postoperatively in gastrointestinal surgery remain under‐researched. Studies evaluating fiber and probiotics were low quality and at high risk of bias because of the misreporting of outcomes and the lack of detailed outlines of probiotic strains utilized. However, fiber‐enriched enteral feeding appears safe, may yield benefits, and is recommended in stable gastrointestinal surgical patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adiarrhea 3aenteral feeding 3aflatulence 3agastrointestinal system 3ahospitals 3anausea 3aprobiotics 3arisk 3asurgery 3asystematic review1 aDavies, Robert0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2022 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.797-810dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.108053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245014400168300002000312520151000332592002801842650002601870650002001896650001001916650003101926650002101957650002201978650002102000650001302021650001602034653003602050653002302086653003002109653001502139653001902154700006002173700002502233700006202258700005802320700002302378700001902401700006102420700006102481773014202542856007802684852000902762655001202771IND60689671020221120151119.0200422e20200413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068967102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c008032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuvaraja, Saravanan10aRealization of an Ultrasensitive and Highly Selective OFET NO₂ Sensor: The Synergistic Combination of PDVT-10 Polymer and Porphyrin–MOF  ap. 18748-18760.  aOrganic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are emerging as competitive candidates for gas sensing applications due to the ease of their fabrication process combined with the ability to readily fine-tune the properties of organic semiconductors. Nevertheless, some key challenges remain to be addressed, such as material degradation, low sensitivity, and poor selectivity toward toxic gases. Appropriately, a heterojunction combination of different sensing layers with multifunctional capabilities offers great potential to overcome these problems. Here, a novel and highly sensitive receptor layer is proposed encompassing a porous 3D metal–organic framework (MOF) based on isostructural-fluorinated MOFs acting as an NO₂ specific preconcentrator, on the surface of a stable and ultrathin PDVT-10 organic semiconductor on an OFET platform. Here, with this proposed combination we have unveiled an unprecedented 700% increase in sensitivity toward NO₂ analyte in contrast to the pristine PDVT-10. The resultant combination for this OFET device exhibits a remarkable lowest detection limit of 8.25 ppb, a sensitivity of 680 nA/ppb, and good stability over a period of 6 months under normal laboratory conditions. Further, a negligible response (4.232 nA/%RH) toward humidity in the range of 5%–90% relative humidity was demonstrated using this combination. Markedly, the obtained results support the use of the proposed novel strategy to achieve an excellent sensing performance with an OFET platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3agases 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrogen dioxide 3arelative humidity 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3atransistors 0aorganic field-effect transistor 0aconjugated polymer 0ametal−organic framework 0aNO2 sensor 0aheterojunction1 aSurya, Sandeep G1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3425-12651 aChernikova, Valeriya1 aVijjapu, Mani Teja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1386-06891 aShekhah, Osama1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1861-92261 aBhatt, Prashant M.1 aChandra, Suman1 aEddaoudi, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1916-98371 aSalama, Khaled N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7742-12820 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Apr. 13, v. 12, no. 16 p.18748-18760dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c008033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245011800173300001600291520120400307592002801511650001701539650001301556650001501569650002601584650001701610650001901627650001901646650002101665653002801686653001701714653004301731653002601774700002301800700002101823700001801844700001901862700001801881773013901899856007902038852000902117655001202126IND60720267820221119191818.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026782DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietroń, Wojciech Jerzy10aDetermination of five sulfonamides in medicated feedingstuffs by liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection  ap. 545-552.  aA fast and reliable method of liquid chromatography and ultraviolet detection of sulfaguanidine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethizole, and sulfamethoxazole in feedingstuffs was described. The method involves THE procedure of preparation of spiked samples, and extraction of sulphonamides from the matrix using a mixture of methanol and acetonitrile, followed by drying the extract and dissolving it in a phosphate buffer. The analysis uses octadecyl (C18) analytical column with UV detection at λ = 260 nm and a gradient programme of mobile phase composition. The analytical procedure has been successfully adopted and validated for quantitative determination of the sulfonamides in feedingstuff samples. Validation included sensitivity, specificity, linearity, repeatability, and intra-laboratory reproducibility. The mean recovery of sulfonamides was 84%, within the working range of 200-2000 mg/kg. Direct, simple sample preparation and HPLC-UV analysis allow the method to be successfully included in the scope of routine analyses. The presented results could be an answer to a need of simple and easy method for sulfonamide determination applicable in medicated feedingstuffs analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3amethanol 3aphosphates 3aquantitative analysis 3asulfadiazine 3asulfamethazine 3asulfamethizole 3asulfamethoxazole 0amedicated feedingstuffs 0asulfonamides 0ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0aultraviolet detection1 aCybulski, Wojciech1 aKrasucka, Dorota1 aMitura, Agata1 aKos, Katarzyna1 aAntczak, Maja0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 57, no. 4 p.545-552dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010000161300001600261520080900277592002801086650000801114650000901122650001101131650002001142650002301162650002201185650001401207653001501221653001001236653002301246653003001269653000801299700002501307700002001332700002301352773013901375856007901514852000901593655001201602IND60720267920221119191919.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026792DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiner, Anna10aDNA based approaches for the detection and identification of bovine meat and bone meal in feeds  ap. 553-557.  aThe aim of this paper was to present the results of comparative evaluation of the usefulness of PCR method for the detection and identification of bovine DNA in feeds. In the validation study, the limit of detection for PCR was determined as 0.05% for bovine meat and bone meal (MBM). Among 132 feed samples, bovine DNA was detected in eight (6.06%) samples. In the next stage of the study, sediment and flotate from the investigated samples were examined with PCR. Out of 132 sediment and flotate samples, bovine DNA was detected in eight (6.06%) and nine (6.82%) samples, respectively. On the basis of the results obtained with the use of the PCR, it is possible to state that the molecular biology methods can, at present, be used as supplementary tools for detection and identification of bovine MBM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abeef 3acattle 3adetection limit 3ameat and bone meal 3amolecular biology 3asediments 0abovine DNA 0afeeds 0ameat and bone meal 0aprocessed animal proteins 0aPCR1 aGołębiowska, Agata1 aPaprocka, Ilona1 aKwiatek, Krzysztof0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 57, no. 4 p.553-557dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245011300164300001600277520143600293592002801729650001601757650001201773650001001785650002301795650001301818653002301831653000901854653001401863653003501877653001401912700002101926700002101947773012301968856007802091852000902169655001202178IND60774676020221121175351.0220422e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467602DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2013.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTharwat, Mohamed10aCardiac troponin I in healthy newborn goat kids and in goat kids with cardiac nutritional muscular dystrophy  ap. 442-453.  aThis study was designed to establish serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentrations in healthy newborn goat kids and in those with cardiac nutritional muscular dystrophy (NMD). Thirty-five single full-term newborn goat kids (20 males and 15 females; age: 6.1 ± 3.5 h; weight 3.4 ± 0.68 kg), together with their respective mothers (Group 1; G1) were enrolled consecutively. Thirty-one goat kids (age: 9.5 ± 4.3 days) with NMD, together with 20 control goat kids (age: 7.8 ± 4.3 days) were also included in this study (Group 2; G2). Blood samples were collected from G1 within 12 h of birth and from G2 on admission. Serum samples were collected and analysed for cTnI. In G1, the mean serum concentration of cTnI in goat kids was 0.290 ± 0.37 ng/mL, with no statistically significant difference between male and female kids (P = 0.61). The mean cTnI concentration in the does was 0.017 ± 0.04, ng/mL. Serum values of cTnI in the goat kids and in their respective mothers differed significantly (P = 0.0001). In G2, the mean cTnI concentration was 0.02 ± 0.05 ng/mL in the control and 11.18 ± 20.07 ng/mL in the diseased goat kids, with a statistically significant difference between diseased and control goat kids (P = 0.017). Serum concentrations of cTnI are higher in goat kids than in their respective mothers. In conclusion, the cTnI assay appears to be a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury in goat kids.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3afemales 3amales 3amuscular dystrophy 3aneonates 0aCardiac biomarkers 0acTnI 0agoat kids 0anutritional muscular dystrophy 0atroponins1 aAl-Sobayil, Fahd1 aEl-Sayed, Mehana0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 61, no. 4 p.442-453dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2013.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011800170300001400288520139800302592002801700650001701728650001201745650002501757650001601782650001401798650001501812650001701827650001101844650001701855650002101872650002001893650001401913650001501927653002001942653002801962653002001990653001702010653001202027653001002039700001502049700001702064700001602081773014202097856008702239852000902326655001202335IND60773715320221122023030.0220419e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077371532DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-0112.2022.00008.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJavid, Rehana10aInfluence of irrigation levels and phenological stages on yield and quality attributes of sweet cherry cv.

Regina grafted on Gisela-5 rootstock to determine the critical stage of specific moisture regime to maximize the yield of quality fruits. During the course of present study, the irrigation was applied at four different phenological stages (fruit set, pit hardening, fruit growth, and fruit bud differentiation) of sweet cherry through drip irrigation, maintaining the four moisture regimes (control, 50% ETc, 75% ETc and 100% ETc). The highest fruit weight, fruit size and yield were noted with 100% (I₃) ETc level of irrigation at fruit growth stage (T₃), which was at statistically at par with 75% irrigation level. Highest yield efficiency was recorded under 100% ETc (I₃) irrigation regime at pit hardening (T₂) stage. The highest content of fruit TSS was recorded with 50% ETc level of irrigation (I₁) applied at fruit growth stage (T₃). Highest fruit acidity was observed with 100% ETc (I₃) level of irrigation applied at fruit bud differentiation stage (T₄). Highest value of TSS/acidity was observed with 50% ETc (I₁) irrigation regime applied at fruit bud differentiation stage (T₄). Trees subjected to irrigation at 100% and 75% ETc regime during fruit growth (T₃) and fruit bud differentiation stage (T₄) excelled for yield and quality characters over other stages and moisture regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3aacidity 3adevelopmental stages 3afruit acids 3afruit set 3afruit size 3afruit weight 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3airrigation rates 3amicroirrigation 3aphenology 3arootstocks 0aPrunus avium L. 0aCrop evapotranspiration 0aDrip irrigation 0aFruit growth 0aQuality 0aYield1 aWani, W.M.1 aRather, G.H.1 aGanai, N.A.0 tIndian journal of horticulture.g2022 Mar., v. 79, no. 1 p.50-55dIndian Academy of Horticultural ScienceswJournal:2099x0974-01127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-0112.2022.00008.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245009300175300001600268520116300284592002801447650001301475650001101488650002101499650001901520650002501539650001601564650001601580650000701596650002301603650001501626650001001641653001701651653001501668653001501683653002301698653002201721700003201743700002501775700002001800700001901820773013901839856007901978852000902057655001202066IND60720268020221119191658.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026802DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoźniak-Sobczak, Barbara,10aScreening and confirmatory GC-MS methods for the detection of trenbolone in bovine urine  ap. 559-566.  aSensitive and selective methods for the screening (GC-MS) and confirmatory analysis (GC-MS/MS) of 17α- and 17β- trenbolone in bovine urine were developed. In the first stage of the analysis, the enzymatic hydrolysis of trenbolone metabolites with glucuronidase AS-HP in acetate buffer (pH 5.2) solution was carried out. Free compounds were extracted from urine with diethyl ether. For the purification of the extract solid phase, extraction with C18 and NH2 columns was applied. The evaporated extract was subjected to two derivatisation steps; the first with MSTFA/I2 solution and second with MSTFA. The separation of the analytes on HP-5 ms capillary column was conducted. The methods were validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. For GC-MS method, CCα and CCβ were 0.21-0.36 μg L⁻¹ for 17α- trenbolone and 0.20-0.34 μg L⁻¹ for 17β- trenbolone, while for GC-MS/MS method the values were lower and amounted to 0.15-0.25 μg L⁻¹ for 17α- trenbolone and 0.20-0.34 μg L⁻¹ for 17β-trenbolone. Method recoveries in spiked samples ranged from 86%-111% with standard deviation lower than 25% for both detection techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acattle 3achemical species 3aderivatization 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethyl ether 3ametabolites 3apH 3astandard deviation 3atrenbolone 3aurine 0abovine urine 0atrenbolone 0avalidation 0agas chromatography 0amass spectrometry1 aMatraszek-Żuchowska, Iwona1 aSemeniuk, Stanisław1 aKłopot, Alicja1 aŻmudzki, Jan,0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 57, no. 4 p.559-566dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003200146245014100178300001600319520208500335592002802420650001602448650001602464650001002480650002202490650001002512650002002522650002302542650001602565650000702581650002002588650001202608650002502620653001202645653001202657653001202669653002102681653002502702653002002727700002102747700001802768700001302786773012302799856008102922852000903003655001203012IND60774676120221121175334.0220422e20021001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467612DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.50.2002.4.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZomborszky-Kovács, Melinda10aEffect of double nursing on some anatomical and physiological properties of the digestive tract of rabbits between 23 and 44 days of age  ap. 445-457.  aAnatomical and physiological properties of the digestive tract were examined and compared in young rabbits nursed either by one (SS) or by two does (DD) daily up to the age of 35 days. At the age of 23, 30, 37 and 44 days, 8 young per treatment were euthanised. Double suckling and the subsequent higher level of solid feed intake after weaning were found to exert a stronger influence on the weight of the entire gastrointestinal tract and that of its individual parts (the stomach, small intestine, caecum and colon) than on its length. The quantity of the gastric content was found to rise with advancing age in both groups (from 36 to 70g and from 37.5 to 79g). In both groups the pH of the stomach was higher during the suckling period (4.5-5.3) than subsequent to weaning (1.6-2.4). The quantity of the caecal content also increased with age (from 4 or 8g), but on the 37th day significantly higher quantities of caecal content were recorded in DD rabbits (50.5g compared with 35g). The pH of the caecal content decreased more slowly from an initial high value (6.0 and 6.5 in SS and DD rabbits, respectively), and by the 37th day had settled at a low value (5.7-5.8) in both groups. The dry matter content of the caecal content decreased from 270-273g to 188-207g in both groups. Total volatile fatty acid (tVFA) and acetic acid (C2) concentration, which amounted to 66-88% of tVFA, rose; in SS rabbits they were at higher levels by the 30th day (53.6 and 42.2mmol/L, respectively), and remained at an increased level until the 44th day (P<0.05). The ratio of C3:C4 was high on the 23rd day (2.5 and 2.4), but dropped at the age of 30 days (0.5 in SS and 1.7 in DD, P<0.05) and, further, by the 37th day (0.2 in SS). In SS rabbits coliform count proved significantly lower (10⁵) on the 23rd day than in DD rabbits (10⁶). By the 37th day this count had decreased in both groups and subsequently remained at a low level (<10⁴). By the 23rd day Bacteroides were present in large quantities (10⁸) in the caecum and showed no change with advancing age or feeding regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aacetic acid 3acecum 3acoliform bacteria 3acolon 3adigestive tract 3adry matter content 3afeed intake 3apH 3asmall intestine 3astomach 3avolatile fatty acids 0arabbits 0arabbits 0arabbits 0aDigestive system 0adigestive physiology 0adouble suckling1 aGyarmati, Tünde1 aSzendrő, Zs.1 aet al., 0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2002 Oct. 1, v. 50, no. 4 p.445-457dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.50.2002.4.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018200172300001400354500001500368520140900383592002801792650002401820650001501844650001901859650002801878650001301906650002201919650001801941650001801959650002701977650001302004650001302017650002502030650001802055650001402073653002802087653002802115653002902143653001902172653001302191653001702204700001802221700001902239700002202258700002402280700002602304700002402330773011402354856008602468852000902554655001202563IND60551901520221116161216.0161019e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055190152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Afsoon10aNovel curcumin-based pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine anti-oxidant inhibitors for α-amylase and α-glucosidase: Implications for their pleiotropic effects against diabetes complications  ap. 46-55.  a2019-12-06  aCurcumin (bis-α,β-unsaturated β-diketone), the chief constituent of turmeric plant (Curcuma longa), plays significant role in prevention of various diseases including diabetes. The research objective in the current study was to synthesize novel anti-diabetic curcumin derivatives with inhibitory properties against α-amylase (α-Amy) and α-glucosidase (α-Gls), as these two carbohydrate-hydrolysing enzymes are known to be important molecular targets for attenuation of postprandial hyperglycemia. The curcumin-based pyrano[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives were synthesized in the presence of curcumin, barbituric acids and aldehydes, using a multi-component reaction (MCR). Also, their inhibitory properties against α-Amy and α-Gls were evaluated spectroscopically. The curcumin-derived compounds with two invariant substructures (curcumin-based subunit and barbituric acid moiety) and one variable aryl (Ar) group demonstrated inhibitory action against α-Amy and α-Gls. Moreover, the synthetic compounds revealed prominent antioxidant activities, when examined by a 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) decolorization assay system. Overall, these antioxidant inhibitors are potentially important anti-diabetic drugs, not only to restore euglysemic condition, but also to limit activity of the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing pathways in diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahypoglycemic agents 3apleiotropy 3adecolorization 3areactive oxygen species 3aturmeric 3aalpha-glucosidase 3ahyperglycemia 3aCurcuma longa 3adiabetic complications 3apatients 3acurcumin 3aantioxidant activity 3aalpha-amylase 3aaldehydes 0aAnti-diabetic compounds 0aReactive oxygen species 0aMulti-component reaction 0aα-Glucosidase 0aCurcumin 0aantioxidants1 aYousefi, Reza1 aPanahi, Farhad1 aSarikhani, Samira1 aZolghadr, Amin Reza1 aBahaoddini, Aminollah1 aKhalafi-Nezhad, Ali0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 July, v. 78 p.46-55dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015100168300001600319520098000335592002801315650001201343650002001355650002001375650001701395650001901412650002001431650001601451650001101467650001401478650001201492650003301504650002801537653002801565653001501593653002201608700001701630700001901647700001601666700001601682700001701698700001601715700002101731700002001752773014601772856008301918852000902001655001202010IND60647377320221119100815.0190718e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064737732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Chi-Chang10aCorrelation analysis of [18F]ROStrace using ex vivo autoradiography and dihydroethidium fluorescent imaging in lipopolysaccharide-treated animals  ap. 397-401.  aReactive oxygen species (ROS) are believed to play an important role in the proinflammatory form of neuroinflammation. Therefore, the availability of a radiotracer labeled with a positron-emitting radionuclide that can measure levels of ROS in tissue could provide a valuable method for imaging neuroinflammation in vivo with the functional imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET). We previously reported the synthesis and in vivo evaluation of [18F]ROStrace, a radiotracer for imaging ROS in vivo with PET, in an LPS model of neuroinflammation. In the current study, we conducted additional validation studies aimed at determining the cellular localization of this radiotracer in the same model. Our results indicate that [18F]ROStrace is primarily localized in microglia/macrophages and neurons in LPS-treated animals, and provide further support in the use of this radiotracer as a PET-based probe for imaging the proinflammatory form of neuroinflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aautoradiography 3adihydroethidium 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3ain vivo studies 3amacrophages 3amodels 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3apositron-emission tomography 3areactive oxygen species 0aReactive oxygen species 0aSuperoxide 0aNeuroinflammation1 aCarlin, Sean1 aHou, Catherine1 aMetz, Tyler1 aLi, Shihong1 aLee, Hsiaoju1 aXu, Kuiying1 aMakvandi, Mehran1 aMach, Robert H.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 516, no. 2 p.397-401dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009500166300001600261520139500277592002801672650001701700650001701717650001401734650001801748650001001766650001401776650000901790650001201799650001001811650001901821650001101840650002501851650001201876650001001888650001501898650001701913650001301930650002601943653001701969653002501986653000802011653001502019700002402034700002602058700002202084700001802106773012302124856007802247852000902325655001202334IND60774676220221122065837.0220422e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467622DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2012.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalofaro, Vincenzo10aBeta-catenin expression in pilomatrix carcinoma with multiple visceral metastases in a dog  ap. 449-457.  aBeta-catenin is a protein initially identified as a submembrane component of the E-cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell adhesion system. It plays a role as a transcriptional factor in the wingless/Wnt signalling pathway. Beta-catenin has been associated with oncogenic activity in human benign and malignant pilomatrix neoplasms where the immunohistochemical profile of β-catenin expression displayed both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in basaloid cells. In this study, an 8-year-old female Irish setter dog was examined because of the presence of skin nodules. Tissue biopsies from different nodules were obtained and histological examination suggested a diagnosis of pilomatrix carcinoma. The dog spontaneously died after 2 months and necropsy showed multiple metastases in the nasal cavity, lungs, heart, kidney, liver and colon. Routine histopathology of metastatic sites showed features consistent with the pattern of primary neoplastic nodules. Immunohistochemical detection of β-catenin was performed in both the primary tumour and the metastases. Beta-catenin expression was located in the nuclei, cytoplasm and membrane of squamoid cells and in the cytoplasm of basaloid cells, while shadow cells were completely negative. To the best of our knowledge, these data represent the first report on the immunohistochemical expression profile of β-catenin in canine pilomatrix carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIrish Setter 3abeta catenin 3acarcinoma 3acell adhesion 3acolon 3acytoplasm 3adogs 3afemales 3aheart 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3aliver 3ametastasis 3anasal cavity 3anecropsy 3atranscription factors 0aSkin tumours 0apilomatrix carcinoma 0adog 0aβ-catenin1 aRapisarda, Giuseppe1 aSfacteria, Alessandra1 aLanteri, Giovanni1 aMarino, Fabio0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 60, no. 4 p.449-457dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2012.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03934naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011200177506011700289506007600406520197800482592002802460506003702488650003102525650002202556650001902578650001402597650001502611650001702626650001402643650001402657650001502671650002902686650001802715650002402733650001702757651001102774653003102785653002202816653001402838653002302852653001702875700002802892700002402920700002802944700003302972700002903005700002303034700002803057700002903085700003203114773011603146856008503262852000903347655001203356IND60743987720221207133320.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074398772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1049942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdaz-Vázquez, Anabel10aGenetic diversity and primary drug resistance transmission in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in southern Mexico  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTuberculosis is a global human health threat, especially in developing countries. The present study aimed to describe the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to measure the transmission rates of primary and acquired resistance. A total of 755 M. tuberculosis isolates from a cohort study of patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in Orizaba, Veracruz, performed between 1995 and 2010 were genotyped by the 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit–variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) method. Drug susceptibility was determined. Logistic regression models were constructed to identify the variables associated with resistance and clusters. The recent transmission index (RTI), the Hunter-Gaston discrimination index (HGDI) for the MIRU-VNTR test and allelic diversity (h) were calculated. The Haarlem and LAM lineages were the most common in the population. A total of 519 isolates were grouped into 128 clusters. The overall drug resistance rate was 19%, isoniazid monoresistance (10%) was the most common, and 3.4% of the isolates were multidrug resistant. Among the 116 isolates resistant to at least one drug, the primary and acquired resistance rates were 81.9% and 18.1%, respectively. Primary resistance was associated with belonging to a cluster (aOR 4.05, 95% CI 1.5–11.2, p = 0.007). Previous treatment history (aOR 9.05, 95% CI 3.6–22.5, p < 0.001) and LAM lineage (aOR 4.25, 95% CI 1.4–12.7, p = 0.010) were associated with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The RTI was 51.7%, and the 24-locus MIRU-VNTR HGDI was 0.98. The alleles with the greatest diversity were 4056-QUB26 (h = 0.84), 2163b-QUB11b (h = 0.79), and 424-Mtub04 (h = 0.72). Primary resistance transmission, high LAM lineage prevalence and its association with MDR-TB represent public health problems. The implementation of molecular tools is needed to improve the existing control surveillance tuberculosis program.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aallelic variation 3acohort studies 3aevolution 3agenotyping 3ahuman health 3ainfection 3aisoniazid 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3atuberculosis 3aMexico 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis 0aGenetic diversity 0aMIRU-VNTR 0aPrimary resistance 0aTransmission1 aTorres-González, Pedro1 aCruz-Hervert, Pablo1 aFerreyra-Reyes, Leticia1 aDelgado Sánchez, Guadalupe,1 aGarcía-García, Lourdes1 aKato-Maeda, Midori1 aPonce-De-León, Alfredo1 aSifuentes-Osornio, José1 aBobadilla-Del-Valle, Miriam0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Sept., v. 93 p.104994-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1049943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009100160300002000251520044000271592002800711650001600739650001600755650001100771650002300782650002300805650000900828650002200837650002200859700001500881700001100896700001400907700001900921700001700940773012100957856008101078852000901159655001201168IND60550486920221119075632.0160911e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b017462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Zuhai10aSynthesis of Sterically Protected Xanthene Dyes with Bulky Groups at C-3′ and C-7′  ap. 11538-11543.  aSubstitution of the xanthene scaffold with bulky groups at C-3′ and C-7′ is expected to protect the electrophilic central methine carbon against nucleophilic attack and inhibit stacking.

The Ang II/type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling pathway can cause endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) dysfunction through various mechanisms leading to ED. The modulation of eNOS phosphorylated at Ser1177 is an important mechanism upregulating eNOS activity. Protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) has been reported to dephosphorylate eNOS at Ser1177. The PP2A inhibitor 2 protein (I2PP2A) is a specific endogenous inhibitor that binds the catalytic subunit of PP2A and directly inhibits PP2A activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that Ang II might attenuate I2PP2A expression to activate PP2A, which downregulates eNOS Ser 1177 phosphorylation, leading to eNOS dysfunction. In our study, we used Ang II-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and, found that the eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation levels were downregulated, the activity of PP2A was increased, and I2PP2A expression was decreased. Furthermore, these effects were blocked by candesartan (CAN). The phosphorylation levels of eNOS Ser1177 were decreased after I2PP2A was knocked down by specific siRNA but increased after I2PP2A overexpression. We also found that the Ang II treatment decreased the association of I2PP2A with PP2A but increased the association between PP2A and eNOS. Taken together, our results suggest that Ang II activates PP2A by downregulating the I2PP2A expression through the AT1R signaling pathway leading to the loss of eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation and ED.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin II 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3agene overexpression 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein subunits 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 0aAngiotensin II 0aAngiotensin II type 1 receptor 0aEndothelial NO synthase 0aProtein phosphatase 2A 0aI2PP2A 0aEndothelial dysfunction1 aZhang, Qian1 aDing, Jing1 aYu, Min1 aJiang, Juncai1 aYang, Fei1 aWang, Shengnan1 aWang, Alei1 aWang, Lingxiao1 aWu, Shan1 aXia, Yong1 aLu, Deqin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Aug. 27, v. 516, no. 3 p.613-618dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.06.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009700161300001600258520132900274592002801603650001301631650001301644650000901657650001401666650001401680650003001694650001301724650002601737650001001763650001901773650001701792650001101809651001201820651001101832653002201843653000901865653001601874653002301890653002201913700001701935700002901952700003101981700001902012773013902031856007902170852000902249655001202258IND60720268320221119191833.0210822e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026832DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinta, Maria10aInfluence of dietary soy isoflavones on immature hamster uterotrophic and Hershberger assays  ap. 579-585.  aTo select appropriate diet for hamsters used in the uterotrophic and Hershberger assays two rodent diets were compared: Murigran (Agropol, Poland) and Altromin 7010 (Altromin Spezialfutter GmbH&Co., Germany). The contents of bioactive compounds in feeds were evaluated by liquid chromatography, and their oestrogenic activity by yeast enhanced green fluorescent protein assay. In opposition to Altromin, Murigran contained high amounts (μg/kg) of genistein (765 600) and daidzein (132 000), and the oestrogenic activity of these compounds, expressed as 17β-oestradiol equivalent concentration (EEQ), was found to be 9.54 μg EEQ/kg. In in vivo study, Murigran induced a high degree of oestrogenisation in immature hamsters, and females failed to exhibit a normal uterine response to recommended dose of a model oestrogen agonist 17α-ethinyloestradiol. There was no influence of the diet on the weight of five accessory sex organs (ASO): ventral prostate, seminal vesicles with coagulating glands, levator ani bulbocavernosus muscles, Cowper`s glands, and glans penis of control males. However, the impact on ASO response to model androgen agonist, testosterone propionate was observed. The obtained results provide the evidence that phytooestrogen-rich feed modulates the oestrogenic and androgenic response to chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3adaidzein 3adiet 3aestrogens 3agenistein 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahamsters 3aliquid chromatography 3apenis 3apropionic acid 3atestosterone 3ayeasts 3aGermany 3aPoland 0aimmature hamsters 0adiet 0aisoflavones 0auterotrophic assay 0aHershberger assay1 aRadko, Lidia1 aStypuła-Trębas, Sylwia1 aWoźniak-Sobczak, Barbara,1 aŻmudzki, Jan,0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 57, no. 4 p.579-585dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245013200168300001600300520087500316592002801191650001601219650001801235650001501253650001501268651001101283653002501294653002901319653003201348653002001380653002401400700001801424700002001442700002101462773012301483856007801606852000901684655001201693IND60774676420221122065907.0220422e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467642DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2014.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGáspárdy, András,10aElectronic monitoring of rumination activity as an indicator of health status and production traits in high-yielding dairy cows  ap. 452-462.  aIn view of the demonstrated relationship between rumination time and health status, the general welfare and metabolic condition of ruminants are often assessed by the examination of rumen function. The main goal of this study was to monitor the daily rumination activity (RA) and its connection with actual liveweight (LW), milk yield (MY) and with two diseases (subclinical hyperketonaemia — SHK, uterine disease — UD) in 96 cows on the basis of a total of 1638 observations in Israel. The studied sample gave a highly significant response, showing that the selected diseases had a diminishing impact on RA and LW and no influence on MY. It can be concluded that the change of RA as determined by electronic monitoring, complemented by the change of LW, is a useful general indicator of health status and subclinical disease before the appearance of clinical signs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3ahealth status 3amilk yield 3arumination 3aIsrael 0aDairy cattle welfare 0ahealth status monitoring 0asubclinical hyperketonaemia 0auterine disease 0arumination activity1 aEfrat, Gingis1 aBajcsy, Árpád1 aFekete, Sándor,0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2014 Dec. 1, v. 62, no. 4 p.452-462dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2014.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245008600158300002000244520160900264592002801873650001801901650002801919650002301947650001701970650001901987650001802006650001202024650002002036650002202056650001902078650001902097650001602116650001402132650001802146650001902164650001402183650001402197650002202211650002802233650001702261650001102278650001902289650001502308653001702323653002502340653002302365653002102388653003602409700001802445700001602463700001602479700001702495700005702512700005802569773014202627856007802769852000902847655001202856IND60689671420221121225444.0200422e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068967142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c010392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yang12aA Dual Functional Nanoreactor for Synergistic Starvation and Photodynamic Therapy  ap. 18309-18318.  aThe combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and enzyme therapy is a highly desirable approach in malignant tumor therapies as it takes advantage of the spatial-controlled PDT and the effective enzyme-catalyzed bioreactions. However, it is a challenge to co-encapsulate hydrophilic enzymes and hydrophobic photosensitizers, and these two agents often interfere with each other. In this work, a protocell-like nanoreactor (GOx-MSN@MnPc-LP) has been designed for synergistic starvation therapy and PDT. In this nanoreactor, the hydrophilic glucose oxidase (GOx) is loaded in the pore of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), while the hydrophobic manganese phthaleincyanide (MnPc) is loaded in the membrane layer of liposome. This spatial separation of two payloads protects GOx and MnPc from the cellular environment and avoids interference with each other. GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose, which generates hydrogen peroxide and gluconic acid, leading to the starvation therapy via glucose consumption in cancer cells, as well as the disruption of cellular redox balance. MnPc produces cytotoxic singlet oxygen under 730 nm laser irradiation, achieving PDT. The antitumor effects of the nanoreactor have been verified on tumor cells and tumor-bearing mice models. GOx-MSN@MnPc-LP efficiently inhibits tumor growth in vivo with a single treatment, indicating the robust synergy of starvation therapy and PDT treatment. This work also offers a versatile strategy for delivering hydrophilic enzymes and hydrophobic photosensitizers using a protocell-like nanoreactor for effective cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3acatalytic activity 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme therapy 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airradiation 3amanganese 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxidation 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aporous media 3asilica 3asinglet oxygen 3astarvation 0ananoreactors 0aphotodynamic therapy 0astarvation therapy 0aglucose oxidases 0amesoporous silica nanoparticles1 aShi, Hongdong1 aLi, Tuanwei1 aYu, Jianing1 aGuo, Zhengxi1 aCheng, Junjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0502-67121 aLiu, Yangzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2891-79640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 12, no. 16 p.18309-18318dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c010393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008800169300001600257520092700273592002801200650001501228650001501243650002501258650002101283650001501304650000901319650002601328650002001354650001801374650001501392653003201407653001501439653002801454653002301482653001501505700002101520700002201541700002001563773012301583856008101706852000901787655001201796IND60774676520221122065744.0220422e20101201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467652DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.58.2010.4.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmutzler, Sandra10aPUFA-dependent alteration of oxidative parameters of a canine mastocytoma cell line  ap. 453-464.  aMast cells play a key role in the immune response. Thereby, the balance of oxidative metabolism is of importance in mast cell mediator synthesis and release. Fatty acids may modify mast cell function in several ways. In this study, we investigated the influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on oxidative parameters of a canine mastocytoma cell line. C2 cells were cultured in media supplemented with linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, alpha-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as lipid peroxides was tested. Furthermore, stressor-induced DNA damage was measured. Exposure of the cells to PUFAs resulted in a significant increase in the synthesis of both ROS and lipid peroxides. Distinct differences between the PUFAs tested underline the impact of the unsaturation degree of fatty acids as well as the position of double bonds on mast cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aaerobiosis 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3acell lines 3adogs 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aimmune response 3alinoleic acid 3amast cells 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids 0amast cells 0areactive oxygen species 0alipid peroxidation 0aDNA damage1 aAndryszak, Lisa,1 aFuhrmann, Herbert1 aSchumann, Julia0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 58, no. 4 p.453-464dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.58.2010.4.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012000164300002000284520119600304592002801500650001601528650002401544650002301568650001301591650001301604650001201617650004401629650002201673650002201695650001401717700001701731700001901748700001501767700001601782700001501798700001501813773012101828856008101949852000902030655001202039IND60550487120221119141601.0160911e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b017782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guangxia10a2,6-Pyridodicarboxamide-Bridged Triptycene Molecular Transmission Devices: Converting Rotation to Rocking Vibration  ap. 11302-11312.  aA series of N²,N⁶-bis(triptycene-9-yl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamides 1–4 were designed and synthesized. Due to rotational constraint of the 2,6-diamidopyridine bridge, the triptycene components in the systems are held together. X-ray structures of 1–4 show that the molecules adopt a gear-like geometry in the solid states. DFT (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) calculations predict the gear-like C₂ conformation as global minimum structures for 1 and 2 and suggest that, through a slippage transition process, rotation of one triptycene component would give rise to a rocking vibration of the counter component due to the barrier for rotation of the triptycene components. VT NMR studies on 1–4 show that the pair of triptycene components undergo ceaseless slippage at room temperature but nearly freeze at temperatures as low as 183 K. Decreasing the temperature freezes the slippage between triptycene components as well, thus producing the appearance of phase isomers of 3 and 4. The dynamic features of the studied molecules indicate that this kind of molecule is able to function as a kind of molecular transmission device for transforming the mode of motion from rotation to rocking vibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aambient temperature 3achemical reactions 3afreezing 3ageometry 3aisomers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3avibration1 aMa, Lishuang1 aXiang, Junfeng1 aWang, Ying1 aChen, Xuebo1 aChe, Yanke1 aJiang, Hua0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Nov. 20, v. 80, no. 22 p.11302-11312dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b017783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011200173300001800285520148800303592002801791650001501819650001201834650001001846650001001856650001001866650001801876650001201894650001201906650000901918650002501927650002001952650001901972650001601991650001302007653001302020653001102033653000902044653001202053653001302065700001402078700001802092700005702110773007902167856008902246852000902335655001202344IND60570571020221117222606.0170708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057057102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yangfei10aFluoride exposure changed the structure and the expressions of HSP related genes in testes of pubertal rats  ap. 1080-1088.  aPrevious studies have indicated that fluoride exposure damaged the male reproductive function; however, the cellular mechanism of fluoride-induced testicular toxicity is still unclear. In this study, twenty-two female pregnant Wistar rats were allotted randomly to two groups: control (deionized water) and sodium fluoride (NaF, contain F−: 67.86 mg/L) groups. After delivery, the dosage was continued for 15 weeks for puppies. Twelve rats in each group were tested at 6 and 9 (pubertal); 12 and 15 (mature) weeks of age. Our results suggested that organ coefficient of epididymis was significantly decreased in the mature (12 and 15 week-old) rats. Epididymal sperm abnormality and femur fluoride concentration were increased with the concomitant decrease in sperm motility and concentration in these experimental periods. Compared to the control, in the NaF group, the seminiferous tubules of each age were reduced in terms of diameter and thickness. The sperm cells were lost and shedding and finally disappeared after 9 weeks. mRNA and protein levels of HSP27 and 90 were decreased with a concomitant increase in HSP70 and HSF mRNA and protein levels in NaF exposed rats. The mRNA and protein levels of HSP27 and HSF (only mRNA) were significantly increased in NaF treated rats at 9 and 15 weeks of age, respectively. In summary, these results emphasize that NaF induces testicular and sperm abnormalities through the involvement of HSPs especially during the pubertal period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepididymis 3afemales 3afemur 3agenes 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3apuberty 3apuppies 3arats 3aseminiferous tubules 3asodium fluoride 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atoxicity 0aFluoride 0aTestes 0aHSPs 0aPuberty 0aMaturity1 aZhao, Jun1 aWang, Jinming1 aWang, Jundong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4320-03470 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.1080-1088dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245012600138300001800264520068000282592002800962650002000990650001101010650001601021650001201037650002601049650001701075650000901092650001401101650001101115650001301126650001501139650001701154650001401171650001801185650000901203653001601212653001801228653002101246653001401267700002201281773012701303852000901430655001201439IND60773712420221121122923.0220419e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077371242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkarawi, Hassan Hadi10aInfluence of foliar application of nano-zinc and iron fertilizers on growth and yield of bell pepper (capsicum annuum L.)  ap. 1115-1119.  aA field experiment in the autumn 2019 was conducted to investigate the combined effect of foliar spraying with nano zinc and iron fertilizers on growth and yield of bell 0, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 g.

In this study, we evaluated the protective effect and molecular mechanism of a dominant polymethoxyflavone nobiletin (NOB) from tangerine peels on intestinal epithelial integrity. The results from transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) suggested that NOB pretreatment counteracts epithelial injury induced by inflammatory cytokines (TEER value in 48 h: vehicle, 135.6 ± 3.9 Ω/cm²; TNF-α + IL-1β, 90.7 ± 0.5 Ω/cm²; 10 μM NOB + TNF-α + IL-1β, 126.1 ± 0.8 Ω/cm²; 100 μM NOB + TNF-α + IL-1β, 125.3 ± 0.5 Ω/cm². P < 0.001). Clinical and pathological test results suggested that administration of NOB effectively alleviates intestinal barrier injury induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) as evidenced by the length of colon villi on day 7 (control, 253.7 ± 4.8 μm, DSS 131.6 ± 4.6 μm, NOB + DSS, 234.5 ± 5.1 μm. P < 0.001). Interestingly, when screening tight junction molecules for intestinal barrier integrity, we observed that independent treatment with NOB sharply increased claudin-7 levels (ratio of claudin-7 over GAPDH: control, 1.0 ± 0.06; DSS, 0.02 ± 0.001; NOB + DSS, 0.3 ± 0.07. P < 0.001), which was previously suppressed upon DSS stimulation. Furthermore, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α) transcriptional regulation of claudin-7 contributed to intestinal barrier homeostasis. Therefore, our study suggests potential intestinal protective strategies based on polymethoxyflavones of aged tangerine peels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3acolon 3adextran sulfate 3aelectrical resistance 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aintestinal mucosa 3amicroorganisms 3apolymethoxyflavones 3aprotective effect 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3atangerines 3atight junctions 3atoxins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avilli 0aclaudin-7 0aHNF-4α 0aintestinal epithelial barrier 0anobiletin 0atangerine peels1 aZhao, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3710-36071 aWang, Liwen1 aWang, Liang1 aDu, Gang1 aGuan, Wenqiang1 aLiu, Jianfu1 aCao, Xiaocang1 aJiang, Xiaohua1 aTian, Jingrui1 aWang, Meiyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7914-30601 aHo, Chi-Tang1 aLi, Shiming0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Apr. 05, v. 68, no. 16 p.4641-4649dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c012173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245013400132300001600266520071300282592002800995650001501023650001301038650001801051650001101069650001001080650001401090650001601104651001401120653003501134653001601169653001901185653001301204653001401217700002101231773013201252852000901384655001201393IND60477717920221121110620.0160105e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047771792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeeman, Owen D.10aNew Parobia (Acari: Podapolipidae) parasitic on pestiferous paropsine beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Eucalypt Plantations  ap. 111-135.  aChrysophtharta cloelia (Chapuis), C. variicollis (Chapuis) and Paropsis atomaria Olivier are pests of plantation eucalypts in eastern Australia.

Here, we used translating ribosome affinity purification to profile translating RNAs in zebrafish cardiomyocytes during heart regeneration. We identified dynamic induction of several Jak1/Stat3 pathway members following trauma, events accompanied by cytokine production. Transgenic Stat3 inhibition in cardiomyocytes restricted injury-induced proliferation and regeneration, but did not reduce cardiogenesis during animal growth. The secreted protein Rln3a was induced in a Stat3-dependent manner by injury, and exogenous Rln3 delivery during Stat3 inhibition stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our results identify an injury-specific cardiomyocyte program essential for heart regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aRNA 3aanimal growth 3acardiomyocytes 3acytokines 3agenetically modified organisms 3amuscles 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics) 3avertebrates 0aTRAP 0acardiac regeneration 0ainterleukin 0ainflammation 0aendocardium1 aGupta, Vikas1 aKarra, Ravi1 aHoldway, Jennifer E.1 aKikuchi, Kazu1 aPoss, Kenneth D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 110, no. 33 p.13416-13421dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13098101103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009100171300001800262520183900280592002802119650002002147650002302167650002802190650002302218650002802241650002602269650001702295650002402312650001602336650002202352650001002374650002202384650001502406650001402421650002002435650001502455650001302470650001002483650003302493650002702526650002102553650002402574650001502598650003702613653001902650653002102669653002202690653002202712653002302734700001802757700005702775700001702832700001702849700002202866773014802888856008003036852000903116655001203125IND60689668720221119035743.0200422e20200331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068966872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b063872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTippannanavar, Madhu10aPreparation of Nanofungicides Based on Imidazole Drugs and Their Antifungal Evaluation  ap. 4566-4578.  aIn spite of modern crop protection measures, the overall crop losses due to pests and pathogens are huge. Rhizoctonia solani, Macrophomina phaseolina, Sclerotium rolfsii, and Fusarium oxysporum are one of the most devastating soil-borne fungi and cause numerous plant diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed to systematically design and develop new nanofungicides based on imidazole drugs, clotrimazole, econazole nitrate, and miconazole nitrate, for effective and efficient management of plant diseases. The assessment of these antifungal medicines for their fungicide likeness using Hao’s rule and their enzyme inhibitory potential by molecular docking was helpful in ensuring their utility as antifungal agents in managing phytopathogenic fungi. Nanotechnological strategies were used to develop nanoformulations of test compounds in poly(ethylene glycol) 300 for further augmenting their bioactivity. Transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed the nanosize of the prepared products. Analysis of their in vitro and in vivo antifungal properties revealed their usefulness in controlling the test fungi, R. solani, M. phaseolina, S. rolfsii, and F. oxysporum. Excellent in vitro antifungal activities were displayed by the clotrimazole nanoformulation with a median effective dose (ED₅₀) of 1.18 μg/mL against R. solani, the econazole nitrate nanoformulation with an ED₅₀ of 5.25 μg/mL against S. rolfsii, and the miconazole nitrate nanoformulation with an ED₅₀ of 1.49 and 1.82 μg/mL against M. phaseolina and F. oxysporum. Furthermore, in vivo studies against test fungi demonstrated the antifungal potency of all the nanoformulations with disease incidences ranging from 11.11 to 27.38% in plants treated with nanoformulations of test chemicals as compared to the inoculated control (39.68–72.38%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aSclerotium (genus) 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aantifungal properties 3aclotrimazole 3acomputer simulation 3acrop losses 3adisease incidence 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibition 3afungicides 3aimidazole 3ain vivo studies 3amiconazole 3anitrates 3apests 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant protection 3apolyethylene glycol 3asoil fungi 3atransmission electron microscopy 0ananotechnology 0ananoformulations 0aantifungal agents 0aeconazole nitrate 0amiconazole nitrate1 aVerma, Ankita1 aKumar, Rajesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7297-16371 aGogoi, Robin1 aKundu, Aditi1 aPatanjali, Neeraj0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Mar. 31, v. 68, no. 16 p.4566-4578dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b063873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012900162300002000291520150400311592002801815650001501843650002101858650001301879650003801892650003501930650001801965650001601983650001401999650001802013650001902031650003102050650002402081700002002105700002802125700002102153700002002174700002902194700001802223700002502241773012402266856007402390852000902464655001202473IND60640592920221120170747.0190504e20160414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064059292DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06076e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlric, Christophe10aCovalent conjugation of cysteine-engineered scFv to PEGylated magnetic nanoprobes for immunotargeting of breast cancer cells  ap. 37099-37109.  aIn the present study, we describe the synthesis and characterization of new generation of cancer-targeting magnetic nanoprobes: superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) shell functionalized with recombinant anti-HER2 single chain fragment variable (scFv) of Trastuzumab antibody. An anti-HER2 scFv with terminal cysteine (scFv 4D5-Cys) has been rationally engineered in order to favor its orientation- and site-directed covalent conjugation to the polymeric surface of PEGylated SPIONs. Optimization of scFv and nanoparticles production allowed to obtain well-characterized SPIONs-PEG–scFv nanoparticles carrying ∼7 fragments per nanoparticle, having a hydrodynamic diameter of ca. 86 nm and nearly neutral surface. The nanoprobes-scFv capability to recognize the HER2 protein has been confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared to non-targeted PEGylated SPIONs, the SPIONs–PEG–scFv nanoprobes showed an enhanced binding to HER2-overexpressing cells (SK-BR3) in vitro as it was shown by immunofluorescence. Finally, ICP-AES measurements shown that in 1 hour the uptake of SPIONs–PEG–scFv in HER2-overexpressing cells is 2.1 times greater than non-targeted PEGylated SPIONs. Therefore, both due to their physico-chemical characteristics and the immunotargeting of HER2-positive breast cancer cells, the SPIONs–PEG–scFv appear as promising nanoplatforms for future applications in theranostic treatment of cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abreast neoplasms 3acysteine 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahydrodynamics 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyethylene glycol1 aAubrey, Nicolas1 aAllard-Vannier, Émilie1 adi Tommaso, Anne1 aBlondy, Thibaut1 aDimier-Poisson, Isabelle1 aChourpa, Igor1 aHervé-Aubert, Katel0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 14, v. 6, no. 43 p.37099-37109dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra06076e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015600166300001600322520092600338592002801264650001301292650001601305650002301321650001501344650001601359650001701375650001001392650001101402650002801413650001101441650002301452650002001475650001601495653001201511653001201523653002301535653002001558700002201578773012401600856008201724852000901806655001201815IND60774672620221122011844.0220422e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467262DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.58.2010.3.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaedi, Mostafa10aBlood gas values and pulmonary hypertension as affected by dietary sodium source in broiler chickens reared at cool temperature in a high-altitude area  ap. 379-388.  aOne hundred and twenty day-old male chicks (Ross 308) reared at a cool temperature at high altitude were subjected to the following two treatments in a completely randomised design: (1) a group for which the sodium requirements were supplied by sodium chloride from day-old age and regarded as control, (2) a group similar to the control but for which 50% of the sodium requirements was supplied by sodium bicarbonate from day-old age.

The purpose of this study was to examine the incretin response to a meal following an exercise bout of different intensities in obese subjects. Eleven women (BMI>37.3±7.0kg/m²; Age 24.3±4.6year) participated in 3 counter- balanced study days, where a standardized meal was preceded by: (1) No exercise (NoEx), (2) ModEx (55% VO2max), and (3) IntEx (4min (80% VO2max)/3min (50% VO2max). Frequent blood samples were analyzed for glucose, lactate, insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and C-peptide concentrations throughout 280min of testing. Glucose concentrations were not different between conditions during exercise or meals. There were no differences between conditions in insulin levels during exercise and recovery, but postprandial insulin incremental area under the curve was lower in ModEx vs. NoEx (p<0.01). GIP and GLP-1 levels were not different between conditions during exercise, but during exercise recovery, GLP-1 concentrations were higher in ModEx vs. NoEx (p=0.03). The meal increased the incretin responses (p<0.01) but this response was not affected by prior exercise. Glucagon concentrations increased with exercise (p<0.05) and continued to be elevated during recovery, with the greatest increase with IntEx compared with NoEx (p<0.05). No differences between conditions were detected for hepatic insulin extraction, insulin secretion, or insulin sensitivity. Exercise prior to an evening meal has no impact on the incretin response to the subsequent meal, yet insulin concentrations were lower during the meals that followed exercise. Exercise intensity had no impact on this response.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood sampling 3abody mass index 3ac-peptide 3aexercise 3agastric inhibitory polypeptide 3aglucagon 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucose 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3alactic acid 3aobesity 3apeak oxygen uptake 3asecretin 3awomen 0aModEx 0aIntEx 0aBMI 0aNoEX 0aVO2max 0aGLP-1 0aGIP 0aOGTT 0aDPP- IV 0aCV 0aANOVA 0aiAUC 0aISR 0aGlucose metabolism 0aHigh intensity exercise 0aInsulin sensitivity1 aHeden, Timothy D.1 aLeidy, Heather J.1 aWinn, Nathan C.1 aPark, Young-Min1 aThyfault, John P.1 aKanaley, Jill A.0 tPeptides.g2015 Sept., v. 71 p.94-99dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010700161300001600268520078100284592002801065650001901093650002001112650002501132650001601157650001101173650001501184650001901199653002301218653001301241653001701254653002501271653002901296700001501325773011601340856008301456852000901539655001201548IND60774672820221121234728.0220424e20070901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467282DNAL7 a10.1556/aalim.36.2007.3.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇam, M.10aComparison of chemical characteristics of fresh and pasteurised juice of gilaburu (Viburnum opulus L.)  ap. 381-385.  aOrganic acids, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity were determined in two different juices of gilaburu fruits (Viburnum opulus L., belonging to the Caprifoliaceae family).

However, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no research on the connection between financial inclusion and environmental sustainability in the country. This study was therefore conducted to help fill that gap. In attaining the aforestated goal, econometric techniques that yield valid and reliable outcomes were engaged. From the results, all the series were first differenced stationary and cointegrated in the long run. The DARDL estimator with the support of the conventional ARDL estimator was adopted to explore the marginal effects of the predictors on the explained variable, and from the results, financial inclusion worsened environmental sustainability in the nation via high carbon emissions. Also, foreign direct investments degraded the country’s ecological quality validating the pollution haven hypothesis. Finally, trade openness, population growth, and energy consumption were detrimental to environmental sustainability in the nation. On the causal directions amidst the series, unidirectional causalities from financial inclusion and trade openness to carbon effusions were disclosed. Also, feedback causalities between foreign direct investments and carbon emissions; between population growth and carbon effluents; and between energy consumption and carbon exudates were unfolded. The study recommended among others that, financial establishments should not fund the production of carbon-intensive goods, but those that are friendly to the environment. The government can also help to improve environmental sustainability by establishing regulations to mandate financial entities to engage in eco-friendly activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aeconometrics 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3aenvironmental sustainability 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3aresearch 3atrade 3aGhana0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.60885-60907dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19994-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008600170300002000256520092400276592002801200650001501228650002601243650002301269650002301292650002101315650002201336650002201358650002101380650002201401700001601423700002001439700002101459700002301480700002201503700002301525700002301548700002801571773012101599856008101720852000901801655001201810IND60550484720171220000000.0160911e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b020662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDell’Acqua, Monica10aMediaChrom: Discovering a Class of Pyrimidoindolone-Based Polarity-Sensitive Dyes  ap. 10939-10954.  aA small library of six polarity-sensitive fluorescent dyes, nicknamed MediaChrom, was prepared. This class of dyes is characterized by a pyrimidoindolone core fitted out with a conjugated push–pull system and a carboxy linker for a conceivable coupling with biomolecules. The optimized eight-step synthetic strategy involves a highly chemo- and regioselective gold-catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction. The photophysical properties of MediaChrom dyes have been evaluated in-depth. In particular, the MediaChrom bearing a diethylamino as an electron-donating group and a trifluoromethyl as an electron-withdrawing group displays the most interesting and advantageous spectroscopic features (e.g., absorption and emission in the visible range and a good quantum yield). Promising results in terms of sensitivity have been obtained in vitro on this dye as a membrane/lipophilic probe and as a peptide fluorescent label.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiochemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afluorescent dyes 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3aregioselectivity 3aspectral analysis1 aRonda, Luca1 aPiano, Riccardo1 aPellegrino, Sara1 aClerici, Francesca1 aRossi, Elisabetta1 aMozzarelli, Andrea1 aGelmi, Maria Luisa1 aAbbiati, G.q(Giorgio),0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Nov. 06, v. 80, no. 21 p.10939-10954dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b020663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007600159300002000235520091500255592002801170650001101198650003001209650001101239650000901250650001401259650002501273650001401298700001501312700001701327700002101344700002101365700002101386773012401407856007401531852000901605655001201614IND60640593320221120170857.0190504e20160418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064059332DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06083h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Munish10aSpin-dependent metallic properties of a functionalized MoS₂ monolayer  ap. 38499-38504.  aStability and electronic properties of a two-dimensional MoS₂ monolayer functionalized with atomic wires of Fe and Co are investigated using density functional theory. The binding energy of the atomic wires of Fe and Co on MoS₂ is noticeably higher relative to that calculated for the BN (0001) surface. The pristine monolayer is non-magnetic and semiconducting, and its functionalization makes the system magnetic and metallic. This is due to mainly the presence of a finite density of states associated with Fe or Co atoms in the vicinity of the Fermi level of the functionalized monolayer. Additionally, the spin-polarized character of the functionalized monolayer is clearly captured by the tunneling current calculated in the STM-like setup. We believe that the results form a basis for fabrication and characterization of such functionalized two-dimensional systems for applications at the nanoscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3airon 3amagnetism 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananowires1 aLoh, G.

Laboratory examinations of the blood consisted of a complete blood count, determination of packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), total plasma protein (TPP), parameters of haemostasis including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and enzyme activities reflecting hepatobiliary function, i.e. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Ultrasonographic findings of the gallbladder (size, shape, wall, content) and appearance of the biliary tract and the surrounding cranial intraabdominal organs were also evaluated. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was performed easily during the study, and dogs tolerated well the procedure performed without anaesthesia. All laboratory parameters of the blood remained within normal limits throughout the study. However, some follow-up values, i.e. PCV, TPP, APTT and ALT, demonstrated statistically significant differences when compared to baseline measurements, which might reflect the effect of 24-hour fasting before the experiment, as well as day-to-day metabolic fluctuations due to feeding and water supply during the study. There were no visible signs of bleeding from the liver, bile leakage from the gallbladder or accumulation of free peritoneal fluid during repeated ultrasonographic examinations. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis seems to be an important diagnostic procedure in canine gallbladder diseases and can be used safely and easily to gain gallbladder bile for diagnosis of bacterial cholecystitis or for investigating hepatobiliary function in the dog.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aalanine transaminase 3aanesthesia 3aaspartate transaminase 3abile 3acholecystitis 3aclinical examination 3adogs 3afasting 3agall bladder 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahemostasis 3aliver 3aprothrombin 3athromboplastin 3aultrasonography 3awater supply 0adog 0adog 0adog 0agallbladder 0abiliary tract 0aUltrasound-guided cholecystocentesis1 aSterczer, Ágnes1 aManczur, F.1 aet al., 0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2002 Oct. 1, v. 50, no. 4 p.385-393dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.50.2002.4.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001200112245012600124300001300250520103900263592002801302650001801330650000901348650001201357650001601369650001401385650001601399650001601415653004101431653002601472653001501498700001901513700001401532700001801546773012901564852000901693655001201702IND60477718520221121214532.0160105e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047771852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Jie10aLaboratory population life table of Amphitetranychus viennensis (Zacher) (Acari: Tetranychidae) at different temperatures  ap. 7-10.  aLaboratory population life table parameters including net reproductive rate (R₀), finite rate of increase (λ), doubling time for population (dt), intrinsic rate of natural increase (rₘ) and mean generation time (T) of Amphitetranychus viennensis (Zacher) were studied at five constant temperatures.

The Coimbatore city is one of the developing cities in Tamilnadu which produces about 1000 tons of municipal solid waste per day with 60% of wet waste and 40% of dry waste processed at one processing unit site at Vellalore, Coimbatore city. In this research the suitable site for solid waste processing unit for north zone region of Coimbatore is found by using GIS tool and weighted overlay analysis. Primary thematic layers were considered weights are assigned and analysed by weighted overlay analysis. The results are justified and screened under categories as highly suitable, high to moderately suitable, moderately suitable, poorly suitable and not suitable. It is found that 2 sqkm is highly suitable and 10 sqkm is high to moderately suitable for solid waste processing unit. The suitability map shows the availability of land for solid waste processing unit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3ainfrastructure 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste management 3aIndia 0aSite suitability 0aWeighted overlay analysis 0aSolid waste management 0aDecentralized processing unit 0aNorth zone1 aNithya, R.0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 48, no. 4 p.1144-1148dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245006700180300001600247520092900263592002801192650004401220650001501264650001501279650001801294650001301312650001301325650004301338650001101381650000701392650003301399650001701432653001501449653001301464653001801477653001701495653001501512653001401527700002001541700002701561700002301588700002301611700002401634700001901658700002501677700002801702700002501730773011601755856008601871852000901957655001201966IND60551899320221122112813.0161019e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055189932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSampaio, Caroline de G.10aChitosan/mangiferin particles for Cr(VI) reduction and removal  ap. 273-279.  aIn this work, chitosan/mangiferin particles (CMP) were prepared by spray-drying technique and characterized by SEM, DLS, FTIR, HPLC–UV and adsorption studies to investigate a possible application as a preventive material in cases of human and animal contamination with Cr(VI). CMP presented sizes ranging from nano to micrometers. Chitosan and mangiferin (MA) presence in the powder was confirmed by FTIR and MA quantification (136μg/mg) was performed using a calibration curve prepared by HPLC–UV. Adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) onto CMP was compared with chitosan and investigated in a batch system by considering the effects of various parameters like contact time, initial concentration of adsorbent and pH. Cr(VI) removal is pH dependent and it was found to be maximum at pH 5.0. The results showed that CMP has a potential application as a preventive material in cases of human or animal contamination with Cr(VI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abatch systems 3achitosan 3achromium 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspray drying 0aMangiferin 0aChitosan 0aEncapsulation 0aChromium(VI) 0aAdsorption 0aReduction1 aFrota, Lucas S.1 aMagalhães, Herbert S.1 aDutra, Lilian M.U.1 aQueiroz, Danilo C.1 aAraújo, Rinaldo S.1 aBecker, Helena1 ade Souza, José R.R.1 aRicardo, Nágila M.P.S.1 aTrevisan, Maria T.S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 July, v. 78 p.273-279dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008600166300001600252520118000268592002801448650001101476650001001487650001401497650003501511650002001546650001001566650002601576650001201602653001501614653002601629653001901655653001101674700002801685700001801713700001801731700003601749773014001785856007901925852000902004655001202013IND60720265220221119192111.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026522DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzalak, Radosław10aImmunoreactivity of the calbindin D28k in the parahippocampal gyrus of chinchilla  ap. 387-391.  aTen adult male chinchillas were used. The localisation of calbindin D28k (CB) was examined with the use of two types of reactions: immunocytochemical peroxidase-antiperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining with a specific monoclonal antibody against CB. Immunocytochemical examination demonstrated the presence of CB-positive neurons in the following layers of all parts the parahippocampal gyrus (PG): marginal, external cellular, middle cellular, and internal cellular, i.e. in entorhinal area, parasubiculum, and presubiculum. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of CB in both Hu C/Dimmunoreactive (IR) neurons and nervous fibers of the PG. CB-IR neuronal cell bodies were moderately numerous (ca. 10% of Hu C/D-IR neurons) and clearly distinguished from the background. Each layer of the brain area consisted of two types of neurons: pyramidal and multiform. Among the second type of neurons, four kinds of morphologically different neuronal subclasses were observed: multipolar, bipolar, round, and Cajal-Retzius cells. It is concluded that the expression of CB in the PG of the chinchilla is species specific and limited to several subclasses of neurons  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abrain 3acalbindin 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmune response 3amales 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneurons 0achinchilla 0aparahippocampal gyrus 0acalbindin D28k 0amemory1 aJaworska-Adamu, Jadwiga1 aRycerz, Karol1 aKulik, Paweł1 aArciszewski, Marcin Bartłomiej0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 57, no. 3 p.387-391dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015200162300001600314520125100330592002801581650003401609650003701643650001601680650001701696650001401713650001301727650002301740650002101763650001301784650001701797650002201814653004101836653002701877653002701904653003501931653002501966700001401991700001402005700001802019700002102037700005602058700001702114700001702131773010202148856008302250852000902333655001202342IND60622602220221120233136.0210121e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062260222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Zhou10aSingle-atom Rh based bipyridine framework porous organic polymer: A high active and superb stable catalyst for heterogeneous methanol carbonylation  ap. 249-256.  aA novel Rh based porous composed N polymer with hierarchical pore, high surface area and high thermal stability (Rh-POL-2BPY) was successfully obtained by impregnation of Rh₂(CO)₄Cl₂ solution of dichloromethane. And based on Rh species as the most active carbonylation site, Rh-POL-2BPY was selected as a catalyst applied in heterogeneous methanol carbonylation system and behaved excellent carbonylation activity (TOF ≈ 1400 h⁻¹) under 195 °C, 2.5 MPa, higher than the corresponding homogeneous system without acetic acid. In addition, contrast to the most reported unstable heterogeneous methanol carbonylation systems, Rh-POL-2BPY could maintain incredibly outstanding stability for near 400 h owing to the firm coordination bond between Rh and N and high exposed N content in the polymer. Here, POL-2BPY apart from its heat-resisting property acts as massive rivets to immobilize the Rh species in its framework solidly during carbonylation process. XPS, XANES, HAADF-STEM and EXAFS results verify the N species of bipyridine, the single atom dispersion of Rh and RhN coordination bond. And above all, the novel five-coordinated Rh center is proposed as the real active site of methanol carbonylation by EXAFS spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3anitrogen content 3apolymers 3asurface area 3athermal stability 0aHeterogeneous methanol carbonylation 0aPorous organic ligands 0aRhN coordination bonds 0aFive-coordinated active center 0aSingle-atom catalyst1 aLiu, Yang1 aLyu, Yuan1 aSong, Xiangen1 aZheng, Changyong1 aFeng, Siquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1367-164X1 aJiang, Zheng1 aDing, Yunjie0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Jan., v. 369 p.249-256dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003000142245011300172300001400285520152500299592002801824650002401852650001401876650002001890650001001910650002401920650002301944650002601967650001701993650001402010650001602024650001902040650001302059651001302072653001002085653002902095653002102124653001402145653001302159653002302172653002302195700002502218773010202243856007602345852000902421655001202430IND60695934020221118235854.0200520e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069593402DNAL7 a10.1675/063.043.01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasallas-Perilla, Maribel10aResource Relationships Among Foods Consumed by the Spot-Flanked Gallinule (Porphyriops melanops) in Colombia  ap. 36-44.  aThe Spot-flanked Gallinule (Porphyriops melanops) is an endangered wetland-dwelling bird in Colombia. A field experiment was conducted to experimentally quantify the gallinule's food consumption and the nutritional relationships among the food resources it consumes, i.e., whether the abundance of one resource changed the consumption of another. Three wetland plant species were used for the experiments (Limnobium laevigatum, Hydrocotile ranunculoides, Azolla filiculoides), along with sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum) as a surrogate for a seed food source. Pairwise comparisons were made to determine food consumption when resources were equally available (first experiment), and after augmenting the most consumed resource in the previous experiment (second experiment). The gallinules behaved selectively during both experiments, and the value of the foods based on consumption was: L. laevigatum > S. indicum > H. ranunculoides > A. filiculoides. However, in the second experiment, L. laevigatum and S. indicum were equally consumed. Food preferences of the least consumed food in the first experiment indicated that in two pairwise comparisons the resources were perfect substitutes. In three pairwise comparisons the resources were treated as complementary, whereas two resources had an antagonistic relation. In conclusion, the gallinules' preferences depended on the context, and keeping mixtures of the preferred and complementary food resources available for the gallinules may improve the quality of wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzolla filiculoides 3aLimnobium 3aSesamum indicum 3abirds 3acomplementary foods 3aendangered species 3afield experimentation 3afood choices 3aingestion 3asesame seed 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3aColombia 0aAndes 0aBogotá highland plateau 0aforaging ecology 0aherbivory 0aRallidae 0aresource selection 0awetland management1 aSánchez, Francisco,0 tWaterbirds.g2020 May 19, v. 43, no. 1 p.36-44dWaterbirds SocietywJournal:6297x1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.043.01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245010500177300001600282520127200298592002801570650000801598650001901606650001801625650001501643650001701658650001701675650002201692650001601714653002101730653001401751653002701765653002601792653002001818700001701838700005901855773007701914856008901991852000902080655001202089IND60570571820221117222750.0170708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057057182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalthammer, Tunga12aA permeation-controlled formaldehyde reference source for application in environmental test chambers  ap. 900-906.  aIn a wide range of indoor air pollutants, formaldehyde is one of the most-used and best-known substances. In order to protect human health, many countries have established threshold values for the release of formaldehyde from miscellaneous products and revise them constantly. Compliance with these regulations is usually assessed by emission test chamber measurements or derived methods. To control and improve the mechanisms of an emission test chamber, a reliable reference source with sample mimicking emission properties is required but not available so far. This study describes a permeation-controlled reference source based on the application of paraformaldehyde as formaldehyde releasing polymeric compound. Interactions between the formaldehyde release of the source and the governing chamber parameters temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were investigated in 1 m3 emission chambers. Depending on the conditions, constant formaldehyde concentrations between approximately 10 ppb and 150 ppb can be adjusted for up to 600 h. A linear correlation between the logarithm of the chamber concentration and the reciprocal temperature was found. The results support the feasibility of the source for validation of emission test chamber performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3acompliance 3aformaldehyde 3ahuman health 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 0aParaformaldehyde 0aDiffusion 0aTemperature dependence 0aEmission test chamber 0aHantzsch method1 aGiesen, Ruth1 aSchripp, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1594-73310 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.900-906dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245009300135300001800228520094600246592002801192650001101220650001301231650002201244650001501266650001201281650000901293650002101302650001501323650002301338650001101361651001001372653002001382653002001402653002001422653001601442700001501458773012701473852000901600655001201609IND60773713320221121155005.0220419e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077371332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenjithkumar, C.R.10aFeeding habits of an endemic bagrid catfish, mystus oculatus from western ghats of India  ap. 1165-1168.  aThe diet composition and feeding ecology of a bagrid freshwater cat fish, Mystus oculatus, endemic to the Western Ghats region of South India was studied from October 2018 to September 2019. The gut contents of 363 specimens with a total length ranging from 56 to 129 mm were collected from Chalakudy river of Kerala. The mean relative length of gut (RLG) recorded was 0.32. Lowest feeding intensity and GaSI was noticed during the breeding season while highest feeding activity during pre-spawning months. Index of relative importance showed that crustaceans (37.97%) were the most preferred food item in the gut followed by insects (13.97%), fish body parts and scales (11.77%) and rotifers (10.6%). The results of the gut content analysis revealed that the species exhibits a carnivorous and euryphagous feeding habit. The present investigation provides a clear idea about the role of this endemic species in the Chalakudy river food web.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMystus 3aRotifera 3aaquatic food webs 3acarnivores 3acatfish 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afreshwater 3aindigenous species 3arivers 3aIndia 0aMystus oculatus 0aBagrid cat fish 0aFeeding ecology 0aCarnivorous1 aRoshni, K.0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 48, no. 4 p.1165-1168dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245017700201300001800378500002000396520172200416592002802138650004402166650001602210650001602226650002202242650001802264650001402282650002302296650002602319650001302345650001702358650001302375650001702388650001402405650002102419700002002440700002202460700002402482773015102506856007402657852000902731655001202740IND60782926020221123044145.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078292602DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.70712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathod, Vaishali N1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0168-466510aPreparation, characterization and catalytic application of Zn‐based metal–organic framework catalyst for synthesis of 3,3‐(arylmethylene)bis‐1H‐indole derivatives  ap. 2005-2012.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A mesoporous zinc‐based pyridine‐2,5‐dicarboxylate metal–organic framework (Zn‐based MOF) catalyst was prepared by a solvothermal method. The catalytic potency of Zn‐based MOF for the one‐pot synthesis of 3,3‐(arylmethylene)bis‐1H‐indole derivatives was investigated. RESULTS: Various analytical techniques were used to characterize the physicochemical structure of Zn‐based MOF catalyst, including powder X‐ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy–energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis. Zn‐based MOF was then employed as a catalyst for the catalytic one‐pot transfer synthesis of 3,3‐(arylmethylene)bis‐1H‐indole derivatives. Optimizations of Zn‐based MOF catalyst in terms of effect of solvent and reaction time were investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Zn‐based MOF catalyst was synthesized by solvothermal treatment, characterized and used as a Lewis acid catalyst for the synthesis of biologically active 3,3′‐(arymethylene)bis‐1H‐indole derivatives. The catalyst offers notable benefits such as reusability of catalytic character, easy separation, nontoxicity, large pore size and providing excellent yield of 3,3′‐phenylmethylene‐1H‐indole derivatives. Zn‐based MOF was confirmed as containing tetragonal phase with large pore diameter, morphology looking like a spherical core and exhibiting no significance loss of catalytic performance when used in organic synthesis for three to four reaction runs. Thereby Zn‐based MOF was evidenced as showing excellent catalytic activity. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis acids 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiotechnology 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asolvents 3asurface area 3asynthesis 3athermogravimetry1 aPawar, Ganesh T1 aGaikwad, Suresh T1 aLande, Machhindra K0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2022 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.2005-2012dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.70713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009100165300002000256520147100276592002801747596007801775596008201853650001401935650001601949650001501965650001301980650002401993650001402017650001602031650001302047651001002060700001202070773015502082856008302237852000902320655001202329IND60791811620221119161540.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079181162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20220-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei’an, Li12aA tripartite evolutionary game study on green governance in China’s coating industry  ap. 61161-61177.  aAs a polluting industry, the green transformation of coatings is highly concerned by the Chinese government. In order to explore the role of government in the process of green transformation of coating industry, this paper constructs a green governance evolutionary game model of “government-manufacturing companies-application companies,” and the complex interaction mechanism among the three parties is studied. Then, the evolutionary game theory is used to analyze the asymptotic stability conditions and evolutionary stability strategies of the equilibrium point of the tripartite game in the three stages of green governance in the coating industry (traditional technology-green transformation-collaborative governance). Finally, the model was verified by numerical simulation, and the influence of the changes of subjective parameters on the evolutionary game was discussed. The results show that (1) the intensity of government governance is related to the frequency of spot checks and punishment coefficients, and the evolution tends to be balanced when the intensity of governance is moderate. (2) The evolutionary trend of the game’s main players’ strategy selection also depends on the government’s punishment. There is greater probability of green transition of manufacturing companies under punishment. (3) The green subsidy coefficient and the green degree of the product also have a greater impact on the strategic choice of the game player.  aPublisher supplied data  a71533002cthe Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China  a72174096cthe General Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aevolution 3agame theory 3agovernance 3aindustry 3amathematical models 3apollution 3aprobability 3aresearch 3aChina1 aYin, Ma0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.61161-61177dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20220-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013500163300001600298520167000314592002801984650001302012650001802025650001102043650001102054650001502065650002002080650001402100650001902114650001302133650002002146650001802166650001302184651001002197651001102207653002302218653003002241653002002271653002502291700001402316700002002330700001702350700001902367700001702386700001702403700001602420773012202436856008202558852000902640655001202649IND60558649920221119201223.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055864992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2016.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Liming10aChemical characterization and source apportionment of atmospheric submicron particles on the western coast of Taiwan Strait, China  ap. 293-304.  aTaiwan Strait is a special channel for subtropical East Asian Monsoon and its western coast is an important economic zone in China. In this study, a suburban site in the city of Xiamen on the western coast of Taiwan Strait was selected for fine aerosol study to improve the understanding of air pollution sources in this region. An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and an Aethalometer were deployed to measure fine aerosol composition with a time resolution of 5 min from May 1 to 18, 2015. The average mass concentration of PM1 was 46.2 ± 26.3 μg/m3 for the entire campaign. Organics (28.3%), sulfate (24.9%), and nitrate (20.6%) were the major components in the fine particles, followed by ammonium, black carbon (BC), and chloride. Evolution of nitrate concentration and size distribution indicated that local NOx emissions played a key role in high fine particle pollution in Xiamen. In addition, organic nitrate was found to account for 9.0%–13.8% of the total measured nitrate. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) conducted with high-resolution organic mass spectra dataset differentiated the organic aerosol into three components, including a hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) and two oxygenated organic aerosols (SV-OOA and LV-OOA), which on average accounted for 27.6%, 28.8%, and 43.6% of the total organic mass, respectively. The relationship between the mass concentration of submicron particle species and wind further confirmed that all major fine particle species were influenced by both strong local emissions in the southeastern area of Xiamen and regional transport through the Taiwan Strait.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3acoasts 3acombustion 3adata collection 3aemissions 3amonsoon season 3anitrates 3anitrogen oxides 3aspectrometers 3asulfates 3aChina 3aTaiwan 0aSubmicron particle 0aChemical characterization 0aOrganic aerosol 0aSource apportionment1 aZhu, Qiao1 aHuang, Xiaofeng1 aDeng, Junjun1 aChen, Jinsheng1 aHong, Youwei1 aXu, Lingling1 aHe, Lingyan0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2017 Feb., v. 52 p.293-304dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01523naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010300155300002000258520056600278592002800844650002100872650001700893650001300910650001600923650001300939700002000952700001500972700001600987773012301003856007401126852000901200655001201209IND60640593920221120141107.0190504e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064059392DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06103f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasada, Y.10aPoly(norbornyl-NDIs) as a potential cathode-active material in rechargeable charge storage devices  ap. 42911-42916.  aTwo pendant-type naphthalene diimide (NDI) polymers bearing a polynorbornene backbone were prepared and their electrochemical properties explored.

The AEDA applied on the volatile fraction of the same batch of juice stored at 0 °C for 10 months under aseptic conditions showed clear changes in the aroma profile as well as in the FD factors of key odorants. The reduction in the intensity of the citrus-like, pungent, green odor attributes in the aroma profile correlated with the loss of 1-penten-3-one, acetaldehyde, and (Z)-3-hexenal and a clear decrease in hexanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal. Quantitation done by stabile isotope dilution assays followed by a calculation of odor activity values (ratio of concentration to odor thresholds in citrate buffer) confirmed that the quick loss of 1-penten-3-one and acetaldehyde already within a few weeks and a significant reduction in nearly all aldehydes over the storage time of 10 months were responsible for the changes in the overall aroma profile of the juice. The same approach applied on Hamlin juice from the next harvest year as well as on chilled stored NFC juice from Valencia oranges confirmed the results for another harvest year and another orange variety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aacetaldehyde 3aaseptic conditions 3acitrates 3acold storage 3adistillation 3aflavor 3aisotope dilution technique 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aorange juice 3aoranges 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3avanillin 3awines 0aNFC orange juice 0astorage 0aaroma extract dilution analysis 0astable isotope dilution assay 0aodor activity value 0a1-penten-3-one 0aacetic acid1 aMall, Veronika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9771-08551 aSchieberle, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4153-27270 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 June 11, v. 66, no. 28 p.7428-7440dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b022573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245012100157300002000278520136600298592002801664650002301692650002001715650000901735650001501744650001801759650001501777650001901792650001101811650001901822653001401841653003701855653000901892653000801901653002701909700001301936700001301949700005601962700001302018700001502031700005102046700005402097773014202151856007802293852000902371655001202380IND60689669620221119041218.0200422e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068966962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c002202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Peng10aPlasmonic Molybdenum Tungsten Oxide Hybrid with Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Comparable to that of Noble Metals  ap. 19153-19160.  aThe surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) research is in full swing owing to its high sensitivity and high selectivity; however, the substrates with superexcellent performance for SERS are largely confined to noble metals (Au, Ag, etc.). Although the SERS active substrates have been extended to semiconductors and transition metals, it is frustrating that their sensitivities are insufficient for widespread practical application. Here, we report the plasmonic molybdenum tungsten oxide (MWO) hybrid nanomaterials (NMs), which can be used as high-performance substrates with SERS comparable to that of noble metals. MWO NMs can achieve the trace detection of rhodamine 6G (R6G), basic fuchsin (BF), and oil red O (ORO). The detection limit concentration for R6G is 10–⁸ M, with the maximum enhancement factor of up to 6.09 × 10⁷. The superexcellent SERS performance was attributed to the cooperative enhancement effect of electromagnetic (EM) enhancement mechanism and the charge transfer (CT) mechanism. Moreover, in the proposed system, the EM and CT contribution was distinguished by employing poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), which serves as a barrier layer to prevent the CT process from MWO NMs to R6G. These remarkable MWO NMs can be obtained with a facile method, and this research provides new insight into non-noble metal based SERS substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adetection limit 3agold 3amolybdenum 3ananomaterials 3arhodamines 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3atungsten oxide 0aplasmonic 0amolybdenum tungsten oxide hybrid 0aSERS 0aR6G 0anoble metal comparable1 aZhu, Lin1 aMa, Chao1 aZhang, Lixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5288-07971 aGuo, Lin1 aLiu, Yawen1 aMa, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8341-40031 aZhao, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0044-97430 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 12, no. 16 p.19153-19160dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c002203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245010900139300001800248520121400266592002801480650002401508650001301532650001901545650001401564650001701578650001201595650001101607650001301618650001801631650002001649650001301669653002101682653002701703653002101730700001601751773012701767852000901894655001201903IND60773713720221121155020.0220419e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077371372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmanchi, Nageswara Rao10aInvitro toxicity of pendimethalin using ciliate protozoa paramecium caudatum and blepharisma intermedium  ap. 1191-1197.  aThe herbicide pendimethalin was tested for its ability to induce cytological, physiological and genotoxic changes in selected ciliates Paramecium caudatum and Blepharisma intermedium. Different concentrations of pendimethalin were administered to both the test organisms in acute toxicity studies for 3 hours and threshold. LC₅₀ and LC₁₀₀ values were derived using probit analysis. The calculated LC₅₀were to be 15ppm and 34.67 ppm for P. caudatum and B. intermedium, respectively. The selected sub lethal concentrations of pendimethalin to Paramecium (2, 3, 4 and 5 ppm) and Blepharisma (4, 6, 8 and 10 ppm) induced significant decrease in contractile vacuole and food vacuole activity with that of controls which is concentration dependent. The changes in shape, size and structure of macronucleus were noticed in both the test organisms under pesticide stress. Rod shaped, vacuolated, fragmented, uneven division and karyolysis were the different changes observed in the macronucleus. The bioassay experiments revealed that the P. caudatum is more sensitive than the B. intermedium and could be used as complementary model in assessing cytotoxic potential of pendimethalin in invitro studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParamecium caudatum 3aProtozoa 3aacute toxicity 3abioassays 3acytotoxicity 3aecology 3amodels 3amutagens 3apendimethalin 3aprobit analysis 3avacuoles 0aCiliate protozoa 0aAcute toxicity studies 0aPesticide stress1 aArchana, G.0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 48, no. 4 p.1191-1197dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012700167300001600294520137400310592002801684650002501712650001501737650001901752650001801771650002401789650001601813650001101829650002001840653000901860653001801869653001601887653002201903700002501925700002501950700002101975773014001996856007902136852000902215655001202224IND60720265920221119192248.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026592DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomosławska, Anna10aAssessment of semen quality in infertile dogs using computer-assisted sperm analysis by the Hamilton-Thorne Semen Analyser  ap. 429-432.  aSemen quality parameters of infertile and fertile dogs were compared. Sperm concentration and semen motility parameters were measured by the Hamilton-Thorne Semen Analyser IVOS 12.3. The spermatozoal morphology and the percentage of live spermatozoa were examined microscopically. Forty-six dogs of various breeds were examined. Twenty dogs had a conception failure within last year. These dogs had a history of prior normal fertility. Twenty six fertile dogs served as control. All animals underwent a clinical examination as well as ultrasonography. Sperm concentration was significantly lower in infertile dogs than in fertile dogs. For most determined motility parameters (MOT, PMOT, VAP, VSL, VCL, BCF, RAPID, STATIC) significant differences between infertile and fertile dogs were found. The percentage of spermatozoa with normal morphology also significantly differed between both groups. Ultrasonography of the prostate gland and testes revealed no pathological conditions. The testicular degeneration was assumed to be a possible cause of infertility in these dogs. The present study showed that the most sperm CASA motility parameters were significantly lower in infertile dogs in comparison to the fertile ones, and confirmed the usefulness of the Hamilton-Thorne Semen Analyser for a quick and objective analysis of sperm concentration and motility in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical examination 3aconception 3aprostate gland 3asemen quality 3asperm concentration 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3aultrasonography 0adogs 0asemen quality 0ainfertility 0acomputer analysis1 aZduńczyk, Sławomir1 aNiżański, Wojciech1 aJanowski, Tomasz0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 57, no. 3 p.429-432dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245013600162300001400298520136500312592002801677650002201705650003001727650001701757650001701774650001301791650001201804650002701816650001601843650001101859651002501870651001001895653003201905653001201937653001801949653002801967653000901995653001502004700001902019700001802038700001902056700002402075773010202099856007602201852000902277655001202286IND60695934520221118235434.0200520e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069593452DNAL7 a10.1675/063.043.01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraixedas, Sara10aBenefits of the European Agri-Environment Schemes for Wintering Lapwings: A Case Study from Rice Fields in the Mediterranean Region  ap. 86-93.  aMediterranean European rice fields provide important habitats for migrating waterbirds. In winter, one waterbird species that particularly benefits from rice fields is the Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), a species threatened in Europe. To assess the effect of agri-environmental measures on rice field selection and use by wintering lapwings, bird counts were conducted in northeastern Spain during two consecutive winters (2005-2006 and 2006-2007). Information on two mandatory post-harvest management prescriptions of the agri-environment schemes was collected, namely winter flooding (percent ground surface covered by water) and whether fields were rolled or not. The number of lapwings in rolled fields was significantly higher compared to non-rolled fields. For instance, an average rolled field with 50% water cover (percentage at which lapwing abundance more or less peaked) would host an estimated 12.03 ± 0.52 SE lapwings versus 0.18 ± 0.58 in a non-rolled field. While the maximum abundance of lapwings in rolled fields was found at an intermediate percentage of water cover (about 25 to 75%), the number of lapwings increased steadily with water cover in non-rolled fields. Rice post-harvest practices derived from the agri-environment schemes are beneficial for biodiversity, promoting the conservation of suitable habitats for waterbirds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVanellus vanellus 3aagri-environmental policy 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3ahabitats 3apaddies 3apostharvest technology 3awater birds 3awinter 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aAgri-environmental measures 0alapwing 0aMediterranean 0apost-harvest management 0arice 0awaterbirds1 aBurgas, Daniel1 aRobson, David1 aCamps, Joachim1 aBarriocanal, Carles0 tWaterbirds.g2020 May 19, v. 43, no. 1 p.86-93dWaterbirds SocietywJournal:6297x1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.043.01093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012400155300001600279500002000295520172400315592002802039596005902067650001102126650002802137650002002165650002802185650001402213650001502227650002402242650002402266650001702290650001302307700001402320700005002334700001302384700001402397700001502411700001102426700001702437700001302454700001702467700005402484700001602538700006802554773013002622856007402752852000902826655001202835IND60782926420221123044233.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078292642DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.107882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiajia10aFeeding intolerance score in critically ill patients with enteral nutrition: A post hoc analysis of a prospective study  ap. 869-877.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Feeding intolerance (FI) is common in critically ill patients fed with enteral nutrition. Although there is increasing evidence showing the association between FI and mortality, no reliable quantitative assessment was available in clinical practice. In this study, we proposed a FI scoring system based on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms to assist the implementation of enteral nutrition and assessed its association with 28‐day mortality. METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis based on data collected in a previous cross‐sectional study. All adult patients who were enterally fed were included. Various definitions of FI were compared. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was used to assess the predictive performance for 28‐day mortality. Pearson correlation coefficient and the variance inflation factor were applied to detect collinearity among variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for 28‐day mortality. RESULTS: Of the 1098 patients included, 200 (18.2%) were nonsurvivors. The incidence of GI symptoms was higher in nonsurvivors on the study day. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the proposed FI score was an independent risk factor for 28‐day mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.37; 95% CI, 1.25–1.51; P < .001). Moreover, the FI score showed better predictive accuracy for 28‐day mortality than the other definitions (AUROC: 0.633 [95% CI, 0.591–0.675] for the FI score vs 0.595 (95% CI, 0.557–0.633] for the best‐performing FI definition [P = 0.001]). CONCLUSIONS: FI score is independently associated with 28‐day mortality in critically ill patients with acceptable predictive accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data  a82070665cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aadults 3across-sectional studies 3aenteral feeding 3agastrointestinal system 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3aprospective studies 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3avariance1 aLiu, Yang1 aKe, Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8093-50731 aLi, Gang1 aLv, Cheng1 aZhou, Jing1 aYe, Bo1 aLi, Baiqiang1 aYang, Qi1 aTong, Zhihui1 aLi, Weiqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8483-62641 aLi, Jieshou1 afor the Chinese Critical Care Nutrition Trials Group (CCCNTG), 0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2022 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.869-877dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.107883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245014200167300001600309520083000325592002801155650001001183650001901193650001401212650002001226650002501246650001801271650001701289653002701306653002001333653004301353653003101396653001401427700001901441700001901460700002301479700002101502773014001523856007901663852000901742655001201751IND60720266020221119192225.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026602DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Toshiro10aHistory of internal radiation exposure in a wild masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) at Fukushima assessed by autoradiography of vibrissae  ap. 433-435.  aAutoradiography was used to visualise an internal radiation in the vibrissae of a wild masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) carcass found in a highly radioactive contamination area within 50 km from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident site. Autoradiogram of the vibrissae revealed a higher density in the root than in the shaft showing a stripe pattern; the γ-ray spectrum of the vibrissae showed peaks of ¹³⁴Cs and ¹³⁷Cs. The radiocaesium taken into the body was responsible for its distribution into the vibrissae shaft during its growth. The stripe pattern indicated that internal radiation exposure was intermittent.

Blood samples were collected in the period of intense and moderate exercise. Serum concentrations of active and total ghrelin were measured using commercial RIA kits. Exercise did not cause the disruption in energy homeostasis, which was confirmed by the conducted tests. Total concentration of ghrelin measured during the increased effort intensity elevated in stallions (from 1031.45 to 1732.19 pg/mL at P ≤ 0.05). The opposite situation occurred in the case of active ghrelin, which concentration did not increase significantly in mares (from 26.21 to 28.46 pg/mL), whereas an insignificant decrease was noted in stallions (from 24.19 to 22.54 pg/mL). The only significant difference between stallions and mares was noted in the 2ⁿᵈ sampling (P = 0.015). The research proved that the fluctuations of both studied parameters did not reflect a negative impact of the increased effort.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aenergy 3aexercise 3aghrelin 3ahomeostasis 0ahorses 0aghrelin 0aexercise1 aLutnicki, Krzysztof1 aRowicka, Agnieszka Zofia1 aBryl, Monika1 aNowakowicz-Dębek, Bożena0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 57, no. 3 p.443-447dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012800177300001600305520110400321592002801425650001501453650002001468650003801488650001201526650002601538650001901564650001301583650001701596650001701613650002401630650004301654650005201697650002001749650001701769650002901786653002801815653003001843653004701873653004201920653002701962700002001989700002102009700001802030773009002048856008602138852000902224655001202233IND60602770920221117003943.0180711e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060277092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2015.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssinder, Stephen J.10aOxytocin differentially effects 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5α-reductase activities in prostate cancer cell lines  ap. 149-155.  aIt is known that oxytocin stimulates steroidogenesis in several organs by modulating activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSD3B) and steroid 5α-reductases (SRD5A). However, this has not been established in prostate cancer where these enzymes, key to local production of androgens, are increased. Analysis of both HSD3B and SRD5A activities using a live cell in situ colourimetric assay demonstrated that in PC-3 cells HSD3B activity was significantly increased by oxytocin whilst SRD5A activity was unchanged. This was confirmed in ELISA based assays of conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone and testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in cell lysates following treatment. In contrast, oxytocin significantly inhibited HSD3B activity in LNCaPs, but significantly increased activity of SRD5A, as confirmed by ELISA assays. Analysis of both cell lines by microarray and qRT-PCR determined that these changes were not due to altered gene transcription. This study demonstrates differential effects of oxytocin on the activities of key de novo steroidogenic enzymes in prostate cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aenzymes 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxytocin 3apregnenolone 3aprogesterone 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asteroidogenesis 3atestosterone 3atranscription (genetics) 0aDe novo steroidogenesis 0aSteroid-5-alpha-reductase 0a3-Oxo-5alpha-steroid delta 4-dehydrogenase 0aHydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase 0aProgesterone reductase1 aDavies, Kathryn1 aSurija, Jonathan1 aLiu-Fu, Frank0 tPeptides.g2015 Sept., v. 71 p.149-155dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245006100204300001600265520156800281592002801849650002101877650001601898650002501914651002501939700002701964773013301991856008302124852000902207655001202216IND60771122420221119012827.0220417e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077112242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-022-03971-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcar, Zahide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9174-044710aInvestigation of extreme precipitation indices in Turkey  ap. 679-691.  aThis paper focuses on spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation indices of Turkey’s precipitation data for the periods 1966–2014. Seven precipitation indices include the number of extremely wet days, very wet days, heavy precipitation days (10 mm and 20 mm), simple daily intensity days, and consecutive dry and wet days. The indices are based on homogenized precipitation data. Besides, long-term changes and trends in the time series of precipitation indices in terms of climatic variability were investigated using nonparametric time series analysis methods. The results obtained are summarized as follows. Extremely wet and very wet day indices include significant decreasing trends in most stations. The trend is statistically significant at some stations in the Mediterranean region and southeastern Anatolia region. The number of heavy precipitation day indices tend to decrease in most of the stations in the Mediterranean precipitation zone, throughout Turkey. Simple daily intensity index generally displays an increasing trend. Consecutive dry days include an overall upward trend throughout Turkey. The inner and in the west of southeastern Anatolia regions have displayed a statistically significant increasing trend. Consecutive humid days tend to decrease overall outside of Turkey’s internal parts. The study also examined the relationships between atmospheric oscillation indices and precipitation indices. Accordingly, the atmospheric oscillation index that has the most decisive effect on the Turkish precipitation indices is NAO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aclimatology 3atime series analysis 3aMediterranean region1 aGönençgil, Barbaros,0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2022 Apr., v. 148, no. 1-2 p.679-691dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-03971-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245014700209300001600356520137400372592002801746650002301774650001901797650002101816650002601837650001201863650001101875650002501886650001601911650000901927650002001936650001801956650001901974650001801993650001402011650001602025650001102041650001902052650001302071650001702084650001502101650002002116650002902136650003302165650001002198653002102208653001902229653001802248653002202266700001802288700002102306700002202327700005802349700005802407773011402465856008602579852000902665655001202674IND60634390020221119194024.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisany, Weria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0260-090210aEnhancement of the antifungal activity of thyme and dill essential oils against Colletotrichum nymphaeae by nano-encapsulation with copper NPs  ap. 213-225.  aNanotechnology is a quickly growing field and have been actually used in a varied assortment of marketable products worldwide. Nanoencapsulation demonstrations the advantage of more efficient and targeted use of pesticides in an environmentally friendly way. Research and development in post-harvest nanotechnology can help to preserve food freshness and quality and prevent diseases in a relatively safer way. In this regard, essential oils (EOs) represent promising agents for reducing food decay and development of pathogen microorganisms. The overall aim of the present study was to encapsulate Iranian thyme (Thymus daenensis L) and dill (Anethum graveolens L.) EOs in copper nanoparticles (NPs) and to evaluate their antifungal activity against the phytopathogen Colletotrichum nymphaeae. Encapsulation of thyme and dill EOs with copper NPs resulted effective in reducing the mycelium growth even by 90% after 9 days treatment. Furthermore a strong inhibitory effect on conidia germination of C. nymphaeae was observed. SEM observations indicated that C. nymphaeae treated with EOs, copper NPs and encapsulated EOs, showed deformation in mycelial growth and hyphae twisting. In summary, these results showed that nano-encapsulation of EOs with NPs, using safe materials, increased the perspective of their effectiveness as new plant disease management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnethum graveolens 3aColletotrichum 3aThymus daenensis 3aantifungal properties 3aconidia 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3adeformation 3adill 3adisease control 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3afood spoilage 3afreshness 3agermination 3ahyphae 3amicroorganisms 3amycelium 3ananocapsules 3apesticides 3aplant pathogens 3aresearch and development 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athyme 0aMedicinal plants 0aNanotechnology 0aPhytopathogen 0aSpore germination1 aSamadi, Saadi1 aAmini, Jahanshir1 aHossaini, Somaieh1 aYousefi, Shima1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1533-40651 aMaggi, Filippo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1375-47440 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 June, v. 132 p.213-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245011800186300001600304500001500320520176300335592002802098650004702126650002602173650001402199650003602213650002302249650003102272650002802303650002302331650002202354650002302376650003202399650007402431650003902505650001502544653003402559653003002593653001602623653001602639653001202655700002402667700002902691700002402720700002502744773013202769852000902901856008302910655001202993IND4394218320221121045008.0181012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439421832DNAL7 a176093552pmid7 a10.1177/1040638707019004152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThachil, Anil J.10aApplication of Polymerase Chain Reaction Fingerprinting to Differentiate Ornithobacterium Rhinotracheale Isolates  ap. 417-420.  a2019-12-04  aOrnithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is an infectious respiratory pathogen of chickens, turkeys, and wild birds. There are 18 serotypes of ORT reported worldwide. In this study, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) polymerase chain reaction and random amplified polymorphic DNA assay with Universal M13 primer-based fingerprinting techniques were investigated for their ability to differentiate ORT isolates. The authors examined 50 field isolates and 8 reference strains of ORT for their genetic differences. The fingerprint patterns were compared with serotyping results of ORT by the agar gel precipitation test. M13 fingerprinting revealed different patterns for 6 reference serotypes of ORT that were tested, namely, C, D, E, I, J, and K. Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale reference serotypes A and F yielded indistinguishable fingerprints with M13 fingerprinting. The ERIC 1R technique discerned only 5 of the 8 reference serotypes of ORT. Distinct fingerprints were also found within the ORT serotypes with both techniques. From 58 isolates of ORT that were fingerprinted belonging to 8 ORT serotypes, 10 different fingerprints were obtained with M13 fingerprinting and 6 different fingerprints were obtained with ERIC 1R fingerprinting. M13 fingerprinting technique was found to be more discriminative in differentiating ORT isolates than the ERIC 1R fingerprinting technique. These results suggest that fingerprinting techniques may be a more discerning tool for characterizing ORT isolates than the serological test using the agar gel precipitation test. This fingerprinting technique could potentially be a valuable tool in identifying an isolate from a clinical outbreak of ORT infection for development of an autogenous vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3adiagnostic techniques 3aserotypes 3aOrnithobacterium rhinotracheale 3astrain differences 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3apathogen identification 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3amicrobial genetics 2aDNA Fingerprintingxmethods 2aOrnithobacteriumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSerotyping 0aPCR fingerprinting; subtyping 0apolymerase chain reaction 0amethodology 0anew methods 0astrains1 aVelayudhan, Binu T.1 aLopes-Berkas, Vanessa C.1 aHalvorson, David A.1 aNagaraja, Kakambi V.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 19, no. 4 p.417-420dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638707019004153Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02700naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245013400194300001500328520118600343592002801529650002301557650001801580650001001598650000901608650001201617650002201629650001101651650001701662650001201679650004401691650001201735700002001747700002201767700002001789700001701809700001901826700002601845773015201871856007002023856010502093990002302198852000902221655001202230IND60608613720221120164744.0190510e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060861372DNAL7 a10.3791/565742doi7 aPMC59313742pmcid7 a295535222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurihara, Sho12aA surgical procedure for the administration of drugs to the inner ear in a non-human primate common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)  ap. e56574.  aHearing research has long been facilitated by rodent models, although in some diseases, human symptoms cannot be recapitulated. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, easy-to-handle New World monkey which has a similar anatomy of the temporal bone, including the middle ear ossicular chains and inner ear to humans, than in comparison with that of rodents. Here, we report a reproducible, safe, and rational surgical approach to the cochlear round window niche for the drug delivery to the inner ear of the common marmoset. We adopted posterior tympanotomy, a procedure used clinically in human surgery, to avoid manipulation of the tympanic membrane that may cause conductive hearing loss. This surgical procedure did not lead to any significant hearing loss. This approach was possible due to the large bulla structure of the common marmoset, although the lateral semicircular canal and vertical portion of the facial nerve should be carefully considered. This surgical method allows us to perform the safe and accurate administration of drugs without hearing loss, which is of great importance in obtaining pre-clinical proof of concept for translational research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallithrix jacchus 3aanimal models 3adrugs 3aears 3ahearing 3ahearing disorders 3ahumans 3anerve tissue 3arodents 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asurgery1 aFujioka, Masato1 aYoshida, Tomohiko1 aKoizumi, Makoto1 aOgawa, Kaoru1 aKojima, Hiromi1 aOkano, Hirotaka James0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Feb. 27, , no. 132 p.e56574-e56574dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/565743Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56574/a-surgical-procedure-for-administration-drugs-to-inner-ear-non-human  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015000166520135700316592002801673650001401701650001101715650001501726650001701741650001701758650002101775650001201796650001701808650001901825650001601844650002801860650001401888653002501902653002801927653002101955653001401976653002201990653003002012700001502042700002002057700001502077700001802092773011202110856008602222852000902308655001202317IND60683672220221122005721.0210121e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yantao10aPreparation of a moderate viscosity, high performance and adequately-stabilized soy protein-based adhesive via recombination of protein molecules  aDeveloping a clean and environmentally-friendly soy protein adhesive to replace formaldehyde-based adhesive is of great significance for sustainable development of resources and human health. Due to the high molecular weight of protein, the resultant soy protein adhesive has a high viscosity and unstable bonding performance, which limit their application on plywood fabrication. Inspiring by theory of molecular recombination enhancing material properties, in this study, bromelain was used to degraded soy protein molecules into small polypeptide chains; a bio-derived cross-linker, triglycidylamine (TGA), was employed to recombine these polypeptide chains to develop a new cleaner soy protein-based adhesive with an excellent and stable bonding performance. The results showed that the molecular weight of soy protein decreased from 10 to 170 KDa to below 25 KDa by adding 0.4% bromelain. Using 3% TGA and 0.1% bromelain, the resultant adhesive viscosity decreased 95% and the wet shear strength increased 76.2% to 1.11 MPa compared with that of the unmodified adhesive. At the same time, the adhesive distribution, bonding stability have been improved significantly. More important, this molecular recombination soy protein adhesive reduced the amount of crosslinker more than 50% compared to other cross-linked modified soy protein adhesives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3aamines 3abromelains 3acrosslinking 3ahuman health 3amolecular weight 3aplywood 3apolypeptides 3ashear strength 3asoy protein 3asustainable development 3aviscosity 0aSoy protein adhesive 0aMolecular recombination 0aTriglycidylamine 0aViscosity 0aBonding stability 0aThe amount of crosslinker1 aHan, Yufei1 aShi, Sheldon Q.1 aGao, Qiang1 aLi, Jianzhang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 10, v. 255 p.120303-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245008600157300001800243500001900261500000900280520154000289592002801829650002201857650001301879650002401892650001801916650001401934650002201948650001201970650001101982650001401993650001102007650001902018650001402037650001002051650002702061650002202088650001702110700001802127700001402145700001802159700001702177773013502194856007802329852000902407655001202416IND60663770820221121034318.0191122e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377082DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj13.02022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Qiang10aSplit Application of Potassium Improves Yield and End-Use Quality of Winter Wheat  ap. 1411-1419.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aMany studies have investigated the effects of basal K fertilization on the yield and quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, less is known about the influence of the split application of K on yield, size distribution of protein fractions, and quality of wheat. Field studies were conducted in two successive seasons (2010/2011 and 2011/2012) using four winter wheat cultivars, Jimai 20, Gaocheng 8901, Yannong 19, and Jinan 17, and three regimes of K fertilization (K0: no K fertilization; KB: basal K fertilization of 120 kg ha–¹; KS: basal K fertilization of 60 kg ha–¹ plus topdressing of 60 kg ha–¹ at jointing). The yield and its components, protein composition, dough-mixing properties, and bread-making quality were determined after harvesting. On average, the KS treatments had a yield advantage over KB treatments mainly resulting from higher kernel weight. The KS treatments improved wheat quality resulted in increased glutenin/gliadin ratio, higher polymerization index (the ratio of sodium dodecyl sulfate to insoluble glutenin in total glutenin), and larger glutenin macropolymer (GMP) particles compared to KB fertilization. No differences in the content of crude protein and wet gluten were found between the KS and KB treatments. Dough development time, stability time, and loaf volume were positively correlated with the glutenin/gliadin ratio, polymerization index, and average size of the GMP, respectively. These results suggest that KS can improve the yield and end-use quality of winter wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3abreadmaking quality 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3adough development 3agliadin 3agluten 3aglutenins 3aloaves 3apolymerization 3apotassium 3aseeds 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asplit application 3awinter wheat1 aJia, Dianyong1 aZhang, Yu1 aDai, Xinglong1 aHe, Mingrong0 tAgronomy journal.g2014 July, v. 106, no. 4 p.1411-1419dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj13.02023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010300160300001600263500002000279500001500299520099700314592002801311650002401339650001001363650001301373650002301386650002601409650002601435650001001461650000901471650001901480650001601499650001401515650001201529650001501541653001201556773009101568856007301659852000901732655001201741IND60569770220221118060512.0170609e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056977022DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.124372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöbel, Gerlinde10aSocial facilitation is a better predictor of frog reproductive activity than environmental factors  ap. 372-381.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aAnuran breeding activity is frequently linked to environmental factors, mainly temperature and rainfall. However, a key feature of anuran reproductive behavior—gathering in choruses and producing loud advertisement calls to attract females—generates a conspicuous social cue that may also facilitate reproductive behavior. Here, I examine the relative importance of environmental and social factors in explaining the intensity of reproductive activity in the Neotropical treefrog Hypsiboas rosenbergi. I show that social cues generally play an important role, but that there are sex differences: male behavior is associated with a combination of environmental and social factors, while female behavior is associated almost exclusively with social cues. I discuss the potential benefits of using social cues in regulating breeding activity, and suggest that conservation efforts may take advantage of the apparently widespread pattern of social facilitation in anuran reproductive ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3asocial facilitation 3amales 3abreeding 3agender differences 3areproductive behavior 3aenvironmental factors 3afrogs 3arain 3asocial factors 3atemperature 3aHypsiboas 3afemales 3aNeotropics 0aecology0 tBiotropica.g2017 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.372-381dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.124373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015500163300001600318520155300334592002801887650001001915650002601925650001001951650001001961650002201971650001001993650001202003650002202015650001202037651002102049700001802070700002102088700002102109700001802130700002002148700002702168773016302195856004002358852000902398655001202407IND50074359320221121081718.0140329e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007435932DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.122482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeixas, Fernando A.10aColonization history of Mallorca Island by the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, and the Iberian hare, Lepus granatensis (Lagomorpha: Leporidae)  ap. 748-760.  aThe Mediterranean islands have a long history of human‐mediated introductions resulting in frequent replacements of their fauna and flora. Although these histories are sometimes well documented or may be inferred from paleontological studies, the use of phylogenetic and population genetic reconstruction methods provides a complementary perspective for answering questions related to the history of insular species. In the present study, we infer the colonization history of Mallorca (Balearic Islands) by the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) using sequence variation of the mitochondrial DNA control region from continental and insular specimens (total of 489 sequences). Additionally, the taxonomic identity of Mallorcan L. granatensis was confirmed using a diagnostic nuclear marker. For both Mallorcan rabbits and hares, genetic diversity was comparable to the continental populations, suggesting the introduction of multiple lineages. Two Mallorcan haplogroups were found in hares, which likely correspond to two introduction events. Rabbits from Mallorca were identified as belonging to the subspecies Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus, and may have been originated both from Iberian and French populations. The molecular estimates of the timing of the colonization events of the Mallorcan lagomorphs are consistent with human‐mediated introductions by early settlers on the islands. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 748–760.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3afauna 3aflora 3agenetic variation 3ahares 3aislands 3amitochondrial DNA 3arabbits 3aBalearic Islands1 aJuste, Javier1 aCampos, Paula F.1 aCarneiro, Miguel1 aFerrand, Nuno1 aAlves, Paulo C.1 aMelo‐Ferreira, José0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2014 Apr., v. 111, no. 4 p.748-760dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Academic Pressx0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.12248  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011100165300001800276500001900294520136700313592002801680650001501708650001501723650001101738650002001749650001801769650001501787650001801802650001301820650001901833650001101852650001701863650002801880650001601908650001201924653003201936653001701968653001801985653002002003700001502023700001302038700001402051700001302065700005502078773014302133856008502276852000902361655001202370IND60741504320221121231053.0210615e20210531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074150432DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c022482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGan, Quan10aTwo-Dimensional Ion-Imprinted Silica for Selective Uranium Extraction from Low-Level Radioactive Effluents  ap. 7973-7981.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recovery of uranium from low-level radioactive effluents (LLRE) is of strategic significance for the sustainable development of nuclear energy. However, the high salinity, massive coexisting nuclides, and radioactivity of LLRE are the major challenges for selective uranium extraction. Herein, a two-dimensional U(VI)-imprinted strategy is developed for highly selective uranium extraction through one-step fabrication of a specific U(VI)-imprinted cavity on silica lamellar. Thanks to the two-dimensional structure of silica lamellar, the optimal adsorbent possesses a high specific surface area of 497.7 m² g–¹ and abundant imprinted cavities with a phosphate group. Thus, the adsorbent has an adsorption capacity of 224.2 mg g–¹ at 298 K, which is higher than most of the U(VI)-imprinted adsorbents. As the temperature increases to 308 and 318 K, the adsorption capacity gradually increases to 253.8 and 274.0 mg g–¹, respectively. In addition, due to the great affinity to uranium and stability of imprinted cavities, the adsorbent exhibits a good salt tolerance of adsorption and a high selectivity for uranium against other coexisting ions even after 6 adsorption–desorption cycles. This work provides an efficient strategy for designing selective U(VI) adsorbents for LLRE treatment, which is meaningful in environmental and energy fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3anuclear power 3aphosphates 3aradioactivity 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asilica 3asurface area 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3auranium 0aNuclear effluents treatment 0aRadionuclide 0aHigh salinity 0aSilica lamellar1 aXu, Meiyun1 aLi, Qian1 aYang, Sen1 aYin, Jia1 aHua, Daoben1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1813-69880 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 May 31, v. 9, no. 23 p.7973-7981dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c022483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245006900162300001600231520122500247592002801472650000801500650001601508650002001524650001801544650001601562650001601578650001701594650001601611650002501627650000701652650001801659650001801677650002201695650002001717650001601737700001501753700001901768700001701787700001401804773011701818856008101935852000902016655001202025IND60572901120221118221855.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-017-0854-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Huina10aDeinococcus planocerae sp. nov., isolated from a marine flatworm  ap. 811-817.  aA Gram-positive, non-motile and coccoid strain, designated XY-FW106ᵀ, was isolated from a marine flatworm identified to be Planocera sp. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this pink organism was consistent with membership of the genus Deinococcus, with high sequence similarity to Deinococcus aetherius ST0316ᵀ (94.7%). The optimum growth temperature range of the strain XY-FW106ᵀ was found to be 25–30 °C and optimum growth occurs at pH 7.2–7.4 without NaCl. The strain XY-FW106ᵀ was found to contain unidentified glycolipids, unidentified phosphoglycolipids, unidentified phospholipids and unidentified lipids, which differed from those of closely related species. Menaquinone MK-8 was identified as the major respiratory quinone and the predominant cellular fatty acids were found to be Summed Feature 3 (C₁₆:₁ ω7c/C₁₆:₁ ω6c), C₁₆:₀, iso-C₁₅:₀, and Summed Feature 8 (C₁₈:₁ ω7c/C₁₈:₁ ω6c). The DNA G+C content was determined to be 70.2 mol%. The biochemical and chemotaxonomic data together suggest that the strain represents a new species for which the name Deinococcus planocerae sp. nov. is proposed.

Seed dispersal is also notoriously difficult to characterize, especially in species rich and spatially complex tropical forests. We contrasted assemblages of biotically dispersed seeds collected from four sites using two methods: deposition into seed traps and interception by the capture of frugivorous birds. We also compared seed deposition and interception with local fruit production. Species accumulation curves for seeds deposited in seed traps began to level off sooner than curves for seeds collected from birds captured in mist nets, and extrapolation showed significantly greater estimated species richness for seeds collected from birds than for those deposited in traps. Assemblages from birds and from traps at each site were quite different, with an abundance‐based similarity index of 0.64; this dissimilarity increases if bat‐dispersed seeds are included in the analysis. Common bird‐dispersed species were retrieved from both mist‐netted birds and from seed traps, but numerous locally fruiting understory species were recovered only from birds. We conclude that the sampling of seeds carried by birds provides a valuable complement to other methods of studying seed dispersal in species‐rich tropical forests by revealing relationships between specific dispersers and their seed plants and by creating a more complete account of species diversity of seeds being transported at a given site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpermatophytina 3abirds 3aclimate change 3afrugivores 3afruiting 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3atraps 3atropical forests 3aunderstory1 aMalloy, Ryan1 aMurray, Greg0 tBiotropica.g2017 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.303-308dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.124193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002500165245007900190300001600269500001500285520099000300592002801290650002001318650000901338650002501347650001301372650002801385650002201413650001001435650002701445650002701472650001701499650001701516650001901533650001101552650001901563650002201582650001201604650006601616650004401682650005501726650004401781650004301825650004401868650001101912653001301923653000801936653001101944653002901955700002101984773013202005852000902137856008302146655001202229IND4394218720221121035622.0181012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439421872DNAL7 a176093592pmid7 a10.1177/1040638707019004192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRassnick, Kenneth M.10aCyclooxygenase-2 Immunoreactivity in Equine Ocular Squamous-Cell Carcinoma  ap. 436-439.  a2019-12-04  aSquamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common tumor in horses, and 40%-50% may occur in ocular and adnexal structures. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is an inducible enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandins that control cell growth and the development and progression of cancer. Mechanisms responsible for the initial upregulation of COX-2 in neoplasia are unclear; prolonged sunlight exposure and mutations in the p53 gene may be possibilities. Because the etiopathogenesis of ocular SCC in horses may involve ultraviolet sunlight and p53 mutations, the purpose of this study was to characterize the immunoreactivity of COX-2 in these tumors. Cyclooxygenase-2 expression was found in 6 of 22 (27%) paraffin-embedded equine SCCs. Cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity was associated with the mitotic index (P < 0.001). Strategies to inhibit COX-2 by the use of topical or systemic COX-2 inhibitors might prove to be a safe and economical treatment in some horses with SCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3asolar radiation 3aeyes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amutation 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agenes 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aimmunologic techniques 3apathogenesis 3aeye diseases 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3adisease course 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aCarcinoma, Squamous Cellxenzymologyximmunologyxveterinary. 2aCyclooxygenase 2xanalysisximmunology. 2aEye Neoplasmsxenzymologyximmunologyxveterinary. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHorse Diseasesxenzymologyximmunology. 2aHorses 0aetiology 0aeye 0aCancer 0aneoplasia, ophthalmology1 aNjaa, Bradley L.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 19, no. 4 p.436-439dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638707019004193Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02499naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009100180300001600271520124600287592002801533650001401561650001601575650001901591650001101610650000901621650002001630651001001650653001301660653001601673653001501689653001001704653002201714653001201736653001401748653001801762700002101780700001701801700003201818773012101850856008501971852000902056655001202065IND60524196220221122230153.0160705e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052419622DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2016.11032382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnnikrishnan Warrier, C.10aStudies on stable isotopic composition of daily rainfall from Kozhikode, Kerala, India  ap. 219-230.  aThe stable isotopic compositions of all major daily rain fall samples (n = 113) collected from Kozhikode station in Kerala, India, for the year 2010 representing the pre-monsoon, southwest and northeast monsoon seasons are examined. The isotopic variations δ ¹⁸O, δ ²H and d -excess in daily rainfall ranged from δ ¹⁸O: −4.4 to 2 ‰, δ ²H: −25.3 to 13.8 ‰, and d -excess: −2.4 to 15.3 ‰; δ ¹⁸O: −9.7 to −0.6 ‰, δ ²H: −61.7 to 5.3 ‰, and d -excess 5.8 to 17.4 ‰; δ ¹⁸O −11.3 to −1.4 ‰, δ ²H: −75.3 to 0.9 ‰, and d -excess: 8.8 to 21.3 ‰ during the pre-, southwest and northeast monsoon periods, respectively. Thus, daily rainfall events during two monsoon periods had a distinct range of isotopic variations. The daily rain events within the two monsoon seasons also exhibited periodic variations. The isotopic composition of rain events during pre-monsoon and a few low-intensity events during the southwest monsoon period had imprints of secondary evaporation. This study analysing the stable isotopic characteristics of individual rain events in southern India, which is influenced by dual monsoon rainfall, will aid in a better understanding of its mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium 3aevaporation 3amonsoon season 3aoxygen 3arain 3astable isotopes 3aIndia 0ad-excess 0aevaporation 0ahydrogen-2 0aIndia 0aisotope hydrology 0amonsoon 0aoxygen-18 0aprecipitation1 aPraveen Babu, M.1 aSudheesh, M.1 aDeshpande, Rajendrakumar D.0 tIsotopes in Environmental and Health Studies.g2016 May 3, v. 52, no. 3 p.219-230dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2016.11032383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245011600136300001400252520102000266592002801286650002701314650001401341650002501355650002001380650001101400650001301411650001201424650001101436650001801447650001201465650001101477650001401488650002001502650001001522650001301532650001201545650002201557653001601579653002201595653001401617653001301631700001801644700002501662700001801687700001501705773014301720852000901863655001201872IND60710321820221121234045.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaik, V Chinna Babu10aSurvival and Development of American Bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera on Bt Cotton Hybrids of Different Bt Events  ap. 16-24.  aBt hybrids of different events were evaluated for their efficacy against the target lepidopteran through laboratory studies. The mortality of early larval instars of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) fed on leaves and squares of all the Bt event hybrids was higher than the later instars. Exposure of later instar larvae to plant parts of Bt event hybrids exhibited adverse effects on the growth and development such as reduced larval weights, prolonged larval developmental period, reduced pupation, formation of small pupae with less weight, reduction in adult emergence with low growth and survival indices for H. armigera. The growth index values were low for the larvae reared on leaves compared to those reared on squares of Bt cotton hybrids. The highest Cry protein toxin was observed at 60 DAS with a progressive decrease at 90 DAS and 120 DAS and negligible levels at 150 DAS during both the seasons. The Cry protein content was slightly high in RCH 2 BG-II hybrid compared to all the other Bt cotton hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aGossypium 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aadverse effects 3acotton 3aeclosion 3ahybrids 3aimagos 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3aleaves 3amortality 3aprotein content 3apupae 3apupation 3arearing 3atransgenic plants 0aDevelopment 0aamerican bollworm 0aBt cotton 0asurvival1 aPrasad, NVVSD1 aRamachandra Rao, G.,1 aRaghavaiah, G1 aKranthi, S0 tIndian journal of plant protection.g2013 Mar., v. 41, no. 1 p.16-24dPlant Protection Association of IndiawJournal:2004x2249-78707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245007200163300001800235500001900253500000900272520157600281592002801857650002201885650001301907650001201920650001401932650002001946650002601966650001301992650002102005650001102026650001702037651001002054700001802064773013502082856008002217852000902297655001202306IND60663771120221121043252.0191122e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377112DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2013.02572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Pengfei12aA New Method for Winter Wheat Critical Nitrogen Curve Determination  ap. 1839-1846.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aAs a plant-based N diagnostic tool, critical N curves can be used to adjust the N input in a field according to the crop demand. Because the existing critical N curve determination methods may overestimate the critical N point, making the designed N curve above the actual one, this study presents an improved method to overcome this drawback. An N experiment was conducted during 2 yr (2010–2012) using different winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars in the northwestern plain of Shandong Province, China. Shoot biomass and N concentration were sampled weekly during the growing season. A new method for designing critical N curves was developed based on the existing N curve determination method and the t-test inversion. Using the above data set, the new and existing methods for designing a critical N curve were compared, and the effects of the different cultivars on the proposed N curve were evaluated. The results showed that the critical N curves generated using existing methods can successfully classify N-limited plants but fail to classify non-N-limited plants, however, the critical N curve determined using the new method was able to classify both N-limited and non-N-limited plants satisfactorily. Cross-validation showed that the new method exhibited a highest total correct classification rate of 76%, while the existing methods displayed total correct classification rates below 64%. Additionally, the proposed critical N curve is robust within species within the same region. Thus, the new method may be useful for N management in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adiagnostic techniques 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3at-test 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aZhu, Yunqiang0 tAgronomy journal.g2013 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1839-1846dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2013.02573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245022100171300001600392520160300408592002802011650002202039650001202061650001202073650001502085650001102100650001302111650001102124650002902135650001002164650001502174650002602189650001902215650002202234650001002256650001302266650000902279650003202288650002602320650001102346650001302357650001302370650001902383650001102402650001302413650002002426650001202446650001002458650001302468650001502481650000902496651001302505653001402518653002402532653002302556653002802579653002002607653001602627653001302643653001902656700002002675773012102695856008502816852000902901655001202910IND60524196420221122230206.0160705e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052419642DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2016.11149332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMechora, Špela10aEnvironmental assessment of freshwater ecosystems of the Sava River watershed and Cerkniško Lake, Slovenia, using the bioindicator species Fontinalis antipyretica: insights from stable isotopes and selected elements  ap. 239-257.  aTen locations in the Notranjska region, Slovenia, with different land use in the catchment (town, village and agricultural areas), including reference points with different geological composition considered as unpolluted sites, were sampled for water and aquatic moss to evaluate environmental assessment in fresh water systems of the Sava River watershed. Samples of fresh water and Fontinalis antipyretica were taken in all four seasons during the years 2010 and 2012. The water chemistry of the investigated locations was dominated by , while concentrations of seasonally ranged from 2.1 to 6.4 mg L ⁻¹ and at one of the reference sites did not exceed 1.3 mg L ⁻¹. δ ¹³C DIC values seasonally ranged from −13.3 to −8.1 ‰ and indicated waters dominated by degradation of organic matter and dissolution of carbonates. δ ¹³C ₚₗₐₙₜ values of F. antipyretica seasonally ranged from −45 to −32.9 ‰ and of δ ¹⁵N ₚₗₐₙₜ from −0.2 to 6.5 ‰. The higher δ ¹⁵N value of 6.5 ‰ found in F. antipyretica was related to agricultural activity in the watershed. The content of minor and trace elements in F. antipyretica ranged from 4–38 µg g ⁻¹ for Ni, 17–105 µg g ⁻¹ for Zn, 2–28 µg g ⁻¹ for Pb, 0.26–1.95 µg g ⁻¹ for Cd, 4–27 µg g ⁻¹ for Cu, 4–49 µg g ⁻¹ for Cr, 1–6 µg g ⁻¹ for As and 0.33–3.24 µg g ⁻¹ for Se.

Physicians may not be aware of the role of biological factors in causing weight regain after an initial weight loss. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered at continuing medical education conferences, both primary care and obesity‐specific. The questionnaire included items about biological and behavioral factors that predispose to weight regain and general items about treatment of obesity. The sample was separated into primary care physicians (PCPs) and physicians preparing for the obesity medicine (OMs) exam. RESULTS: Among all respondents, behavioral factors were given higher importance ratings, relative to biological factors in causing weight regain. Respondents rated behaviour modification as more effective, relative to medications or surgery to treat obesity. OMs gave higher importance ratings to biological factors, relative to PCPs. OMs also gave higher effectiveness ratings for medications and surgery, relative to PCPs. However, even OMs gave higher effectiveness ratings for behaviour modification, relative to medications or surgery. Respondents who reported a belief in the role of behavioral factors rated lifestyle modification as more effective. Respondents who reported a belief in both behavioral and biological factors rated medications as more effective. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians rate biological factors as less important, relative to behavioral factors in causing weight regain. Physicians rate medications and surgery as less effective, relative to lifestyle modification alone. Belief in the importance of behavioral factors correlated with a higher effectiveness rating for lifestyle modification. A better understanding of the biological basis for weight regain may help to increase comfort with the use of biological treatments for obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior modification 3alifestyle 3amedical education 3amedicine 3ametabolic diseases 3aobesity 3aquestionnaires 3asurgery 3aweight loss1 aHiston, T.1 aKyle, T.

Numerous agriculturally important dicot and monocot weeds, including Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), have evolved resistance to glyphosate via this mechanism. Specifically, the extrachromosomal amplification of the 5‐enopyruvlyshikimate‐3‐phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was found to be the basis for glyphosate resistance in Amaranthus weeds, for example Palmer amaranth and common waterhemp. Nonetheless, the mechanism of extrachromosomal amplification of the EPSPS gene was different in these weeds. These extrachromosomal elements are newly identified genetic components and represent a paradigm shift in genetics to provide an adaptive advantage to organisms to withstand stress. Also, the extrachromosomal amplified copies are touted to be unstable in many organisms, due to their unpredictable behaviour during mitosis or meiosis, suggesting that they may have not integrated into the host genome. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesise that, in the absence of selection, the number of EPSPS copies may dissipate leading to the reversal of glyphosate resistance to susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aAmaranthus tuberculatus 3aLolium multiflorum 3agene amplification 3agenes 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aresearch 3aweeds0 tWeed research.g2021 Apr., v. 61, no. 2 p.100-105dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.124733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04427naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009000160300001200250520290600262592002803168650002503196650001703221650002203238650002203260650000903282650001603291650002703307650002603334650001103360650001503371650001603386650001803402650002203420650002303442650001003465650003703475650001103512650001503523650001803538650001503556650001003571700001203581700001403593700001603607700001603623700001603639773015103655856008203806852000903888655001203897IND60572901520221118222040.0180619e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-5977-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGang, Lv10aPreferential flow characteristics of reclaimed mine soils in a surface coal mine dump  ap. 266.  aThere are a large number of macropores/tubular channels of a few centimeters and plant roots in reclaimed dump soils, which are the main reasons for the formation of soil macropores and soil preferential flow. To systematically study the morphological characteristics and variation of soil preferential flow for different reclaimed vegetations in a dump, a dye-staining experiment and physical and chemical analysis were carried out to investigate the formation mechanism and influencing factors of soil preferential flow in the vegetation restoration process. The results indicate that there were differences in the soil water breakthrough curves for different plots. The macropore effluent rate generally increased at first and then tended to stabilize. The soil steady effluent rate decreased with increasing soil depth, which reached the maximum and minimum values at the depths of 0∼5 cm (0.0193∼0.0315 mm s⁻¹) and 50∼60 cm (0.0028∼0.0035 mm s⁻¹), respectively. Furthermore, the radius of soil macropores under different types of reclaimed vegetation ranged from 0.03 to 4.71 mm, most of which ranged from 0.11 to 2.36 mm. The soil macroporosity of different reclaimed vegetation types ranged from 0.03 to 16.58%, which was significantly greater than 5%. The soil macroporosity determined 65% of the variation in the steady effluent rate and 42% of the variation in the saturated hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, the dye coverage ratio decreased as the soil layer depth increased in different plots, and there were some differences in each plot. The maximum dye coverage ratio occurred in the 0∼5 cm soil layer, which reached 90.37%. The dye coverage ratio at a depth of 0∼60 cm in six plots followed the order of Robinia pseudoacacia (26.48%) > Ulmus pumila (20.12%) > mixed forest (17.32%) > farmland (15.06%) > shrub (13.97%) > weeds (10.07%). The soil preferential flow mostly occurred in the 0∼40 cm soil depth layer, which occupied more than 93% of the total soil profile (0∼60 cm). Moreover, a Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors (soil, water, and plant factors) and the dye coverage ratio. The dye coverage ratio of soil preferential flow under different reclamation vegetations was very significantly or significantly positively correlated with the gravel content, mean radius of soil macropores, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, root weight density, and root length density, which promoted the formation and development of soil preferential flow. This study will provide a scientific basis for understanding the formation mechanism and perfecting the research system of soil preferential flow, vegetation restoration, and reconstruction in a dump; furthermore, this research offers significance guidance in the construction of green mines and the development of regional economics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aUlmus pumila 3aagricultural land 3achemical analysis 3acoal 3acorrelation 3aecological restoration 3aenvironmental factors 3agravel 3amacropores 3amined soils 3amixed forests 3apreferential flow 3aregional economics 3aroots 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3ashrubs 3asoil depth 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3aweeds1 aJun, Li1 aYexin, Li1 aDing, Wang,1 aYazhuo, Liu1 aXinyang, Fu0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 June, v. 189, no. 6 p.266-266dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-5977-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01658naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245014700194300001600341520054700357592002800904650002100932650001900953650001700972700001700989700001601006700001701022700001601039700006001055773014401115856007601259852000901335655001201344IND60627166420221118022749.0190128e20181227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062716642DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b124332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6522-252310aSite-Specifically Initiated Controlled/Living Branching Radical Polymerization: A Synthetic Route toward Hierarchically Branched Architectures  ap. 794-799.  aControlled/living radical polymerization was developed to synthesize branched polyacrylates and polystyrene with tunable degrees of branching and low dispersities.

First, capillary suction time (CST), specific resistance to filterability (SRF), and water content (Wc) are used to evaluate the sludge dewaterability. The effect of the hydrothermal temperature, the concentration and the molar ratio of FeSO₄ and Ca(ClO)₂ on the sludge dewatering performance was examined to determine the optimal conditions. Furthermore, the mechanism of the degradation of EPS in sludge was studied using density functional theory (DFT), e.g., electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis, bond order analysis, and bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) analysis. The results show that the sludge dewaterability was significantly improved with the combined method. The floc structure and the oxygen-containing groups of EPS in sludge are the key reasons for its hydrophilicity and high water content. The combined method can enhance sludge dewatering by breaking the floc structure and removing oxygen functional groups, which is a promising technology for sludge dewatering.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium hypochlorite 3adensity functional theory 3adewatering 3adissociation 3aenthalpy 3afilterability 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asludge 3atemperature 3awater content 0aSludge dewatering 0aExtracellular polymeric substances (EPS) 0aHydrothermal treatment 0aFeSO4/Ca(ClO)2 oxidation 0aDFT calculation1 aDou, Yuhao1 aTang, Qin1 aHuang, Yaji1 aSong, Min1 aZhou, Jun1 aFu, Lichun0 tFuel processing technology.g2020 Jan., v. 197 p.106196-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.1061963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245012200184300001600306520155400322592002801876650001201904650001001916650001401926650001401940650004401954650001901998650002602017650002202043650001502065650001702080650001602097650002602113650001402139650001202153650001602165650001002181650001002191650001302201650001202214650002802226650000902254650001102263650003302274650002302307650002102330650001302351650003802364650002002402700002602422700002102448700002102469700002402490700002302514773013202537852000902669856008302678655001202761IND4394491420221121015508.0181012e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439449142DNAL7 a174026232pmid7 a10.1177/1040638707019002172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouser, Pamela10aFatal Ricin Toxicosis in a Puppy Confirmed by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry when Using Ricinine as a Marker  ap. 216-220.  aRicin, a lectin from the castor bean plant (Ricinis communis), is considered one of the most potent plant toxins. Ingestion of masticated seeds results in high morbidity, with vomiting and watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea. The prognosis varies with the number of seeds ingested, the degree of mastication, individual susceptibility, and the delay in treatment. Low mortality restricts assessment of histologic lesions, and the literature on toxicologic analysis for ricin is limited. This report describes a fatal case of castor bean ingestion in a 12-week-old Mastiff puppy, with confirmation of ricin exposure through detection of the biomarker ricinine by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Despite supportive therapy, the puppy died several hours after presentation for acute vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. At necropsy, a segment of jejunum and mesenteric lymph nodes were congested. When the owner reported the presence of castor beans in the dog's feces, selected formalin-fixed and unfixed tissues were submitted for diagnostic evaluation. Histopathologic findings included superficial necrotizing enteritis of the jejunum and occasional, random foci of coagulative necrosis in the liver. The alkaloid ricinine was detected in gastric content by using a newly developed LC/MS method. This confirmation of exposure is important in the diagnosis of ricin toxicosis, because ingestion of castor beans is not always fatal, histologic lesions are nonspecific, and the degree of mastication can influence the effective dose of ricin.  aPublisher supplied data 3apuppies 3aricin 3apoisoning 3amortality 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3ahistopathology 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3abiomarkers 3acase studies 3ametabolites 3adiagnostic techniques 3amorbidity 3ajejunum 3alymph nodes 3afeces 3aliver 3anecrosis 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aIntestinal Mucosaxpathology 2aJejunumxpathology 2aLiverxpathology 2aNecrosis 2aPoisoningxpathologyxveterinary. 2aRicinxtoxicity1 aFiligenzi, Michael S.1 aPuschner, Birgit1 aJohnson, Valerie1 aMiller, Margaret A.1 aHooser, Stephen B.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 19, no. 2 p.216-220dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638707019002173Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02758naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008600164300001600250520136400266592002801630650001601658650001301674650002501687650002301712650001301735650002501748650002401773650002001797650001501817650001001832650001401842651001001856653002201866653002601888653002401914653003901938653002901977653002402006700001302030700001902043700001502062700001502077773009002092856008502182852000902267655001202276IND60607857820221118041642.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060785782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSui, Lili12aA quantification method for shale fracability based on analytic hierarchy process  ap. 637-645.  aA quantification method for evaluation of the fracability of shale is essential for optimizing hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs and enhancing shale gas recovery. To quantitatively evaluate the fracability, seven sets of shale cores are drilled from the reservoirs at different depths of an oilfield in the east of China. The influences of six fracability-related mechanical and physical characteristics of shale, i.e. brittleness, brittle mineral content, clay mineral content, cohesion, angle of internal friction, and unconfined compressive strength, are analyzed. A mathematical model taking account of significance of the influencing factors is proposed based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the fracability according to their different effects on shale fracability. The analysis indicates that the fracability decreases with the increase of reservoir depths. The hydraulic fracturing tests of the shale cores are conducted to verify the accuracy of the quantification method. The fractal geometry is used to characterize the fracture degree of the shale. It is shown that a larger fractal dimension of the fracture network corresponds to a better fracability of shale. The more complex the fractures are, the larger the fracability of shale is. The experimental data coincide with the results of the proposed evaluation model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acohesion 3acompression strength 3afractal dimensions 3afriction 3ahydraulic fracturing 3amathematical models 3amineral content 3aoil fields 3ashale 3ashale gas 3aChina 0aShale fracability 0aQuantification method 0aInfluencing factors 0aAnalytical hierarchy process (AHP) 0aExperimental measurement 0aFractal description1 aJu, Yang1 aYang, Yongming1 aYang, Yong1 aLi, Aishan0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.637-645dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245005000130300001400180520181000194592002802004650002202032650002702054650002802081650002802109650002602137650002302163650001602186650001302202650002302215650001602238650001402254650001002268650001602278650001402294650001602308650001302324650001402337650001902351650001402370650000902384650001902393650000902412650002302421653002302444653002702467653001502494653001802509653001502527700002802542700002202570700001702592773014302609852000902752655001202761IND60710322420221121225249.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, T Kiran10aBiological Control of Root Rot of China Aster  ap. 50-60.  aTen fungi and one bacterium were isolated consistently from the rhizosphere of China aster (cv. Local) plants and their population was gradually increased from seedling to vegetative and vegetative to flowering stages. In vitro screening of rhizosphere microflora, exotic and commercial formulations of fungal and bacterial antagonists against Rhizoctonia solani, Trichoderma viride (Native Tv1), T. harzianum (DOR Th), Pseudomonas fluorescens (ANGRAU Pf₁) and Bacillus subtilis (NBAII Bs) were found to be the best among all the isolates tested in inhibiting the growth of the test pathogen. The compatibility of fungal and bacterial antagonists was tested with eight fungicides and it was observed that T. viride (Native Tv1) was compatible with validamycin, T. harzianum (DOR Th) with carbendazim, P. fluorescens (ANGRAU Pf₁) with thiophanate methyl and B. subtilis (PDBC Bs) with iprodione+carbendazim (Quintal) at their recommended and half the recommended dosages. The efficacy of potential antagonists (Native Tv1, DOR Th, ANGRAU Pf₁ and NBAII Bs) and compatible fungicides (validamycin, carbendazim, thiophanate-methyl and Quintal) alone or in combination as seed treatment or soil application were evaluated for the management of R. solani causing root rot in China aster. The effectiveness of these antagonists increased when used as soil and seed application treatments and also when combined with soil drenching chemicals. Combined soil application of talc based formulation of ANGRAU Pf₁ @2g/kg of soil and thiophanate methyl (0.1%) was found to be superior by recording significantly high per cent germination and least root rot incidence of 16.7 per cent. The antagonist P. fluorescens when used singly or combined with fungicide did not significantly affect the root rot incidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCallistephus chinensis 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aTrichoderma viride 3aantagonists 3abacteria 3abiological control 3acarbendazim 3aflowering 3afungi 3agermination 3apathogens 3arhizosphere 3aroot rot 3ascreening 3aseed treatment 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil drenching 3atalc 3athiophanate-methyl 0aRhizoctonia solani 0arhizosphere microflora 0abiocontrol 0acompatibility 0afungicides1 aKumar, C Pramod Chandra1 aReddy, D Raja Ram1 aSingh, T V K0 tIndian journal of plant protection.g2013 Mar., v. 41, no. 1 p.50-60dPlant Protection Association of IndiawJournal:2004x2249-78707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04834naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245010700185300001400292520246400306592002802770650002202798650002102820650002702841650001102868650002702879650002702906650001602933650002902949650002502978650002803003650003003031650001103061650001703072650001003089650001203099650001803111650002303129650002803152650001103180650004303191650002103234650002203255650001103277650001503288650001203303650002203315650002303337650003703360650004403397650003103441650001803472650001003490650002503500651001103525651000903536653001403545653002703559653002403586653003503610700003103645700007303676700003303749700003303782700006603815773011203881856008603993852000904079655001204088IND60634390920221119194142.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSala-Carvalho, Wilton Ricardo10aIs Hyptis lacustris A. St.-Hil. ex Benth. (Lamiaceae) extract a good candidate for antibacterial uses?  ap. 26-32.  aMore than 70% of drugs approved during the last three decades to treat bacterial infection are derived from natural products. Lamiaceae is one of the ten most researched families regarding its medicinal uses. Hyptis Jacq. (Lamiaceae) is used in popular medicine of several countries, including northeast part of Brazil, for the treatment of gastrointestinal infections, cramps, pains, skin diseases, malaria, respiratory diseases, and insect repellent. Hyptis lacustris A. St.-Hil. ex Benth. is used by Yanesha tribe of Peru for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis. In vitro studies confirmed its ethnopharmacological use, in which 95% ethanol extract showed Inhibitory Concentration of 50% lower than 10 μg mL−1 against axenic amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis. For its use in traditional medicine, the aim of this research was to investigate the antibacterial activity of hydroethanol crude extract and its four fractions (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and hydromethanol) against three bacteria strains (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli), and the activity of three compounds isolated from Hyptis lacustris against Bacillus subtilis. The extract was produced by maceration of stems and leaves in 70% ethanol, and its fractions were produced by partition using hexane, dichloromethane, and ethyl acetate. Fractions were chemically characterized using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector. Compounds from fractions with high antibacterial activity were purified and identified through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Mass Spectrometry. The antibacterial activity of extract, fractions, and isolated compounds were screened by a broth microdilution method in 96-wells microplate. Major constituents in the hexane fraction are terpenoids, being abietane diterpenoids the most prominent class. 8β-hydroxy-9(11),13-abietadien-12-one was identified in Hyptis for the first time. Hexane fraction was the most active against Bacillus subtilis, isolated compounds were also active against B. subtilis. The high activity of the hexane fraction is probably due to its major composition of abietane diterpenoids, class of compounds with renowned activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Results point out to a potential antibacterial activity of Hyptis lacustris against Gram-positive bacteria, mainly its Hexane fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aHyptis 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aamastigotes 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial infections 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adigestive system diseases 3adiodes 3aditerpenoids 3adrugs 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3agas chromatography 3agastrointestinal system 3ahexane 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3ainsect repellents 3aleaves 3amaceration 3amalaria 3amass spectrometry 3amethylene chloride 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arespiratory tract diseases 3askin diseases 3astems 3atraditional medicine 3aBrazil 3aPeru 0aLamiaceae 0aAntibacterial activity 0aAbietane diterpenes 0aBrazilian traditional medicine1 ados Santos, Kátia Pereira1 aSedano-Partida, Martha Dalila1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7332-117X1 ada Silva-Luz, Cíntia Luíza1 aPena Ferreira, Marcelo José1 aFurlan, Cláudia Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6180-10340 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245011600180300001300296500001500309520133100324592002801655650002001683650001701703650001801720650001601738650001901754650001101773650001201784650003001796650001101826650001001837650001401847650001101861650002301872650001101895650001201906650002101918653001201939700001701951700003101968700002601999700001702025700002302042773010402065856008102169852000902250655001202259IND60572901820221118222309.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-3065-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-Fernández, Alexandre10aSex ratio variation in an exploited population of common octopus: ontogenic shifts and spatio-temporal dynamics  ap. 1-16.  a2019-12-06  aSex ratio is a fundamental demographic parameter with major implications for the dynamics, management, and conservation of animal populations. The objective was to study the main factors affecting the post-settlement population sex ratio (SR) of Octopus vulgaris off the NE Atlantic. We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics in SR using more than 115,000 individual records obtained from onboard observers over a 14-year period. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the abiotic and biotic factors affecting the variation in SR. The probability of catching a female decreased with size. Seasonal differences in SR resulted in a female-biased ratio in autumn and male dominance in summer. SR also varied along the bathymetric gradient with larger female proportion at deeper waters in winter and spring. The probability of catching a female was lower in hard substrates mainly in summer. Upwelling intensity and sea surface temperature did not show substantial effects on SR. The analysis neither revealed an influence of local density on SR. The spatio-temporal patterns of SR in O. vulgaris are likely based on differences in sexual behavior and life history which may affect catchability rates. Understanding the causes in SR patterns will provide valuable knowledge for future assessment and management plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3asexual behavior 3alife history 3alinear models 3aprobability 3abiotic factors 3aautumn 3aanimals 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3amales 3asex ratio 3aspring 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3afemales 3aOctopus vulgaris 0arecords1 aOtero, Jaime1 aBañón Martínez, Rafael,1 aCampelos, Jose Manuel1 aSantos, Juan1 aMucientes, Gonzalo0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 794, no. 1 p.1-16dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-3065-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245008600134300001400220520089300234592002801127650001501155650001001170650002101180650001101201650001401212650001601226650001101242650001901253650001101272650001301283653001201296653002701308653001501335653001501350653001501365700001801380773014301398852000901541655001201550IND60710322520221121164544.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahapatra, Sunita10aEvaluation of Fungicides and Botanicals Against Alternaria Leaf Blight of Mustard  ap. 61-65.  aField studies were carried out during 2007–08 and 2008–09 to evaluate the six botanicals and seven fungicides at their respective doses against Alternaria blight of mustard and its yield.

Among the treatments, spraying of iprodione @ 0.25% a.i. caused minimum disease severity on leaves and siliqua with less number of spots per siliqua and subsequently increased the yield and yield parameters followed by garlic bulb extract. Thus, garlic bulb extract could be used as a substitute for chemical fungicide iprodione and others for eco friendly management of Alternaria leaf blight of mustard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3abulbs 3adisease severity 3agarlic 3aiprodione 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3aplant extracts 3asowing 3aspraying 0aMustard 0aAlternaria leaf blight 0abotanicals 0afungicides 0aseed yield1 aDas, Srikanta0 tIndian journal of plant protection.g2013 Mar., v. 41, no. 1 p.61-65dPlant Protection Association of IndiawJournal:2004x2249-78707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001800192245010700210506007600317520137300393592002801766506003701794650002101831650001801852650001501870650001501885650001001900650002001910650002101930650001201951650001301963650001601976650001301992650001402005650002502019650002202044650001702066653001802083653001502101700002102116700001602137700001502153773009302168856008602261852000902347655001202356IND60690884920221207134157.0210619e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088492DNAL7 a313044082pmid7 aPMC66032812pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e018862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMigahid, M.M.10aPriming of Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn seeds with H2O2 and magnetic field ameliorates seawater stress  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSilybum marianum (L.) Gaertn is an important medicinal plant and has been used as a traditional medicine for diseases of the liver and biliary tract. The effects of seed priming by H₂O₂ (Haloprimig) and magnetic field (Magnetopriming, MF) on the impacts of seawater concentration were tested using S. marianum at the vegetative stage. These plant species accumulate flavonoids especially slimarine that is used in liver treatment. Some soaked S. marianum seeds were subjected to 0.18 T MF for different time durations (0, 10, 20 and 30 min) and other seeds were soaked in different concentrations of H₂O₂ (0, 80,160 and 240μM) for 8h. H₂O₂ priming increased growth and development under water irrigation more than under sea water stress. Moreover, our results uncovered statistical evidence that the priming seeds with H₂O₂ and MF increased the tolerance of S. marianum to salinity. In summary, we provide clear evidence that seawater stress caused a highly significant reduction in the growth parameters and stimulation in proline and phenolic compounds. It was concluded that, application of H₂O₂ and MF of S. marianum could scavenge or alleviate the harmful effects of salinity stress at early seedling stage and alleviate the oxidative damage leading to improvements in physiological attributes for the plant growth under sea water stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSilybum marianum 3abiliary tract 3aflavonoids 3airrigation 3aliver 3amagnetic fields 3amedicinal plants 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseawater 3aseedlings 3atraditional medicine 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 0aPlant biology 0aBiophysics1 aElghobashy, R.M.1 aBidak, L.M.1 aAmin, A.W.0 tHeliyon.g2019 June, v. 5, no. 6 p.e01886-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e018863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011000162300001600272500002000288520178200308592002802090650001502118650001202133650001002145650001902155650001602174650001102190650001202201650001302213650001302226650001702239650001202256650001402268650001502282650001602297650001402313650001402327650000902341650002502350650002202375650001502397650002602412700001802438700002002456773009102476856007302567852000902640655001202649IND60569771220221120172028.0170609e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056977122DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.124302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNurul‐Ain, Elias10aResource availability and roosting ecology shape reproductive phenology of rain forest insectivorous bats  ap. 382-394.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBats in temperate and subtropical regions typically synchronize birth of a single young with peaks in resource availability driven by local climate patterns. In tropical rain forest, insects are available throughout the year, potentially allowing departures from seasonal monoestry. However, reproductive energy budgets may be constrained by the cost of commuting to foraging grounds from distant roosts. To test these hypotheses, we simultaneously tracked female reproductive activity of 11 insectivorous bat species, insect biomass, and local weather variables for 20 months in a Malaysian rain forest. Five species roost in forest structures and hence have low commuting costs, whereas six species depend on caves, which are limited in the landscape, and are presumed to incur higher commuting costs to foraging sites. Monthly insect biomass was positively correlated with monthly rainfall, and there was a significant relationship between insect biomass and lactation in cave‐roosting but not forest‐roosting species. Cave‐roosting species were seasonally monoestrus, with parturition confined to a two‐month period, whereas in forest‐roosting species, pregnancy and lactation were recorded throughout the year. Our results suggest that the energetic costs of commuting from roosts to foraging grounds shape annual reproductive patterns in tropical rain forest insectivorous bats. Ongoing changes in forest landscapes are likely to increase these costs for cave‐roosting bats, further restricting reproductive opportunities. Climate change is projected to influence the timing of rainfall events in many tropical habitats, which may disrupt relationships between rainfall, insect biomass, and bat reproductive timing, further compromising reproductive success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3abiomass 3acaves 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3afemales 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ainsectivores 3ainsects 3alactation 3alandscapes 3aparturition 3aphenology 3apregnancy 3arain 3areproductive success 3aroosting behavior 3asubtropics 3atropical rain forests1 aRosli, Hashim1 aKingston, Tigga0 tBiotropica.g2017 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.382-394dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.124303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001600301520143500317592002801752650001601780650001501796650001201811650001201823650001501835650001101850650001801861650001101879650001301890650002301903650001801926650001801944650001501962650001501977651001901992700002402011773010702035856008102142852000902223655001202232IND60572901920221118222221.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-017-3094-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, Simon A.10aDischarge-driven flood and seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition of an Australian tropical savannah river  ap. 203-221.  aDischarge is a primary determinant of river phytoplankton, but its influence can be mediated by climate, water quality and catchment development. The relationship between discharge and phytoplankton over seasonal and flood temporal scales was examined for the Daly River in the Australian tropical savannah. Phytoplankton, water quality and hydrographic data were collected over the high-discharge wet season and lower-discharge dry season. Wet season main channel river conditions were unfavourable for phytoplankton growth. Floods, however, connected the main channel to off-channel water bodies that supplied phytoplankton, predominately Cryptomonas, to the river. Wet season phytoplankton biovolume and cell concentrations were higher than in the dry season and comprised the majority of the annual phytoplankton biomass load. High discharges served to both temporally connect the river to off-channel phytoplankton sources as well as dilute these sources. In the dry season, the Daly River was groundwater-fed and disconnected from off-channel phytoplankton sources and dominated by a potamoplanktonic population of Cryptomonas and Peridinium. River phytoplankton were determined by the seasonal discharge regime which drove water quality and underpinned a shift from highly productive, spatially extensive off-channel sources in the wet season to less productive more spatially confined in-channel sources in the dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomonas 3aPeridinium 3abiomass 3aclimate 3adry season 3afloods 3aphytoplankton 3arivers 3asavannas 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aSavannah River1 aDouglas, Michael M.0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 794, no. 1 p.203-221dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3094-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245013900180300001600319520141800335592002801753650001701781650001801798650001801816650001801834650001101852650002401863650002001887650001801907650002601925650002801951650001401979650003001993650002202023650002602045650001802071650001302089650002202102650002602124650002802150650002902178650002202207650003002229650001702259650001902276650001402295650002302309650003402332650003402366650002702400650002302427651001802450651001802468700001202486700001602498700001702514700001802531700002402549773009402573856008102667852000902748655001202757IND4468179420221121083539.0160903e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446817942DNAL7 a216984022pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-011-9891-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Weimin10aPhylogenetic and Gene Expression Analysis of Cyanobacteria and Diatoms in the Twilight Waters of the Temperate Northeast Pacific Ocean  ap. 765-775.  aIn this study, to explore the microbial community structure and its functionality in the deep-sea environments, we initially performed a 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based community structure analyses for microbial communities in the sea water collected from sites of 765–790 m in depth in the Pacific Ocean. Interestingly, in the clone library we detected the presence of both photoautotrophic bacteria such as cyanobacteria and photoheterotrophic bacteria, such as Chloroflexus sp. To further explore the existence and diversity of possible light-utilizing microorganisms, we then constructed and analyzed a 23S rRNA plastid gene cloning library. The results showed that the majority of this cloning library was occupied by oxygenic photoautotrophic organisms, such as diatoms Thalassiosira spp. and cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. In addition, the diversity of these oxygenic photoautotrophic organisms was very limited. Moreover, both reverse-transcription PCR and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR approaches had been employed to detect expression of the genes involved in protein synthesis and photosynthesis of photoautotrophic organisms, and the positive results were obtained. The possible mechanisms underlying the existence of very limited diversity of photosynthetic organisms at this depth of ocean, as well as the positive detection of rRNA and mRNA of diatom and cyanobacteria, were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloroflexus 3aDNA libraries 3aSynechococcus 3aThalassiosira 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3amicrobial communities 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein synthesis 3areverse transcription 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3aspecies diversity 2aAutotrophic Processes 2aCyanobacteriaxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDiatomsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Library 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPhylogeny 2aPlastidsxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxgenetics 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aWater Microbiology 3aPacific Ocean 0aPacific Ocean1 aShi, Xu1 aWu, Jieying1 aJin, Yuguang1 aZhang, Weiwen1 aMeldrum, Deirdre R.0 tMicrobial ecology.g2011 Nov., v. 62, no. 4 p.765-775dSpringer New Yorkx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-011-9891-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245017500162300001600337500002000353520134800373592002801721650001001749650002101759650002401780650002001804650001001824650002501834650000901859650000901868650002501877650002601902650002601928650001801954650001001972650002001982650002302002651001102025700001602036700002102052700002202073700002502095700002902120700001802149773012402167856007402291852000902365655001202374IND60569771420221120193124.0170609e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056977142DNAL7 a10.1111/cjag.121052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOparinde, Adewale10aRadio Messaging Frequency, Information Framing, and Consumer Willingness to Pay for Biofortified Iron Beans: Evidence from Revealed Preference Elicitation in Rural Rwanda  ap. 613-652.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIron deficiency is a public health problem in many developing countries. Iron‐biofortified varieties of commonly consumed staple crops have the potential to contribute to the daily iron requirements in diets. This paper examines consumer acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for two iron bean varieties in Rwanda: red iron bean (RIB) and white iron bean (WIB). Using the Becker‐DeGroot‐Marschak mechanism, the paper investigates the effect of (1) nutrition information; (2) information frame; and (3) the frequency of providing the information on consumer WTP. WTP estimations take into account social interaction and nonpayment effects. Results indicate that without information about the nutritional benefits of the two iron bean varieties, consumers are willing to pay a large premium for the RIB variety, but not for the WIB variety. The nutrition information provided has a significantly positive effect on the premium for each of the iron bean varieties. Results also indicate that the effects of how the information is framed on this premium are not statistically significant. However, providing the nutrition information three times versus once significantly increases consumer demand for the WIB variety. These findings could inform the design of efficient delivery and marketing strategies for iron bean varieties in Rwanda.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3abiofortification 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer demand 3acrops 3adeveloping countries 3adiet 3airon 3amarketing strategies 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrition information 3apublic health 3aradio 3asocial behavior 3awillingness to pay 3aRwanda1 aBirol, Ekin1 aMurekezi, Abdoul1 aKatsvairo, Lister1 aDiressie, Michael T.1 aNkundimana, Jean d'amour1 aButare, Louis0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g2016 Dec., v. 64, no. 4 p.613-652dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0008-39767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cjag.121053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245009200176300001600268500001500284520186000299592002802159650001902187650002002206650001102226650001602237650001902253650002102272650002102293650001002314650002102324650001302345650002102358653001502379700002102394700002102415773009302436856005502529852000902584655001202593IND50074359720221121115502.0140329e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007435972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00368.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchibalski, Anett10aClimate change shifts environmental space and limits transferability of treeline models  ap. 321-335.  a2019-12-06  aOur study aims at gaining insights into the processes determining the current treeline dynamics in Finnish Lapland. Using forest surveys conducted in 1978 and 2003 we modelled the occurrence and abundance of three dominant tree species in Finnish Lapland, i.e. Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Betula pubescens, with boosted regression trees. We assessed the importance of climatic, biotic and topographic variables in predicting tree occurrence and abundance based on their relative importance and response curves. We compared temporal and spatial transferability by using an extended transferability index. Site fertility, the abundance of co‐occurring species and growing degree days were generally the most important predictors for both occurrence and abundance across all species and datasets. Climatic predictors were more important for modelling occurrences than for modelling abundances. Occurrence models were able to reproduce the observed treeline pattern within one time period or region. Abundance models underestimated basal area but captured the general pattern of low and high values. Model performance as well as transferability differed considerably between species and datasets. Pinus sylvestris was modelled more successfully than P. abies and B. pubescens. Generally, spatial transferability was greater than temporal transferability. Comparing the environmental space between datasets revealed that transferring models means extrapolating to novel environments, providing a plausible explanation for limited transferability. Our study illustrates how climate change can shift the environmental space and lead to limited model transferability. We identified non‐climatic factors to be important in predicting the distribution of dominant tree species, contesting the widespread assumption of climatically induced range expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest surveys 3adata collection 3amodels 3aPicea abies 3aclimate change 3amodel validation 3aBetula pubescens 3atrees 3aPinus sylvestris 3atreeline 3astand basal area 0abasal area1 aLehtonen, Aleksi1 aSchröder, Boris0 tEcography.g2014 Apr., v. 37, no. 4 p.321-335dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00368.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245006600205300001600271506007600287520156200363592002801925506003701953650000801990650002001998650001502018650004402033650001602077653004102093653002502134653003502159653003302194700002402227700002302251700002302274773017102297856007902468852000902547655001202556IND60178668020221207093740.0150604e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017866802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13176311112doi7 aPMC38961862pmcid7 a243793722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostame, Sarah10aTunable nonequilibrium dynamics of field quenches in spin ice  ap. 640-645.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present nonequilibrium physics in spin ice as a unique setting that combines kinematic constraints, emergent topological defects, and magnetic long-range Coulomb interactions. In spin ice, magnetic frustration leads to highly degenerate yet locally constrained ground states. Together, they form a highly unusual magnetic state—a “Coulomb phase”—whose excitations are point-like defects—magnetic monopoles—in the absence of which effectively no dynamics is possible. Hence, when they are sparse at low temperature, dynamics becomes very sluggish. When quenching the system from a monopole-rich to a monopole-poor state, a wealth of dynamical phenomena occur, the exposition of which is the subject of this article. Most notably, we find reaction diffusion behavior, slow dynamics owing to kinematic constraints, as well as a regime corresponding to the deposition of interacting dimers on a honeycomb lattice. We also identify potential avenues for detecting the magnetic monopoles in a regime of slow-moving monopoles. The interest in this model system is further enhanced by its large degree of tunability and the ease of probing it in experiment: With varying magnetic fields at different temperatures, geometric properties—including even the effective dimensionality of the system—can be varied. By monitoring magnetization, spin correlations or zero-field NMR, the dynamical properties of the system can be extracted in considerable detail. This establishes spin ice as a laboratory of choice for the study of tunable, slow dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aice 3amagnetic fields 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 0anonequilibrium dynamics and quenches 0afrustrated magnetism 0akinetically constrained models 0areaction-diffusion processes1 aCastelnovo, Claudio1 aMoessner, Roderich1 aSondhi, Shivaji L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Jan. 14, v. 111, no. 2 p.640-645dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13176311113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008600172300001400258520119400272592002801466650001401494650001801508650001001526650001101536650001801547650001301565650001901578650001001597650001201607653002001619653001601639653002001655653002401675653002901699653000801728700002001736700002001756700002501776700001901801700002101820700002601841700002401867773011201891856008602003852000902089655001202098IND60634391320221119194536.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarshney, Deepti10aTissue specific long non-coding RNAs are involved in aroma formation of black tea  ap. 79-89.  aWith the progress of sequencing technology coupled with in silico approaches, disclosure of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) from RNAseq data has become easy and reliable. Till today, no methodical investigation of lncRNAs and their regulatory roles in tea have been studied. In this study, using 170 RNAseq data (˜7157 million reads) of 11 harvestable tissues, 33,400 putative high certainty lncRNAs were discovered, among which 99.76% were found to be putative novel lncRNAs. The expression analysis of lncRNAs from 53 RNAseq data of 7 tissues (axillary bud, a bud and a leaf, a bud and 2 leaves, apical bud and 2 leaves, 2nd leaf, 4th leaf, and 6th leaf) demonstrated their tissue-specific expression. Further, around 1,654 lncRNAs were found to be endogenous target mimics of miRNAs that interacted with 698 mRNAs of tea genome. Based on their target i.e. coding-gene partners by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathway showed that 378 lncRNAs are involved in major aroma formation pathway of tea. Present study also provides valuable information to uncover the various molecular functions of lncRNAs that regulate aroma formation of tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablack tea 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aodors 3atissues 0aAroma formation 0aEpigenetics 0aGene expression 0aLong non-coding RNA 0amRNAs-lncRNA interaction 0aTea1 aRawal, Hukam C.1 aDubey, Himanshu1 aBandyopadhyay, Tanoy1 aBera, Biswajit1 aMohan Kumar, P.,1 aSingh, Nagendra Kumar1 aMondal, Tapan Kumar0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.79-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171520171300267592002801980650001702008650001902025650001402044650002102058650002402079650001902103650001502122650001202137650002302149650001602172650002202188650002702210650002702237650001602264650002502280653001902305653002702324653001202351653002402363653002402387700001502411700001402426700001502440700001702455700001702472700001702489700001302506700001702519700001802536700001302554773011202567856008602679852000902765655001202774IND60683673720221123000713.0210121e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiaoding10aClarithromycin affect methane production from anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge  aAnaerobic digestion is widely identified as a sustainable technology for the treatment of waste activated sludge (WAS). However, various antibiotics enriched in WAS making the anaerobic digestion process full of uncertainty. This experiment studied the potential impact of a shock load of macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin (CLA) on CH₄ production from anaerobic digestion of thermal pretreatments (55 °C, 10 h) WAS. Experimental results showed that the CH₄ production rate was significantly suppressed in the existence of CLA during the first 10 days of anaerobic digestion, but gradually recovered thereafter. Although the total cumulative CH₄ yield in the presence or absence of CLA showed little difference after 36 days of digestion, the maximal CH₄ production rate decreased from 22.3 ± 0.7 mL/(g volatile suspended solids (VSS)·d) to 15.0 ± 0.4 mL/(g VSS·d) with CLA concentration elevated from 0 to 2000 mg/kg total suspended solids. Mechanism investigations showed that CLA had negative effect on the process of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, homo-acetogenesis and methanogenesis, but its longer-time and more-severely inhibitory effect on acetogenesis and methanogenesis than other process was the main reason for the lower CH₄ production rate in the CLA-added reactors. IonS5ᵀᴹXL sequencing analysis showed that the relative abundance of typical syntrophic acetogens, such as Syntrophomonas and Syntrophorhabdus, and the methanogens, such as Methanosaeta and the hydrogenotrophic methanogens all increased with the addition of CLA at the later period of digestion. Their changes were consisted with the variations of volatile fatty acids and CH₄ in digesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaeta 3aSyntrophomonas 3aacetogens 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3aclarithromycin 3ahydrolysis 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3asequence analysis 3asustainable technology 3atotal suspended solids 3auncertainty 3avolatile fatty acids 0aClarithromycin 0aWaste activated sludge 0aMethane 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aMicrobial community1 aLiu, Xuran1 aChen, Fei1 aWang, Yali1 aLi, Xiaoming1 aWang, Dongbo1 aTao, Ziletao1 aXu, Dong1 aXue, Wenjing1 aGeng, Mingyue1 aYang, Qi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 10, v. 255 p.120321-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245014300127300001600270520100600286592002801292650002301320650001501343650001601358650001201374650001701386650001401403650003301417653000901450653000901459653002501468700002001493773014501513852000901658655001201667IND60710323120221123030115.0200908e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanitha, K10aPrincipal Component Analysis of Brown Planthopper Resistance Mechanisms in the Recombinant Inbred Lines of Cross Basmati 370/ASD16 in Rice  ap. 109-112.  aA set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of cross Basmati370/ASD16 was tested for brown planthopper (BPH) resistance using resistance mechanisms viz., antixenosis, antibiosis and tolerance. Correlation analysis among the phenotypic parameters associated with resistance to BPH revealed significant differences among several parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) carried out on 182 variables (RILs of Basmati370/ASD16 cross) across 11 resistance parameters provided the Eigen values of 184.37, 0.61 and 0.42 with the proportions of 0.991, 0.003 and 0.002 for PCA1, PCA2 and PCA3 respectively. PCA analysis carried out on 11 variables (parameters used to assess BPH resistance) across 182 RILs provided the Eigen values of 2.8674, 2.0499 and 1.5194 with the proportions of 0.261, 0.186 and 0.138 for PCA1, PCA2 and PCA3, respectively. Among the parameters tested, FPLI, PDWLI, nymphal settling preference and winged female percentage were contributing more for resistance than other parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aantibiosis 3aantixenosis 3afemales 3ainbred lines 3aphenotype 3aprincipal component analysis 0aRice 0aRILs 0aphenotypic screening1 aMaheswaran, M.,0 tIndian journal of plant protection.g2013 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.109-112dPlant Protection Association of IndiawJournal:2004x2249-78707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245010600204300001600310520051800326592002800844650001900872650001200891650001400903700005600917773014400973856007601117852000901193655001201202IND60627167120190520000000.0190128e20190108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062716712DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b127382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansze, Suzanne M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2979-263010aPalladium-Based Metal–Ligand Assemblies: The Contrasting Behavior upon Addition of Pyridine or Acid  ap. 815-819.  aThe stability of five different [Pdₙ(N-donor)ₘ]²ⁿ⁺ assemblies was examined by performing disassembly experiments with pyridine and with trifluoroacetic acid.

However, it is unknown whether temporal genetic population structure exists. We tested whether adult Pacific lamprey: (1) show temporal genetic population structure; and (2) migrate different distances between years. We non-lethally sampled lamprey for DNA in 2009 and 2010 and used eight microsatellite loci to test for genetic population structure. We used telemetry to record the migration behaviors of these fish. Lamprey were assignable to three moderately differentiated genetic clusters (F ST = 0.16–0.24 for all pairwise comparisons): one cluster was composed of individuals from 2009, and the other two contained individuals from 2010. The F ST value between years was 0.13 and between genetic clusters within 2010 was 0.20. A total of 372 (72.5%) fish were detected multiple times during their migrations. Most fish (69.9%) remained in the mainstem Willamette River; the remaining 30.1% migrated into tributaries. Eighty-two lamprey exhibited multiple back-and-forth movements among tributaries and the mainstem, which may indicate searching behaviors. All migration distances were significantly greater in 2010, when the amplitude of river discharge was greater. Our data suggest genetic structuring between and within years that may reflect different cohorts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEntosphenus tridentatus 3aadults 3afish 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amigratory behavior 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3astream flow 3atelemetry1 aWyss, Lance1 aMcCoun, Rebecca1 aCourter, Ian1 aSchwabe, Lawrence1 aPeery, Christopher1 aSchreck, Carl B.1 aSpice, Erin K.1 aDocker, Margaret F.0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 794, no. 1 p.223-240dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3096-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245010900204300001600313506007600329520178200405592002802187506003702215650001602252650001402268650001502282650002002297650002302317650001302340650002502353650002002378650000902398650001002407650002202417650001402439650001302453650002202466650001302488650001102501653001202512653002402524653002002548653002502568700001802593700002402611773017102635856007902806852000902885655001202894IND60178668220221207093707.0150604e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017866822DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13182071112doi7 aPMC38962002pmcid7 a243793912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Jongchan10aDifferential processing of Arabidopsis ubiquitin-like Atg8 autophagy proteins by Atg4 cysteine proteases  ap. 863-868.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutophagy is a highly conserved biological process during which double membrane bound autophagosomes carry intracellular cargo material to the vacuole or lysosome for degradation and/or recycling. Autophagosome biogenesis requires Autophagy 4 (Atg4) cysteine protease-mediated processing of ubiquitin-like Atg8 proteins. Unlike single Atg4 and Atg8 genes in yeast, the Arabidopsis genome contains two Atg4 (AtAtg4a and AtAtg4b) and nine Atg8 (AtAtg8a – AtAtg8i) genes. However, we know very little about specificity of different AtAtg4s for processing of different AtAtg8s. Here, we describe a unique bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based AtAtg8 synthetic substrate to assess AtAtg4 activity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we developed a unique native gel assay of superhRLUC catalytic activity assay to monitor cleavage of AtAtg8s in vitro. Our results indicate that AtAtg4a is the predominant protease and that it processes AtAtg8a, AtAtg8c, AtAtg8d, and AtAtg8i better than AtAtg4b in vitro. In addition, kinetic analyses indicate that although both AtAtg4s have similar substrate affinity, AtAtg4a is more active than AtAtg4b in vitro. Activity of AtAtg4s is reversibly inhibited in vitro by reactive oxygen species such as H ₂O ₂. Our in vivo bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analyses in Arabidopsis transgenic plants indicate that the AtAtg8 synthetic substrate is efficiently processed and this is AtAtg4 dependent. These results indicate that the synthetic AtAtg8 substrate is used efficiently in the biogenesis of autophagosomes in vivo. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the AtAtg8 synthetic substrate will be a valuable tool to dissect autophagy processes and the role of autophagy during different biological processes in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aautophagy 3abiogenesis 3abioluminescence 3acatalytic activity 3acysteine 3acysteine proteinases 3aenergy transfer 3agels 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alysosomes 3aproteins 3atransgenic plants 3avacuoles 3ayeasts 0aatg4a4b 0anitrogen starvation 0aautophagic body 0amonodansylcadaverine1 aPark, Eunsook1 aDinesh-Kumar, S.

For aposematic species, advantages may result from advertising unpalatability to decrease predation and attracting mates to increase reproductive success. On Green Island, Taiwan, most Eupyrgops waltonianus weevils have metallic blue spots on the body; however, some weevils have no conspicuous coloration. The role of coloration in sexual selection and any disadvantages encountered by dull individuals are unknown. To understand whether morphological traits affect mating success in E. waltonianus, we compared different traits between mating and nonmating individuals in the field. A manipulation experiment was also used to test whether coloration affects mating choice and behaviour. The function of colour as an aposematic signal was tested. Results showed that body size and coloration were important indicators of female mating success in field and laboratory experiments, respectively. In the field, males preferred to mate with larger, more conspicuous females, and females preferred to mate with conspicuous males; however, no such preference was shown in the laboratory. Intrasexual competition was stronger in males than in females. Predators avoided colourful weevils. Thus, conspicuous coloration in both sexes is a multifunctional trait and could be an attractive or aposematic signal for different receivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3aaposematic species 3abody size 3acolor 3afemales 3amimicry (behavior) 3apredation 3areproductive success 3asexual selection 3aTaiwan 0aaposematic signal 0acompetition 0aEupyrgops waltonianus 0amating behaviour 0amating system 0asexual selection1 aTseng, Hui-Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1166-47561 aLiao, Chen-Pan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9703-19941 aHsu, Jung-Ya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6141-48001 aHuang, Wen-San1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0073-35570 tAnimal behaviour.g2021 July, v. 177 p.231-240dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03633naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168300001600261520148600277592002801763650003401791650002201825650001301847650001701860650002001877650003101897650002901928650002601957650002501983650001602008650001902024650002202043650001802065650001802083650004102101650001702142650003202159650001802191650001302209650001302222650002702235650003602262650003202298653001002330653001002340653001002350653001002360653001002370653001002380653002102390653001902411653002502430653002702455653003102482700001502513700001802528700001902546700001902565700001902584700001602603700001502619700001402634700001202648700001802660773011402678856008602792852000902878655001202887IND60634391620221119194409.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Wenqian10aPhytochemical composition and bioactivities of essential oils from six Lamiaceae species  ap. 357-364.  aEssential oils isolated from the Lamiaceae species are attracting increasing interest because of their applications in natural food preservation and pharmaceutics. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the composition and biological effects of six Lamiaceae essential oils. Approximately 106 components were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and the predominant compounds were linalool (0.05–46.55%), α-pinene (0.12–45.35%), o-cymene (0.91–41.20%), patchouli alcohol (28.27%), dl-menthol (21.12%), isobornyl acetate (22.52%), d-limonene (0.01–18.42%), α-terpineol (0.07–4.88%), and β-pinene (0.08–2.03%). Most of these essential oils were found to have effective antioxidant activities (IC50; 1.07–18.77%), as estimated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging assays. The essential oils not only had antibacterial activities (6.5–12.3 mm diameter inhibition zones), but also had antifungal activities (6.5–19.0 mm diameter inhibition zones). The essential oils exhibited strong anti-inflammatory activities and markedly decreased the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). The most abundant compounds in the essential oils isolated from the six Lamiaceae species have potential applications in the scavenging of free radicals, inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth, and relief from inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPogostemon cablin 3aacetates 3aalpha-pinene 3aalpha-terpineol 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-pinene 3aessential oils 3afood preservation 3afree radicals 3afungal growth 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-6 3alimonene 3alinalool 3aprostaglandin synthase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aPFEOs 0aPCEOs 0aMHEOs 0aROEOs 0aLAEOs 0aSBEOs 0aLamiaceae family 0aEssential oils 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aAnti-inflammatory activity1 aDu, Zhiyun1 aZheng, Yating1 aLiang, Xiaoxin1 aHuang, Guomeng1 aZhang, Qianhua1 aLiu, Zexuan1 aZhang, Kun1 aZheng, Xi1 aLin, Li1 aZhang, Lanyue0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.357-364dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245008800209300002000297506007600317520079100393592002801184506003701212650000801249650002101257650002201278650002401300700002401324700002501348700002601373700001901399773017701418856007901595852000901674655001201683IND60173803020221207065631.0150603e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017380302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13076041102doi7 aPMC37737862pmcid7 a239801642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez, José I.10aComprehensive experimental fitness landscape and evolutionary network for small RNA  ap. 14984-14989.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe origin of life is believed to have progressed through an RNA world, in which RNA acted as both genetic material and functional molecules. The structure of the evolutionary fitness landscape of RNA would determine natural selection for the first functional sequences. Fitness landscapes are the subject of much speculation, but their structure is essentially unknown. Here we describe a comprehensive map of a fitness landscape, exploring nearly all of sequence space, for short RNAs surviving selection in vitro. With the exception of a small evolutionary network, we find that fitness peaks are largely isolated from one another, highlighting the importance of historical contingency and indicating that natural selection would be constrained to local exploration in the RNA world.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3acenter of origin 3anatural selection 3apopulation genetics1 aXulvi-Brunet, Ramon1 aCampbell, Gregory W.1 aTurk-MacLeod, Rebecca1 aChen, Irene A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 110, no. 37 p.14984-14989dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13076041103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245012000180300001600300520107800316592002801394650002301422650001101445650002501456650002101481650001101502650001801513650002501531773010301556856008201659852000901741655001201750IND60621125520221122005953.0181115e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062112552DNAL7 a10.1260/0958305027622312962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristiansen, Atle Christer10aPromoting Environmental Innovation in the Energy Sector: An Analytcial Framework for Dynamic Efficiency Assessments  ap. 813-832.  aIt is increasingly being recognised that the development, adoption and diffusion of cleaner energy technologies are key determinants to success or failure in environmental policy, at least in the long term. However, it is still unclear what specific role there is for public policies and regulatory intervention in this field, and how to select an appropriate portfolio of policy action and instruments that does justice to all stages in the development cycle of technological change. The key objective of this paper is to provide an analytical framework for analysing and assessing the way in which public policy can promote environmentally benign technological change. The framework comprises a template that blends a mechanistic representation of causal variable-impact relationships with knowledge and insights from empirical research. “It is widely agreed that technical innovation is the ultimate key to successful (meaning affordable as well as quantitatively adequate) global measures to stabilise the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere” (Toman, 1998: 610)  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3agreenhouse gases 3amixing 3apublic policy 3atechnological change0 tEnergy & environment.g, v. 13, no. 6 p.813-832dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26865x2048-40707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1260/0958305027622312963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01239naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007500130300001500205520040700220592002800627650001400655650001400669650001400683653001500697653001400712653001700726653001600743653002100759653002300780773012500803852000900928655001200937IND60477752020221120111917.0160105s1996    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047775202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Ting-Kui12aA review and cladistic analysis of the Eupodoidea (Acari: Acariformes)  ap. 77-105.  aA review of relevant literature underpins a revised definition required for the Eupodoidea.

Characterization of different origin humic substances is important for evaluation of their contribution to stabile and labile carbon pool in the environment. The relative abundance of chemical components in HA isolated from soils, compost, commercial lignohumates, alginite, acadiane and lignite was studied with aim to quantify content of important biomarkers such as amino acid, lipids and polyphenols. HA were considered as a heterogeneous complex and high concentration of peptides, polyphenols and lipids was determined in acadian-HA to compare with soil-HA. Compost-HA contained much more amino acids to compare with soil-HA samples. Alginite-HA and lignite-HA were similar in biomarkers content to soil-HA. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that chemical composition and functional groups content differs with the origin, humification degree and the age of studied samples. Soil-HA are typically composed of a variety of −OH, COOH−, C–O, C–H ₂, (aliphatic and aromatic) groups, quinines, lignin fragments, polysaccharide, monosaccharide and proteins fragments, which are linked together by −O−, −NH−, −H=, >C=O, metal ions and –S− groups. ¹³C NMR spectroscopy showed that aromatic carbon content was the highest in lignite-HA and soil-HA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aamino acids 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acomposts 3ahumic acids 3ahumification 3alignin 3alignite 3alipids 3ametal ions 3amicroorganisms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3apolyphenols 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3asoil 0anatural humic substances 0abiomarkers 0aFTIR and 13C NMR spectroscopy1 aKomínková, Markéta1 aZítka, Ondřej1 aKizek, René,1 aBarančíková, Gabriela1 aLitavec, Tadeáš1 aLošák, Tomáš1 aHlušek, Jaroslav1 aMårtensson, Anna,1 aLiptaj, Tibor0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 65, no. 6 p.517-528dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.10304423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017300169520125300342592002801595650002601623650001001649650001201659650000901671650001501680650001201695651001301707653001601720653001901736653001201755653001701767700001801784700002601802700003001828700002201858700002501880700002801905773013301933856008502066852000902151655001202160IND60647403120221117184510.0190620e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064740312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yuong-Nam10aUnusual locomotion behaviour preserved within a crocodyliform trackway from the Upper Cretaceous Bayanshiree Formation of Mongolia and its palaeobiological implications  aCrocodyliform tracks are reported from the Upper Cretaceous (?Cenomanian-Santonian) Bayanshiree Formation in southeastern Mongolia. Ten tracks are preserved as natural casts, forming a trackway with a quadrupedal gait pattern with a tail trail. All tracks are short and wide, and dominated by toe traces without plantar impressions. Pes tracks are characterized by four deep claw impressions and push-back marks behind them. Manus tracks have shallow claw marks and long, sub-parallel scratch marks behind. The preferential association of the scratch marks with only the distal digit impressions and irregular pattern of footfalls suggests that this trackway was made by a bottom walking and punting crocodyliform under water. This trackway represents the first crocodyliform “swim tracks” in the Late Cretaceous of Asia and the first evidence for punting behaviour of a fossil crocodyliform. The “swim tracks” can be divided into two categories such as bottom walking tracks with punting for moving somewhat more quickly and subaqueous walking tracks without punting to be associated with slower underwater speeds. The tracks show that crocodylians had adopted a bottom walking behaviour similar to extant crocodylians by Cretaceous times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aclaws 3afossils 3agait 3alocomotion 3awalking 3aMongolia 0aSwim tracks 0aBottom walking 0aPunting 0aParalligator1 aLee, Hang-Jae1 aKobayashi, Yoshitsugu1 aPaulina-Carabajal, Ariana1 aBarsbold, Rinchen1 aFiorillo, Anthony R.1 aTsogtbaatar, Khishigjav0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 533 p.109239-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008800168300001600256520167600272592002801948650000901976650001901985650001902004650001902023650001402042650002002056650003002076650001702106650002202123650001302145650002602158650001502184650001402199650001902213650002402232650002002256650001702276650001502293650001802308651001802326653002002344653002302364653002002387653001802407653002602425700001802451700001702469700001802486773010902504856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60133249720221120115943.0150518e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013324972DNAL7 a10.1080/09064710.2015.10304432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingze10aGlobal trends in soil monitoring research from 1999–2013: a bibliometric analysis  ap. 483-495.  aA bibliometric analysis of soil monitoring during the period of 1999–2013 was performed based on Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Science Citation Index databases. The measuring parameters included scientific outputs, subject categories and major journals, international collaboration and geographic distribution of authors and countries, keywords, and hot topics. This research demonstrated a significant increase in the field since 1999. The USA was the largest contributor, generating 26.7% of the total articles with a total number of cited times per paper (CPP) of 17.4. The USDA ARS was the most productive institute with a CPP of 19.0. Hot topics were classified into two major groups according to the author keywords analysis: (1) monitoring objectives and indicators, e.g. climate change, land use and agriculture, soil moisture and heavy metals, which reveal the relationships between the soil and environmental factors; (2) monitoring techniques and monitoring scales, e.g. remote sensing and integrated ‘3S’ techniques, and the varied scales aiming at the comprehensive detection of various soil attributes change. We found that environment policy should be formulated regarding heavy metal pollution which raised great concern about soil monitoring. Biodegradation and bioremediation were popular methods to restore the changes in microbial communities, soil water quality, soil organic matter and inorganic matter. What is more, the integration of ‘3S’ techniques at a regional scale guaranteed the rapid data acquisition and facilitated soil mapping and its spatio-temporal pattern analysis, which should be a future research direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aedaphic factors 3ageographical distribution 3aheavy metals 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amicrobial communities 3amonitoring 3apollution 3aremote sensing 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3asoil surveys 3asoil water 3awater quality 3aUnited States 0asoil monitoring 0ascientific outputs 0aresearch trends 0abibliometrics 0amonitoring techniques1 aLiu, Dianfeng1 aJia, Jinglei1 aZhang, Xiaoyi0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 65, no. 6 p.483-495dTaylor & Francisx1651-19137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.10304433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245013100152300001400283500001900297500002000316520137600336592002801712596006501740596007001805596007001875596006301945596006602008596006702074596006702141596006802208650002802276650001502304650001602319650001702335650002102352650001802373650002402391650006202415650001202477700005602489700001502545700001502560700001702575700005502592773012202647856007302769852000902842655001202851IND60720295620221117201516.0201211e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072029562DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.132652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Qing10aGeneration and characterization of aptamers against grass carp reovirus infection for the development of rapid detection assay  ap. 33-44.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrass carp reovirus (GCRV) causes devastating viral haemorrhagic disease in farmed grass carp (Ctenopharyngon idellus). As novel molecular probes, aptamers have been widely applied in rapid diagnosis and efficient therapies against virus or diseases. In this study, three single‐stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers were selected against GCRV‐infected CIK cells via SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology). Secondary structures predicted by MFOLD indicated that aptamers formed stem‐loop structures, and GVI‐11 had the lowest ΔG value of −30.84 KJ/mol. Three aptamers could specifically recognize GCRV‐infected CIK cells, with calculated dissociation constants (Kd) of 220.86, 176.63 and 278.66 nM for aptamers GVI‐1, GVI‐7 and GVI‐11, respectively, which indicated that they could serve as specific delivery system for antiviral therapies. The targets of aptamers GVI‐1, GVI‐7 and GVI‐11 on the surface of GCRV‐infected cells could be membrane proteins, which were trypsin‐sensitive. Furthermore, FAM‐labelled aptamer GVI‐7 could be applied to detect GCRV infection in vivo. It is the first time to generate and characterize aptamers against GCRV‐infected cells. These aptamers have great potentials in development of rapid diagnosis technology and antiviral agents against GCRV infection in aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data  aAB18221111cKey Research and Development Programs of Guangxi  a2018GXNSFBA281011cNatural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province  a2019GXNSFAA245054cNatural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province  aAD19245022cNatural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province  a2019JJB130070cNatural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province  a2018YJJ903cBasic Research Fund of Guangxi Academy of Sciences  a2018YJJ902cBasic Research Fund of Guangxi Academy of Sciences  a2019YJJ1005cBasic Research Fund of Guangxi Academy of Sciences 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aReoviridae 3aaquaculture 3adissociation 3aoligonucleotides 3arapid methods 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3aviruses1 aLiu, Mingzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7124-70841 aWu, Siting1 aXiao, Hehe1 aQin, Xinling1 aLi, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2313-50900 tJournal of fish diseases.g2021 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.33-44dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.132653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011300163520140400276592002801680650002101708650001601729650001901745650001201764650002501776650002601801650001101827650001401838650001401852650002301866650002901889653001001918653001101928653001501939653003601954653002101990653002002011700001502031700001702046700001602063700001602079700001602095700001802111700005502129700001202184773010802196856008102304852000902385655001202394IND60749526520221120210121.0211009e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074952652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2021.1143572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yanhong10aQuantification of 2-NBDG, a probe for glucose uptake, in GLUT1 overexpression in HEK293T cells by LC–MS/MS  aThe growth and proliferation of most cancer cells involve the excessive uptake of glucose mediated by glucose transporters. An effective strategy for cancer therapy has been to inhibit the GLUTs that are usually overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells. 2-NBDG is a GLUT1 substrate that can be used as a probe for GLUT1 inhibitors. An accurate and simple assay for 2-NBDG in a HEK293T cell model overexpressing GLUT1 was developed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Xbridge® Amide column (3.5 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm, Waters) with acetonitrile-water containing 2 μM ammonium acetate (80:20, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Mass detection was conducted in the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode. The calibration curve for 2-NBDG showed good linearity in the concentration range of 5–500 ng/mL with satisfactory precision, a relative standard deviation ranging from 2.92 to 9.59% and accuracy with a relative error ranging from −13.14 to 7.34%. This method was successfully applied to quantify the uptake of GLUT1-mediated 2-NBDG, and the results clearly indicated inhibition of GLUT1 by WZB117 and quercetin (two potent glucose transporter inhibitors) in the GLUT1-HEK293T cell model. This study provides a convenient and accurate method for high-throughput screening of selective and promising GLUT1 inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium acetate 3acalibration 3acancer therapy 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3aquercetin 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aGLUT1 0a2-NBDG 0aLC–MS/MS 0aInhibition of glucose transport 0aNatural products 0aHigh-throughput1 aHu, Minwan1 aWang, Fenghe1 aTan, Huixin1 aHu, Jiahuan1 aWang, Xinbo1 aWang, Baolian1 aHu, Jinping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2382-20341 aLi, Yan0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 631 p.114357-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.1143573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009100204300001400295520147500309592002801784650002601812650001301838650000901851650001201860650002501872650001301897651001101910653001101921653000801932653002701940653001301967700001501980700001801995700002202013700001902035700001702054700001602071700001902087700002102106773011002127856008302237852000902320655001202329IND60622625520221121045811.0190219e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062262552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.10.1712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristo, T.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4650-068710aFeline Lymphoma and a High Correlation with Feline Leukaemia Virus Infection in Brazil  ap. 20-28.  aLymphoma is the most important haemopoietic tumour in cats and has been associated with feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infection. In Brazil, no studies have established a correlation between FeLV infection and lymphoma. The aim of this study was to characterize lymphomas arising in cats in Brazil anatomically and microscopically, and to correlate these data with FeLV infection as determined by immunohistochemistry for the FeLV gp70 antigen. Fifty-three cats with lymphoma were evaluated. The mean age of junior, prime, mature, senior and geriatric cats was 1.65 years, 4.34 years, 8 years, 12.14 years and 15.5 years, respectively. The anatomical types of lymphoma were multicentric (43.4%, 23/53), mediastinal (33.96%, 18/53), renal (11.32%, 6/53), hepatic (5.66%, 3/53), nodal (3.77%, 2/53) and alimentary (1.89 %, 1/53). The histological types were small noncleaved-cell (33.96%, 18/53), mixed diffuse (22.64%, 12/53), immunoblastic (15.11%, 8/53), lymphoblastic (11, 32%, 6/53), small lymphocytic (9.43%, 5/53), small cleaved-cell (3.77%, 2/53) and large cell lymphomas (3.77%, 2/3). Immunopositivity for FeLV was observed in 56.6% (30/53) of the samples. FeLV positivity was equally distributed between the genders, but predominated in junior and prime cats. The degree of association between lymphoma and FeLV infection in Brazil was higher than that found in other countries, demonstrating the need to prevent and control the factors associated with infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFeline leukemia virus 3aantigens 3acats 3aelderly 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymphoma 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0acat 0afeline leukaemia virus 0alymphoma1 aBiezus, G.1 aNoronha, L.F.1 aPereira, L.H.H.S.1 aWithoeft, J.A.1 aFurlan, L.V.1 aCosta, L.S.1 aTraverso, S.D.1 aCasagrande, R.A.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2019 Jan., v. 166 p.20-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.10.1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006900168300001600237520124200253592002801495650001201523650000901535650002501544650001101569650002501580650001401605650002001619650001701639650001501656650001801671650001601689653004101705653002701746653002501773653003901798653002701837653000901864653000901873653000801882653000801890653000901898653000801907653000801915653000801923653000801931700001701939700001601956700001601972773009801988856008602086852000902172655001202181IND60602798020221120140023.0180711e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060279802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanak, D.P.10aProbabilistic performance assessment of a coal-fired power plant  ap. 350-364.  aDespite the low-carbon environmental policies, coal is expected to remain a main source of energy in the coming decades. Therefore, efficient and environmentally friendly power systems are required. A design process based on the deterministic models and application of the safety factors leads to the equipment oversizing, hence fall in the efficiency and increase in the capital and operating costs. In this work, applicability of a non-intrusive stochastic methodology to determine the probability of the power plant equipment failure was investigated. This alternative approach to the power plant performance assessment employs approximation methods for the deterministic prediction of the key performance indicators, which are used to estimate reliability indices based on the uncertainty of the input to a process model of the coal-fired power plant. This study revealed that high reliability indices obtained in the analysis would lead to reduced application of conservative safety factors on the plant equipment, which should result in lower capital and operating cost, through a more reliable assessment of its performance state over its service time, and lead to the optimisation of its inspection and maintenance interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acoal 3adeterministic models 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3aequipment 3aoperating costs 3apower plants 3aprediction 3asafety factor 3auncertainty 0aProbabilistic performance assessment 0aCoal-fired power plant 0aStochastic modelling 0aStochastic response surface method 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aFORM 0aSORM 0aULS 0aLLS 0aSRSM 0aMPR 0aLSM 0aMCS 0aKPI1 aKolios, A.J.1 aBiliyok, C.1 aManovic, V.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 139 p.350-364dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009800168300001600266520113000282592002801412650004401440650002201484650002201506650001401528650002201542650001701564650000901581650001001590650001201600653003401612653001601646653002201662653001001684653001701694653003201711700001401743700001201757700001601769700001301785700001801798700001901816700001601835700001701851700001201868773010801880856008601988852000902074655001202083IND60570598120221120160124.0190318e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057059812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Deqing10aExploring crystalline structural variations of cellulose during pulp beating of tobacco stems  ap. 146-153.  aIn this work, crystalline structural variations of cellulose during pulp beating of tobacco stems were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FT-IR spectroscopy. The results showed that the correlation between the cellulose crystallinity index and the degree of beating was not a linear but an initially upward and then downward trend followed by a repeating fluctuation as a result of the beating action on amorphous regions first and then on crystalline cellulose. It was proposed that the whole beating process might be presumably divided into two phases in the case of the evolution of the crystallinity index. The crystallite sizes of 101 and 101¯ lattice planes showed an obvious fluctuation during the beating while the crystallite sizes and d-spacings from representative 002 lattice planes exhibited little change. Complementally, FT-IR characterization of cellulose structural properties further proved that the crystallinity index was highly affected by mechanical beating and the intact beating process might be divided into two stages characteristic of a first ascending and then descending tendency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aX-ray diffraction 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3apulp 3astems 3atobacco 0aCellulose crystallinity index 0aPFI beating 0aX-ray diffraction 0aFT-IR 0aTobacco stem 0aReconstituted tobacco sheet1 aYang, Fei1 aDai, Ya1 aTao, Feiyan1 aShen, Yi1 aDuan, Wangjun1 aZhou, Xuezheng1 aMa, Hongyan1 aTang, Lvqiao1 aLi, Jun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 174 p.146-153dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011200165520133000277592002801607650001701635650001301652650001701665650003501682650001001717650003401727650001701761650001401778653002801792653003001820653001401850653001001864653001701874700001601891700001601907700001801923700001401941700001701955700001701972700001901989700001802008700001902026700001602045773010802061856008102169852000902250655001202259IND60749526720221120210301.0211009e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074952672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2021.1143592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Zhongyi10aEstablishment of heparin-binding protein time-resolved immunoassay and some potential clinical applications  aTo establish a highly sensitive time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay of heparin-binding protein (HBP-TRFIA) and evaluate its application value for bacterial or fungal infections in tumor patients.Two types of HBP monoclonal specific antibodies against different epitopes of the antigen molecule were used as coating antibodies and Eu³⁺-labeled antibodies, respectively. The double-antibody sandwich method was used in establishing HBP-TRFIA, and the methodology was evaluated. The established HBP-TRFIA was used in detecting HBP concentration in the plasma samples of healthy individuals, patients with bacterial or fungal infections, and infected or uninfected patients with various types of tumors.The linear range of HBP-TRFIA was (0.11–530 ng/mL). Plasma HBP concentrations detected through HBP-TRFIA were consistent with the results of fluorescence quantitative immunochromatography (ρ = 0.964). The plasma HBP concentrations of infected tumor patients were significantly higher than those of uninfected tumor patients (P < 0.01).This study successfully established a highly sensitive HBP-TRFIA, which was highly comparable to commercially available fluorescent quantitative immunochromatographic kits and was able to facilitate the timely diagnosis of bacterial or fungal infections in patients with tumor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3aepitopes 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3afungi 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aimmunoassays 3aneoplasms 0aHeparin-binding protein 0aTime-resolved immunoassay 0aInfection 0aTumor 0aInflammation1 aZhang, Lele1 aHu, Renjing1 aChen, Xindong1 aQin, Yuan1 aZhou, Xiumei1 aWang, Yigang1 aHong, Jianfeng1 aTang, Huqiang1 aFang, Hongming1 aHuang, Biao0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 631 p.114359-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.1143593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245012200184300001600306520136300322592002801685650001201713650002301725650001101748650001901759650001201778650001401790650002001804650002501824650001301849650000701862650001501869650001601884650003401900650005501934650001201989650003002001650001402031650003102045650001002076650005202086650005402138650001202192650001602204650001702220650003502237650006002272700001602332700001602348700001702364700002202381700002002403773011402423856008102537852000902618655001202627IND50072774120221119211508.0150212e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007277412DNAL7 a240817062pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-013-0478-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoelee, N. C.10aNutrient Removal and Biomass Production in an Outdoor Pilot-Scale Phototrophic Biofilm Reactor for Effluent Polishing  ap. 405-422.  aAn innovative pilot-scale phototrophic biofilm reactor was evaluated over a 5-month period to determine its capacity to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from Dutch municipal wastewater effluents. The areal biomass production rate ranged between 2.7 and 4.5 g dry weight/m²/day. The areal nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates averaged 0.13 g N/m²/day and 0.023 g P/m²/day, which are low compared to removal rates achieved in laboratory biofilm reactors. Nutrient removal increased during the day, decreased with decreasing light intensity and no removal occurred during the night. Additional carbon dioxide supply was not requisite as the wastewater was comprised of enough inorganic carbon to sustain microalgal growth. The study was not conclusive for the limiting factor that caused the low nutrient removal rate, possibly the process was limited by light and temperature, in combination with pH increases above pH 9 during the daytime. This pilot-scale study demonstrated that the proposed phototrophic biofilm reactor is not a viable post-treatment of municipal wastewater effluents under Dutch climate conditions. However, the reactor performance may be improved when controlling the pH and the temperatures in the morning. With these adaptations, a phototrophic biofilm reactor could be feasible at lower latitudes with higher irradiance levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aeffluents 3alight intensity 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3atemperature 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aBiomass 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aDiffusion 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLight 2aNitrogenxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutantsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aJanssen, M.1 aTemmink, H.1 aShrestha, R.1 aBuisman, C.

There is a lack of scientific literature examining the response of cover crops to soil residues of glyphosate or AMPA. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of glyphosate or AMPA residues in silty clay loam soil on emergence, growth, and biomass of cover crops, including cereal rye, crimson clover, field pea, hairy vetch, and winter wheat, as well as their germination in a 0.07% (0.7 g L⁻¹) solution of AMPA or glyphosate. Greenhouse studies were conducted at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln to determine the dose response of broadleaf and grass cover crops to soil-applied glyphosate or AMPA. The results indicated that soil treated with glyphosate or AMPA up to 105 mg ae kg–¹ of soil had no effect on the emergence, growth, above-ground biomass, and root biomass of any of the cover crop species tested. To evaluate the impact of AMPA or glyphosate on the seed germination of cover crop species, seeds were soaked in Petri plates filled with a 0.7 g L⁻¹ solution of AMPA or glyphosate. There was no effect of AMPA on seed germination of any of the cover crop species tested. Seed germination of crimson clover and field pea in a 0.7 g L⁻¹ solution of glyphosate was comparable to the nontreated control; however, the germination of cereal rye, hairy vetch, and winter wheat was reduced by 48%, 75%, and 66%, respectively, compared to the nontreated control. The results suggested that glyphosate or AMPA up to 105 mg ae kg–¹ in silt clay loam soil is unlikely to cause any negative effect on the evaluated cover crop species.

The objective of this Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) Weed Loss Committee report is to provide estimates of wheat yield and economic losses due to weeds. Weed scientists provided both weedy (best management practices but no weed control practices) and weed-free (best management practices providing >90% weed control) average yield from replicated research trials in both winter and spring wheat from 2007 to 2017. Winter wheat yield loss estimates ranged from 2.9% to 34.4%, with a weighted average (by production) of 25.6% for the United States, 2.9% for Canada, and 23.4% combined. Based on these yield loss estimates and total production, the potential winter wheat loss due to weeds is 10.5, 0.09, and 10.5 billion kg with a potential loss in value of US$2.19, US$0.19, and US$2.19 billion for the United States, Canada, and combined, respectively. Spring wheat yield loss estimates ranged from 7.9% to 47.0%, with a weighted average (by production) of 33.2% for the United States, 8.0% for Canada, and 19.5% combined. Based on this yield loss estimate and total production, the potential spring wheat loss is 4.8, 1.6, and 6.6 billion kg with a potential loss in value of US$1.14, US$0.37, and US$1.39 billion for the United States, Canada, and combined, respectively. Yield loss in this analysis is greater than some previous estimates, likely indicating an increasing threat from weeds. Climate is affecting yield loss in winter wheat in the Pacific Northwest, with percent yield loss being highest in wheat-fallow systems that receive less than 30 cm of annual precipitation. Continued investment in weed science research for wheat is critical for continued yield protection.

Mass concentrations of chemical components were determined, including water-soluble ions, water-soluble organic carbon, levoglucosan, organic carbon (OC), and element carbon (EC). BrC, as an unidentified and wavelength-dependent organic compound, was also measured from water-soluble carbon (WSOC) at 340 nm using UV–vis spectrometer. The wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient (babs) and mass absorption coefficient (MAC) were much abundant at 340 nm, and the high Absorption Ångström coefficient (AAC) values were observed around 5.4, corresponding to the existence of BrC in ambient PM2.5, especially in winter. Good correlations (R > 0.60) between babs and biomass burning markers, such as levoglucosan and K⁺, in winter indicated significant amounts of primary BrC from biomass burning emissions. Secondary organic carbon BrC (SOCBrC) was more abundant in winter than in summer. SOCBrC in winter was mainly fresh SOC formed from aqueous phase reactions while in summer, aged SOC from photo-chemical formation. Source profiles of BrC optical parameters were detected, which verified sources of BrC from biomass burning and coal burning emissions in areas surrounding Xi'an. The rapidly decreasing babs-340nm values from biomass burning smoldering to straw pellet burning suggested that burning straw pellet instead of burning straw directly is an effective measure for reducing BrC emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3acoal 3aemissions 3aions 3aoptical properties 3aparticulates 3apotassium 3astraw 3asummer 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awinter 3aChina 0aBrown carbon 0aAbsorption coefficient 0aMass absorption coefficient 0aSecondary organic carbon1 aZhang, Qian1 aCao, Junji1 aZhang, Leiming1 aLei, Yali1 aHuang, Yu1 aHuang, R.-J.1 aGao, Jinjin1 aZhao, Zhuzi1 aZhu, Chongshu1 aYin, Xiuli1 aZheng, Chunli1 aXu, Hongmei1 aLiu, Suixin0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Feb., v. 150 p.322-330dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012200173520220300295592002802498650001202526650001302538650002002551650001602571650001302587650003102600650001602631650002302647650001002670650000902680650001302689653001802702653001202720653001402732653001802746653002702764700002402791700002902815700002002844700002502864700002102889700001902910700002202929700003102951773010602982856008603088852000903174655001203183IND60647403620221120023113.0191121e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064740362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1125852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstanislau, Celio10aRat self-grooming and its relationships with anxiety, dearousal and perseveration: Evidence for a self-grooming trait  aRodent self-grooming is a behavior that, besides its cleaning function, can be led by arousing experiences. A putative trait-like nature of this behavior was studied. With the aim of providing information about how grooming behavior can reflect different behavioral processes, an individual differences approach was adopted. Fifty nine male Wistar-derived rats were submitted to five 30-min long behavioral tests. These tests were selected based on the behavioral processes they entangle. Elevated plus-maze (EPM): anxiety, exploration/habituation, arousal/dearousal; Marble burying (MB): active/passive coping; Operant extinction (EXT): frustration, perseveration; Conditioned fear context (CFC): fearfulness, active/passive coping; Novelty after restraint (NAR): stress induced behavior. Orthogonal (Varimax) factor analyses were performed within each test in order to select the most representative measures. To the selected variables from all tests a Direct Oblimin factor analysis was applied. A three factor solution was found after the application of the Cattell's scree test. This solution accounted for 44.2% of the variance. By looking at the loading variables, some conclusions could be drawn. On Factor 1 loaded time spent grooming in three tests and the measure of extinction resistance. We considered this factor to evidence a trait-like nature of grooming and a relationship between it and perseveration. On Factor 2 loaded freezing in the CFC, SAPs in the EPM and grooming duration in the EXT. We considered this factor to correspond to anxiety. On Factor 3, moderate to high loadings were found for crossings in the NAR test and for grooming duration in this test and in the EPM. A lower loading on this factor was also found for the number of buried marbles. We considered this factor as related to dearousal. The present results suggest important relationships both (1) within grooming measures recorded in different behavioral tests and (2) among grooming and other behaviors observed in the tests. These relationships are in accordance with a trait-like nature for self-grooming and shed some light to how grooming behavior interplays with anxiety, dearousal and perseveration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3acleaning 3afactor analysis 3afearfulness 3afreezing 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3ahabituation 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3arats 3avariance 0aSelf-grooming 0aAnxiety 0aDearousal 0aPerseveration 0aIndividual differences1 aVeloso, André W.N.1 aFilgueiras, Guilherme B.1 aMaio, Taimon P.1 aDal-Cól, Maria L.C.1 aCunha, Daniel C.1 aKlein, Rodrigo1 aCarmona, Lucas F.1 aFernández-Teruel, Alberto0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 209 p.112585-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.1125853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100005900141245006300200300001800263520215600281592002802437650001002465650002202475650002202497650001802519650001502537650001102552650001502563650002102578650001602599650001502615650001302630650001802643650000902661650001102670650001102681650001702692650001002709650001702719653002002736653001502756653002002771653001802791653001202809700005702821773012302878856007603001852000903077655001203086IND60771152820221120103713.0220325e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077115282DNAL7 a10.1017/wet.2021.792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorne, Mark E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5039-093010aRush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea L.) control in fallow  ap. 1045-1051.  aRush skeletonweed is an invasive weed in winter wheat (WW)/summer fallow (SF) rotations in the low to intermediate rainfall areas of the inland Pacific Northwest. Standard weed control practices are not effective, resulting in additional SF tillage or herbicide applications. The objective of this field research was to identify herbicide treatments that control rush skeletonweed during the SF phase of the WW/SF rotation. Trials were conducted near LaCrosse, WA, in 2017–2019 and 2018–2020, and near Hay, WA, in 2018–2020. The LaCrosse 2017–2019 trial was in tilled SF; the other two trials were in no-till SF. Fall postharvest applications in October included clopyralid, clopyralid plus 2,4-D, clopyralid plus 2,4-D plus chlorsulfuron plus metsulfuron, aminopyralid, picloram, and glyphosate plus 2,4-D. Spring treatments of clopyralid, aminopyralid, and glyphosate were applied to rush skeletonweed rosettes. Summer treatments of 2,4-D were applied when rush skeletonweed initiated bolting. Plant density was monitored through the SF phase in all plots. Picloram provided complete control of rush skeletonweed through June at all three locations. Fall-applied clopyralid, clopyralid plus 2,4-D, and clopyralid followed by 2,4-D in summer reduced rush skeletonweed through June at the two LaCrosse sites but were ineffective at Hay. In August, just prior to WW seeding, the greatest reductions in rush skeletonweed density were achieved with picloram and fall-applied clopyralid at the two LaCrosse sites. No treatments provided effective control into August at Hay. Wheat yield in the next crop compared to the nontreated control was reduced only at one LaCrosse site by a spring-applied aminopyralid treatment, otherwise no other reductions were found. Long-term control of rush skeletonweed in WW/SF may be achieved by a combination of fall application of picloram, after wheat harvest, followed by an effective burn-down treatment in August prior to WW seeding.

The cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is considered the most common cyanobacterial species that produces CYN. The discovery of the cyr gene cluster responsible for CYN biosynthesis allows us to develop molecular methods that detect and quantify potentially CYN-producing C. raciborskii. This paper describes the development of real-time PCR (qPCR) assays capable of quantifying the total and CYN-producing C. raciborskii in subtropical reservoirs of southern China. We designed primers and probes specifically targeting the rpoC1 and cyrJ genes of C. raciborskii, and enabling quantification of its total cell numbers and potentially toxic genotypes, respectively. The qPCR showed strong linearity between 10² and 10⁶ copies per reaction for both genes. This molecular method was validated against microscopic counting and a high correlation was found between them for quantifying C. raciborskii cell numbers in cyanobacterial cultures and water samples. Using qPCR, we detected potentially CYN-producing C. raciborskii in 34 of the 46 subtropical reservoirs of southern China, with the cyrJ/rpoC1 proportion ranging from 0.3 to 34.7%. CYN concentrations significantly correlated with both the copy numbers of cyrJ gene and the proportion of toxic C. raciborskii. Thus, the present real-time PCR method provides a reliable and faster method for estimating the potential toxicity of C. raciborskii blooms in this region. The wide distribution of potential CYN-producing C. raciborskii in the investigated subtropical reservoirs highlights the need for further monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  a31770507cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grant  a2016-29cthe Water Resource Science and Technology Innovation Program of Guangdong Province 3aCylindrospermopsis raciborskii 3abiosynthesis 3acylindrospermopsin 3agenotype 3amonitoring 3amultigene family 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxicity 3awater reservoirs 3aChina1 aLei, Minting1 aLu, Yan1 aPeng, Liang1 aHan, Bo-Ping0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.3749-3758dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01898-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004900168300001600217520070100233592002800934650001200962650001900974650001400993650000801007650001101015650001401026700001501040700002001055773010301075856008201178852000901260655001201269IND60621126220221122033631.0181115e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062112622DNAL7 a10.1260/0958305033223644212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, P.

A frequent characteristic feature of these plots is a non-linear curve with a foreshortened depth scale. Whilst the age analyses from the dosimetry do not present a problem, many authors have made subsequent assumptions on the basis of the curve shape with respect to climate and environmental changes. Such claims should be strongly questioned, as by using a model which includes the effects of compaction, most of the original curves transform into linear plots corresponding to constant depositional rates. The corrections and the implications for models of climate change are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adosimetry 3aice 3amodels 3asediments1 aParish, R.1 aRowlands, A.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that two compounds contain unique high-nuclearity water clusters without organic counter cations. The octahedral-shaped water cluster (H₂O)₃₀ was constructed from square-pyramid-shaped (H₂O)₅ for compound 1, while the huge cage-shaped water cluster (H₂O)₄₉ of compound 2 consisted of crown-like (H₂O)₈ and one water molecule, which substitute the organic counter cations involved in the structural construction. More importantly, after removing the water clusters via simple heat treatment, the active sites of the two compounds were fully exposed, leading to good catalytic activities for both benzene hydroxylation reaction and oxidative desulfurization. Furthermore, the catalytic test confirmed that compound 2 may be a bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst with great promise for both benzene hydroxylation and oxidative desulfurization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesulfurization 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxylation 0apolyoxometalate-based metal−organic frameworks 0ahigh-nuclearity water clusters 0abenzene hydroxylation 0aoxidative desulfurization 0aheterogeneous catalyst1 aYu, Yan-Zhao1 aHong, Ya-Lin1 aLi, Ning-Fang1 aHan, Ye-Min1 aCao, Jia-Peng1 aSun, Qi1 aMei, Hua1 aXu, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6059-075X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 12, no. 51 p.57174-57181dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c189703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014300167300001600310520106600326592002801392650001501420650002501435650001401460650002201474650001201496650001901508650001901527650001701546650001701563650002001580653002701600653002401627653001701651653001601668653001201684700001901696700001801715700001801733773010801751856008601859852000901945655001201954IND60570598520221120160141.0190318e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057059852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Jinling10aExploration of permeability and antifouling performance on modified cellulose acetate ultrafiltration membrane with cellulose nanocrystals  ap. 190-199.  aCellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were introduced into cellulose diacetate (CDA) matrix via immerged phase-inversion process, aiming to improve the filtration and antifouling performance of CNCs/CDA blending membrane. The effects of CNCs on membrane morphologies, hydrophilicity, permeability and antifouling property were investigated. Results showed that the incorporation of CNCs into CDA membrane could effectively enhance the permeability and antifouling property of CNCs/CDA blending membrane by optimizing membrane microstructure and improving membrane hydrophilicity. A high pure water flux of 173.8L/m2h was achieved for the CNCs/CDA blending membrane at 200KPa, which is 24 times that of the CDA membrane (7.2L/m2h). The bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption amount of the CNCs/CDA blending membrane decreased about 48% compared to that of the CDA membrane. Additionally, the CNCs/CDA blending membrane exhibited better antifouling performance with the flux recovery ratio (FRR) of 89.5% after three fouling cycles, compared to 59.7% for the CDA membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abovine serum albumin 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3afouling 3ahydrophilicity 3amicrostructure 3ananocrystals 3apermeability 3aultrafiltration 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aCellulose diacetate 0aPermeability 0aAntifouling 0aProtein1 aZhang, Guoquan1 aZhang, Hanmin1 aYang, Fenglin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 174 p.190-199dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.06.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010400170300001400274520157500288592002801863650005001891650001101941650001901952650002001971650001501991650002902006650001202035650001802047650001602065650002002081650001902101650003702120650001202157650003102169651002102200653001102221653001502232653000802247653002202255653002402277700001602301700002002317700001802337700001702355700001802372773009602390856008602486852000902572655001202581IND60602798520221120140053.0180711e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060279852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Cheolsoo10aPerformance and emission characteristics of a vehicle fueled with enriched biogas and natural gases  ap. 17-29.  aThis study aimed to investigate the characteristics of exhaust emissions and the fuel economy of a compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle fueled with biogas and natural gases. A large CNG vehicle currently used as a city bus in Korea was tested on a chassis dynamometer under the European Transient Cycle (ETC) and the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) 06 cycles. One CH4-enriched biogas (97.6% CH4) and 5 natural gases with different CH4 contents (81.6–94.0% CH4) were used as test fuels. Total hydrocarbons (THC), CO, NOx and CO2 emissions in the NIER 06 cycle were higher than those in the ETC cycle for all tested fuels, while the fuel economy in the NIER 06 cycle was 43.7–51.5% lower than that in the ETC cycle. Total VOC emissions increased with increasing CH4 content in the fuel, with toluene being the highest proportion of the BTEX emissions in both the ETC cycle (72–80%) and the NIER 06 cycle (73–78%). Emissions of elemental/organic carbon exhibited a similar trend to that of nanoparticle emissions. Total organic carbon was mainly comprised of organic compounds at 97–99% (ETC cycle) and 95–99% (NIER 06 cycle). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in the NIER 06 cycle were 133.3–577.8% higher than in the ETC cycle because of incomplete combustion and an increase in unburned fuel in the NIER 06 cycle, which is a low-speed driving mode. Nanoparticle number concentrations were lowest for M91 among the 6 tested fuels; the total number of particles in the NIER 06 cycle was 33.2–123.8% higher than in the ETC cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3anatural gas 3anitrogen oxides 3aorganic carbon 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3aKorean Peninsula 0aBiogas 0aBiomethane 0aCNG 0aExhaust emissions 0aTransportation fuel1 aKim, Daigon1 aSong, Changkeun1 aKim, Jeongsoo1 aHan, Jinseok1 aCha, Jun-Seok0 tApplied energy.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 139 p.17-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010500165300001600270500001500286520141600301592002801717650001501745650000901760650001301769650001701782650002101799650000901820650002201829650001101851650001401862651001001876653001801886700001701904773010101921856008102022852000902103655001202112IND50073175220221119090511.0150213e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007317522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-013-0507-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xingqi10aEffectiveness of Rainwater Harvesting in Runoff Volume Reduction in a Planned Industrial Park, China  ap. 671-682.  a2019-12-06  aIt is urgent to effectively mitigate flood disasters in humid mountainous areas in southeastern China for the increasing flood risk under urbanization and industrialization. In this study, a rural district with an area of 13.39 km²that planning to build an industrial park covering an area of 7.98 km²in Changting was selected to estimate the potential of collectable rainwater and the extent to which runoff volume can potentially be mitigated by rainwater harvesting. In addition, the optimum cistern capacity of a rainwater harvesting system in the planned industrial park was evaluated using daily water balance simulation and cost-efficiency analysis. The results showed that rainwater harvesting in the planned industrial park has great potential. The annually collectable rainwater is approximately 9.8 × 10⁶ m³and the optimum cistern capacity is determined to be 0.9 × 10⁶ m³. With the optimum cistern capacity, the annual rainwater usage rate is 0.99, showing neither financial savings nor deficits. Rainwater harvesting can reduce 100 % of runoff volume in the cases of critical rainfall storm (50 mm) and annual average maximum daily rainfall (111.2 mm), and 58 % of runoff volume in the case of maximum daily rainfall (233.6 mm), respectively. All surface runoff can be collected and stored in the cisterns when rainfall amount is less than 135.5 mm in a rainstorm event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3arisk 3aplanning 3aurbanization 3awater harvesting 3arain 3aindustrialization 3arunoff 3adisasters 3aChina 0awater balance1 aHu, Maochuan0 tWater resources management.g2014 Feb., v. 28, no. 3 p.671-682dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-013-0507-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04253naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245010800212300001600320520212500336592002802461650002202489650001902511650001302530650002002543650001002563650001902573650000902592650002402601650001302625650002502638650003002663650001802693650001002711650001602721653001902737653002702756653001502783653002202798653001902820653001502839653001902854653003002873653002202903700006502925700006302990700006603053700006003119700006003179700002203239700002403261700006103285700005903346773015103405856008603556852000903642655001203651IND60749527120221120210320.0211003e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074952712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorinay, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7905-969110aCombining social information use and comfort seeking for nest site selection in a cavity-nesting raptor  ap. 167-178.  aWhen selecting a breeding site, individuals can use social information to reduce the uncertainty regarding habitat quality. Individuals of several bird species tend to reuse nests previously occupied by conspecific or heterospecific competitors but the proximate mechanisms underlying this behaviour remain unclear. Reoccupying nests previously used by competitors could result from individuals copying competitors' choices (the ‘social information’ hypothesis). Alternatively, it could allow individuals to fulfil their need for a soft nest substrate (e.g. by improving thermal insulation or reducing egg breakage risks) at low costs, regardless of previous occupancy (the ‘comfort’ hypothesis). Here, we aimed to determine which of these nonmutually exclusive mechanisms triggered the preference for old conspecific nest material in a secondary cavity-nesting raptor that does not add lining material to its nests, the lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni. Using an experimental design forcing settling lesser kestrels to choose between two adjacent nestboxes containing different substrates, we detected a strong preference for soft substrates (peat moss or old conspecific or European roller, Coracias garrulus, nest material) over coarse mineral substrate, especially when the soft substrate also provided social information about previous nest use by a competitor. Despite the apparent absence of preference when directly comparing settlement patterns in soft substrates with and without social information, early settling individuals favoured the substrate with social information, while late settling ones favoured the substrate without social information. This could reflect intraspecific competition avoidance by late arriving individuals that may be competitively inferior to early arriving ones. This hypothesis is supported by a later laying date of young breeders in our population. Our findings suggest that both comfort seeking and social information use explain the preference for previously used nest cavities, and that nest site choices may depend on individual competitive abilities and experience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoracias garrulus 3aFalco naumanni 3aSphagnum 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3aconspecificity 3aeggs 3aexperimental design 3ahabitats 3ainsulating materials 3aintraspecific competition 3anesting sites 3anests 3auncertainty 0acavity nesting 0aconspecific attraction 0adouble-box 0ainformed decision 0alesser kestrel 0anest reuse 0anest substrate 0anestbox choice experiment 0aold nest material1 aDe Pascalis, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1414-77701 aDominoni, Davide M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2063-99551 aMorganti, Michelangelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8047-04291 aPezzo, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4437-38051 aPirrello, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9471-106X1 aVisceglia, Matteo1 aDe Capua, Enrico L.1 aCecere, Jacopo G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4925-27301 aRubolini, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2703-57830 tAnimal behaviour.g2021 Oct., v. 180 p.167-178dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006100141245010900202300001600311520168900327592002802016650004002044650002602084650002202110650001202132650002002144650001502164650001802179650002502197650001502222650001302237650001502250650001002265653002302275653002302298700001802321700002002339773012202359856007602481852000902557655001202566IND60771153020221120103708.0220325e20211027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077115302DNAL7 a10.1017/wet.2021.902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2748-975310aMesotrione: a new preemergence herbicide option for wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) control in wheat  ap. 924-931.  aWild radish is the most problematic broadleaf weed in Australian grain production. The propensity of wild radish to evolve resistance to herbicides has led to high frequencies of multiple herbicide–resistant populations present in these grain production regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of mesotrione to selectively control wild radish in wheat. The initial dose response pot trials determined that at the highest mesotrione rate of 50 g ha–¹ applied preemergence (PRE) was 30% more effective than when applied postemergence (POST) on wild radish. This same rate of mesotrione applied POST resulted in a 30% reduction in wheat biomass compared to 0% for the PRE application. Subsequent mesotrione PRE dose response trials identified a wheat selective rate range of >100 and <300 g ai ha–¹ that provided greater than 85% wild radish control with less than 15% reduction in wheat growth. Field evaluations confirmed the efficacy of mesotrione at 100 to 150 g ai ha–¹ in reducing wild radish populations by greater than 85% following PRE application and incorporation by wheat planting. Additionally, these field trials demonstrated the opportunity for season-long control of wild radish when mesotrione applied PRE was followed by bromoxynil applied POST. The sequential PRE application of mesotrione, a herbicide that inhibits p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, followed by POST application of bromoxynil, a herbicide that inhibits photosystem II, has the potential to provide 100% wild radish control with no effect on wheat growth.

In Mexico, drinking water consumption in children from 9 to 18 years only reaches 30% of total fluid consumption. The aim of our study was to describe the social representations (SR) of drinking water in school-children and parents of two schools in Zapopan, Mexico. Associative free listing was used as an information gathering technique. Schoolchildren aged 8 to 12 years (n = 50) and parents (n = 23) from two elementary schools were selected by a convenience sampling from April to June 2015. A similarity analysis was performed using the co-occurrence index; with this, a similarity graph was obtained. Prototypical analysis was performed to explore the structure of the SR. Three dimensions were described in the children’s SR: a functional dimension related to health and nutrition, a practical dimension that describes the instruments used for its consumption, and a theoretical dimension that specifies the characteristics of water and its relationship with nature. In the parents’ SR, a functional dimension was also found; another dimension was described regarding the integral well-being that drinking water provides. A practical dimension describes the features related to its consumption. The investigation describes the structure of the water SR, which help to contextualize and explain the actions of schoolchildren and their parents regarding drinking water consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3adiet 3aschool children 3aMexico1 aBernal-Orozco, María Fernanda1 aGrover-Baltazar, Gabriela Alejandra1 aVizmanos, Barbara 0 tNutrients.g2021 May 30, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130618713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011900164300001600283520181000299592002802109650001602137650002102153650001702174650002002191650001802211650001302229650001402242650000902256650002102265650001702286650002502303650001602328650001202344650002702356650002302383650001502406650001002421650001302431650001402444651000902458700002102467700002102488700002202509773009002531856008102621852000902702655001202711IND60576339720221118163940.0170802e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057633972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-017-9843-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnwar, Usman14aThe Effect of Five Biomass Cropping Systems on Soil-Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Across a Topographic Gradient  ap. 824-831.  aUnderstanding the environmental impact of bioenergy crops is needed to inform bioenergy policy development. We determined the effects of five biomass cropping systems—continuous maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max)-triticale (Triticosecale ×)/soybean-maize, maize-switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), triticale/sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and triticale-aspen (Populus alba × P. grandidentata)—on soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K S) across a toposequence in central Iowa, USA. We compared data from the time of cropping system establishment in 2009 to 4 years post-establishment. Both our 2009 and 2013 data confirmed that cropping system impacts on K S vary by landscape position. We found that differences in cropping system impacts were more likely to occur at lower landscape positions, specifically, within footslope and floodplain positions. Previous research on cropping system impacts suggested that grass and woody systems were associated with a general increase in K S over time, with greater changes likely occurring at landscape positions with a higher erosive potential or lower SOC content. Our results confirmed that the triticale-aspen woody system was associated with a significant increase in K S across all landscape positions. In contrast, we did not observe an increase in K S under maize-switchgrass, which we attributed to the high density of switchgrass roots by the fourth year of study, but expect an increase in K S under switchgrass under longer measurement periods. We also found a significant increase in K S in the annual systems, likely due to the conversion to no-till soil management with cropping system establishment. We expect such differences to become more apparent over longer time scales as cropping systems continue to impact soil hydraulic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aPanicum virgatum 3aPopulus alba 3aSorghum bicolor 3aTriticosecale 3aZea mays 3abioenergy 3acorn 3acropping systems 3aenergy crops 3aenvironmental impact 3afloodplains 3agrasses 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alandscape position 3ano-tillage 3aroots 3asoybeans 3atriticale 3aIowa1 aSchulte, Lisa A.1 aHelmers, Matthew1 aKolka, Randall K.0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.824-831dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-017-9843-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010500171300001800276520063900294592002800933650001300961650002200974650002800996650001101024650001201035700002501047700002401072700002201096773011101118856008601229852000901315655001201324IND60569795220221120151840.0170610e20170606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056979522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b013752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, Ryan A.10aEvaluation of Porous Silicon Oxide on Silicon Microcantilevers for Sensitive Detection of Gaseous HF  ap. 6272-6276.  aSensitive detection of harmful chemicals in industrial applications is pertinent to safety.

There are other inexpensive measures of adiposity which might better capture fat‐mass in youth The objective of this study is to examine differences between sex‐specific trajectories of BMI and other adiposity indicators (subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness, waist circumference, waist‐to‐height ratio) which may better capture fat‐mass in youth. METHODS: Data come from four cycles of a longitudinal cohort of 1293 students in Montréal, Canada at ages 12, 15, 17 and 24. Group‐based trajectory models identified sex‐specific adiposity trajectories among participants with data in ≥3 cycles (n = 417 males; n = 445 females). RESULTS: There were six trajectory groups in males and females for all five indicators, except for waist circumference (seven) in both sexes and triceps skinfold thickness (four) and waist‐to‐height ratio (five) in females. Most trajectories indicated linear increases; only the skinfold thickness indicators identified a decreasing trajectory. While all indicators identified a trajectory with high levels of adiposity, they differed in the number and relative size of trajectories pertaining to individuals in lower half of the adiposity distribution. CONCLUSION: BMI is a satisfactory indicator of adiposity in youth if the aim of the trajectory analysis is to identify youth with excess adiposity, a known risk factor for cardiometabolic outcomes in adulthood.  aPublisher supplied data  a010271cCanadian Cancer Society Research Institute  a017435cCanadian Cancer Society Research Institute  a21098cCancer Research Society 3aadiposity 3aadulthood 3abody mass index 3alean body mass 3aobesity 3arisk factors 3askinfold thickness 3awaist circumference 3awaist-to-height ratio 3ayouth 3aCanada1 aAhun, Marilyn N.1 aO'Loughlin, Jennifer0 tObesity science & practice.g2021 Dec., v. 7, no. 6 p.711-718dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.5383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245009900208300002000307506007600327520098100403592002801384506003701412650001301449650001801462650001001480650001501490650001701505650002501522650001601547653002601563653002801589653002901617653002501646700002701671700003601698700002501734773017601759856007901935852000902014655001202023IND60178689320221207125654.0150604e20140812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017868932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14117271112doi7 aPMC41366122pmcid7 a250711952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnglada, Josep M.10aSpectroscopic signatures of ozone at the air–water interface and photochemistry implications  ap. 11618-11623.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFirst-principles simulations suggest that additional OH formation in the troposphere can result from ozone interactions with the surface of cloud droplets. Ozone exhibits an affinity for the air–water interface, which modifies its UV and visible light spectroscopic signatures and photolytic rate constant in the troposphere. Ozone cross sections on the red side of the Hartley band (290- to 350-nm region) and in the Chappuis band (450–700 nm) are increased due to electronic ozone–water interactions. This effect, combined with the potential contribution of the O ₃ + hν → O(³P) + O ₂(X ³Σ g⁻) photolytic channel at the interface, leads to an enhancement of the OH radical formation rate by four orders of magnitude. This finding suggests that clouds can influence the overall oxidizing capacity of the troposphere on a global scale by stimulating the production of OH radicals through ozone photolysis by UV and visible light at the air–water interface.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adroplets 3afree radicals 3aozone 3aphotolysis 3aspectroscopy 3asurface interactions 3atroposphere 0aatmospheric chemistry 0aheterogeneous processes 0areactive oxidant species 0acomputer simulations1 aMartins-Costa, Marilia1 aRuiz-Lopez, M.

Layered GaN is a promising two-dimensional material of the III–V family with a sizable band gap. The impact of buckling and the difference in atomic structure of the different models lead to significant changes in the electronic structure, including an indirect-to-direct band gap transition. Because of the small energy difference between different models, it can be expected that at room temperature, regions of the material may have different structures that coexist. The possibility to tailor the structural and electronic properties of bilayer GaN by applying an external strain is also explored. Under tensile strain, all structures tend to become flat, whereas under biaxial compressive strain, buckled structures are favored, with an indirect-to-direct band gap transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acompression strength 3aenergy 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3atensile strength1 aYayama, Tomoe1 aMorishita, Tetsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8308-62111 aSpencer, Michelle J.

Dietary lapses (i.e., deviations from the BWL diet) occur frequently and can adversely affect weight loss outcomes. Research indicates that lapse behavior is heterogenous; there are many eating behaviors that could constitute a dietary lapse, but they are rarely studied as distinct contributors to weight outcomes. This secondary analysis aims to evaluate six behavioral lapse types during a 10-week mobile BWL program (eating a large portion, eating when not intended, eating an off-plan food, planned lapse, being unaware of caloric content, and endorsing multiple types of lapse). Associations between weekly behavioral lapse type frequency and weekly weight loss were investigated, and predictive contextual characteristics (psychological, behavioral, and environmental triggers for lapse) and individual difference (e.g., age, gender) factors were examined across lapse types. Participants (N = 121) with overweight/obesity (MBMI = 34.51; 84.3% female; 69.4% White) used a mobile BWL program for 10 weeks, self-weighed weekly using Bluetooth scales, completed daily ecological momentary assessment of lapse behavior and contextual characteristics, and completed a baseline demographics questionnaire. Linear mixed models revealed significant negative associations between unplanned lapses and percent weight loss. Unplanned lapses from eating a large portion, eating when not intended, and having multiple “types” were significantly negatively associated with weekly percent weight loss. A lasso regression showed that behavioral lapse types share many similar stable factors, with other factors being unique to specific lapse types. Results add to the prior literature on lapses and weight loss in BWL and provide preliminary evidence that behavioral lapse types could aid in understanding adherence behavior and developing precision medicine tools to improve dietary adherence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3ademographic statistics 3adiet 3aenergy content 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3aobesity 3aprecision medicine 3aquestionnaires 3aweight loss 3awireless technology 0aDietary lapse 0aWeight loss 0aEcological momentary assessment 0aEating behavior1 aThomas, J.

Leaf bioassays using mycelia from the fermentation product of MV indicated that excised leaves of young greenhousegrown (glyphosate resistant and -susceptible) and mature field-grown (glyphosateresistant) plants were injured by the bioherbicide. Generally, injury was directly proportional to the MV mycelial concentration applied, and glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant plant leaves were equally sensitive to the MV phytotoxic effects as measured by reduction of chlorophyll content. Similar effects occurred on whole plants challenged by MV spray applications to foliage, as substantiated by plant growth reduction (fresh and dry weight accumulation) at termination of the time course. MV disease progression over a 7-d period in young (2-week-old) plants increased with time, and at 48 to 72 h after treatment, disease was severe with nearly 100% mortality occurring and there were no significant response differences in the glyphosate-susceptible and -resistant plants. As expected, disease progression in 4-week-old plants was slower, indicating more tolerance to the bioherbicide, but injury was moderately severe at the endpoint (168 h) after treatment. Results demonstrate that under greenhouse and laboratory conditions, MV can control both glyphosate-resistant and susceptible Palmer amaranth seedlings which could make this bioherbicide a possible candidate for use against this economically important weed. 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3aallelopathy 3abioassays 3abiopesticides 3abiotypes 3achlorophyll 3adisease course 3adry matter accumulation 3afermentation 3afungi 3aglyphosate 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3aherbicidal properties 3aherbicide resistance 3aleaves 3amature plants 3amortality 3amycelium 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3aseedlings 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aTeaster, N.

The chemical modification of DTP group will be expected to modulate the electron-donating ability of D–A–A small molecules. To gain a better understanding of the effects of structural modification of DTP on the photophysical properties and the photovoltaic performance, the geometrical and electronic structures, absorption spectra, energy loss, intramolecular charge transfer, exciton dissociation and charge recombination rates at the interface, and hole-transport properties are analyzed in detail to establish structure–property relationships for the investigated D–A–A molecules. This work provides an intuitive explanation why the modification of DTP could modulate the frontier orbital levels, light-absorbing capacities, intra- and intermolecular charge-transfer properties, and interfacial exciton dissociation and recombination. The calculated results also demonstrate that the fine tuning of the electron-donating ability of small-molecule donor material could be an effective approach to improving the cell performance. This study could give theoretical guidelines for molecular design and pave the way to synthesize efficient small-molecule donor materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantum mechanics 3asolar cells 3aspectral analysis1 aSong, Chongping1 aLi, Jiaqi1 aLi, Ping1 aZhang, Houyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0360-60350 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Dec. 30, v. 123, no. 2 p.1069-1081dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b100383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245010400206520189200310592002802202650001602230650001302246650002802259650000902287650002402296651001202320653001602332653001302348653001902361653001502380653001702395700006202412700001802474773009502492856008402587852000902671655001202680IND60741528420221118104117.0210813e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074152842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1054622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvert, Sian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1764-666310aNormative misperceptions of unhealthy snacking amongst 11- to 12-year-old secondary school students  aYounger adolescents are at an age where they have increasing control of their diet, and where peers become an important social reference for acceptable and normative dietary behaviours. These normative perceptions are often inaccurate and can lead to the development of unhealthy eating practices; although, the role of normative misperceptions of peers' unhealthy snacking behaviours in younger adolescents' personal snacking behaviours is not clear. The current study was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a social norms-based healthy eating intervention sampling two secondary schools in deprived areas of England. Students aged 11–12 years (n = 252) completed self-report measures of their demographic characteristics and personal behaviours, attitudes, intentions, and normative perceptions (descriptive and injunctive norms), relating to unhealthy snacking. Results indicated students overestimated peers' daily unhealthy snacks consumption by approximately 3.2 portions, misperceived peers to have more positive attitudes towards unhealthy snacking and more negative attitudes towards reducing snacking. The greater these misperceptions of peers' behaviours and attitudes, the more likely students were to consume unhealthy snacks and have positive attitudes about unhealthy snacking. Girls had a stronger intention to reduce their snacking behaviours if they had more positive attitudes to reducing snacking behaviours and misperceived peers to also have a positive attitude. In summary, 11- to 12-year-olds misperceive the snacking behaviour and attitudes of their peers, and such normative misperceptions are associated with students’ own snacking behaviours and attitudes. Interventions which challenge these misperceptions may assist in reducing the social acceptability of unhealthy snacking and in reducing unhealthy snacking amongst young adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aappetite 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3asecondary education 3aEngland 0aAdolescents 0aSnacking 0aMisperceptions 0aIntentions 0aSocial norms1 aDempsey, Robert C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6477-23631 aPovey, Rachel0 tAppetite.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 166 p.105462-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1054623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245013000188300001800318520068300336592002801019650001801047650001601065650002601081650001901107650001901126650001001145650001501155650003101170650001901201650003001220650001101250650006701261650005101328650006601379650006201445650007101507650003401578650005201612650001901664650002801683650003901711650003101750650001401781650003001795650006501825650006501890650002201955650003201977700002802009700002502037700002402062700002502086773010402111856008102215852000902296655001202305IND4414606820221120032500.0151024e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441460682DNAL7 a186885752pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-008-9816-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvanitis, Nikolaos12aA refinery sludge deposition site: presence of nahH and alkJ genes and crude oil biodegradation ability of bacterial isolates  ap. 2105-2110.  a204 bacterial isolates from four Greek refinery sludge deposition sites were investigated for the presence of nahH and alkJ genes encoding key enzymes of both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation pathways by PCR and DNA hybridisation.

This manuscript describes procedures that may be used to monitor γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of either APP-C99 or Notch, using a Gal4 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter system. These assays were established by stably co-transfecting HEK293 cells with the Gal4-driven luciferase reporter gene and either the Gal4/VP16-tagged C-terminal fragment of APP (APP-C99; CG cells), or the Gal4/VP16-tagged Notch-ΔE (NΔE; NG cells). Using these reporter assays in parallel, we have demonstrated that an ErbB2 inhibitor, CL-387,785, can preferentially suppress γ-secretase cleavage of APP-C99 in CG cells, but not NΔE in NG cells. The differential responses exhibited by the CG and NG cells, when treated with CL-387,785, represent a preferred characteristic for γ-secretase modulators, and these responses are in stark contrast to the pan-inhibition of γ-secretase induced by DAPT. Our studies provide direct evidence that γ-secretase activities toward different substrates can be differentiated in a cellular context. These new assays may therefore be useful tools in drug discovery for improved AD therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aluciferase 3aquantitative analysis 3areporter genes1 aWu, Pei-Yi1 aChen, Yun-Wen1 aChang, Yu-Tzu1 aBhore, Noopur1 aWu, Po-Fan1 aLiao, Yung-Feng0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Jan. 25, , no. 131 p.e56795-e56795dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/567953Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56795/quantitative-measurement-secretase-mediated-amyloid-precursor-protein  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100005600192245011800248500001900366506007600385520136400461592002801825506003701853650001901890650001501909650001001924650001601934650003501950653001701985653001702002653001502019700005902034773009302093856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60690913320221207064105.0200508e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069091332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e021762doi7 aPMC67065852pmcid7 a314633822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiimi, Kimie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5240-574510aNew system to examine the activity and water and food intake of germ-free mice in a sealed positive-pressure cage  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGerm-free (GF) mice are useful models for the examination of host–microbe interactions in health and disease. We recently reported on the maintenance of individual GF mice for more than 1 year in a sealed positive-pressure cage. However, no useful system exists to automatically record basic behavioral patterns, such as activity and the intake of water and food, under GF status. In this study, we examined basic behavior by combining the sealed positive-pressure cage with a behavioral monitoring system and observed the gross morphology of GF mice at 4 weeks and 8 months of age. GF mice exhibited cecal enlargement and had lower body and adipose tissue weights compared with age-matched specific pathogen–free (SPF) mice. Although both strains had similar circadian rhythms, GF mice exhibited decreased activity compared with age-matched SPF mice. GF mice also exhibited increased levels of water intake compared with age-matched SPF mice. Although GF mice demonstrated decreased food intake levels at the age of 4 weeks, they exhibited increased food intake levels compared with age-matched SPF mice at the age of 8 months. The present research indicates that automated measurement systems that record the basic behaviors of GF mice for long periods are useful for the acceleration of the study of metabolic functions and host–microbe interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3aautomation 3acages 3afood intake 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 0aMicrobiology 0aNeuroscience 0aPhysiology1 aTakahashi, Eiki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0253-49680 tHeliyon.g2019 Aug., v. 5, no. 8 p.e02176-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e021763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245016300169520142100332592002801753650001601781650001401797650001701811650001001828650001201838650002101850650001501871650001501886650001401901650001401915650003101929650001501960653001601975653000901991653001502000653001502015653001202030700002302042700002102065700002202086700002302108700002002131700002202151700002002173773012202193856008302315852000902398655001202407IND60781508020221119080943.0220714e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078150802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.1112632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolst, Meghan M.10aBehavioral changes in senescent giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini) are associated with peripheral neural degeneration and loss of epithelial tissue  aMost species of octopus experience extreme physical decline after a single reproductive bout which extends over a period of days, weeks, or months before eventual death. Although outward indicators of senescence are widely recognized, comparatively little is known about physiological and neural changes accompanying terminal decline in octopuses. Here, we measured changes in behavioral response to nociceptive stimuli across the lifespan in giant Pacific octopus (GPO), Enteroctopus dofleini, held in public aquariums in the USA. Post-euthanasia, tissue was collected from arm tips, and neural and epithelial cell degeneration was quantified and compared with biopsies of arm tips from healthy, pre-reproductive GPOs. Behavioral assays showed significant changes both in low threshold mechanosensory responses and nociceptive behavioral responses beginning early in senescence and extending until euthanasia. Histology data showed that while the ratio of apoptotic cells to total cell number stayed constant between healthy and senescent GPOs, overall neural and epithelial cell density was significantly lower in terminally senescent octopuses compared with healthy controls. Our data provide new insight into the time-course and causes of sensory dysfunction in senescent cephalopods and suggest proactive welfare management should begin early in the senescence phase, well before animals enter terminal decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCephalopoda 3aapoptosis 3abiochemistry 3adeath 3adecline 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aeuthanasia 3ahistology 3alongevity 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphysiology 0aNociception 0aPain 0aPhysiology 0aSenescence 0aWelfare1 aHauver, Camille M.1 aStein, Rachel S.1 aMilano, Bianca L.1 aLevine, Lindsey H.1 aZink, Andrew G.1 aWatters, Jason V.1 aCrook, Robyn J.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Sept., v. 271 p.111263-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2022.1112633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024003800169024001200207040001800219100002100237245009100258300001600349506017300365520160200538592002802140596007002168650002102238650003002259650002302289650001202312650002702324650001302351650002502364650000902389650002402398773009002422856011402512856008202626956010402708961000902812852000902821655001202830IND60576340320221214223451.0170802e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057634032DNAL7 a3309762aris7 a10113/57634032hdl7 a10.1007/s12155-017-9827-62doi7 a10.1007/s12155-017-9827-62chorus8 ans13022  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, Tim L.10aEffect of Nitrogen Fertilization and Residual Nitrogen on Biomass Yield of Switchgrass  ap. 648-656.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSwitchgrass, Panicum virgatum L., grown for biomass has been extensively researched where the annual precipitation >760 mm and the climate varies from humid to moist-subhumid. Research is needed for areas that receive <700 mm of precipitation, where the climate varies from dry-subhumid to semiarid. The objectives were to determine (1) the effect of nitrogen fertilization on biomass production, (2) the effect of residual nitrogen on biomass production, (3) the nitrogen yield from harvested biomass, and (4) the concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC) from switchgrass plots. Plots were fertilized annually with nitrogen at the rates of 0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha⁻¹ from 2008 to 2011 and unfertilized from 2012 to 2015. The biomass yield varied with N rate × production year interactions (P < 0.05), and biomass yield as a function of N rate was either linear or curvilinear depending upon production year. When fertilized, the biomass yield averaged 4.4, 9.4, 11.6, and 13.2 ± 0.4 Mg ha⁻¹ for the 0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha⁻¹ N rates, respectively. Residual nitrogen sustained high biomass yields for 1 year after fertilization ceased. The nitrogen harvested in biomass varied with N rate × production year interactions (P < 0.05), and the harvested nitrogen yield as a function of N rate was linear each year. Fertilization increased the concentration of SOC an average of 1.0 ± 0.2 mg g⁻¹ of soil. The data suggest that producers could occasionally skip a year of nitrogen fertilization without detrimentally impacting the production of switchgrass biomass.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917 3aPanicum virgatum 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abiomass production 3aclimate 3afertilizer application 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.648-656dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57634033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-017-9827-63Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/10.1007_s12155-017-9827-6.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245015200181300001600333500001500349520141200364592002801776650002101804650002101825650001601846650001501862650001101877650002801888650001401916650001801930650003801948650000901986650001401995650001302009650001202022650004002034650001102074650004402085650008902129650003202218650001102250650002102261650007902282650005202361650003202413653003902445700001602484700001802500700001402518773013102532852000902663856008302672655001202755IND2047171620221119194132.0181016e199504  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204717162DNAL7 a76198982pmid7 a10.1177/1040638795007002022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElvander, M.10aEvaluation and Application of an Indirect ELISA for the Detection of Antibodies to Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Milk, Bulk Milk, and Serum  ap. 177-182.  a2019-12-04  aAn indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed at the National Veterinary Institute (NVI), Uppsala, to detect antibodies to bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) in serum and milk. For the evaluation of the NVI ELISA, field sera collected from cattle in England and Sweden were tested in parallel with an ELISA in use at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL), Weybridge. The tests showed 96% agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of the NVI ELISA relative to the CVL ELISA were 94% and 100%, respectively. There was evidence that the difference in sensitivity between the 2 tests was due to the detection of both IgG and IgM class antibodies by the CVL ELISA, whereas the NVI ELISA was designed specifically to detect IgGl. Milk and serum samples from individual cows were tested by the NVI ELISA for presence of antibodies to BRSV. There was a good correlation between the ability to detect antibodies in serum and the ability to detect them in milk, although the antibody titer was generally lower in milk than in serum. Bulk milk samples were collected from farms with severe clinical symptoms of respiratory distress and from farms with no history of respiratory disease. There was a clear distinction between antibody levels in diseased and healthy herds. The NVI ELISA is a rapid and reliable test for detecting antibodies to BRSV in milk, bulk milk, and serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ablood serum 3aantibodies 3acattle 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3abulk milk 3arapid methods 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amilk 3adetection 3aaccuracy 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxanalysisxblood. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxstatistics & numerical dataxveterinary. 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFemale 2aMilkximmunology 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus Infectionsxdiagnosisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovineximmunology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aBovine respiratory syncytial virus1 aEdwards, S.1 aNäslund, IS.1 aLinde, N.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 7, no. 2 p.177-182dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638795007002023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03425naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245012200198300001400320500002000334520153900354592002801893596004801921596004801969596004802017596004802065596004802113596004802161596004802209650002302257650001202280650001702292650001302309650001602322650001802338650001202356650002402368650001902392650001602411651001302427700002502440700005802465700002802523700002202551700006602573700006602639773012002705856007302825852000902898655001202907IND60789473920221117222823.0220820e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078947392DNAL7 a10.1002/osp4.5402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaldwell, Ann E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9537-521610aImproving lifestyle obesity treatment during the COVID‐19 pandemic and beyond: New challenges for weight management  ap. 32-44.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: The COVID‐19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes to daily life and many health‐related behaviors. The objective of this study was to examine how the stay‐at‐home/safer‐at‐home mandates issued in Colorado (March 2020–May 2020) impacted lifestyle behaviors and mental health among individuals with overweight or obesity participating in two separate behavioral weight loss trials (n = 82). METHODS: Questionnaires were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data on challenges to weight loss presented by the COVID‐19 pandemic, including changes in dietary intake, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and mental health during the stay‐at‐home/safer‐at‐home mandates. RESULTS: Using a convergent mixed method approach integrating qualitative and quantitative data, the greatest challenge experienced by participants was increased stress and anxiety, which led to more unhealthy behaviors. The majority perceived it to be harder to adhere to the prescribed diet (81%) and recommended physical activity (68%); however, self‐reported exercise on weekdays increased significantly and 92% of participants lost weight or maintained weight within ±1% 5–6 weeks following the stay‐at‐home mandate. CONCLUSION: Study results suggest that obesity treatment programs should consider and attempt to address the burden of stress and anxiety stemming from the COVID‐19 pandemic and other sources due to the negative effects they can have on weight management and associated behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data  aF32 DK122652cNational Institutes of Health  aK01 DK113063cNational Institutes of Health  aUL1 RR025780cNational Institutes of Health  aKL2 TR002534cNational Institutes of Health  aR01 DK111622cNational Institutes of Health  aR21 DK117499cNational Institutes of Health  aK01 HL143039cNational Institutes of Health 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aanxiety 3adiet therapy 3aexercise 3afood intake 3amental health 3aobesity 3asedentary lifestyle 3aweight control 3aweight loss 3aColorado1 aThomas, Elizabeth A.1 aRynders, Corey1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5767-62611 aHolliman, Brooke Dorsey1 aPerreira, Cathryn1 aOstendorf, Danielle M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3923-57261 aCatenacci, Victoria A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9723-37480 tObesity science & practice.g2022 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.32-44dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.5403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012100182300001600303520169400319592002802013650002602041650001002067650001302077650002802090650001302118650001502131650001802146650001902164650000702183650002202190650001702212650002302229650001402252650001102266650001102277650001802288653002702306653000702333653001802340653002302358653001302381653001602394700003802410700002902448700002902477700002002506700003102526700003402557700002402591700003002615773007802645856008602723852000902809655001202818IND60572934220221119113359.0170720e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057293422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContreras-Cruzado, Isabel10aRelationships between spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment and halophytes zonation in salt marshes  ap. 173-187.  aThis study reports the soil-plant relationships along the intertidal gradient from unvegetated mudflats to the ecotone between high marshes and coastal dunes. The main objective was to establish the integrated role of spatial and seasonal changes in the sedimentary abiotic environment in relation to the establishment of the halophytes zonation pattern. The sedimentary environment and the halophytes coverage were sampled bimonthly during a year in nine intertidal habitats characterized by different plant communities. The highest values of sediment water content (40–60%) and electrical conductivity (20–30mScm−1) were registered in low-middle marshes, the highest organic matter content (ca. 23%) was found in middle marshes, and the highest pH (8.5–9.0) was recorded in high marshes. The conductivity and the pH of the marsh sediments changed seasonally. The sediment conductivity reached its highest values during spring and summer. The spatial variations in the sedimentary environment were closely associated with the distribution of most of the recorded halophytes, especially in low and high marshes where the abiotic environment was more stressful. At the same time, cyclical seasonal changes in conductivity seemed to determine the distribution of the halophytes in high marshes, where the seasonality was very marked under Mediterranean climate. The combination and integration over time of these spatio-temporal changes in the sedimentary environment defined habitats with contrasted abiotic conditions parallel to the tidal line and complex abiotic mosaics inside some of these habitats, allowing the cohabitation of >30 plant species along the intertidal gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3adunes 3aecotones 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahabitats 3ahalophytes 3alittoral zone 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aplant communities 3asalt marshes 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3awater content 0aOrganic matter content 0apH 0aWater content 0aTidal salt marshes 0aSalinity 0aSeasonality1 aInfante-Izquierdo, María Dolores1 aMárquez-García, Belén1 aHermoso-López, Virgilio1 aPolo, Alejandro1 aNieva, Francisco Javier J.1 aCartes-Barroso, Juan Bautista1 aCastillo, Jesús M.1 aMuñoz-Rodríguez, Adolfo0 tGeoderma.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 305 p.173-187dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011900165300001400284520091200298592002801210650002301238650001001261650001101271650001501282650004301297650001101340650001801351650001001369650001401379700001301393700002001406773009801426856008101524852000901605655001201614IND4473267520221118063644.0141110e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447326752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalderón, J.M.10aWithin and between plant variation of 4β-hydroxiwithanolide E in cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana; Solanaceae)  ap. 21-25.  a4β-Hydroxywithanolide E is a compound with antifeedant activity against certain species of insect herbivores.

In this study, we quantified by HPLC the concentration of 4β-hydroxywithanolide E in different organs of P. peruviana plants in different developmental stages. Also, we determined the effect of simulated herbivory on concentration of this compound in different parts of the plant. In seedlings, 4β-Hydroxywithanolide E had a higher concentration in leaves than in roots. Conversely, in mature plants, the concentration was lower in leaves than in roots. In reproductive parts, calyxes had higher concentration than fruits.

This study measured herbicide sorption and efficacy when soils were treated with low (1% w/w) or high (10% w/w) amounts of biochar manufactured from different feedstocks [maize (Zea mays) stover, switchgrass (Panicum vigatum), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)], and treated with different post-processing techniques. Twenty-four hour batch equilibration measured sorption of ¹⁴C-labelled atrazine or 2,4-D to two soil types with and without biochar amendments. Herbicide efficacy was measured with and without biochar using speed of seed germination tests of sensitive species. Biochar amended soils sorbed more herbicide than untreated soils, with major differences due to biochar application rate but minor differences due to biochar type or post-process handling technique. Biochar presence increased the speed of seed germination compared with herbicide alone addition. These data indicate that biochar addition to soil can increase herbicide sorption and reduce efficacy. Evaluation for site-specific biochar applications may be warranted to obtain maximal benefits without compromising other agronomic practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aPanicum virgatum 3aPinus ponderosa 3aZea mays 3aapplication rate 3aatrazine 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abyproducts 3acorn 3afeedstocks 3aphytomass 3aplant cultural practices 3apyrolysis 3aseed germination 3asoil amendments 3asoil quality 3asoil types 3asorption 3astover 0a2,4-D 0aAtrazine 0aherbicide efficacy 0asorption 0aspeed of germination1 aKrack, Kaitlynn K.1 aBruggeman, Stephanie A.1 aPapiernik, Sharon1 aSchumacher, Thomas E.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 Aug. 2, v. 51, no. 8 p.497-507dTaylor & Francisx1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2016.11705403Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03675naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245008500129300001600214500001900230520228000249592002802529650001002557650001902567650001502586650001702601650001702618650001402635650000902649650000902658650001802667650002202685650001702707650001902724650002402743650001202767650001802779650001502797650002102812650001702833650001502850651001002865653002902875653004102904653001302945653002202958653001802980773016202998852000903160655001203169IND60710355220221119072505.0200908e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071035522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrewal, S.S.10aImpact of soil conservation measures on soil properties in sukhna lake catchment  ap. 216-223.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSukhna, a recreational Lake of Chandigarh suffered from rapid siltation as its catchment at Shivalik hills are affected by severe soil erosion. Intensive soil conservation measures taken for three decades reduced silt loads but ameliorative effects in terms of soil properties were not evaluated. Comparing with an untreated comparable adjoining control watershed, the ameliorative impacts of 30 years of closure and intensive soil conservation measures were evaluated during 2008–09. The catchment was divided into 27 slopes and elevation based classes in 560 ha micro watershed. The enumeration of vegetation cover and soil analysis from each plot was carried out using standard methodology. The data on impact of soil properties is presented in this paper. The mean soil pH in treated area decreased from 8.19 to 7.72 but EC increased from 0.11 to 0.15 dsm ⁻¹. The overall soil organic carbon increased from 0.44 to 0.70%. The available phosphorus was 22.23kg ha⁻¹ in control against 32.56kg ha⁻¹ in the surface soil of treated Sukhna Lake catchment. The status of available soil potassium was 116.63 kg ha in control against almost double i.e. 219.71 kg ha⁻¹ in the treated area. The leaf litter increased from 2.04t ha⁻¹ yr to4.49t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. The growth of Sorghum plants raised in pots filled with soil taken from plots of control and treated under conditions of no water stress was 15.1 and 19.3 cm and survival as 86.4 and 100% in one month. However, when water stress was applied in a separate set of pots, the plant growth was 8.0 and 11.2 cm and survival percentage as 43.2 and 70.8% in one month in control and treated pots. In case of control area, the soil moisture in 0–120 cm profile varied from 4.1 to 11.0% before rain and 5.0 to 11.4% after the monsoon rain. However, in case of treated area, the soil moisture varied from 5.6 to 13.6% before and from 6.5 to 15.0% after the monsoon rains. The soil profile of Sukhna Lake catchment stored 2.9 cm more water up to 0–120 cm depth as compared to the control area which over 2540 ha catchment area would mean 73.66 ha-m of additional water stored in the soil profile. Such an improvement in soil fertility and moisture regime was responsible for rejuvenation of the vegetation cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3alakes 3amonsoon season 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant litter 3apotassium 3arain 3asilt 3asoil analysis 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3avegetation cover 3awater stress 3awatersheds 3aIndia 0aChemical soil properties 0aImpact of soil conservation measures 0aPhysical 0aSiltation of Lake 0aSoil moisture0 tIndian journal of soil conservation.g2014 Aug., v. 42, no. 2 p.216-223dIndian Association of Soil and Water ConservationistswJournal:2072x0976-17217nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245019000161520150400351592002801855650001601883650002001899650001701919700001901936700001901955700002001974700002001994700001702014700001702031773012102048856007402169852000902243655001202252IND60742659220221119212112.0210624e20210531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074265922DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130618822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaines, Allison 10aDeconstructing the Supermarket: Systematic Ingredient Disaggregation and the Association between Ingredient Usage and Product Health Indicators for 24,229 Australian Foods and Beverages  aUnhealthy diets are underpinned by the over-consumption of packaged products. Data describing the ingredient composition of these products is limited. We sought to define the ingredients used in Australian packaged foods and beverages and assess associations between the number of ingredients and existing health indicators. Statements of ingredients were disaggregated, creating separate fields for each ingredient and sub-ingredient. Ingredients were categorised and the average number of ingredients per product was calculated. Associations between number of ingredients and both the nutrient-based Health Star Rating (HSR) and the NOVA level-of-processing classification were assessed. A total of 24,229 products, listing 233,113 ingredients, were included. Products had between 1 and 62 ingredients (median (Interquartile range (IQR)): 8 (3–14)). We identified 915 unique ingredients, which we organised into 17 major and 138 minor categories. ‘Additives’ were contained in the largest proportion of products (64.6%, (15,652/24,229)). The median number of ingredients per product was significantly lower in products with the optimum 5-star HSR (when compared to all other HSR score groups, p-value < 0.001) and significantly higher in products classified as ultra-processed (when compared to all other NOVA classification groups, p-value < 0.001). There is a strong relationship between the number of ingredients in a product and indicators of nutritional quality and level of processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aingredients 3anutritive value 3asupermarkets1 aShahid, Maria 1 aHuang, Liping 1 aDavies, Tazman 1 aTaylor, Fraser 1 aWu, Jason HY1 aNeal, Bruce 0 tNutrients.g2021 May 31, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130618823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010600169300001600275520121300291592002801504650002201532650001401554650001801568650001201586650001101598650001801609650001801627650001501645650001301660650002601673653002001699653001801719653002201737653002301759700002901782700005801811700001801869700001701887773012301904856008302027852000902110655001202119IND60741529020221118104121.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074152902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeramati, Arezoo14aThe effect of audible sound frequency on the growth and beta-carotene production of Dunaliella salina  ap. 373-382.  aSound vibrations as a cutting-edge technology considered for promoting the growth of microalgae. In this experiment, the authors have carried out a pilot study to observe the response of Dunaliella salina to audible sound frequencies (100, 200, 500, 1000 Hz). The growth and beta-carotene concentration as a secondary metabolite in optimal culture medium and sub-optimal medium with nitrate deficiency were investigated. The control was in an acoustic enclosure without any sound frequency exposure and cultured in the N-sufficient medium. The sound frequency of 200 Hz was found to promote biomass concentration and cell division up to 50% compared to control. Interestingly, the frequency of 200 Hz promoted growth when the nitrate concentration decreased by 75% in the culture medium. The simultaneous effect of audible sound frequency of 200 Hz and nitrate deficiency showed the amount of beta-carotene increased to 37% compared to control. In the absence of sound frequency, an increase of 18% in beta-carotene was observed. To the best of our knowledge, the frequency of 200 Hz is a good demonstration of the ability of sound stimuli to improve the growth as well as a secondary metabolite of D.salina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDunaliella salina 3aacoustics 3abeta-carotene 3abiomass 3abotany 3acell division 3aculture media 3amicroalgae 3anitrates 3asecondary metabolites 0aSound frequency 0aBeta-carotene 0aDunaliella salina 0aNitrate deficiency1 aPajoum Shariati, Farshid1 aTavakoli, Omid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5332-94571 aAkbari, Zahra1 aRezaei, Mina0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 141 p.373-382dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245012200212300001800334506007600352520180000428592002802228506003702256650002202293650001702315650001902332650002302351650002002374650002202394650002402416650001302440650002202453650001702475650002002492650001702512650001202529700002802541700001602569700002002585700002502605773010302630856008502733852000902818655001202827IND60569796020221207125726.0170610e20170606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056979602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.7b002222doi7 aPMC54632722pmcid7 a285141402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Elizabeth10aProperties of Intermediates in the Catalytic Cycle of Oxalate Oxidoreductase and Its Suicide Inactivation by Pyruvate  ap. 2824-2835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxalate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OOR) is an unusual member of the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OFOR) family in that it catalyzes the coenzyme A (CoA)-independent conversion of oxalate into 2 equivalents of carbon dioxide. This reaction is surprising because binding of CoA to the acyl-TPP intermediate of other OFORs results in formation of a CoA ester, and in the case of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), CoA binding generates the central metabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA and promotes a 10⁵-fold acceleration of the rate of electron transfer. Here we describe kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational results to show that CoA has no effect on catalysis by OOR and describe the chemical rationale for why this cofactor is unnecessary in this enzymatic transformation. Our results demonstrate that, like PFOR, OOR binds pyruvate and catalyzes decarboxylation to form the same hydroxyethylidine–TPP (HE–TPP) intermediate and one-electron transfer to generate the HE–TPP radical. However, in OOR, this intermediate remains stranded at the active site as a covalent inhibitor. These and other results indicate that, like other OFOR family members, OOR generates an oxalate-derived adduct with TPP (oxalyl-TPP) that undergoes decarboxylation and one-electron transfer to form a radical intermediate remaining bound to TPP (dihydroxymethylidene–TPP). However, unlike in PFOR, where CoA binding drives formation of the product, in OOR, proton transfer and a conformational change in the “switch loop” alter the redox potential of the radical intermediate sufficiently to promote the transfer of an electron into the iron–sulfur cluster network, leading directly to a second decarboxylation and completing the catalytic cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aactive sites 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3adecarboxylation 3aelectron transfer 3aenzyme inactivation 3aoxalates 3apyruvate synthase 3apyruvic acid 3aredox potential 3aspectroscopy 3athiamin1 aMansoorabadi, Steven O.1 aCan, Mehmet1 aReed, George H.1 aRagsdale, Stephen W.0 tBiochemistry.g2017 June 06, v. 56, no. 22 p.2824-2835dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b002223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245013400128300001600262500001900278520146000297592002801757650000901785650002201794650002301816651001001839653002401849653002301873653004301896653001801939700001801957700001601975700001601991773016202007852000902169655001202178IND60710355320221119070836.0200908e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071035532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagdi, G.L.10aImpact of non-formal trainings regarding soil and water conservation technologies on farmers of mahi ravine area in Gujarat state  ap. 224-228.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe action research study on non-formal trainings to needy farmers was carried out during 2003 to 2006 in villages of Mahi ravine area under Anand and Baroda districts of Gujarat state with the objective to increase the knowledge and adoption behaviour towards Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) technologies for ravine reclamation. The pre-training status of farmers regarding knowledge, symbolic adoption and adoption was moderate, low and very low level, respectively. Under the study, Target Groups (TGs) of farmers were imparted non-formal trainings on ravine reclamation during 2003–2006 through the selected individual, group and mass contact extension training methods to impart knowledge, skills and motivate farmers about different ravine reclamation SWC technologies for promoting adoption. Consequently, farmers of Mahi ravine area initiated different soil and water conservation practices by their own efforts on their farms. The post-training status of farmers was also evaluated and it was found that the knowledge level of farmers regarding SWC technologies improved from moderate to high level; symbolic adoption increased from low to moderate level; and the actual adoption of soil and water conservation technologies also improved from very low to moderate level. The overall impact of the non-formal trainings on targeted farmers was measured quantitatively with the help of the Training Index (TI) and 30.1% improvement was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil 3asoil conservation 3awater conservation 3aIndia 0aNon-formal training 0aRavine reclamation 0aSoil and water conservation technology 0aTarget groups1 aKurothe, R.S.1 aSingh, H.B.1 aPande, V.C.0 tIndian journal of soil conservation.g2014 Aug., v. 42, no. 2 p.224-228dIndian Association of Soil and Water ConservationistswJournal:2072x0976-17217nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015500173300001600328520211400344592002802458650002202486650001602508650001402524650002402538650001902562650002102581650001002602650003502612650002002647650002802667650001202695650002202707650002802729650001802757650001602775650001702791650002302808650002702831650002202858650001802880650002302898650001102921650001202932650002702944650000902971650001202980650003202992650001303024653002203037653002303059653001003082653001103092653001203103653001803115700002603133700002903159700002803188700001803216700003803234773010903272856008203381852000903463655001203472IND60607880720221121135605.0180830e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060788072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2016.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Glaucia Carielo10aPassiflora edulis peel intake improves insulin sensitivity, increasing incretins and hypothalamic satietogenic neuropeptide in rats on a high-fat diet  ap. 863-870.  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of Passiflora edulis peel flour (PEPF) intake on hypothalamic neuropeptides messenger RNA expression, insulin sensitivity, and other metabolic parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet.Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in 3 groups: a control group, fed on a normal fat diet; a HF group, fed on a high-fat diet (35% fat [w/w]); and a high-fat Passiflora flour (HFPF) group, fed on a HF diet containing PEPF. The rats from the HFPF group as well as the HF group were kept on an HF diet for the first 4 wk to induce metabolic conditions related to obesity. Then the HFPF group was switched to a HF diet containing PEPF for additional 6 wk. Other groups were kept on normal-fat and HF diet without addition of PEPF during the whole period of experiment. The glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated through the glucose tolerance test (GTT) and the insulin tolerance test (ITT). Gut hormones and adipokines were measured through an immunoassay. The hypothalamic neuropeptides expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.The PEPF intake increased the hypothalamic cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript expression (CART) (P < 0.05), counteracted cumulative body weight gain (P < 0.001), decreased adiposity (P < 0.05) and leptin level (P < 0.01), whereas increased adiponectin (P < 0.01), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (P < 0.01), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (P < 0.001) improved the insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity rats by increasing the kITT (glucose disappearance rate) (P < 0.01), which was calculated during the ITT. Other gut hormones (peptide tyrosine tyrosine, pancreatic polypeptide, and amylin) and interleukins (IL) (IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) were not changed by the PEPF intake.Our findings provide a further understanding of how the PEPF works as a dietary component to improve glucose homeostasis and demonstrate a molecular mechanism that may increase satiety by PEPF in diet-induced obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPassiflora edulis 3aadiponectin 3aadiposity 3abody weight changes 3achemokine CCL2 3adigestive system 3aflour 3agastric inhibitory polypeptide 3agene expression 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglucose tolerance tests 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunoassays 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin tolerance test 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alaboratory animals 3aleptin 3aobesity 3apancreatic polypeptide 3arats 3asatiety 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3atyrosine 0aPassiflora edulis 0aInsulin resistance 0aGLP-1 0aPectin 0aObesity 0aNeuropeptides1 aVuolo, Milena Morandi1 aBatista, Ângela Giovana1 aDragano, Nathália R.V.1 aSolon, Carina1 aMaróstica Junior, Mário Roberto0 tNutrition.g2016 July,  Aug., v. 32, no. 7-8 p.863-870dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245012300128300001300251500001900264520158800283592002801871650001201899650002001911650002001931650000901951650001101960650001901971650001601990650001402006650001902020650001302039650003302052650000902085650002402094650002202118650001702140650001902157651001002176653001602186653004302202653002402245653002502269700002502294700001802319700001702337700001802354700002102372700001702393773015802410852000902568655001202577IND60710355420221119072418.0200908e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071035542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeka, Bipul10aAssessment of fertility potential for the soils of Northern Brahmaputra valley zone using Principal Component Analysis  ap. 1-11.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn attempt is made to model relationships of soil physical-chemical-hydraulic parameters of 50 rice-growing soils for fertility potential classification under 6 physiographic units of Northern Brahmaputra Valley Zone (NBVZ) of Assam. The physiographic units studied were Old Flood Plain (OFP), Lower Alluvial Plain (LAP), Upper Alluvial Plain (UAP) Lower Piedmont Plain (LPP), Upper Piedmont Plain (UPP) and Structural Hill (SH) soils. Relationships of 27 soil parameters were established using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCs identified are (i) Inherent Potentiality; (ii) Soil Loss; (iii) Nitrozinc; (iv) Cation Exchange; (v) Acidity; (vi) Copper; and (vii) Anionic factors which could explain 81% variability in soil parameters. Based on eigen vectors of PCs, component scores were determined for ranking soils and physiographic units. Dhullie (No. 32) soil ranked first for soil fertility, while OFP soils were most fertile. The ranking of soils was in agreement with analytical values of soil physical-chemical-hydraulic parameters. UPP soils had maximum values for CEC, acidity and anionic factors, compared to LPP soils for copper. The values were maximum for UAP for nitrozinc factor; LAP for soil loss factor; and SH for inherent potentiality. Among 27 soil parameters studied, silt, organic matter, CEC, manganese, field capacity, AWC and clay were found significant and contributed to the total variability.

This study examined associations between two diet quality indices and obesity risk in a nationally representative sample of Iranian adults and interactions by sex and area of residence. METHODS: Data on 18,307 adults (mean age 37 [SD 15.2] years) were used from the Iranian National Survey 2001–2003. Two diet quality indices (Healthy Eating Index 2015, HEI‐2015, and Diet Quality Index International, DQI‐I) were calculated from household 24‐h dietary recalls. Multi‐level regression analyses were used to examine the association between household diet quality and individual‐level obesity risk, with interaction terms for sex and area of residence. RESULTS: Higher household HEI‐2015 and DQI‐I were associated with higher risk of obesity (HEI‐2015: relative risk ratio: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.05; DQI‐I: relative risk ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.02), with stronger effect sizes in adults living in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality (HEI‐2015 and DQI‐I) was associated with higher obesity risk, which was stronger in adults living in rural areas. Due to the complexity of examining these associations in a Middle Eastern country undergoing a nutrition transition, longitudinal research is needed to confirm these findings.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPP1173803cNational Health and Medical Research Council Emerging Leadership Fellowship  aAPP1175250cNational Health and Medical Research Council Emerging Leadership Fellowship  aID102109cNational Heart Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship 3across-sectional studies 3afood quality 3anational surveys 3aobesity 3arelative risk1 aLeech, Rebecca M.1 aMcNaughton, Sarah A.1 aAbdollahi, Morteza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0310-20211 aHoushiarrad, Anahita1 aLivingstone, Katherine M.0 tObesity science & practice.g2022 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.12-20dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.5363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008500174300001600259520128400275592002801559650002101587650001701608650001701625650001601642650001801658650001301676650002701689650001701716650001101733650002401744650001301768650001001781650001701791650001501808650001001823650002001833650001801853653001801871653001601889653001101905653001501916653001701931653001301948653002001961700002301981773011702004856008302121852000902204655001202213IND60741529220221118103302.0210918e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074152922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgnacio, Islas-Flores10aResearch opportunities on the coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) using new technologies  ap. 414-420.  aA member of the Arecaceae family, coconut Cocos nucifera L. is cultivated in tropical regions worldwide. Humans have exploited the different structures of this palm for millennia. Although the trunk and leaves are used, mainly as construction material, by far the most valuable element is the fruit. It is the source of edible components such as coconut water, virgin coconut oil, copra, and coconut milk, as well as natural fiber (husk) and activated charcoal (nutshell). Today, all of them are at high demand in the international markets. Thus represent a commerce valued in ~11.5 billion dollars, and it is expected to reach ~31.1 billion by 2026. The global market of coconut derived products used in food applications must meet an increase stringent food quality and security parameters. Application of new technologies and research strategies such as metabolomics, proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics to coconut fruit is generating exciting data that will help improve management and marketing of this valuable crop. This in turn will lead to progressive genetic improvement of C. nucifera while allowing current producers to meet market demands. This review condenses the most outstanding current research on coconut fruit involving these technologies and approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acoconut meal 3acoconut milk 3acoconut oil 3acoconut water 3acoconuts 3aconstruction materials 3afood quality 3afruits 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3ahulls 3ametabolomics 3aproteomics 3atrade 3atranscriptomics 3aworld markets 0aCoconut fruit 0aFresh water 0aKernel 0aProteomics 0aMetabolomics 0aGenomics 0aTranscriptomics1 aMiguel, Tzec-Simá0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2021 Sept., v. 141 p.414-420dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002400164245006300188300001600251520165100267592002801918650001001946650002001956650001301976650001201989650002802001650001002029650001602039650001902055650002102074650002702095650001202122650002102134650002102155650002902176650001102205650002802216650002502244650002302269650006202292650005402354650001402408650001002422650004102432651001202473700002302485700002202508700001702530700002402547700002902571700002102600700002202621773013102643852000902774856008302783655001202866IND2047173320221119194242.0181016e199504  mou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204717332DNAL7 a76199062pmid7 a10.1177/1040638795007002112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradley, Gregory A.10aNeuroaxonal Degeneration in Sheep Grazing Sorghum Pastures  ap. 229-236.  aDuring the fall of 1992, 250 (10%) of 2,500 Rambouilet cross feeder lambs grazing Sorghum bicolor developed neurologic signs including weakness, ataxia, head shaking, knuckling of the fetlocks, inability to rise, and opisthotonos. One hundred fifteen (46%) of the affected lambs died. Twenty of the surviving lambs exhibited residual neurologic signs of ataxia when stressed. At the same time, 275 (25%) of 1,100 ewes grazing a nearby sudex pasture (S. sudanese × S. bicolor) gave birth to lambs that were weak and unable to rise. Newborn lambs exhibited extensor rigidity and opisthotonos when assisted to a standing position. The dystocias that occurred were due to lambs with contracted limbs (arthrogryposis). All affected lambs died or were euthanized. Histologic examination of the brains of 3 feeder lambs and 9 newborn lambs revealed similar microscopic lesions. The predominant change was the presence of focal axonal enlargements (spheroids) in the proximal segments of axons, which were restricted to the nuclei of the medulla, cerebellum, and midbrain. In addition, the spinal cord contained spheroids in the ventral horn gray matter of the 6 newborns examined. Ultrastructurally, the spheroids were composed of aggregates of neurofilaments, mitochondria, vesicular bodies, and dense bodies bounded by a thin myelin sheath. There was mild gliosis in the more severely affected animals of both groups. There was minimal Wallerian degeneration in the white matter adjacent to affected nuclei in the brain and the ventromedial and dorsolateral funiculi of the spinal cord. This is the first detailed report of Sorghum toxicity in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3alambs 3aSorghum bicolor 3atoxicity 3agrazing 3anervous system diseases 3abrain 3aspinal cord 3ahistopathology 3apoisonous plants 2aAnimal Feedxpoisoning 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aAxonsxpathology 2aEdible Grainxpoisoning. 2aFemale 2aMaternal-Fetal Exchange 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aNerve Degeneration 2aNervous System Diseasesxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPlant Poisoningxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aPregnancy 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxetiologyxpathology. 3aArizona1 aMetcalf, H.

Blood samples were collected at the three visits after 12 h of fasting. Fatty acid concentrations were determined using fast gas-liquid chromatography. Plasma adiponectin (μg/mL) and leptin (ng/dL) concentrations were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Statistical analyses included median adipokine concentrations according to the tertiles of fatty acid distribution and multiple linear mixed-effect models adjusted for body mass index, gestational age, total energy intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking.Women classified in the third SFA concentration tertile had lower median values of adiponectin compared with those in the first tertile ([first trimester: first tertile = 5.36; third tertile = 5.00]; [second trimester: first tertile = 6.39; third tertile = 4.47]; [third trimester: first tertile = 6.46; third tertile = 4.60]). Similar trends were observed for the 14:0, 16:0 and 18:0 fractions. In the multiple longitudinal models, total SFA (β = −41.039; P = 0.008) and 16:0 were negatively associated with plasma adiponectin (16:0, β = −0.511; P = 0.001). Total PUFA ω-6 (β = 28.961; P = 0.002) and 18:2 ω-6 (β = 0.259, P = 0.006) were positively associated with the adiponectin. Total SFA (β = 0.110, P = 0.007), 14:0 (β = 0.072, P = 0.011), and 20:3 ω-6 (β = 0.039; P = 0.035) were positively associated with plasma leptin.Total serum SFA and the 16:0 fraction were negatively associated with plasma adiponectin and positively associated with leptin concentrations. Total ω-6 PUFA was positively associated only with plasma adiponectin concentrations throughout pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aalcohol drinking 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aenergy intake 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3agestational age 3aleptin 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3astatistical analysis 0aAdiponectin 0aLeptin 0aFatty acids 0aPregnancy 0aCohort studies1 aFarias, Dayana Rodrigues1 aVaz, Juliana dos Santos1 ade Jesus Pereira Pinto, Thatiana1 ada Silva Lima, Natália1 aFreitas Vilela, Ana Amélia1 aCunha, Marcelo1 aFactor-Litvak, Pam1 aKac, Gilberto0 tNutrition.g2016 July,  Aug., v. 32, no. 7-8 p.740-747dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245005700165300002000222520098000242592002801222650001601250650001501266650001201281650002801293650001801321650002001339650001101359650001301370650001401383650001601397650001601413700002601429700002001455700002001475700002301495700005701518700005901575773013801634856008001772852000901852655001201861IND60627189520221118191541.0190128e20181113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062718952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b101672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbar, Juan D.10aAdsorption of Hexacontane on Hexagonal Boron Nitride  ap. 27575-27581.  aWe have investigated the adsorption of hexacontane (C₆₀H₁₂₂) on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The molecules can be deposited either by sublimation or from solution and form lamellar rows with dimensions of the order of 0.1–1 μm in three different rotational domains. High-resolution AFM images reveal that, similar to alkanes on graphite, the molecules are adsorbed parallel to the lattice vectors of hBN and we show using molecular mechanics that this corresponds to the lowest energy configuration. Lamellar rows with the same periodicity are observed even when several layers of hexacontane are deposited, although there is some orientational disorder in these multilayers. We also observe heat-induced modification of hexacontane, including recrystallization. We compare our results with recent X-ray studies of alkane adsorption on hBN and discuss the possible role of alkanes on steering molecular self-assembly on hBN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aadsorption 3aalkanes 3aatomic force microscopy 3aboron nitride 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amechanics 3aperiodicity 3asublimation1 aKorolkov, Vladimir V.1 aBaldoni, Matteo1 aWatanabe, Kenji1 aTaniguchi, Takashi1 aBesley, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9910-76031 aBeton, Peter H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2120-80330 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Nov. 13, v. 122, no. 48 p.27575-27581dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b101673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010100128300001400229500001900243520164800262592002801910650001601938650001601954650001601970650003001986650001702016650001802033650001002051650001402061650002202075650001302097650000902110650000902119650002202128650001002150653001202160653001402172653002202186653001502208653001302223700001602236700001602252700001602268700001702284700001502301773015902316852000902475655001202484IND60710355720221119070901.0200908e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071035572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, G.L.10aAssessment of productivity potential of some soils of Aravali hills based on parametric approach  ap. 28-39.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSix representative soil profiles were collected from different landform units of ER upland to assess land productivity index based on parametric approach. Soils, developed on different physiographic units viz., hill, pediments, valley, very gently sloping, nearly level plains were studied for their characterization, classification and potentiality evaluation. Morphologically soils showed considerable color variations with dominant hue of 10YR. The sand, silt and clay content in soils of ER upland ranged from 8.10 to 53.87%, 28.73 to 45.67% and 16.07 to 49.75%, respectively. The Bulk density showed increasing trend with the depth and varied from 1.43 to 1.68 Mg M. Soils on valley and plains were well developed as compared to those on hill and pediments. The soils are classified as lithic Ustorthents (P, and P₂), Typic Haplustepts (P₃, P₄ and P₅) and Typic Haplusterts (P₆). The productivity of hill and pediments soils was extremely poor for crop (1.57%), pasture (5.89%) and tree (0.12%). Agriculture productivity of valley, pediments and plains (P₃-29.43%, P₄-31.07%, P₅-27.62% and P₆-31.07%) was assessed as average. With adoption of improved package of practices like moisture conservation, addition of organic manures etc., the productivity class of these soils can be upgraded to good (from 50.40 to 53.87%). The potentiality of ER upland soils for crop, pasture and commercial crops production can be improved as indicated by coefficient of improvement (varied from 0.93 to 5.23%). The soils on Sawantgarh series (P₄) and Raitoda series (P₆) had the highest potentiality for crop and pasture production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaplustepts 3aHaplusterts 3aUstorthents 3aagricultural productivity 3abulk density 3aclay fraction 3acolor 3ahighlands 3aland productivity 3apastures 3asand 3asilt 3asoil conservation 3atrees 0aAravali 0aER upland 0aLand potentiality 0aTopography 0aTransect1 aSingh, R.S.1 aSingh, R.K.1 aMeena, H.R.1 aMeena, Suman1 aMina, B.L.0 tIndian journal of soil conservation.g2017 Apr., v. 45, no. 1 p.28-39dIndian Associations of Soil & Water ConservationistswJournal:2072x0976-17217nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245022000166300001600386520104600402592002801448650001501476650002901491650001601520650002801536650002001564650001701584650002201601650002001623650001601643650002501659650001901684650000701703650002101710650001101731650002401742650001601766653001501782653002601797653002501823653001301848653001901861653003101880700001701911700001501928700001601943700001601959700001301975700001901988700002002007700001702027773010602044856008702150852000902237655001202246IND60634414820221122032429.0190529e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063441482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fuhou10aFerulic acid esterase-producing lactic acid bacteria and cellulase pretreatments of corn stalk silage at two different temperatures: Ensiling characteristics, carbohydrates composition and enzymatic saccharification  ap. 211-221.  aThe effects of Acremonium cellulase and L. plantarum A1 with ferulic acid esterase activity on corn stalk silage fermentation characteristics, carbohydrate composition and enzymatic saccharification were studied at 25 and 40 °C, respectively. Corn stalk was ensiled without additive (C), Acremonium cellulase (AC), L. plantarum A1 (Lp) and AC + Lp for 60 days. Pretreatment with Lp or AC + Lp promoted the better silage fermentation and the degradation of lignocellulose as indicated by high lactic acid and low pH and lignocellulose content compared to control silages at 25 °C. AC + Lp performed better in reducing lignocellulose and DM loss. In addition, Lp alone enhanced enzymatic saccharification of corn stalk silage. However, the influence of L. plantarum A1 on corn stalk silage was not obvious at 40 °C. Corn stalk ensiled with combined additive is a suitable pretreatment method for subsequent biofuel production at 25 °C, but addition of Acremonium cellulase alone at 40 °C may be a promising method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcremonium 3acarbohydrate composition 3acorn stover 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3aferulic acid 3aferuloyl esterase 3afuel production 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3alignocellulose 3apH 3asaccharification 3asilage 3asilage fermentation 3atemperature 0aCorn stalk 0aFerulic acid esterase 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aEnsiling 0aLignocellulose 0aEnzymatic saccharification1 aDing, Zitong1 aKe, Wencan1 aXu, Dongmei1 aZhang, Ping1 aBai, Jie1 aMudassar, Shah1 aMuhammad, Ishaq1 aGuo, Xusheng0 tBioresource technology.g2019 June, v. 282 p.211-221dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04021naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245014500198300001400343500002000357520186700377592002802244596002302272596005302295596004402348596001802392596000902410596001402419596006002433650001902493650002202512650002002534650001402554650001002568650001002578650001902588650001702607650002302624650003002647650001502677650001602692650002302708650004302731650001202774700006602786700006702852700001702919700001902936700002702955700002502982700002703007700002203034700002103056700002703077700001903104700005803123773012003181856007303301852000903374655001203383IND60789474520221117222832.0220820e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078947452DNAL7 a10.1002/osp4.5452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakker, Guido J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2819-939510aFecal microbiota transplantation does not alter bacterial translocation and visceral adipose tissue inflammation in individuals with obesity  ap. 56-65.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Visceral adipose tissue inflammation is a fundamental mechanism of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Translocation of intestinal bacteria has been suggested as a driving factor for the inflammation. However, although bacterial DNA was detected in visceral adipose tissue of humans with obesity, it is unclear to what extent this is contamination or whether the gut microbiota is causally involved. Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on bacterial translocation and visceral adipose tissue inflammation in individuals with obesity and insulin resistance were assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight individuals with clinically severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] >35 kg/m²) and metabolic syndrome received lean donor FMT 4 weeks prior to elective bariatric surgery. The participants were age‐, sex‐, and BMI‐matched to 16 controls that underwent no fecal transplantation. Visceral adipose tissue was collected during surgery. Bacterial translocation was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of adipose tissue and feces. Pro‐inflammatory cytokine expression and histopathological analyses of visceral adipose tissue were performed to assess inflammation. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota transplantation significantly altered gut microbiota composition. Visceral adipose tissue contained a very low quantity of bacterial DNA in both groups. No difference in visceral bacterial DNA content between groups was observed. Also, visceral expression of pro‐inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration did not differ between groups. No correlation between inflammatory tone and bacterial translocation was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Visceral bacterial DNA content and level of inflammation were not altered upon FMT. Thus, bacterial translocation may not be the main driver of visceral adipose tissue inflammation in obesity.  aPublisher supplied data  a016.146.327cZonMw  a708193cH2020 Marie SkÅ,odowska‐Curie Actions  a2015.81.1840cDutch Diabetes Foundation  cHartstichting  cICAR  cICaR‐VU  cDutch Heart Foundation, Grant/Award Number:2015.81.1840 3aadipose tissue 3abariatric surgery 3abody mass index 3acytokines 3afeces 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amacrophages 3ametabolic syndrome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity1 aMeijnikman, Abraham S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8653-65911 aScheithauer, Torsten P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1446-31801 aDavids, Mark1 aAydin, Ömrüm1 aBoerlage, Thomas C.

The gel capillaries were prepared in a fused silica capillary modified with 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethacrylate using a variety of the PEG-based hydrogels. After the fundamental evaluations in CGE regarding the separation based on the molecular size effect depending on the crosslinking density, the optimized capillary provided the efficient separation of glucose ladder (G1 to G20). In addition, another capillary showed the successful separation of DNA ladder in the range of 10–1100 base pair, which is superior to an authentic acrylamide-based gel capillary. For both glucose and DNA ladders, the separation ranges against the molecular size were simply controllable by alteration of the concentration and/or units of ethylene oxide in the PEG-based crosslinker. Finally, we demonstrated the separations of real samples, which included sugars carved out from monoclonal antibodies, mAbs, and then the efficient separations based on the molecular size effect were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achromatography 3acrosslinking 3aethylene glycol 3aethylene oxide 3agel electrophoresis 3aglucose 3ahydrogels 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilica 0aCapillary gel electrophoresis 0aPoly(ethylene glycol) 0aMolecular size 0aCrosslinking density 0aBiomolecules1 aNishimura, Naoki1 aFuruta, Hayato1 aKubota, Kei1 aNaito, Toyohiro1 aŌtsuka, Kōji,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 1523 p.107-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245013800168520153100306592002801837650001401865650001401879650001501893650001601908650001001924650001501934650001901949650001101968650001701979650001601996650002002012700002802032700002602060700002602086773012102112856007402233852000902307655001202316IND60742659720221119212457.0210624e20210531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074265972DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130618872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkiewicz, Lidia Hanna10aPhytate and Butyrate Differently Influence the Proliferation, Apoptosis and Survival Pathways in Human Cancer and Healthy Colonocytes  aThe colonic epithelium is never exposed to a single factor, therefore studies on the effect of combinations of factors naturally and persistently present in the intestines are of special importance for understanding the phenomena occurring at this place. The aim of the study was to investigate the combined effect of 1 mM phytate and 1 mM butyrate (PA1B1) on cell lines derived from cancer (HCT116 and HT-29) and healthy (NCM460D) human colonic epithelium. Colorimetric and flow cytometry methods were used to determine the proliferation rate, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Selected markers of proliferation, inflammatory, and survival pathways were investigated at the mRNA and/or protein level. The combination of phytate and butyrate disturbed the cell cycle and triggered apoptosis and/or death in both studied cancer colonocytes to a higher extent compared to healthy colonocytes. Moreover, in healthy colonocytes, phytate activated the survival pathway without stimulation of inflammatory response. This may indicate that the response of healthy colonocytes to phytate protects colonic epithelium from the loss of integrity and tightness that would occur if inflammation developed. Based on the obtained results we postulate that studies on both cancer and/or healthy colonocytes should be carried out in the presence of butyrate as the permanent component of colonic contents. This should be of special importance when anti-proliferative/pro-apoptotic activity or inflammatory status of colonocytes is to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abutyrates 3acell cycle 3acolorimetry 3adeath 3aepithelium 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aphytic acid 3aprotein content1 aOgrodowczyk, Anna Maria1 aWiczkowski, Wiesław 1 aWróblewska, Barbara 0 tNutrients.g2021 May 31, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130618873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010600131300001400237500001900251520181600270592002802086650001102114650001202125650001102137650002302148650001502171650002402186650002202210650002802232650002302260650001002283651001002293653002402303653002902327653002802356653002902384653002802413700001702441700001902458700001502477700001802492700001802510700001702528700001602545773015902561852000902720655001202729IND60710355820221119070919.0200908e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071035582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ambrish10aDesign and development of gravity flow water conveyance system for irrigation in Himalayan foot hills  ap. 40-44.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncreasing demand of water for industrial, domestic and power sectors necessitates urgent need for development of water saving technologies to ensure accessibility of water to every field (Har khet kopant) through following the approach-"per drop more crop " in agriculture. Efficient water management in agriculture is the major challenge to ensure sustainable food production in India. While, the situation is more aggravating in mostly rainfed type of farming in hill and mountains. Low productivity and cropping intensity, subsistence level of farming is attributed to poor water resource development in the hilly areas. To enhance the productivity and livelihood in the Himalayan foothills, a participatory gravity-flow Irrigation System has been developed with major emphasis on the participation of beneficiary farmers in all activities starting from surveying, planning, implementation, monitoring and operation of the system. In this endeavor, 1830 m GI pipeline (100 mm diameter) from source to Distribution Tank (DT) as a water conveyance and 1500 m PVC pipeline (110 mm) as a water distribution are laid out in the command area (26.28 ha) in the adopted villages-Pasauli and Devthala of Dehradun district in Uttarakhand. The conveyance efficiency was recorded >95% of the system starting from source to remotest riser in the command area. Discharge of randomly selected risers were taken in 2016 and found a 10–16% variation between designed (estimated) and observed data. Check basin border size for efficient irrigation were optimized using SIRMOD. Productivity of major crops increased by 48% with enhanced cropping intensity by 29% due to intervening crop of Toria in between Maize-Wheat sequence.

The aim of this study was to illustrate the effects on consumption of two anabolic protein supplements on body weight and structure and function of hepatocytes in male albino Wistar rats.We assigned male Wistar albino rats into three groups (n = 10 each): control, hyperwhey protein (Nutrabolics, Richmond, Canada) (2.5 g/kg body weight), and super amino 2500 (SA) (APN, Ft. Launderale, FL, USA) (2.5 g/kg body weight). The applied dose was orally administered daily in tap water for 14 wk. Body weight was regularly measured. At 14 wk, animals were sacrificed and dissected. Blood was collected from a puncture of the heart and the liver was removed and weighed. Biochemical analysis of liver function tests, lipidogram, hematology, histopathology, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, B-cell lymphoma 2 and 70 kd heat shock proteins, and flow-cytometry of hepatocyte cell cycle were performed.Hyperwhey- and SA-supplemented rats had lower body weight gain compared with the control group and developed hepatic dysfunction manifested by apparent congestion of blood vessel, increased apoptosis, and breakdown of hepatocytes. The SA group had thickening of the liver capsule and more drastic damage of hepatocytes. The level of transaminases was markedly increased. Insulin level was also markedly decreased in parallel with increase cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triacylglycerols.Hyperwhey and SA protein formula administration dramatically altered the liver function and increased hepatic damage similar to the development of suspected diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aalbino 3aapoptosis 3aathletes 3ablood 3ablood vessels 3abody weight changes 3acell cycle 3acholesterol 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3aflow cytometry 3aheart 3aheat shock proteins 3ahematology 3ahepatocytes 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin 3alaboratory animals 3aliver 3aliver function 3aliver function tests 3alow density lipoprotein 3amales 3amuscles 3aoral administration 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aprotein supplements 3arats 3atap water 3atissues 3atransaminases 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aCanada 0aAnabolic body-building protein 0aHepatitis 0aTransaminases 0aBlood picture 0aBiochemistry 0aHistopathology 0aImmunohistochemistry 0aTransmission electron microscopy1 aEl-Sayyad, Hassan I.H.1 aMoftah, Osama A.1 aChilibeck, Phil D.0 tNutrition.g2016 July,  Aug., v. 32, no. 7-8 p.840-848dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245017100131300001400302500001900316520161900335592002801954650001901982650001702001650001102018650001802029650001802047650002402065650002102089650002102110650002202131650001002153653003202163653002302195653003102218653002402249653002302273653002802296700001402324700001602338773015902354852000902513655001202522IND60710355920221119070832.0200908e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071035592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazumdar, S.P.10aSoil aggregation and distribution of carbon in a sandy loam soil of Trans Gangetic plains under integrated nutrient management practices in rice-wheat cropping system  ap. 45-51.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of different integrated nutrient management practices on soil aggregation, bulk density and aggregate associated carbon after 26 years of rice-wheat cropping system on a sandy loam soil of Ludhiana were studied. The total Water Stable Aggregates (WSA) at wheat harvest ranged between 78.6 and 85.8% under different treatments. Application of NPK either through inorganic fertilizers or through combination of inorganic fertilizers and organics such as Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or Crop Residue (CR), or Green Manure (GM) significantly increased the amount of water stable aggregates, aggregate ratio, Mean Weight Diameter (MWD) and Geometric Mean Diameter (GMD). The macro-aggregates comprised 35.3 to 48.9% of the total WSA compared to 36.5 to 43.3% as micro-aggregates. The amount of macro-aggregates was lowest in the control plot and it was higher in the plots treated with organics. Application of FYM, CR and GM significantly improved the formation of macro-aggregates as compared to control. The proportion of micro-aggregates decreased with the application of organics. Among the macro-aggregates, the 0.25–0.50 mm fraction constituted the greatest proportion (17–21.6%). Plots receiving FYM showed the highest MWD (0.56 mm) and the control plots had the lowest MWD (0.43 mm). Meagre variation was observed in all the structural indices among the organically amended treatments. Carbon concentration was higher in macro-aggregates as compared to micro-aggregates and application of organics resulted in the greatest increase in C concentration in various aggregate size fractions over control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acrop residues 3agreen manures 3anutrient management 3asandy loam soils 3asoil aggregation 3asoil conservation 3awheat 0aAggregate associated carbon 0aOrganic amendments 0aRice-wheat cropping system 0aSoil organic carbon 0aStructural indices 0aWater stable aggregates1 aGhosh, D.1 aNayak, A.K.0 tIndian journal of soil conservation.g2017 Apr., v. 45, no. 1 p.45-51dIndian Associations of Soil & Water ConservationistswJournal:2072x0976-17217nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013300174520176400307592002802071650003602099650002102135650001402156650002202170650001902192650000902211650001502220650002102235650001602256650001402272650001002286651001002296653002202306653001402328653002502342653000802367653001402375653001602389653001002405700005702415700003002472700001902502700002202521700006102543700002802604700002002632773009902652856008502751852000902836655001202845IND60741529520221118103304.0210729e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074152952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1057172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGangwar, Om Prakash10aVirulence and molecular diversity among Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes identified in India between 2015 and 2019  aYellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is economically one of the most important diseases of wheat in India and worldwide. During four wheat-growing seasons (2015-19), a total of 951 yellow rust samples collected from farmers’ fields (n = 602) and trap plot nurseries (n = 349) were analyzed for virulence on 30 differentials. From this analysis, 11 distinct Pst pathotypes were identified. The virulence pattern of these pathotypes was also tested on 14 Avocet near-isogenic lines (NILs) and Avocet S. None of the pathotypes were virulent to Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, Yr16, Yr24, Yr32, and YrSP. Pathotype 46S119 (46E159) was most prevalent and widely distributed in all the areas and its overall frequency was maximum (56.2%) followed by 110S119 (110E159, 31.9%). However, the frequency of 46S119 has decreased gradually from 62.0% (2015-16) to 48.4% (2018-19). Pathotype 238S119 (238E159) being the most virulent among the identified pathotypes, was detected in 6.8% of samples. Each of the remaining pathotypes was identified in <5% of the samples. Genetic diversity among eleven pathotypes was assessed using novel 89 SSR primer-pairs out of which 24 primers showed polymorphism. Finally, 69 alleles were detected across the loci with an average of 2.87 alleles per locus. Polymorphic information content (PIC) value was in the range from 0.28 to 0.68, with a mean of 0.47. Expected heterozygosity was in the 0.34 to 0.73 range, with a mean of 0.56. Cluster analysis based on both avirulence/virulence pattern and SSR profile categorized the identified pathotypes into two major clades. Generated information will potentially be helpful in rust resistance breeding and deployment of resistant cultivars in yellow rust-prone areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia striiformis f. tritici 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3apathotypes 3aplant protection 3astripe rust 3avirulence 3awheat 3aIndia 0aGenetic diversity 0aPathotype 0aPuccinia striiformis 0aSSR 0aVirulence 0aStripe rust 0aWheat1 aKumar, Subodh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1680-80821 aChander Bhardwaj, Subhash1 aPrasad, Pramod1 aKashyap, Prem Lal1 aKhāna, Hānipha,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4615-207X1 aSingh, Gyanendra Pratap1 aSavadi, Siddana0 tCrop protection.g2021 Oct., v. 148 p.105717-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1057173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006000170300001600230520093300246592002801179650002301207650002201230650002001252650001301272653000801285653000801293653000801301653000901309653002301318653002601341653003801367653004401405653002601449653004501475700001801520773011201538856008501650852000901735655001201744IND60602795420221122205947.0180711e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060279542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaohong10aSieve semiparametric two-step GMM under weak dependence  ap. 163-186.  aThis paper considers semiparametric two-step GMM estimation and inference with weakly dependent data, where unknown nuisance functions are estimated via sieve extremum estimation in the first step. We show that although the asymptotic variance of the second-step GMM estimator may not have a closed form expression, it can be well approximated by sieve variances that have simple closed form expressions. We present consistent or robust variance estimation, Wald tests and Hansen’s (1982) over-identification tests for the second step GMM that properly reflect the first-step estimated functions and the weak dependence of the data. Our sieve semiparametric two-step GMM inference procedures are shown to be numerically equivalent to the ones computed as if the first step were parametric. A new consistent random-perturbation estimator of the derivative of the expectation of the non-smooth moment function is also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3avariance 0aC12 0aC22 0aC32 0aC140 0aSieve two-step GMM 0aWeakly dependent data 0aAuto-correlation robust inference 0aSemiparametric over-identification test 0aNumerical equivalence 0aRandom perturbation derivative estimator1 aLiao, Zhipeng0 tJournal of econometrics.g2015 Nov., v. 189, no. 1 p.163-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2015.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03697naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015100208300001800359520187700377592002802254596008102282596008302363650001302446650001002459650001902469650002202488650001202510650001602522650001202538650001802550650001602568650001802584650004102602650001902643650002102662650002702683650002202710650001302732650002602745650002502771700002402796700002702820700003102847700002002878700002802898700002002926773013002946856008203076852000903158655001203167IND60678046320221119124544.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067804632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01864-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Levi P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6035-851X10aEffects of bromide-enriched natural seawater culture medium on protein and monoterpenes output of Ochtodes secundiramea (Rhodophyta, Gigartinales)  ap. 3831-3839.  aBenthic marine algae, especially Rhodophyta, are within a well-known marine group able to produce secondary metabolites with bioactive properties. Among them are halogenated terpenes, synthesized by vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase (V-BPO). The red alga Ochtodes secundiramea (Montagne) M. Howe produces high amounts of halogenated monoterpenes (HMT) which have the potential to control phytopathogenic fungi. Culture closed a system is a tool used to manipulate conditions to increase the synthesis of HMT and other metabolites. The apical segments of O. secundiramea were cultivated in a bioreactor, either in seawater enriched with half strength von Stosch’s solution (VSES/2) without (control) and with the addition of 250 mg L⁻¹ bromine (treatment). In response to these conditions, specific growth rate, HMT profile, soluble protein, phycobiliproteins, soluble carbohydrate, and chlorophyll as well as the V-BPO activity, uptake, and accumulated bromine within the biomass were evaluated. The treatment did not promote significant alterations in the growth but increased the V-BPO activity and bromine uptake and incorporation (2.5 fold). No changes in the HMT profiles of the extracts from both cultures conditions were observed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses, whereas the values of total soluble protein and phycobiliproteins were 2-fold higher in samples from the bromine-enriched medium when compared to samples from control. These results support the evidences of protective effects promoted by V-BPO activity. Furthermore, carbohydrate and chlorophyll contents were not affected by experimental conditions. These results provided new low-cost strategies that can be applied to increase of certain biomass components, which here are algal proteins, especially in Rhodophyta-based biotechnological industries for food and agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data  aFAPESP2010/14893-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a308879/2013-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aOchtodes 3aalgae 3aalgal proteins 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3abromine 3acarbohydrates 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amonoterpenoids 3aphycobiliprotein 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aprotective effect 3aseawater 3asecondary metabolites 3aspecific growth rate1 aStefanello, Eliezer1 aAndreghetti, Daniel X.1 aZambotti-Villela, Leonardo1 aColepicolo, Pio1 ade Carvalho, Luciana R.1 aYokoya, Nair S.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.3831-3839dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01864-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010900157300001800266500001900284520097000303592002801273650001501301650001101316650001401327650001701341650002401358650001001382650001101392650001901403650001301422700001501435700001601450700001701466773014101483856007401624852000901698655001201707IND60695960620221118034855.0200520e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069596062DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta02833a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongxia10aHydrogen generation from toxic formaldehyde catalyzed by low-cost Pd–Sn alloys driven by visible light  ap. 9616-9628.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNoble metal co-catalysts are efficient for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from formaldehyde, but their high cost and low abundance limit their scale-up applications. Alloying a second metal with noble metals offers an available way to decrease their usage and consumption and enhances their catalytic activity. Among the potential candidates, Sn is a high abundance element in the earth. In this work, a new highly active low-cost Pd–Sn/RGO catalyst has been developed. Under optimized conditions, the hydrogen evolution rate reached up to 530.07 μmol h⁻¹ driven by visible light. By taking advantage of the optimized adsorption nature of the active sites on the alloy cocatalyst, effective separation and transfer of photogenerated charges have been achieved; at the same time, the photo-generated electrons have a longer lifetime. More interestingly, it has been found that trace amounts of oxygen are helpful in catalytic hydrogen production from HCHO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrogen production 3alight 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3atoxicity1 aWang, Meng1 aMa, Jiantai1 aLu, Gongxuan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 May 19, v. 8, no. 19 p.9616-9628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta02833a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007800168300001400246520169200260592002801952650000801980650002001988650000802008650001002016650002402026650001402050650003002064650001402094653002302108653001502131653001502146653001802161653001502179773012302194856008102317852000902398655001202407IND60689694120221121033125.0200423e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068969412DNAL7 a10.1080/104084105909217362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCall, Douglas R.10aChallenges and Opportunities for Pathogen Detection Using DNA Microarrays  ap. 91-99.  aDNA microarrays offer the potential for simultaneous detection of many pathogens that are of interest to homeland security, public health, medicine, and veterinary diagnostics. These tools are best suited for detecting the presence or absence of genetic sequences characteristic of specific pathogens, but microarrays are poorly suited for determining pathogen viability, and current methods provide only limited potential for pathogen enumeration. Two basic strategies have been described for pathogen detection: using enzymatic amplification to generate targets for interrogation with a microarray, or using direct interrogation of DNA or RNA without pre-amplification. Multiplex PCR has the advantage of a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, but associated microarrays are necessarily limited in scope. PCR-independent, whole-genome amplification eliminates biases inherent in PCR amplification and can accommodate more extensive microarrays, but assay sensitivity is compromised and these methods are probably of limited use when testing tissue samples. Direct hybridization of DNA or RNA provides the least bias in gene detection, but also the lowest level of analytic sensitivity. Ultimately, cost and limited sample throughput make it unlikely that planar microarrays will play a significant role in future pathogen detection schemes. Alternative microarray formats such as bead arrays, however, may circumvent the cost and throughput limitations and permit us to apply what we have learned from planar microarrays to develop robust pathogen detection systems. Assay validation and sample preparation will continue to be significant challenges for these detection systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA microarrays 3aRNA 3agenes 3amicrobial detection 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviability 0aPathogen Detection 0aMicroarray 0aBead Array 0aHybridization 0aValidation0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2005 Jan. 1, v. 31, no. 2 p.91-99dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104084105909217363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010100158300001800259520166300277592002801940650001401968650001701982650002501999650001202024650001102036650001402047650002102061650001302082650001702095700001602112700001302128700001902141700001802160700001602178700001202194700001702206700001802223700001902241700001902260700001702279700001602296773014302312856007502455852000902530655001202539IND60791841620221120085328.0220901e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079184162DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb01334g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCen, Qingyuan10aGlycine assists in efficient synthesis of herbal carbon dots with enhanced yield and performance  ap. 6433-6442.  aAs a special type of biomass, herbal medicine often contains a variety of biologically active substances, and taking it as a carbon source, it is expected to produce various types of biologically functional carbon dots (CDs). However, there are few reports in this field, especially in achieving enhanced performance of CDs by improving the utilization efficiency of active substances in medicinal materials. In this work, by adding glycine as an auxiliary agent in the preparation of CDs from herbal medicine (Exocarpium Citri Grandis), the carboxyl and amino groups of the adjuvant provided more reactive sites, which greatly improved the yield of CDs (about 6 times). More importantly, the antioxidant and biological activities of herbal CDs were also improved. By controlling the functional groups of adjuvants, the effects of carboxyl and amino groups in adjuvants on the synthesis of herbal CDs were compared. The results reveal that both carboxyl and amino groups can react with the substances in the carbon source, and the influence of amino groups was greater. After adding glycine, the size of the CDs became larger, resulting from the more abundant functional groups on the carbon skeleton, which was the main reason for the improved performance of the CDs. Finally, the biological activity experiment demonstrated that CDs derived from Exocarpium Citri Grandis and glycine could greatly enhance the vitality of cells and activate immune cells, which are expected to be applied in the field of cell reproduction and biological immunity. The method proposed in this work provides a potential strategy for high-yield preparation of CDs from biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achemistry 3aherbal medicines 3aimmunity 3areproduction1 aFu, Fangmei1 aXu, Hong1 aLuo, Lianxiang1 aHuang, Fanfan1 aXiang, Jing1 aLi, Wei1 aPan, Xiaoqin1 aZhang, Haoran1 aZheng, Mingtao1 aZheng, Yinjian1 aLi, Qingming1 aLei, Bingfu0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 10, no. 34 p.6433-6442dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb01334g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015200169520177300321592002802094650002402122650001302146650002902159650001702188650001402205650003802219650001602257650001202273650001602285650003302301650001502334650002102349650002502370653002102395653002802416653002602444653001502470653001602485653001502501700005802516700001902574700005702593773009502650856008302745852000902828655001202837IND60744013520221120165434.0220228e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074401352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasouli, Yasaman10aFabrication of anti-Listeria film based on bacterial cellulose and Lactobacillus sakei-derived bioactive metabolites; application in meat packaging  aMore recently, probiotics-derived bioactive metabolites (so-called postbiotics; P) have gained more attention for antimicrobial food packaging. In this study, anti-Listeria active packaging films containing bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) and postbiotics of Lactobacillus sakei were fabricated, and their antibacterial performance was examined in in vitro condition and patty of buffalo meat. To facilitate postbiotics incorporation, ultrasound-assisted coating (UC, 40-kHz) and common coating (CC) were applied. The concentration of postbiotics and coating time were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design, and the antimicrobial activity of films was assessed by the disk diffusion method. The FTIR, mechanical, and surface morphologies of BNC-CC-P and BNC-UC-P films in optimized conditions (17 and 30% of postbiotics and 10 min coating time) were investigated. Based on the FTIR and SEM data, UC facilitated postbiotics incorporation into BNC, while tensile strength and elongation at break of BNC-CC-P and BNC-UC-P films were decreased and increased, respectively. Even though Listeria counts in patties with BNC film followed a similar trend with control samples without film and passed 10⁷ CFU/g, samples wrapped with BNC-CC-P and BNC-UC-P films represented a 2.3 and 2.6 log CFU/g reduction in the bacterial count during storage (9 days at 8 °C), respectively. The findings of this work have provided worthwhile insights into the use of postbiotics in antimicrobial meat packaging for the control of foodborne pathogens. Ultrasound-assisted coating facilitated the rapid release of postbiotics from BNC into the meat matrix, signifying the importance of such a film for the packaging of foods having a short shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aListeria 3aantimicrobial properties 3abuffalo meat 3acellulose 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3ametabolites 3apatties 3aplate count 3aresponse surface methodology 3ashelf life 3atensile strength 3aultrasonic treatment 0aActive packaging 0aBacterial nanocellulose 0aCell-free supernatant 0aProbiotics 0aFood safety 0aSonication1 aMoradi, Mehran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6004-68741 aTajik, Hossein1 aMolaei, Rahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0107-11640 tFood bioscience.g2021 Aug., v. 42 p.101218-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010300165300001600268520141200284592002801696650001801724650001301742650001101755650001801766650001801784650001701802650001101819650003301830653001901863653002501882653001101907653001901918653002001937700002001957700002001977700002401997700002202021773012502043856008302168852000902251655001202260IND60622623120221120165649.0210121e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062262312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.11.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Weiping10aSandwich layering in binary nanoparticle films and effect of size ratio on stratification behavior  ap. 209-217.  aStratification or self-segregation of multicomponent particle mixtures during drying is an important phenomenon to understand for the development of single-step deposition processes for complex coatings. We hypothesize that varying the ratio of particle Peclet numbers will lead to different types of stratification behavior.Binary colloidal films of polystyrene and silica were prepared by evaporative film formation, and stratification of nanoparticles of different size ratio (7.7–1.2) was studied using microbeam small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).SAXS spectra showed noticeable variations at different film depths, consistent with stratification. These results are quantified to obtain vertical composition profiles. We observe “sandwich”-type layered structures at different nanoparticle size ratios, which to our knowledge have not been previously observed experimentally or predicted by theory. For example, for films of larger particle size ratios (7.7–4.8), large particles are enriched at the film top and bottom, leading to a large-small-large or “LSL” behavior; while within films of smaller particle size ratio (2.2–1.2), small particles are enriched at the top and bottom of the film (small-large-small or “SLS” structures). The enrichment of particles at the top persists over several hundred particle layers and is not just a single monolayer pinned to the upper surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeclet number 3acoatings 3adrying 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolystyrenes 3asilica 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 0aFilm formation 0aEvaporative assembly 0aDrying 0aStratification 0aColloidal films1 aCarr, Amanda J.1 aYager, Kevin G.1 aRouth, Alexander F.1 aBhatia, Surita R.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 538 p.209-217dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.11.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245013100172300001400303520117400317592002801491650000801519650002501527650001001552650002001562650001001582650001101592650002001603650001101623650001601634650000901650650001101659650001101670650001701681653004101698653002901739653002101768653002201789653002801811653001701839700001901856700002101875700001701896700002001913700001601933700001401949700001801963700001301981700002101994773007602015856009002091852000902181655001202190IND60570595820221122183203.0170708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057059582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lu-Lu10aTumor-selective lipopolyplex encapsulated small active RNA hampers colorectal cancer growth in vitro and in orthotopic murine  ap. 13-28.  aSmall active RNA (saRNA)-induced gene activation (RNAa) is a novel strategy to treat cancer. Our previous work proved that the p21-saRNA-322 successfully hindered colorectal cancer growth by activating p21 gene. However, the barrier for successful saRNA therapy is lack of efficient drug delivery. In the present study, a rectal delivery system entitled p21-saRNA-322 encapsulated tumor-selective lipopolyplex (TSLPP-p21-saRNA-322) which consist of PEI/p21-saRNA-322 polyplex core and hyaluronan (HA) modulated lipid shell was developed to treat colorectal cancer. Our results showed that this system maintained at the rectum for more than 6 h and preferentially accumulated at tumor site. CD44 knock down experiment instructed that the superb cellular uptake of TSLPP-p21-saRNA-322 attributed to HA-CD44 recognition. An orthotopic model of bio-luminescence human colorectal cancer in mice was developed using microsurgery and TSLPP-p21-saRNA-322 demonstrated a superior antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo.

It replaced and simplified the former government‐funded national evaluation programmes in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The programme includes testing of all cool‐season grasses on lawn/fairways at 15–20 mm mowing height (“lawn trials”) and optional testing of Poa pratensis L. and Lolium perenne L. on simulated football pitches with wear, mowed at 30 mm (“wear trials”). Since 2013, the program has regarded the Nordic countries as one trial zone with three test sites: Tystofte Denmark (55°15′ N, 11°20′ E), Landvik, Norway (58°21’ N, 8°32’ E) and Ylistaro, Finland (62°57′ N, 22°31’ E). Wear trials are carried out at the intermediate location Landvik only. Candidate varieties are tested against two reference varieties of the same species or subspecies. In the lawn trials, candidate varieties are evaluated for visual merit (overall turfgrass quality), winter damage, winter color, diseases and daily height growth at all three locations and for tiller density, fineness of leaves, in‐season (genetic) color, at Landvik only. Based on the results from the SCANTURF trials in 2014–2016 and 2016–2018, the candidate varieties Fabian, Tetrastar, Annecy, and Monroe (Lolium perenne), Becca, Harmonie, Traction, and Markus (Poa pratensis) and Lystig, Greenmile, and Humboldt (Festuca rubra ssp. commutata) were recommended for lawns in the Nordic countries, while Eurocordus, Columbine, Monroe, and Annecy (Lolium perenne) and Harmonie (Poa pratensis) were recommended for sports grounds. More use of the recommended varieties will have a positive effect on quality of lawns and sport grounds in the Nordic countries. Less winter injury and increasing relative performance with increasing latitude of the tetraploid perennial ryegrass variety Fabian in the lawn trials may possibly lead to more use of perennial ryegrass in the northern and more continental parts of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa pratensis 3acold season 3acolor 3afineness 3alatitude 3alawns and turf 3aresearch 3asports 3atetraploidy 3aturf grasses 3aDenmark 3aFinland 3aNorway 3aScandinavia 3aSweden1 aNiskanen, Markku1 aLarsen, Anders S.1 aAamlid, Trygve S.0 tInternational Turfgrass Society research journal.g2022 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.597-609dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27673x2573-15137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/its2.303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015500166300001600321520145200337592002801789650001401817650002301831650001501854650001901869650001501888650001501903650001801918650001301936650001701949653002501966653002901991653003002020653001402050700001902064700001202083700001802095700001602113700002002129700001202149773012502161856008302286852000902369655001202378IND60622623220221120181235.0210121e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062262322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.11.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianwei10aGravity-driven catalytic nanofibrous membrane with microsphere and nanofiber coordinated structure for ultrafast continuous reduction of 4-nitrophenol  ap. 108-115.  aSilver loaded nanofibrous membrane with high catalytic performance for 4-nitrophenol under continuous gravity-driven filtration was developed in this study. A polydopamine (PDA) microsphere and nanofiber coordinated composite structure was fabricated through an in situ PDA synthesis to achieve a high catalyst loading and controllable residence time of 4-nitrophenol. The incorporated PDA microspheres played an important role for the enhancement of catalytic performance due to the increased surface area (23% increase compared with PAN and PAN-PDAs-Ag) and reduced membrane porosity. Silver loading amount and the residence time of 4-nitrophenol was increased by more than 108% (from 1.2 wt% to 2.5 wt%) and 45% (from 0.79 s to 1.15 s) when comparing with PAN-PDAc-Ag and PAN-PDAs-Ag nanofibrous membrane. The conversion rate of 4-nitrophenol in a gravity-driven filtration process was as high as 97% when PAN-PDAs-Ag nanofibrous membrane was used, which was much higher than the PAN-PDAc-Ag membrane (80%). In addition, the PAN-PDAs-Ag nanofibrous membrane exhibited excellent recycle performance, the conversion rate was maintained as high as 93% after five times of reuse. The microsphere and nanofiber coordinated structure with enhanced surface area and controllable residence time of contaminants proposed in this study might advance the real applications of electrospun nanofibrous membrane for catalytic removal of contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afiltration 3amicroparticles 3ananofibers 3ananosilver 3ap-nitrophenol 3aporosity 3asurface area 0aNanofibrous membrane 0aPolydopamine microsphere 0aGravity-driven filtration 0aCatalysis1 aPei, Xiaoqiang1 aLiu, Ge1 aBai, Jianfeng1 aDing, Yajie1 aWang, Jianqiang1 aLiu, Fu0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 538 p.108-115dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.11.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001300156245014100169300001400310520154200324592002801866650001401894650001701908650001601925650002001941650001601961650002901977650001802006650001902024650002202043650002802065650002802093653000802121653001402129653002502143653002502168653003102193700001502224700001802239700001302257773007602270856009002346852000902436655001202445IND60570595920221122183142.0170708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057059592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Na10aNIR-triggered high-efficient photodynamic and chemo-cascade therapy using caspase-3 responsive functionalized upconversion nanoparticles  ap. 40-49.  aStimuli-responsive nanoparticles with multiple therapeutic/diagnostic functions are highly desirable for effective tumor treatment. Herein novel caspase-3 responsive functionalized upconversion nanoparticles (CFUNs) were fabricated with three-in-one functional integration: near-infrared (NIR) triggered photodynamic damage along with caspase-3 activation, subsequent caspase-3 responsive drug release, and cascade chemotherapeutic activation. CFUNs were formulated from the self-assembly of caspase-3 responsive doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug tethered with DEVD peptide (DEVD-DOX), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP), a photosensitizer (pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester, MPPa), and tumor-targeting cRGD-PEG-DSPE to afford multifunctional CFUNs, MPPa/UCNP-DEVD-DOX/cRGD. Upon cellular uptake and NIR irradiation, the visible light emission of UCNP could excite MPPa to produce reactive oxygen species for photodynamic therapy (PDT) along with the activation of caspase-3, which further cleaved DEVD peptide to release DOX within tumor cells, thus accomplishing NIR-triggered PDT and cascade chemotherapy. CFUNs presented silent therapeutic potency and negligible cytotoxicity in the dark, whereas in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the NIR-triggered cascade therapeutic activation and tumor inhibition due to consecutive PDT and chemotherapy. Current NIR-activated cascade tumor therapy with two distinct mechanisms is significantly favorable to overcome multidrug resistance and tumor heterogeneity for persistent tumor treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaspase-3 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3ain vivo studies 3airradiation 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3areactive oxygen species 0aNIR 0aCaspase-3 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aCascade chemotherapy 0aUpconversion nanoparticles1 aWu, Baoyan1 aHu, Xianglong1 aXing, Da0 tBiomaterials.g2017 Oct., v. 141 p.40-49dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011200156300001800268520124400286592002801530650001501558650002101573650002201594650001201616650001701628650001301645650001701658700001501675700001701690700001801707700001401725773014301739856007501882852000901957655001201966IND60791841920221120085424.0220901e20220831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079184192DNAL7 a10.1039/d2tb01466a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Zhibo10aOxygen-powered flower-like FeMo₆@CeO₂ self-cascade nanozymes: a turn-on enhancement fluorescence sensor  ap. 6425-6432.  aEnzyme cascade reactions in organisms have sparked tremendous interest for their coupled catalysis-facilitated efficient biochemical reactions. However, multi-enzyme cascade nanozymes remain largely unused. In the work, flower-like porous ceria-based integrated enzymes (INAzyme), FeMo₆@CeO₂ (FMC-n), were readily prepared using an efficient thermally induced process. Owing to a larger specific surface area and excellent adsorption, the flower-like matrix (CeO₂) can serve as not only an effective sorbent for the conversion of dissolved oxygen in solution but also an excellent support for self-cascade reactions with FeMo₆. Based on the electron transfer through Fe and Ce cycles, FMC-n INAzyme exhibits intrinsic oxidase-, peroxidase- and Fenton-like activities. Moreover, by assessing the Vo mobility and F-Vo relative content of FMC-2 and FC-66, we found that the contribution of enhanced accessibility through the specific surface area (SSA) to the activity of the INAzyme is significantly higher than the active sites. Finally, a fluorescence turn-on enhancement sensing platform based on self-cascade FMC-n for the detection of Cys was established, culminating in a LOD of as low as 0.014 μM in the range of 1–100 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectron transfer 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3asorbents 3asurface area1 aWang, Tong1 aCai, Yunheng1 aSha, Jingquan1 aPeng, Tai0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2022 Aug. 31, v. 10, no. 34 p.6425-6432dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2tb01466a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008500168300001600253520229100269592002802560650001902588650001902607650002902626650002102655650002202676650001102698650001402709651002102723651001102744653002102755653002002776653002202796773010902818856008502927852000903012655001203021IND60604958220221120054452.0180718e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060495822DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2018.14928972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaites, Erik10aCarbon taxes and greenhouse gas emissions trading systems: what have we learned?  ap. 955-966.  aSystematic evidence relating to the performance of carbon pricing – carbon taxes and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading systems (ETSs) – is sparse. In 2015, 17 ETSs were operational in 55 jurisdictions while 18 jurisdictions collected a carbon tax. The papers in this special thematic section review the performance of many of these instruments over the 2005–2015 period. The performance of existing carbon taxes and GHG ETSs can help policy makers make informed choices about whether to introduce these instruments and to improve their design. The purpose of carbon pricing instruments is to reduce GHG emissions cost effectively. Assessing their performance is difficult because emissions are also affected by other policies and exogenous factors such as economic conditions. Carbon taxes in Europe prior to 2008 and in British Columbia reduced emissions from business-as-usual but actual emissions continued to rise. Since 2008 emissions subject to European carbon taxes have declined, but in most countries, other mitigation policies have probably contributed more to the reductions than the carbon taxes. Emissions subject to ETSs, with the exception of four systems without emissions caps, have declined. The ETSs contributed to the emissions reductions, but their share of the overall reduction is not known. Most tax rates are low relative to levels thought to be needed to achieve climate change objectives. Few jurisdictions regularly adjust their tax rates. All ETSs have accumulated surplus allowances and implemented measures to reduce these surpluses. The largest ETSs now specify annual reductions in their emissions cap several years into the future. Emissions trading system allowance prices are generally lower than the tax rates. Key policy insights Theoretical discussions usually portray carbon taxes and GHG ETSs as alternatives. In practice, a jurisdiction often implements both instruments to address emissions by different sources. Designs of ETSs have evolved based on experience shared bilaterally and via dedicated institutions. Carbon tax designs, in contrast, have hardly evolved and there are no institutions dedicated to sharing experience. Every jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other policies that affect its GHG emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3asurpluses 3aBritish Columbia 3aEurope 0aGreenhouse gases 0acarbon taxation 0aemissions trading0 tClimate policy.g2018 Sept. 14, v. 18, no. 8 p.955-966dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2018.14928973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01248naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014900171300001300320520035500333592002800688653001700716653001400733653001500747653001300762773011600775856008200891852000900973655001200982IND60771150020221120103759.0220325e20220324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077115002DNAL7 a10.13156/arac.2022.19.1.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassirkhani, Mahrad10aFirst record of Neobisium (Neobisium) kobachidzei Beier (Pseudoscorpiones: Neobisiidae) from Iran, with a list of Iranian pseudoscorpion species  ap. 7-14.  aThe pseudoscorpion Neobisium (Neobisium) kobachidzeiBeier, 1962 is recorded from Iran for the first time.

A low-cost solid-state supercapacitor of high energy density and good cyclic stability is fabricated with a facile method. The electrodes of the supercapacitor are made of a freestanding composite film of polyaniline and acid-treated carbon particles using phytic acid as a crosslinker, and the gel electrolyte is composed of sulfuric acid and polyvinyl alcohol. The electrochemical performances of the as-fabricated supercapacitor are investigated with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our results show that a maximum capacitance of 272.6F/g (3.63F/cm²) at a current density of 0.63A/g can be achieved by the supercapacitor, which is significantly higher than most solid-state ones reported in the literature. The ability to achieve a high-capacitance supercapacitor with good cyclic stability is mainly attributed to excellent infiltration of the gel electrolyte into the electrodes. The developed lightweight, thin, flexible, and environmental friendly supercapacitor would have potential applications in various energy storage devices, such as wearable electronics and hybrid electric vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3agels 3aphytic acid 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asulfuric acid 3avehicles (equipment) 0aEnergy storage 0aSupercapacitor 0aSolid-state device 0aPolyaniline 0aCarbon particles1 aXing, M.1 aWang, Q.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 153 p.87-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245016800170520135800338592002801696650002501724650001701749650002001766650001801786650001401804650002101818650002801839650001301867650001601880650001501896650001601911650001701927650001401944650001401958653001401972653001901986653004002005700005402045773009502099856008302194852000902277655001202286IND60744013920221120181114.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074401392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavas, Busra Sena10aOat bran fortified raspberry probiotic dairy drinks: Physicochemical, textural, microbiologic properties, in vitro bioaccessibility of antioxidants and polyphenols  aIn this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of oat bran, which is a good source of dietary fiber, on L. acidophilus, L. casei and B. lactis viability, physicochemical, textural, sensorial properties, total phenolic compound and antioxidant activity with DPPH, CUPRAC and ABTS method of probiotic dairy drinks.

In conclusion, although oat bran did not show the expected effects on probiotic dairy drinks, the use of oat bran together with raspberry did not have a negative effect on probiotic drinks and they can be consumed as a functional food with good antioxidant properties in diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3aoat bran 3apolyphenols 3aprobiotics 3araspberries 3astorage time 3aviability 3aviscosity 0aProbiotic 0aFermented milk 0aIn vitro gastrointestinal digestion1 aAkan, Ecem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6479-73360 tFood bioscience.g2021 Oct., v. 43 p.101223-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06960naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245012900180300001400309500001500323520438400338592002804722650001004750650001004760650001704770650001304787650001904800650001004819650003704829650001204866650001504878650002104893650001704914650001704931650001204948650002004960650001104980650002004991650001305011650003805024650001405062650001405076650001205090650001305102650001305115650000905128650001405137650001505151650001405166650001105180650001705191650001205208650002105220650001505241650001805256650001505274650000905289650001005298650002205308650001105330650002305341650001305364650001505377650001405392650003005406650003805436650002905474650003805503650004305541650004805584650003705632650003105669650003605700650003205736651001805768653001305786700002005799700001705819700001405836773012705850856004805977852000906025655001206034IND50068745620221121060618.0130824e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006874562DNAL7 a117318352pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-001-0222-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauci, M.10aDevelopment of Plant Bioassay to Detect Herbicide Contamination of Compost at or Below Practical Analytical Detection Limits  ap. 79-85.  a2019-12-06  aComposting is an excellent method of recycling organic materials into a highly desirable product. The sanitizing effect of the composting process on weeds, disease organisms, and herbicides is well known. Unfortunately composts made from organic materials that had been treated with persistent herbicides may retain bioactive levels of residues. For example, both picloram and clopyralid residues have caused problems for composting facilities (Bezdicek et al. 2000; Rynk 2000) whose product were associated with phytotoxicity in gardens and nurseries.Clopyralid and picloram are chlorinated pyridinecarboxylates that function as auxin agonists. Picloram, the active ingredient in Tordon and Grazon, is used for systemic control of woody plants and broad-leafed weeds in forests, on pastures, rangeland, and rights-of-way, and in barley, oat, and wheat. Clopyralid is the active ingredient in over 30 products including Confront, Curtail and Stinger and it is used to control annual and perennial weeds similarly to picloram, but it may also be used on turf, including golf courses and lawns. The salts of clopyralid and picloram, which are used in many formulations, are water-soluble (300,000 and 200,000 mg/L at 25° C, respectively) and thus have very low sorption potential (Koc 6 and 16 mL/g, respectively) (WSSA 1994). Field half-lives of clopyralid in soil range from 8–250 days (DowElanco 1997), but picloram is considered even more persistent with a half-life ranging from 167–513 days (US EPA 1995).Normally composting degrades most herbicides and insecticides (Buyuksonmez et al. 1999; 2000). Vandervoot et al (1997) found clopyralid declined from 32 ppm to less than 1.4 ppm after 365 days of composting grass clippings, however, these levels are still 10 to 100 times above the no observable effects level (NOEL). Composting, therefore, may not be sufficient to reduce the final residues of clopyralid and picloram below phytotoxic levels. Indeed, the formulated product labels have strict warnings prohibiting organic materials treated with the herbicides from being used as mulch or in compost. Compost produced by the Washington State University (WSU) Compost Facility in the fall of 1999 was contaminated by picloram that came from grass hay produced in 1999. The compost was sold in spring 2000 and caused herbicide damage in many local gardens and landscape projects (Bezdicek et al. 2000). Thus, a need arose for testing the compost for contamination.Analytical screening for the herbicides can be sensitive enough to detect these compounds at levels that cause visual herbicide damage to plants, but they are usually screened at the much higher levels set for food tolerances (Hebert 2000). Analyzing a complex matrix like compost extract requires significant cleanup procedures to lower detection limits from 50 to 1 ppb. The NOEL of these herbicides on sensitive plants is similar to the practical limit of quantitation (∼ 1 ppb).The high cost of analytical testing prompted us to investigate other means of herbicide detection in compost. An ELISA technique known as the RaPID assay kit is available for screening water samples for picloram and clopyralid in the 0–2 ppb range (Strategic Diagnostic Inc., Newark, DE). However, after repeated trials with the kit we concluded that compost extracts have too many compounds that interfere with results, even with dilution ratios greater than 1:1000.We decided to develop a plant bioassay to detect herbicide contamination of compost. Plant bioassays can be cost effective, but they require several weeks to gauge plant responses. They can be used to screen finished compost before it is marketed or to screen feed stocks before they are composted. To develop the bioassay, we first determined the concentration-response relationship for picloram and clopyralid using plants grown in potting soil. Samples screening positive can then be subjected to chemical analysis. Our routine bioassay for finished compost or feed stocks is based on bean grown in test sample mixed with commercial peatbased potting media (25% test sample with 75% potting mix, by volume) In addition to describing a diagnostic plant bioassay for potentially contaminated compost, we determined the effects of activated carbon on herbicidal bioactivity in gardens that were treated with the compost from the WSU Compost Facility.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeans 3afeeds 3ainsecticides 3apicloram 3alawns and turf 3awheat 3ano observed adverse effect level 3agardens 3afeedstocks 3acompost extracts 3aplant damage 3agolf courses 3aforests 3aperennial weeds 3abarley 3adetection limit 3apastures 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ascreening 3ahalf life 3agrasses 3asampling 3asorption 3asoil 3abioassays 3aclopyralid 3agrass hay 3aauxins 3awoody plants 3amulches 3aactivated carbon 3arangelands 3aphytotoxicity 3alandscapes 3aoats 3asalts 3achemical analysis 3aspring 3aactive ingredients 3aagonists 3acomposting 3arecycling 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aHerbicidesxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgrowth & development. 2aNo-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level 2aPeasxgrowth & development 2aPhaseolusxgrowth & development 2aSensitivity and Specificity 3aUnited States 0alabeling1 aBezdicek, D.

A novel catchment-scale regression kriging approach was used to assess regional sensitivity and critical loads of acidity for the total lake population of northern Saskatchewan (89,947 lakes). Lake catchments were delineated using Thiessen polygons, and surface water chemistry was predicted for sensitivity indicators (calcium, pH, alkalinity, and acid neutralizing capacity). Critical loads were calculated with the steady state water chemistry model using regression-kriged base cations, sulphate, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations modelled from surface water observations (n > 800) and digital landscape-scale characteristics, e.g., climate, soil, vegetation, landcover, and geology maps. A large region (>13,726 km²) of two or more indicators of acid sensitivity (pH < 6 and acid neutralizing capacity, alkalinity, calcium < 50 μeq L⁻¹) and low critical loads < 5 meq m⁻² yr⁻¹ were predicted on the Athabasca Basin. Exceedance of critical loads under 2006 modelled total sulphate deposition was predicted for 12% of the lakes (covering an area of 3742 km²), primarily located on the Athabasca Basin, within 100 km of the AOSR. There have been conflicting scientific reports of impacts from atmospheric emissions from the AOSR; the results of this study suggest that catchments in the Athabasca Basin within 100 km of the AOSR have received acidic deposition in excess of their critical loads and many of them may be at risk of ecosystem damage owing to their sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abasins 3acalcium 3acations 3aclimate 3acritical load 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3ahydrochemistry 3akriging 3alakes 3aland cover 3amodels 3aneutralization 3aoil sands 3apH 3arisk 3asoil 3asulfates 3asulfur dioxide 3asurface water 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3awind direction 3aSaskatchewan 0aAcid rain 0aSulphur dioxide 0aCritical loads 0aRegression-kriging 0aSteady state water chemistry (SSWC) model 0aAthabasca Oil Sands1 aAherne, J.1 aJeffries, D.S.1 aScott, K.A.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Dec., v. 146 p.290-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.08.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245014800135300001600283500001500299520066100314592002800975650000901003650001901012650001401031650001601045651001201061651001201073653001901085653001801104653001401122653001901136700002301155700001901178700001701197773013301214852000901347655001201356IND60477749820221119032647.0160105e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047774982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmilov, Sergey G.10aNew species of oribatid mites of the genera Hermannobates and Rhynchoribates (Acari: Oribatida: Hermanniellidae, Rhynchoribatidae) from Ecuador  ap. 313-321.  a2019-12-06  aTwo new species of oribatid mites, Hermannobates dilatatus sp. nov. and Rhynchoribates longisetosus sp. nov., are described from Ecuadorian soils.

Here we review plant phenotyping systems by examining three important characteristics: throughput, dimensionality, and resolution. First, whole-plant phenotyping systems are highlighted together with advances in automation that enable significant throughput increases. Organ and cellular level phenotyping and its tools, often operating at a lower throughput, are then discussed as a means to obtain high-dimensional phenotypic data at elevated spatial and temporal resolution. The significance of recent developments in sensor technologies that give access to plant morphology and physiology-related traits is shown. Overall, attention is focused on spatial and temporal resolution because these are crucial aspects of imaging procedures in plant phenotyping systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aimage analysis 3ameasurement 3aphenotype 3aplant morphology 3aplant physiology 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assistedxmethods 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Cells 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlantsxanatomy & histologyxclassification. 2aSoftware 0aplant phenomics 0anon-invasive sensor 0aimage processing 0aplant growth 0aphysiology1 aWuyts, Nathalie1 aInzé, D.q(Dirk),0 tTrends in plant science.g2013 Aug., v. 18, no. 8 p.428-439dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl53669x1360-13857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2013.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013100160300001800291520146600309592002801775596008201803650001801885650002601903650002001929650001001949650001701959650002301976650004201999650001202041650002402053650001402077650001902091650001802110650001702128700001502145700001902160700001602179700002802195700001902223700001802242700001302260773013002273856008202403852000902485655001202494IND60678046920221119124324.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067804692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01815-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Na10aComplete plastid genome of Kappaphycus alvarezii: insights of large-scale rearrangements among Florideophyceae plastid genomes  ap. 3997-4005.  aKappaphycus alvarezii is a large commercial tropical marine red alga. In this study we used next-generation sequencing to determine the complete plastid genome of K. alvarezii. The plastid genome mapped a 178,205-bp circular DNA molecule with a GC content of 29.6%, without any inverted repeat region, and encoded a standard set of 202 protein-coding genes, including 4 open reading frames, 30 transfer RNA genes, 3 ribosomal RNA genes, and 1 transfer-messenger RNA gene. Only one group II intron interrupting the trnMe gene was detected. Comparative analysis of the seven plastid genomes from three orders including Gigartinales, Gracilariales, and Peyssonneliales revealed that the genomes were more conserved except five remarkable gene rearrangements. However, an approximately 12.5-kb gene fragment from the psaM to ycf21 gene in K. alvarezii plastid genome was completely reversed compared to that in published plastid genomes from the Florideophyceae. To our knowledge, the gene rearrangement was identified for the first time in the plastid genomes of red algal species. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of 49 Florideophyceae species based on 144 shared protein-coding genes suggested that different species from the same class clustered together according to their sources: three species of Gigartinales formed one group as the subbranch of Florideophyceae, but K. alvarezii was the most closely related to Riquetophycus sp. from the Peyssonneliales.  aPublisher supplied data  a201405020cPublic Science and the Technology Research Funds Projects of Ocean 3aGracilariales 3aKappaphycus alvarezii 3aPeyssonneliales 3aalgae 3acircular DNA 3agene rearrangement 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintrons 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aplastid genome 3aribosomal RNA 3atransfer RNA1 aZhang, Lei1 aTang, Xianming1 aWang, Xumin1 aMeinita, Maria Dyah Nur1 aWang, Guoliang1 aChen, Weizhou1 aLiu, Tao0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2019 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.3997-4005dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01815-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245014000199300001800339500001900357500002000376520179800396592002802194596017002222596007302392596005902465650002802524650001702552650001402569650003602583650001302619650002302632650001702655650001902672650001302691650001602704650000902720650001302729650002202742650001602764650001202780650001402792650000902806700001602815700001502831700001602846700001802862773012602880856007903006852000903085655001203094IND60720293820221117201214.0201211e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072029382DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.155222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0356-310010aInteraction of exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus plantarum YW11 with whey proteins and functionalities of the polymer complex  ap. 4141-4151.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExopolysaccharide (EPS)‐producing lactic acid bacteria have been widely used in fermented milk, but interaction between the EPS and milk proteins has not been well studied. In this study, interaction between the EPS from Lactobacillus plantarum YW11 (EPS‐YW11) and whey proteins (WP), and functional properties of the EPS‐YW11/WP were investigated. The results showed that EPS‐YW11 tended to encase WP by ζ‐potential analysis with a decrease in the surface charge of the protein fraction (from −26.00 mV to 15.30 mV), and an increase in the melting temperature of the protein fraction (from 76.31 °C to 84.48 °C) as shown by differential scanning calorimetry. Circular dichroism spectrometry showed that the EPS could induce structural change of WP, that is, increment in the content of α‐helixes and random coils, There was stronger interaction between EPS‐YW11 and WP at higher temperatures (60 °C, 90 °C) due to formation of intermolecular H‐bonds and OH stretching vibration as indicated by infrared spectral analysis. A significant improvement in the texture (hardness, springiness, gumminess, resilience, cohesiveness, and chewiness) of the EPS‐YW11/WP complex was also observed when compared to that of the EPS or WP alone. This was confirmed by microstructural observation of the EPS‐YW11/WP complex that formed branched and porous structures, and it became more complex and stable with increased temperature treatment. Due to the strong interaction the EPS‐YW11/WP exhibited improved functionality. This study identifies the potential of the EPS‐YW11 to serve as a functional agent in the processing of fermented dairy products with enhanced textural stability and bioactivities such as cholesterol‐lowering, antioxidant, and antibiofilm.  aPublisher supplied data  aPXM2019_014213_000010cBeijing Talent Cultivation Quality Construction ‐ First‐class Professional Construction (Municipal Level) ‐ Food Science and Engineering  a19008001616c2019 Postgraduate Research Capacity Improvement Program  a31871823cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantioxidants 3achewiness 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acohesion 3aexopolysaccharides 3afermentation 3afermented milk 3ahardness 3alactic acid 3amilk 3apolymers 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3atexture 3avibration 3awhey1 aLuo, Tianqi1 aZhao, Xiao1 aHao, Xiaona1 aYang, Zhennai0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.4141-4151dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.155223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001200186245011700198300002000315506007600335520179500411592002802206506003702234650002202271650001202293650002002305650002602325650002002351650001602371650001602387650002102403650001102424650001802435650000902453650003102462650001202493650001702505650002402522650002602546653001502572653001302587700002102600700002002621700001402641773017702655856007902832852000902911655001202920IND60173801420221207071248.0150603e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017380142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13041711102doi7 aPMC37737382pmcid7 a239183862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Bei10aPresenilins regulate calcium homeostasis and presynaptic function via ryanodine receptors in hippocampal neurons  ap. 15091-15096.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPresenilin (PS) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, and loss of PS causes progressive memory impairment and age-related neurodegeneration in the mouse cerebral cortex. In hippocampal neurons, PS is essential for neurotransmitter release, NMDA receptor-mediated responses, and long-term potentiation. PS is also involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, although the precise site of its action is less clear. Here we investigate the mechanism by which PS regulates synaptic function and calcium homeostasis using acute hippocampal slices from PS conditional knockout mice and primary cultured postnatal hippocampal neurons, in which PS is inducibly inactivated. Using two different calcium probes, Fura-2 and Mag–Fura-2, we found that inactivation of PS in primary hippocampal neurons does not affect calcium concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum. Rather, in the absence of PS, levels of ryanodine receptor (RyR) are reduced in the hippocampus, measured by Western analysis and radioligand binding assay, although the mRNA expression is unaffected. RyR-mediated function is also impaired, as indicated by reduced RyR agonist-induced calcium release from the ER and RyR-mediated synaptic responses in the absence of PS. Furthermore, knockdown of RyR expression in wild-type hippocampal neurons by two independent shRNAs to levels comparable with the RyR protein reduction in PS- deficient hippocampal neurons mimics the defects exhibited in calcium homeostasis and presynaptic function. Collectively, our findings show that PS regulates calcium homeostasis and synaptic function via RyR and suggest that disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis may be an early pathogenic event leading to presynaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3acalcium 3acerebral cortex 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3ahippocampus 3ahomeostasis 3aknockout mutants 3amemory 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3aryanodine receptors 3asynaptic transmission 0aER calcium 0acaffeine1 aYamaguchi, Hiroo1 aLai, F.

Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) are lipid raft-like domains formed in the ER membranes that are in close apposition to mitochondria. They play an important role in signal transmission between these two essential organelles. When cells are exposed to internal or external stressful stimuli, the ER will activate an adaptive response called the ER stress response, which has a significant effect on mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial quality control is an important mechanism to ensure the functional integrity of mitochondria and the effect of ER stress on mitochondrial quality control through MAMs is of great significance. Therefore, in this review, we introduce ER stress and mitochondrial quality control, and discuss how ER stress signals are transmitted to mitochondria through MAMs. We then review the important roles of MAMs in mitochondrial quality control under ER stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3alipids 3amitochondria 3aquality control 3astress response 0aEndoplasmic reticulum stress 0aMitochondrial quality control 0aMitochondria associated membranes 0aCa2+1 aHe, Yichun1 aSun, Hongyu1 aZheng, Xinzi1 aGao, Yufei1 aLi, Na0 tLife sciences.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 231 p.116587-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1165873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015100164520193000315592002802245650002502273650002102298650002502319650001702344650002702361650001002388650001702398650001602415650001602431650001902447650002402466650001602490650001602506650001802522650001902540650001102559650001002570650002002580650002102600650002202621650002102643653002402664653001802688653002102706653002502727653001802752700001502770700001102785700001402796700002002810773009502830856008302925852000903008655001203017IND60744014420221120202030.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074401442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGökçe, Y.10aInfluence of purple basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) extract and essential oil on hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in rats fed high-cholesterol diet  aThe aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of purple basil methanolic extract and essential oil on serum lipid profiles in rats fed a high cholesterol diet. Feeding a high-cholesterol diet increased serum lipid profiles, leptin, hepatic triglyceride, cholesterol levels, malondialdehyde concentrations, fatty acid synthase (FAS), liver X receptors (LXRs), ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1c) expression in the liver in rats. The extract and essential oil reduced serum triglycerides by 28.2%, 30.7%, and total cholesterol by 21.7% and 14.5%, respectively. The applications did not return the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities to their normal levels. Extract and fenofibrate administration decreased serum leptin levels by 17.5% and 27.5%, respectively. The extract reduced hepatic triglyceride by 16.4% and total cholesterol by 22.1%. Fenofibrate reduced the triglyceride and hepatic total cholesterol by 25.5% and 46.3%, respectively. The decrease in MDA levels was 34.6% in those treated with the extract, and less in those who were applied essential oil. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS), liver X receptors (LXRs), ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1c) in the liver decreased by 20.9%, 15.4%, 20.7% and 16.9%, respectively, when the extract was administered. For those treated with essential oil, the decline was 9.9%, 13.6%, 10.2%, and 12.5%. It decreased by 38.1%, 56.8%, 21.7% and 40.8% in those administered fenofibrate. The ABTS and DPPH based antioxidant activities and total phenolic contents of the extract were 67.83%, 86.98% and 57.94 ± 0.39 mg Gallic acid equivalent (GAE), respectively. The results reveal that methanolic extract of purple basil may contain hypolipidemic and antioxidant substances and its protective effect on the liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aATP citrate synthase 3aOcimum basilicum 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abasil 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aessential oils 3afatty-acid synthase 3afenofibrate 3agallic acid 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3aleptin 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3atriacylglycerols 0aOcimum basilicum L. 0aHypolipidemia 0aHigh cholesterol 0aAntioxidant activity 0aEssential oil1 aKanmaz, H.1 aEr, B.1 aSahin, K.1 aHayaloglu, A.A.0 tFood bioscience.g2021 Oct., v. 43 p.101228-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1012283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245011600209300001600325520171000341592002802051650001302079650002602092650001902118650001602137650001002153650001502163650002202178650001102200651001002211651001902221651001602240651001502256653001602271653001402287653001902301653002002320653002202340653002802362700001502390700001802405700001402423700001502437773010402452856008702556852000902643655001202652IND60558675420221119065508.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055867542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Sai-Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3089-343910aTransport of East Asian dust storms to the marginal seas of China and the southern North Pacific in spring 2010  ap. 316-328.  aThe transport of a super-severe dust storm that occurred in East Asia from 19 to 22 March 2010 has been well documented by both model simulations and surface observations. We investigated the transport of this severe dust storm and several other spring 2010 dust storms using model simulations, backward trajectories, and measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite. The model simulations indicated that the emission of dust in spring 2010 was about 35% higher than that in spring 2006 and was twice that of the 44-year average from 1960 to 2003. The dust emissions over two major source regions (western China and the Gobi Desert) in spring 2010 accounted for 86% of the total amount of dust. The simulated depositional flux over the two major source regions was c.2.7–9.0 times that over two marginal seas (the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea) and more than two magnitudes higher than that over the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The mean extinction coefficient observed by the CALIPSO satellite over the two source regions was c.1.3–3.7 times that over the two marginal seas and one magnitude higher than that over the North Pacific. This was consistent with the result from our model, suggesting that this model is able to capture the major features of dust storms. The vertical profiles recorded by the CALIPSO satellite indicated that the dust aerosol mainly floated from the ground to 13 km above ground level over the source regions and above the seas. A multiple dust layer appeared over the seas and the backward trajectories suggested that the dust aerosol in different layers may have been sourced from different regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adust emissions 3adust storms 3alidar 3asatellites 3asimulation models 3aspring 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aGobi Desert 3aYellow Sea 0aDust storms 0aTransport 0aDust emissions 0aDust deposition 0aVertical profiles 0aExtinction coefficients1 aLi, Jiawei1 aChe, Huizheng1 aChen, Bin1 aWang, Hong0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Jan., v. 148 p.316-328dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008900161300001400250520190900264592002802173650002202201650002102223650001902244650001202263650000902275650001202284650001602296650002002312650002002332650001802352650001302370650001002383650000902393650001202402650002502414650002802439650001102467650000702478650002502485650002002510650001702530650002102547650002002568650001202588650001602600650001002616650001102626653000902637653002102646653000802667653000902675653002802684653002002712700001402732773012302746856008102869852000902950655001202959IND60689695020221121225001.0200423e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068969502DNAL7 a10.1080/104084106007098002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpano, G.10aEnvironmental Stress Response in Wine Lactic Acid Bacteria: Beyond Bacillus subtilis  ap. 77-86.  aLactic acid bacteria (LAB) constitute a heterogeneous group of bacteria that are traditionally used to produce fermented foods. The industrialization of food transformations has increased the economical importance of LAB, as they play a crucial role in the development of the organoleptic and hygienic quality of fermented products. However, the strains selected for industrial purposes, should tolerate adverse conditions encountered in industrial processes, either during starter handling and storage (freeze-drying, freezing, or spray-drying) or during food processing in which abiotic stresses such as heat, cold, acidity, and high concentration of NaCl or ethanol are common. Wine LAB have to deal with several stresses including an acidic pH, a high alcoholic content, non optimal growth temperatures, and growth-inhibitory compounds such as fatty acids and tannins, originated from yeast and bacteria metabolism. Wine LAB have developed several mechanisms to escape or to tolerate wine conditions. They carry out a malolactic fermentation in this stressful environment. In addition to the regulation of the expression of specific genes, bacteria have evolved adaptive networks to face the challenges of a changing environment and to survive under conditions of stress. The so called Global Regulatory Systems control the simultaneous expression of a large number of genes in response to a variety of environmental stress factors. CIRCE sequences able to bind the HrcA repressor, σᴮ dependent promoters and CtsR regulatory elements have been observed in several genes identified from wine LAB. Improved knowledge of regulators and a better understanding of LAB stress responses could constitute a basis of comparison with the well known model microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Moreover, it can provide an important insight into improving current industrial starter strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aabiotic stress 3aacidity 3acold 3aethanol 3afatty acids 3afermented foods 3afood processing 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3agenes 3aheat 3ahygiene 3alactic acid bacteria 3amalolactic fermentation 3amodels 3apH 3aregulatory sequences 3asodium chloride 3aspray drying 3astarter cultures 3astress response 3atannins 3atemperature 3awines 3ayeasts 0aWine 0aAbiotic Stresses 0aσB 0aCtsR 0aLactobacillus plantarum 0aOenococcus oeni1 aMassa, S.0 tCritical reviews in microbiology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 32, no. 2 p.77-86dTaylor & FranciswJournal:14619x1549-78287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104084106007098003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012900175300001400304520175600318592002802074650002802102650001002130650002502140650001402165650000802179650001402187650001402201650002202215650002402237650000902261650001802270650001902288650001702307651001402324653002502338653002802363653001102391653001202402653001702414653001402431700001902445700002602464700001702490700002902507773009602536856008502632852000902717655001202726IND60570596420221122215306.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057059642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPou, Sonia Alejandra10aLarge-scale societal factors and noncommunicable diseases: Urbanization, poverty and mortality spatial patterns in Argentina  ap. 32-40.  aIn developing countries, the rapid increase in noncommunicable diseases burden has been accompanied by socio-demographic changes, such as rapid urbanization, with persistence of considerable socio-economic gaps between populations. In Argentina, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer are leading causes of death. The aim of this study was to identify geographic clustering of mortality rates related to both diseases in Argentina and to assess their association with two large-scale societal factors, urbanization and poverty contexts.We performed an ecological study in Argentina (n = 525 counties), 2009–2011 period. Using spatial analysis techniques we identified and mapped spatial clusters of high and low values for age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) of cancer or CVD and for selected urbanization and poverty indicators. We estimated incidence-rate ratios using two-level Poisson regression models, which accounted for rates distribution spatial variability.Cancer and CVD mortality rates distribution were spatially dependent. Population growth showed an inverse association with ASMR from these causes, for both sexes. We detected an additive interaction of effects between urban scale and poverty level, being the “rural poverty” associated with an increasing risk of mortality by cancer (in both sexes) or by CVD (only men), compared to contexts with high urban scale and low poverty level. Counties with an intermediate urban scale seem to present the most favorable context, even when their socio-economic conditions are more unfavorable than those with higher urbanization levels.Geographical differences in urban and socioeconomic contextual conditions can explain spatial variation in NCD mortality burden in Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3adeath 3adeveloping countries 3ageography 3amen 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3apopulation growth 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arural poverty 3asocioeconomics 3aurbanization 3aArgentina 0aSpatial epidemiology 0aCardiovascular diseases 0aCancer 0aPoverty 0aUrbanization 0aArgentina1 aTumas, Natalia1 aSánchez Soria, David1 aOrtiz, Pablo1 aDíaz, María del Pilar,0 tApplied geography.g2017 Sept., v. 86 p.32-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011500157300001800272520200200290592002802292650001502320650001102335650001902346650002102365650003002386650001502416650001902431650002802450650001102478650002902489650001302518650001402531650001302545650001502558700001802573700001702591700001502608700001602623700001802639700001702657700001702674773014102691856007402832852000902906655001202915IND60695961620221118235947.0200520e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069596162DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03262j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Sainan10aCarbon phosphides: promising electric field controllable nanoporous materials for CO₂ capture and separation  ap. 9970-9980.  aMaterials for high-efficiency CO₂ capture and separation are the prerequisites for the CO₂ capture and storage strategy that aims to alleviate excessive CO₂ emission in the atmosphere. Herein, six carbon phosphides (PCₙ; n = 0.33, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) were systematically evaluated for the first time as promising electric field controllable nanoporous materials for CO₂ capture and separation by using density functional theory. The six PCₙ structures presented high structure stabilities with strong P–C bonds, and high electrical conductivity in an electric field. Without an electric field, weak physisorption of CO₂ was observed on PC₀.₃₃ and PC₃, whereas CO₂ would escape from PC₆, PC₅, PC₂, and PC₁ surfaces. In electric fields, the adsorption energies of CO₂ on all PCₙ structures were remarkably regulated, and the adsorption of CO₂ on PC₀.₃₃, PC₂, and PC₅ underwent a transition from physisorption to chemisorption with increasing the electric field. The adsorption behaviour and energy decomposition analyses identified that PC₀.₃₃ and PC₅ could significantly enhance the CO₂–PCₙ interaction strength, and PC₂ could directly activate CO₂ in large electric fields. The adsorption energy differences between CO₂ and N₂/H₂O on PCₙ indicated the high CO₂ selectivity over N₂ and the excellent humidity resistance of PCₙ structures. The maximum adsorption capacity and average interaction analyses confirmed that the best adsorption performance of PC₅ corresponded to three CO₂ molecules located at a favourable adsorption site with an adsorption strength of 30.77 kJ mol⁻¹ in an electric field of 0.0020 a.u.; the kinetic processes demonstrated that an extremely low energy consumption of 1.4 GJ per ton of CO₂ was required for a complete adsorption/desorption cycle under these conditions, which was superior to that of most of the CO₂ adsorptions via other methods or materials in electric fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aelectric field 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumidity 3ananopores 3anitrogen 3aphosphides1 aWang, Maohuai1 aWang, Jiahui1 aXin, Huili1 aLiu, Siyuan1 aWang, Zhaojie1 aWei, Shuxian1 aLu, Xiaoqing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 May 19, v. 8, no. 19 p.9970-9980dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03262j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014700174300001800321500001500339520109400354592002801448650002301476650001601499650001001515650001301525650002201538650001101560650000901571650001501580650001401595650002501609650001301634650001401647651002201661653001601683700002001699700002301719700002201742700002701764773009301791856004801884852000901932655001201941IND50068746020221122152719.0130824e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006874602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-013-2228-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFélix-Hackradt, F.

The temporal and inter-annual variability of settlement and the effects of mortality on recruitment were investigated across 2 years in the vicinities of Cabo de Palos-Islas Hormigas Marine Reserve by visual census and light trap sampling. Settlement was seasonal with greater species richness and abundance in summer. Although temporal synchronization was observed between larval supply and settlement, densities of settlers could not be predicted from post-larval abundances. Timing of settlement was consistent between years but with high inter-annual variation in abundance. High mortality (~80 %) and general decoupling between post-larval and settlement stages suggest that early mortality is driving such patterns. Nevertheless, indications of habitat-mediated mortality were found for benthic species such as Symphodus and Diplodus, highlighting the importance of habitat in shaping population demography. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3alight traps 3areefs 3aDiplodus 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3afish 3apostlarvae 3aSymphodus 3apopulation structure 3ahabitats 3amortality 3aMediterranean Sea 0arecruitment1 aHackradt, C.

We sought to determine if turfgrass cultivation machinery could reliably manage white grubs in turfgrass systems. Hollow‐tine aeration provided greater reductions in grub densities than solid‐vibratory tine and air/solid injection cultivation in field trials. In following studies, low to moderate reductions (0–53%) were observed with single hollow‐tine applications, though low grub densities encountered within field plots hindered the ability to detect statistical differences between cultivation treatments including tine diameter and tine spacing. Increasing aerification frequency on plots from one to two or more passes produced statistically significant reductions (>80% control) in both years of trials. To eliminate the variability observed in the field, a simulation model was constructed to determine the expected outcome of varying tine patterns have on increasing grub densities. Models suggests that expected mortality is likely to be minimal (<10%) in one‐time aerification events. In‐field simulations using templates overlaid on natural populations demonstrated two‐fold greater control than theoretical simulations. Differences in control between field studies and model simulation are likely caused by an over‐estimation of mortality when performing presence‐absence counts in field studies when grub densities are low. Although multiple aerification events will likely improve control, current cultivation practices are unlikely to achieve the level of control expected by turfgrass managers in intensely managed landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3amortality 3aresearch 3asimulation models 3aturf grasses1 aPrice, Garrett1 aSimard, Audrey1 aTrotta, Kevin0 tInternational Turfgrass Society research journal.g2022 June, v. 14, no. 1 p.823-830dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27673x2573-15137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/its2.493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245007800147300001600225500001500241520093700256650001301193650001901206650002101225650001001246650001201256650001301268650001101281650002001292650001501312650002001327650002001347650001401367653002001381773007201401852000901473939003301482946001301515655001201528IND9205014420221119103249.0920810e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920501442DNAL7 a167270722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShelton, J.N.10aFactors affecting viability of fresh and frozen-thawed sheep demi-embryos  ap. 713-721.  a2019-12-04  aThe addition of 0.1 M sucrose to the medium in which sheep embryos were bisected had no effect (39.5 vs 36.4%) on the survival rate of demi-embryos transferred (one per ewe) to recipients. There was a trend to greater survival of demi-blastocysts (44.7%) compared to demi-morulae (30%), and all the surviving twins were derived from the demiblastocysts. It is suggested that the survival of demimorulae is enhanced by the transfer of two demi-morulae to one uterine horn. In three experiments demi-embryos were frozen after the addition of 1.5 M glycerol in three or six steps or after the addition of 1.5 M ethylene glycol in six steps. No treatment resulted in acceptable survival rates of the demi-embryos transferred to recipients after thawing and step-wise removal of the cryoprotectant. Overall, 8 of 142 (5.6%) cryopreserved demi-embryos survived as 50-day fetuses or term lambs compared with 14 of 31 (45.2%) whole embryos. 3afreezing 3apregnancy rate 3acryopreservation 3asheep 3asucrose 3aglycerol 3amorula 3aethylene glycol 3ablastocyst 3acryoprotectants 3aembryo transfer 3amortality 0aembryo (animal)0 tTheriogenology.g1992 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.713-721x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03663naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145100001500162245008000177300001400257500001500271520211300286592002802399650002202427650001302449650002302462650002602485650002302511650002602534650002202560650000902582650001402591650001802605650002102623650001902644650003702663650001602700653001902716653004402735653002402779700001802803773009602821852000902917856008502926856007703011930003303088945002503121946001103146655001203157IND4375022820221119103442.0051006e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437502282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-005-2238-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHyrkas, A.10aResponse to long-term selection in early maturing maize synthetic varieties  ap. 43-49.  a2019-12-04  aLong-term continuous selection is essential for germplasm improvement. However, choice of germplasm for long-term genetic improvement might limit the success of germplasm enhancement programs. The objective of this research was to report the response to long-term selection in early maturing North Dakota (ND) synthetic varieties. We wanted to determine whether the performance of three ND maize synthetic varieties was improved by long-term mass selection (M) and if the performance of one of them was improved by long-term modified ear-to-row (MER) selection. The evaluation of long-term selection response was performed at two plant densities. An experiment in a randomized complete block design with split-plot arrangement was used to evaluate NDSM(M), NDSAB(M), NDSCD(M), and NDSAB(MER) under 75,000 and 42,500 plants per hectare across seven environments. Long-term mass selection for grain yield and stalk lodging resistance in NDSM(M), NDSAB(M), and NDSCD(M) was not successful, since there were no significant changes in grain yield or stalk lodging in these populations at either low or high densities. On the other hand, long-term modified ear-to-row selection was effective for grain yield improvement in NDSAB(MER). Grain yield increased non-linearly from 3.9 Mg ha⁻¹ in cycle 0 to 5.0 Mg ha⁻¹ in cycle 12 at a rate of 2.5% per cycle. Interaction between plant density and genotype was not detected even though selection was performed at relatively low densities (20,000 plants ha⁻¹ for mass selection and 50,000 plants ha⁻¹ for ear-to-row selection). The confirmation of a lack of interaction between plant density and genotype suggests that selection at low plant densities might still be able to provide high-density stress resistance through density-independent genotypes, allowing progeny testing across multiple locations with better accuracy and fewer resources. Selection methods that emphasize both additive and dominance effects such as full-sib recurrent selection are recommended to maximize genetic improvement of advanced population cycles of early maturing synthetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aselection methods 3aZea mays 3aselection response 3along term experiments 3alodging resistance 3asynthetic populations 3aearly development 3acorn 3avarieties 3aplant density 3aagronomic traits 3amaturity stage 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 0aplant breeding 0along-term modified ear-to-row selection 0along term selection1 aCarena, M.

The cells were characterised by positive immunofluorescent staining for von Willebrand factor and NADPH-diaphorase staining for nitric oxide synthase. Measurements of endothelins indicated that there were significant release rates from the cells for up to six hours. Measurements of intracellular calcium concentration showed that the application of bradykinin caused a transient increase in calcium concentration with similar characteristics to those observed in other endothelial cell preparations. These tests verify the endothelial character of these cells and establish the method as a reliable means of producing a primary culture of equine endothelial cells. 3aendothelium 3anitric oxide synthase 3avasoconstrictor agents 3acell culture 3acalcium 3apulmonary artery 3ahorses 3aendothelins 2aAnimals 2aBradykininxpharmacology 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCell Communicationxphysiology 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCell Separationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCells, Cultured 2aEndothelinsxanalysis 2aEndothelium, Vascularxchemistryxcytologyxphysiology. 2aFluorescent Antibody Techniquexmethodsxveterinary. 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aNADPH Dehydrogenasexanalysis 2aNeurotransmitter Agentsxpharmacology 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexanalysis 2aNitritesxanalysis 2aPulmonary Arteryxchemistryxcytologyxphysiology. 2avon Willebrand Factorxanalysis 0aoxidoreductases 0acharacterization 0aisolation1 aSmith, G.L.1 aNolan, A.M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 62, no. 2 p.147-152x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02204naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245004100155300001400196500009300210500001500303520116300318650002101481650001501502650002401517653001601541653001901557653002301576773008601599852000901685856007801694930003301772945001301805946001301818990002301831655001201854IND2123290920221119103657.0980610e199709  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212329092DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025091602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHameri, A.P.10aInnovating from big science research  ap. 27-35.  aIn the special issue: Symposium on accelerating the conversion of science to technology.  a2019-12-04  aIncreasing scientific knowledge demands technological breakthroughs beyond industrial innovation activity. Using this as a basic motivation for R&D collaboration between industry and big science, the paper reports a systematic approach to exploit the technological treasures embedded in experimental basic research. Based on a systematic technology breakdown and mapping of each technological trajectory with possible application areas, the method enables one to direct joint efforts on the most prominent research topics. Yet, to achieve this, active partners are needed to enter the innovative conversion process to turn scientific ambitions into commercial products. Some industrial companies practicing active R&D strategy have realized this, and the paper outlines some cases where the product innovation is not the only motivation to enter big science collaboration. Putting all this together, and knowing the severe financial and political pressures the major scientific research labs are facing, the paper defines the practical procedures needed to initiate the process which eventually leads to better technological return from fundamental research. 3aresearch support 3atechnology 3atechnology transfer 0acooperation 0anew technology 0atechnical progress0 tJournal of technology transfer.g1997 Fall, v. 22, no. 3 p.27-35x0892-99127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025091603Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03190naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012400181300001600305500002400321520142500345650001901770650001101789650001801800650001601818650000901834650001101843650002301854650003801877650001201915650001101927650003701938650002501975650001402000650004802014650003902062650003302101650003702134650003802171650003202209700001302241700001702254700001802271700002002289700001402309700001902323700001902342700001902361700001902380700001802399773010102417852000902518856008502527655001202612IND4431721520221119103628.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443172152DNAL7 a198346482pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-009-0142-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jinlong10aIn vitro myogenic and adipogenic differentiation model of genetically engineered bovine embryonic fibroblast cell lines  ap. 195-202.  aIncludes references  aOur current understanding of muscle and adipose tissue development has been largely restricted to the study of murine myogenic and adipogenic cell lines, since attempts to establish these cell lines from other species have met with only limited success. Here we report that a spontaneously immortalized bovine embryonic fibroblast cell line (BEFS) undergoes differentiation into adipogenic or myogenic lineages when ectopically transduced with PPARγ2 (an adipogenic lineage determinant) or MyoD (a myogenic lineage determinant) and grown in adipogenic and myogenic differentiation culture media (ADCM and MDCM, respectively). We also found that PPARγ2-overexpressing BEFS cells (BEFS-PPARγ2) grown in ADCM with or without the PPARγ2 ligand, troglitazone, preferentially differentiate into adipogenic cells in the presence of ectopic MyoD expression. Ectopic expression of PPARγ2 in the inducible MyoD-overepxressing BEFS cells (BEFS-TetOn-MyoD) completely suppresses myogenic differentiation and leads to a significant increase in adipogenic differentiation, suggesting that the adipogenic differentiation program might be dominant. Therefore, BEFS, BEFS-PPARγ2, and BEFS-TetOn-MyoD would be a valuable biological model for understanding a fundamental principle underlying myogenic and adipogenic development, and for isolating various genetic and chemical factors that enable muscle and adipocyte differentiation. 3aadipose tissue 3acattle 3aculture media 3alipogenesis 3amice 3amodels 3amuscle development 2aAdipocytesxcytologyxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Line 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aFibroblastsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aGenetic Enhancementxmethods 2aMyoblastsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aPPAR gammaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTissue Engineeringxmethods1 aJin, Xun1 aBeck, Samuel1 aKang, Dong Ho1 aHong, Zhongshan1 aLi, Zhehu1 aJin, Yongcheng1 aZhang, Qiankun1 aChoi, Yun-Jaie1 aKim, Sung-Chan1 aKim, Hyunggee0 tBiotechnology letters.g2010 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.195-202dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0142-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03164naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001800138245016600156300001800322520176100340650002402101650001902125650001702144650002802161650001102189650004402200650001902244650001302263650001702276650003302293650001202326650002002338700001502358700001302373700001302386700001302399700001702412700001402429773014202443852000902585856007802594930003302672946001302705655001202718IND4421921520221119103633.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442192152DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.217412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Xiaodong10aVisualization of spontaneous aggregates by diblock poly(styrene)-b-poly(L-lactide)/poly(D-lactide) pairs in solution with new fluorescent CdSe quantum dot labels  ap. 1393-1405.  aSpontaneous stereocomplex aggregation of diblock poly(styrene)-b-poly(L-lactide) PS-b-PLLA/poly(D-lactide) PDLA pairs has been investigated under ambient temperature in tetrahydrofuran solution. First, diblock PS₂₆₀-b-PLLA₁₆₅ and PS₂₆₀-b-PDLA₁₆₂ bearing similar lengths of respective PLLA and PDLA blocks were synthesized through controlled atom-transfer radical polymerization of styrene, and a subsequent living ring-opening polymerization of optically pure lactides, and their structures were further characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Subsequently, new enantiomeric poly(D-lactide) stabilized core-shell fluorescent CdSe quantum dots (CdSe/PDLA QD) were designed and prepared as sensitive fluorescence labels to shed new lights on the spontaneous stereocomplex aggregation in THF, which was mediated by stereocomplexation of the PLLA and PDLA chains. Upon simply mixing two individual THF solution of diblock PS₂₆₀-b-PLLA₁₆₅ and HO-PDLA₃₀-SH, spontaneous stereocomplex aggregation was studied, and the aggregated uniform spherical particles were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) to exhibit average particle diameters of 2.0 μm. Finally, utilizing the prepared CdSe/PDLA QDs as new fluorescent labels, morphologies of the spontaneous aggregates by new diblock PS₂₆₀-b-PLLA₁₆₅/HO-PDLA₃₀-SH pair were for the first time directly visualized by a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (CLSFM). These results might suggest alternative ways to simply prepare functional fluorescent particles with tunable diameter sizes and would be helpful to understand the mechanism of stereocomplex particle aggregation. 3aambient temperature 3achromatography 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3amixing 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astyrene 3atetrahydrofuran1 aLi, Qiaobo1 aHe, Yong1 aJia, Lin1 aLi, Yang1 aZhu, Yingdan1 aCao, Amin0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 July 15, v. 47, no. 14 p.1393-1405dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217413Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02884naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245009600154300001800250520154900268650001601817650002201833650001201855650002301867650001301890650001901903650001301922650002401935650001901959650001301978650001701991650001602008650003802024650003702062700001602099700001602115700001802131700001402149773014202163852000902305856007802314930003302392946001302425655001202438IND4421921120221119103618.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442192112DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.217392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Fabao10aChiroptical aggregates from block copolymer bearing amino acid moieties in aqueous solution  ap. 1345-1355.  aOptically active poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether-b-poly(methacryloyl-L-leucine methyl ester) (denoted as MPEG-b-PMALM) copolymers were prepared via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), using bromine (Br) end-capped poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (denoted as MPEG-Br) as macroinitiator in the presence of CuBr/tris(2-dimethylaminoethy1)amine (Me₆TREN) as catalytic system. Broad range of morphologies, such as spherical, cylindrical, and vesicular micelles, which were prepared by initially dissolving prepared polymer in organic solvent at different concentration followed by addition various amount of water before dialysis against water to remove any added solvent, was observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM). More detailed chiroptical properties of the micelles/aggregates in aqueous solution were evaluated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy as a function of micelles morphologies, polymer concentration, solvents employed, temperature, etc. The micellar solutions exhibit almost the same CD spectra regardless of its morphologies. The intensity of the CD spectra of the cylindrical micelles decreased in the molar ellipticities as the micellar concentration in water was increased. The Cotton effect was markedly changed when the solvent hydrophobicity was changed by addition of trifluoromethyl ethanol (TFME) to water. The intensity of the CD spectra decreased not too much within the temperature range from 20 °C to 90 °C, indicating good stability of the micelles upon temperature variation. 3aamino acids 3aaqueous solutions 3abromine 3acomposite polymers 3adialysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Zhilei1 aFeng, Liang1 aSun, Jianping1 aHu, Jiwen0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 July 15, v. 47, no. 14 p.1345-1355dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217393Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02945naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245014800143300001600291520081100307650003101118650000901149650001201158650001801170650002301188650002701211650001601238650002401254650002501278650001201303650003901315650003401354650003201388650001801420650006401438650004801502650004701550650003401597650006901631650001101700650002801711650001401739650007701753650001001830650005501840651002701895651002601922653002801948700002101976700002101997700001702018700003202035700001602067700001802083700001402101700001802115773008402133852000902217930003302226945001302259946001102272655001202283IND2123285120221119103644.0980610e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212328512DNAL7 a93005412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoenen, F.10aComparison of the pathogenic, antigenic and molecular characteristics of two encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) isolates from Belgium and Greece  ap. 239-244.  aThe pathogenicity of two porcine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) isolates for sows in gestation and young piglets was studied. One virus originated from a case of reproductive failure in pigs in Belgium and the other from a case of acute myocarditis in pigs in Greece. Sows in the mid-gestation period and one- to two-month old piglets were inoculated with each isolate. The molecular relationship between both isolates was studied by determining the nucleotide sequence located across the junction of the 1C and 1D capsid-coding genes. Antigenic analysis was performed using a panel of 35 monoclonal antibodies raised against an Italian field isolate of EMCV. All three approaches revealed differences between both isolates and also confirmed that there was no link between the two outbreaks of disease. 3aEncephalomyocarditis virus 3asows 3apiglets 3apathogenicity 3astrain differences 3areproductive disorders 3amyocarditis 3aantigenic variation 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aAntigens, Viralximmunology 2aBase Sequence 2aCardiovirus Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aDNA Primersxanalysisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aEncephalomyocarditis virusxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aFemale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Infectiousxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxmortalityxvirology. 0aBelgiumxepidemiology. 0aGreecexepidemiology. 0amolecular sequence data1 aVanderhallen, H.1 aPapadopoulos, O.1 aBillinis, C.1 aPaschaleri-Papadopoulou, E.1 aBrocchi, E.1 aDe Simone, F.1 aCarra, E.1 aKnowles, N.J.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 62, no. 3 p.239-244x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01880naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245010300155300001800258520077500276650001801051650000901069650001301078650001901091650002701110650002001137700002101157700001901178700001401197700001601211700001601227773014201243852000901385856007801394930003301472946001301505655001201518IND4421919920221119103355.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442191992DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.234472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qifeng10aRaft polymerization of MMA in the presence of ferrocene: A new way to realize the rate enhancement  ap. 3607-3615.  aFerrocene (Fe(Cp)₂) was added to a thermal initiation of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) with 2-cyanoprop-2-yl 1-dithionaphthalate (CPDN) as the RAFT agent at 115 °C. It was found that the polymerization was greatly promoted after the addition of Fe(Cp)₂ while retaining the characteristics of a typical RAFT polymerization. It was proposed that the formation of a redox initiation system, in which the poly(methyl methacrylate) peroxide (PMMAP) generated in situ as the oxidizer and Fe(Cp)₂ as the reducer, was possibly the reason for the interesting polymerization phenomenon. Such a redox initiation mechanism was further validated with ascorbic acid (VC) as the reducer instead of Fe(Cp)₂. 3aascorbic acid 3airon 3aoxidants 3apolymerization 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aredox reactions1 aZhang, Zhengbiao1 aZhou, Nianchen1 aZhu, Jian1 aPan, Qinmin1 aZhu, Xiulin0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 July 15, v. 47, no. 14 p.3607-3615dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.234473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02681naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245016200180300001600342500002400358520097000382650001101352650001601363650002501379650004301404650002201447650002601469650001401495650003601509650001601545650004101561650002801602650004801630650001401678650004801692650002901740650005201769650002301821650004101844651001001885651001001895700001301905700001701918700001701935773012901952852000902081856008502090655001202175IND4431698620221119103420.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443169862DNAL7 a200911502pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-009-9923-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Humin10aResearch on Florfenicol Residue in Coastal Area of Dalian (Northern China) and Analysis of Functional Diversity of the Microbial Community in Marine Sediment  ap. 245-249.  aIncludes references  aAn analytical method based on high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been developed to investigate florfenicol residues. Among 11 stations, florfenicol was detected in six water samples. The concentrations of florfenicol in the six samples were 64.2 μg L⁻¹, 390.6 μg L⁻¹, 1.1 × 10⁴ μg L⁻¹, 29.8 μg L⁻¹, 61.6 μg L⁻¹, 34.9 μg L⁻¹, respectively. These results showed that high levels of florfenicol were observed in water samples collected from stations influenced by aquaculture discharges. However, no florfenicol residue was detected in the sediment samples. Furthermore, the functional diversities of microbial community in four marine sediment samples were analyzed by Biolog microplate. For the sediment samples from the stations where antibacterials had been used, the functional diversity of microbial community was much lower than those from the stations where antibacterials were not used. 3acoasts 3aflorfenicol 3afunctional diversity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicrobial communities 3asediments 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aAquaculture 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aHalf-Life 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aThiamphenicolxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina1 aMa, Deyi1 aWang, Juying1 aHu, Jiangtao0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.245-249dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-009-9923-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01643naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007800165300001600243500002400259520077400283650001101057650002201068650001901090700001501109700001801124773012901142852000901271856008501280655001201365IND4431697120221119103633.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443169712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-009-9912-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiao, Kai Sheng10aAb Initio Theoretical Study of the Interactions Between CFCl₃ and SO₂  ap. 170-174.  aIncludes references  aAb initio calculations have been performed on complexes of CFCl₃ with SO₂. Ten complexes were found stable, the interaction energies that reflect their stability were corrected by the basis set superposition error and the correction of zero-point energy. The natures of these interactions were investigated by the analysis of natural bond orbital and the atoms in molecules. The results from theoretical calculation indicated that there were the interactions of Cl···O, F···O, Cl···S and F···S between CFCl₃ and SO₂, furthermore, the non-covalent bonds of Cl···O and Cl···S were the major interaction forces, which provided some data and information for studying the environment problem such as greenhouse effect relevant to CFCl₃ and SO₂. 3aenergy 3agreenhouse effect 3asulfur dioxide1 aWang, Fang1 aWang, Hai Jun0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.170-174dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-009-9912-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02527naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245016200159300001800321520131800339650001701657650001401674650002301688650001301711650001401724650002301738650003101761650001701792650001901809650001601828650001301844700002101857773014201878852000902020856007802029930003302107946001302140655001202153IND4421919020221119103619.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442191902DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.234262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiałek, Marzena10aEthylenebis(5-chlorosalicylideneiminato)vanadium dichloride immobilized on MgCl₂-based supports as a highly effective precursor for ethylene polymerization  ap. 3480-3489.  aEthylenebis(5-chlorosalicylideneiminato)vanadium dichloride supported on MgCl₂(THF)₂ or on the same carrier modified by EtnAlCl₃₋n, where n = 1-3, was used in ethylene polymerization in the presence of MAO or a common alkylaluminium compounds as a cocatalyst. The support type alter vanadium loading and also change the characteristic of the catalytic active sites. Et₂AlCl is the best activator for a catalyst which has been immobilized on a nonmodified support, whereas the systems which contain a carrier which has been modified by an organoaluminium compound reveal the highest activity in conjunction with MAO. That difference, together with different temperature effects on polymerization efficiency (i.e., decrease and increase of catalytic activity for increasing temperatures, respectively) suggest the formation of different types of active sites in the catalytic systems supported on modified and nonmodified magnesium carrier. However, all supported precatalysts possess a long lifetime, still being active towards ethylene polymerization after 2 h. All the systems yield wide MWD polyethylene, while bimodal MWD is found for some part of analyzed samples. Polyethylene with bimodal particle size distribution is formed with the system which contain modified carriers at higher temperatures. 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethylene 3amagnesium 3amagnesium chloride 3aparticle size distribution 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3avanadium1 aPietruszka, Anna0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 July 15, v. 47, no. 14 p.3480-3489dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.234263Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01900naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245009900175300001700274500001500291520075800306650001401064650002501078650001301103650001301116650001701129650001601146650001201162651001101174653001101185700001501196700001601211700002201227700002601249773007801275852000901353856009401362939003301456946001301489655001201502IND9204197620221119103651.0920709e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920419762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb05493.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-Cinco, M.E.10aMicrobial and chemical analysis of Chihuahua cheese and relationship to histamine and tyramine  ap. 355- 365.  a2019-12-04  aFreshly made Mexican white cheese, "Queso Chihuahua" obtained in Chihuahua and Hermosillo, Mexico, was analyzed.

In vivo bioassay with 1 day old Z. atratus pupae showed that the extract induces a negative inotropic effect on the heart. 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aTenebrio molitor 3aZophobas atratus 3abioassays 3aglycoalkaloids 3aheart 3apotatoes 2aAlkaloidsxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHeartxdrug effects 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInsecticidesxtoxicity 2aMyocardial Contractionxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPupa 2aSolanum tuberosumxchemistry 2aTenebrio1 aAdamski, Zbigniew1 aBednarz, Paweł1 aSlocinska, Malgorzata1 aZiemnicki, Kazimierz1 aLelario, Filomena1 aScrano, Laura1 aBufo, Sabino A.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.153-156dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-009-9921-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01848naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245009000170300001600260520084500276650001901121650001101140650001301151650002001164650004301184653001201227700001301239700001401252700001801266773007701284852000901361856009401370939003301464946001301497655001201510IND9204197520221119103500.0920709e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920419752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb05492.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Chan, E.10aSilica-based and polymeric columns for reversed-phase HPLC analysis of Cheddar cheese  ap. 350-354.  aOctadecyl polymeric (ODP) vs octadecyl silica (ODS) reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) columns were compared for analytical separation of water-soluble fractions extracted from Cheddar cheese. A polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer-based column did not resolve cheese water-soluble components. Good resolution was achieved on a vinyl alcohol copolymer ODP column as well as two ODS columns under optimized conditions of gradient elution, using increasing concentrations of aqueous acetonitrile containing ion-pair reagent. However, the ODP column had longer useful life characteristics. Use of phosphoric instead of trifluoracetic acid as ion-pair reagent produced a more stable chromatogram baseline and may prolong column useful life. ODP-RP-HPLC could be useful to monitor ripening of Cheddar cheese samples. 3aCheddar cheese 3asilica 3apolymers 3acheese ripening 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0acolumns1 aKwan, L.1 aNakai, S.1 aAmantea, G.F.0 tJournal of food science.g1992 , v. 57, no. 2 p.350-354x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb05492.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01664naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245007500173300001600248520076400264650001901028650000701047650001301054650001201067653001401079653001401093700001701107773007701124852000901201856009401210939003301304946001301337655001201350IND9204197820221119103528.0920709e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920419782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb05495.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsoubeli, M.N.10aInfluence of dairy proteins on aspartame stability in the pH 6-7 range  ap. 361-365.  aThe effect of three commercial milk protein products on aspartame degradation was studied as a function of temperature (4, 30, 70, 80 degrees C), pH (6 and 7), phosphate buffer concentration (0.01 M/L, 0.1 M/L) and protein (0-3%). Caseinates significantly decreased the pseudofirst order loss rate at low buffer concentration and higher temperature (70-80 degrees C), whereas the rate was faster in a presence of a casein/whey mixture. At high buffer concentration, the loss rate was not affected by protein. The protective effect may have been due to either a buffering capacity decrease caused by a protein/aspartame interaction that lowered pH or some unknown protein interaction.

Segmental pressures were recorded at six sites along the model at four different unidirectional flows (1300-4100 litre min-1), and the respective resistances (R) to airflow were calculated. The external nares and the larynx made the greatest contributions to the total resistance (R(TOT)) when no obstruction was present. Modifying the model to simulate severe pharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia (PLH) had no effect on R at the larynx or at any point in the trachea under these flow conditions. Two 16 litre anaesthetic rebreathing bags were attached to the bronchial end of the model, and tidal ventilation generated by a piston pump. Upper (nares to pharynx) and lower tract R (R(U) and R(L)) and R(TOT), and dynamic compliance were determined for pump volumes (V(p)) of six and 12 litres, at pumping frequencies (f(p)) of 20-100 min-1 while the airway was clear, and after modifying it to simulate either PLH or partial bronchial obstruction. Model condition had no effect on R(U). However, R(L) and R(TOT) were higher in the PLH simulated condition when f(p) greater than or equal to 90 and V(p) = 12 litres (P<0.05). This suggested that severe PLH may significantly interfere with airflow distal to the site of the lesions during high frequency, high volume ventilation of the type seen in galloping horses. With partial bronchial obstruction R(L) and R(TOT) were increased when f(p)>34 with each V(p). The applicability of the model was verified by comparing results from the unobstructed state with those from normal horses exercising on a treadmill. 3ahorses 3arespiratory system 3aexercise 3amodels 3afiberglass 3aair flow 3arespiratory tract diseases 2aAnimals 2aExercise Testxmethodsxveterinary. 2aHorse Diseasesxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aHorses 2aHyperplasiaxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aLarynxxpathology 2aLung Diseases, Obstructivexpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aModels, Anatomic 2aModels, Biological 2aPharyngeal Diseasesxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animalxphysiology 2aRespirationxphysiology. 2aRespiratory Mechanicsxphysiology 2aTidal Volumexphysiology 2aTracheaxpathology 0arespiration 0ablockage1 aSlocombe, R.F.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 62, no. 3 p.205-211x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01723naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245007900171300001600250520069600266650000900962650001900971650001600990650001201006650001801018650001401036700001501050700001701065700001701082700001801099700001801117773007701135852000901212856009401221939003301315946001301348655001201361IND9204198120221119103457.0920709e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920419812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb05498.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandolfi, I.10aD-amino acids in milk as related to heat treatments and bacterial activity  ap. 377-379.  aThe occurrence in milk of free and bound D-amino acids was investigated by chiral phase GC and related to heat treatments and bacterial activity.

The amount did not increase by pasteurization, UHT treatment, and sterilization. In contrast, the content of D-Ala in raw milk samples increased during cold storage at 4 degrees C, and it was suggested that D-Ala may be considered as an indicator of bacterial milk contamination. The presence of D-Ala, D-Asp and D-Glu detected in milk protein hydrolysates was due to hydrolysis conditions. 3amilk 3aheat treatment 3aplate count 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3aglutamine1 aPálla, G.1 aDelprato, L.1 aDe Nisco, F.1 aMarchelli, R.1 aSalvadori, C.0 tJournal of food science.g1992 , v. 57, no. 2 p.377-379x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb05498.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02281naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002500138245008000163300001800243520124500261650001801506650001101524650002101535650001901556650001301575650001201588700002201600700002201622700002401644773014201668852000901810856007801819930003301897946001301930655001201943IND4421918820221119103545.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442191882DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.233852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonkolewicz, Dominik10aRAFT polymerization kinetics: How long are the cross-terminating oligomers?  ap. 3455-3466.  aWe extend a new model for the kinetics of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The essence of this model is that the termination of the radical intermediate formed by the RAFT process occurs only with very short oligomeric radicals. In this work, we consider cross-termination of oligomers up to two monomers and an initiator fragment. This model accounts for the absence of three-armed stars in the molecular weight distribution, which are predicted by other cross-termination models, since the short third arm makes a negligible difference to the polymer's molecular weight. The model is tested against experiments on styrene mediated by cyano-isopropyl dithiobenzoate, and ESR experiments of the intermediate radical concentration. By comparing our model to experiments, we may determine the significance of cross-termination in RAFT kinetics. Our model suggests that to agree with the known data on RAFT kinetics, the majority of cross-terminating chains are dimeric or shorter. If longer chains are considered in cross-termination reactions, then significant discrepancies with the experiments (distinguishable star polymers in the molecular weight distribution) and quantum calculations will result. 3afree radicals 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3astyrene1 aHawkett, Brian S.1 aGray-Weale, Angus1 aPerrier, Sébastien0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 July 15, v. 47, no. 14 p.3455-3466dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.233853Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01798naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245010600170300001600276520069700292650001700989650001401006650001301020650002301033650001001056650002501066650002301091653001601114700001701130700001901147700001501166700001701181773007701198852000901275856009401284939003301378946001301411655001201424IND9301194720221119103432.0930225e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930119472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1992.tb14302.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrusa, K.J.10aAcceptability and sensory analysis of pork summer sausage from pigs administered porcine somatotropin  ap. 819-821.  aSummer sausages were formulated to contain 20% fat from the following raw meat sources: (1) pork and beef blend, (2) 100% pork from control pigs, and (3) 100% pork from pigs administered 4 mg/day porcine somatotropin (pSt).

However, Bmax was increased to comparable levels for both BZ-S and BZ-R isolates of each species when assayed by the less stringent gel filtration technique. These results indicate that the BZ-tubulin interaction in trichostrongylid nematodes is comprised of a minimum of two components. As similar levels of total [3H]MBZ binding were observed for both BZ-S and BZ-R isolates of each species when assayed by gel filtration, it is suggested that the reduction in the pseudo-irreversible BZ binding component in BZ-R isolates results in an increase in the level of reversible BZ binding and therefore provides a survival advantage to BZ-R nematodes. 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3adrug resistance 3amebendazole 3atubulin 2aAnimals 2aBenzimidazolesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aDrug Resistance 2aDrug Stability 2aHaemonchusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTrichostrongylusxdrug effects 2aTubulinxmetabolism 0abinding1 aLacey, E.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1992 May, v. 22, no. 3 p.399-402x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02612naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013400128300001600262500001500278520119500293650002101488650001501509650001501524650002001539650001001559650002101569650001001590650002001600650002001620650002201640650001501662650002301677650002001700650001101720650001401731650001401745650002301759650001901782650001801801650001301819650001701832650001901849653002201868653002001890700001901910700001901929773007901948852000902027939003302036946001302069655001202082IND9205007820221119103632.0920807s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920500782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, D.M.10aEffect of aluminum on relative yield and plant chemical concentrations of cereals grown in solution culture at low ionic strength  ap. 403-418.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of aluminum (Al) on yield and plant chemical concentrations were determined for 5 cereal species (18 cultivars) using a low ionic strength solution culture technique. The relationship between relative yield and solution Al activity was determined using polynomial exponential splines, and the Al activity (micromolar) at which yields were reduced by 50% (Al(RY50)) determined. Based on the yields of plant tops, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars Warigal, Sonora-63 and Scout were sensitive to Al (Al(RY50) < 0.5), and Cardinal, Waalt, BH1146, Atlas-66 and Carazinho were tolerant (Al(RY50) 1.4-3.3). Avena byzantina cv Acacia (Al(RY50) 0.9) was more sensitive and A. stigosa cv Saia (Al(RY50) 2.5) more tolerant to Al than the common oats (A. sativa) (Al(RY50) mean 1.8, range 1.4-2.4). Both barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivars, Kearney and Dayton, were sensitive to Al (Al(RY50) 0.3 and 0.8 respectively). The most consistent effect of increasing solution Al on the plant nutrient concentrations in the cereals was to decrease Mg and Ca concentrations in the tops by an average of 37% and 11% respectively, and decrease Mg concentrations in the roots by an average of 47%. 3anutrient content 3acrop yield 3aphosphorus 3ametal tolerance 3aroots 3anitrogen content 3astems 3aHordeum vulgare 3anutrient uptake 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAvena nuda 3anutrient solutions 3amineral content 3aleaves 3acultivars 3apotassium 3abiomass production 3aionic strength 3aphytotoxicity 3aaluminum 3aAvena sativa 3atrace elements 0amineral nutrition 0aplant nutrition1 aEdmeades, D.C.1 aChristie, R.A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 4 p.403-418x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02373naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142072001700159100001200176245012600188500001500314520092500329592002801254650001701282650001401299650002101313650003301334650000901367650001101376650001701387650001601404650002701420650001301447653002101460653002701481700001301508700001601521700002001537700001901557700002001576700001801596773010301614852000901717856008201726930003301808945002501841946001301866655001201879IND4426913120221119103545.0091005e20090411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442691312DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.14362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Gelation time during milk fermentation and apparent viscosity of yogurt stored for 3 days were the rheological parameters studied. The results revealed that the gelation time and apparent viscosity of yogurt were significantly affected (P < 0.1) by incubation temperature, starter culture level, and total solids. Incubation temperature had the greatest influence on the gelation time. Higher temperature led to shorter gelation time, but resulted in lower apparent viscosity of yogurt. Apparent viscosity of yogurt was mainly affected by total solids. Higher apparent viscosities were also obtained at lower incubation temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aviscosity 3ainoculum density 3aresponse surface methodology 3amilk 3ayogurt 3atotal solids 3atemperature 3acultured milk starters 3agelation 0astarter cultures 0arheological properties1 aLi, Dong1 aLi, Shu-jun1 aBhandari, Bhesh1 aYang, Bao-ling1 aChen, Xiao Dong1 aMao, Zhi-huai0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2009 Apr. 11, v. 5, no. 2dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.14363Available from publisher's Web site  a20100104b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle02367naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142100004300159245009300202520085100295592002801146650001601174650001901190650003801209650001701247650001801264650002601282650001401308650002101322650001201343650001301355650001101368650002101379650001401400650001101414650001501425650001901440653002001459653002401479700003901503700002301542700003201565773010201597852000901699856008201708930003301790945002501823946001301848655001201861IND4426916220221119103624.0091005e20090804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442691622DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.16082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

During the enzymatic degradation assays, it was observed that the addition of some essential nutrients in the formulation of the culture medium contributed positively in the cellulolytic enzyme production, with exception of riboflavin. Such results contributed in the establishment of an effective method for the evaluation of enzymatic activities in anaerobic fibrolytic fungi. In this work, nutrients added to enrich the culture medium have successfully proven that they can be used as inoculating agents (inductors) in diets rich in ensilage with law nutritive value.  aPublisher supplied data 3arumen fungi 3abeta-glucanase 3acellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase 3abiosynthesis 3aculture media 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3anutrient content 3aglucose 3anitrogen 3axylose 3aammonium sulfate 3acellulose 3asulfur 3ariboflavin 3afeed additives 0aanaerobic fungi 0aenzyme preparations1 aJorge Hernán Castro-Gómez, Raúl1 aSarrouh, Boutros F1 aSilva, Silvio Silvério da,0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 5, no. 3dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.16083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100105b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle03049naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245015000181300001600331500002400347520096700371650000801338650001001346650001901356650002201375650001301397650002201410650004801432650002901480650001201509650002401521650001201545650001901557650003901576650001601615650004501631650002301676650002001699650001201719650001701731650001101748650004201759650002801801650001301829650003001842650003601872650004901908650003001957650002101987650002302008650003402031650004602065650001702111651001302128700001902141700001902160700002102179773009302200852000902293856008502302655001202387IND4431695520221119103511.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443169552DNAL7 a200948462pmid7 a10.1007/s10528-009-9306-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, In-Nee10aCharacterization of Mutations in the FOXE1 Gene in a Cohort of Unrelated Malaysian Patients with Congenital Hypothyroidism and Thyroid Dysgenesis  ap. 141-151.  aIncludes references  aThe FOXE1 gene was screened for mutations in a cohort of 34 unrelated patients with congenital hypothyroidism, 14 of whom had thyroid dysgenesis and 18 were normal (the thyroid status for 2 patients was unknown). The entire coding region of the FOXE1 gene was PCR-amplified, then analyzed using single-stranded conformational polymorphism, followed by confirmation by direct DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing analysis revealed a heterozygous A>G transition at nucleotide position 394 in one of the patients. The nucleotide transition changed asparagine to aspartate at codon 132 in the highly conserved region of the forkhead DNA binding domain of the FOXE1 gene. This mutation was not detected in a total of 104 normal healthy individuals screened. The binding ability of the mutant FOXE1 protein to the human thyroperoxidase (TPO) promoter was slightly reduced compared with the wild-type FOXE1. The mutation also caused a 5% loss of TPO transcriptional activity. 3aDNA 3agenes 3ahypothyroidism 3aiodide peroxidase 3apatients 3asequence analysis 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAdenine 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCohort Studies 2aCongenital Abnormalitiesxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aForkhead Transcription Factorsxgenetics 2aGene Amplification 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGuanine 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHumans 2aHypothyroidismxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aPolymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aReference Values 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aThyroid Dysgenesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransfection 0aMalaysia1 aMusa, Maslinda1 aHarun, Fatimah1 aJunit, Sarni Mat0 tBiochemical genetics.g2010 Feb., v. 48, no. 1-2 p.141-151dSpringer USx0006-29287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-009-9306-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01992naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142100002200159245013900181500001500320520063100335592002800966650001200994650002801006650002301034650000901057650002001066650002501086650002001111650001401131653002801145653002701173653002701200653002601227700001901253700002101272773010301293852000901396856008201405930003301487945002501520946001301545655001201558IND4426913620221119103427.0091005e20090424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442691362DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.15072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The 21 SSR loci revealed 128 alleles with an average of 6.1 alleles per locus. The highest values of proportion of polymorphic loci (P) and gene diversity index (He) were obtained in the Northern (P = 1.00; He = 0.60) and the Yangtze River reaches and Southern populations (P = 1.00; He = 0.59). The lowest values were in the populations of the Yellow River reaches (P = 0.86; He = 0.44). The highest average number of alleles per locus (4.52) and number of unique alleles (7) were found in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau population. Cluster analysis revealed that together with the row type, strong eco-geographic variables influenced the classification. Associations of SSR and eco-geographic values were established for 11 SSR loci. Four to six markers were found to discriminate among geographic groups, which may serve as tools for diagnosis of the eco-geographic populations and provide evidence for the adaptive nature of SSR markers. 3aalleles 3abarley 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aClimate 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEcology 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aHordeumxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSelection, Geneticxgenetics 3aChina 0aChina1 aChen, Defu1 aVallés, María-Pilar1 aGao, Zhen1 aChen, Xiwen0 tBiochemical genetics.g2010 Feb., v. 48, no. 1-2 p.44-56dSpringer USx0006-29287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-009-9294-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03189naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245012100190300001400311500002400325520118000349650001801529650001201547650001601559650001301575650001901588650001501607650000901622650001701631650001901648650002001667650002101687650002701708650002001735650001001755650001001765650001201775650001201787650002601799650005801825650002301883650004501906650001601951650001101967650002201978650001302000650001702013650001502030650001102045650003102056650003702087650002602124650003002150650002602180650001702206700002602223700002702249700002002276700002202296773009102318852000902409856008502418655001202503IND4431696320221119103721.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443169632DNAL7 a200948432pmid7 a10.1007/s10528-009-9296-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, Rudranath10aMicrosatellite Variability and Its Relationship with Growth, Egg Production, and Immunocompetence Traits in Chickens  ap. 71-82.  aIncludes references  aVariability of microsatellites and a possible relationship with growth, egg production, and immunocompetence traits were estimated for six crossbred chicken populations of White Leghorn. Nine microsatellite markers were explored; an association study used the least square maximum-likelihood method on 170 birds of six genetic groups. Seven microsatellites were polymorphic, with two to four alleles. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of five markers was more than 52%. Microsatellites MCW0041, ADL0210, and MCW0110 were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with egg production traits. Genotype 33 of MCW0041 had the highest egg production, up to 64 and 72 weeks of age. Genotypes 11 and 13 of this marker produced the lowest number of eggs. The heterozygous genotype 34 of ADL0210 had the highest egg production, up to 52, 64, and 72 weeks of age. Homozygote 11 of MCW0110 produced the highest number of eggs, up to 28 weeks of age. MCW0041 was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with body weight at 28 and 40 weeks of age. No microsatellite was significantly associated with egg weight at any age, with age at sexual maturity, or with immune response to sheep RBC. 3aWhite Leghorn 3aalleles 3abody weight 3achickens 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aerythrocytes 3aheterozygosity 3aimmune response 3aimmunocompetence 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asexual maturity 3asheep 2aAging 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA Primers 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHeterozygote 2aHomozygote 2aHumans 2aImmunocompetencexgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aOvipositionxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSheepxblood1 aSharma, Ramashraya P.1 aBhattacharya, Tarun K.1 aNiranjan, Matam1 aReddy, B.

According to the maternal-preference offspring-performance hypothesis, females should choose oviposition sites that are optimal for offspring fitness. However, in thermally challenging environments, maternal oviposition behaviour may be constrained by the limited availability of suitable oviposition sites. We investigated nest-site selection in a nocturnal lizard [velvet gecko Oedura lesueurii (Duméril and Bibron)] that inhabits a thermally challenging environment in south-eastern Australia. The viability of these gecko populations is critical for the persistence of an endangered snake species (Hoplocephalus bungaroides Wagler) that feeds heavily on velvet geckos. Female geckos chose nest sites nonrandomly, with 87% of nests (N = 30) being laid in deep crevices. By contrast, only 13% of clutches were laid under rocks, which were the most readily available potential nest sites. Nest success in crevices was high (100%), but no eggs hatched from nests under rocks. Temperatures in nest crevices remained relatively low and constant throughout the incubation period (mean = 22.7 °C, range 21.0-24.5 °C), whereas thermal regimes under rocks showed large diurnal fluctuations. Geckos selected crevices that were deeper, had less canopy cover, and were warmer than most available crevices; in 85% of cases, such crevices were used simultaneously by more than one female. The thermally distinctive attributes of nest sites, and their frequent communal use, suggest that nest sites are a scarce resource for female velvet geckos, and that the shading of rock outcrops through vegetation encroachment may influence nest success in this species. 3aGekkonidae 3acanopy 3adiurnal variation 3aeggs 3afemales 3alizards 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3aoviposition 3aoviposition sites 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3arocks 3ashade 3asnakes 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aviability 3aAustralia 0acanopy cover 0acommunal nesting 0ahydric regimes 0aselection 0acrevice 0athermal regimes 0avelvet1 aWEBB, JONATHAN K.1 aShine, Richard.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2010 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.250-259dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2009.01353.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01926naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009900144300001600243520107200259650001001331650001901341650002001360650001601380650002301396650002001419653002501439700002101464773007201485852000901557939003301566946001301599655001201612IND9205013220221119103346.0920810e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920501322DNAL7 a167270602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenn, B.J.10aSeasonal effects on caprine response to synchronization of estrus and superovulatory treatment  ap. 579-585.  aNubian doelings (n = 21, 7 of which were repeats) were synchronized and superovulated with Norgestomet ear implants and follicle stimulating hormone-pituitary (FSH-p) and were then mated during early and late periods of their breeding season in the southeastern United States.

Literature experimental SFE data were used to estimate the cost of manufacturing (COM) of oils and carotenoids present in the crops, considering five main costs: fixed cost of investment, operational labor, utilities, waste treatment and raw material. SFE at 40C/300 bar, 50C/250 bar and 45C/300 bar presented the lowest COM for buriti, pupunha and PPF oils, respectively. The time of extraction determined the concentration of carotenoids in the oils. Under the conditions studied, the prices of SFE oils were higher than the selling prices of pressed oils, not because of the investment cost, but because of the raw material cost. Nevertheless, it is known that SFE oils are generally richer in carotenoids, which should determine higher selling prices and special uses for the product. Oils extracted from the pulp and shell of Mauritia flexuosa (buriti) and Guilielma speciosa (pupunha) and from the pressed fiber of Elaes guineensis (palm oil), all of which are Amazonian palm fruits, are rich in carotenoids. Recent studies have shown that supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) may be economically viable to obtain vegetable extracts. However, it is important to study the economical viability of this technology, because the investment costsare usually pointed as the main reason why there are still no SFE industrial plants in Latin America. Studies showing SFE viability and each cost impact for Amazonian plants may be decisive in order to influence South American companies to invest in this green technology. 3aBactris gasipaes var. gasipaes 3aMauritia 3abusiness enterprises 3acarotenoids 3acrops 3afruits 3alabor 3amanufacturing 3apalm oils 3aprices 3apulp 3araw materials 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3asustainable technology 3atrees 3avegetable extracts 3aviability 3awaste treatment 3aLatin America1 aASSIS, ANDRÉ R.1 aMARÓSTICA-JÚNIOR, MÁRIO R.1 aMeireles, M.

  1 aLi, Feng-Juan10aComparison of Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Activities of Pre-Fermented Douchi (a Chinese Traditional Fermented Soybean Food) Started with Various Cultures  aPre-fermented douchi, also called douchi qu, is a salt-free semi-product of a Chinese traditional fermented soybean food (douchi), which is classified into three types, that is, Aspergillus-type, Mucor-type and Bacteria-type. In this work, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor activities of douchi qu started by different types of cultures were compared. It was found that douchi qu fermented with Aspergillus oryzae, Mucor wutungkiao, Bacillus subtilis natto and Bacillus subtilis B1 showed significantly different (p < 0.05) ACE inhibitor activities with decreasing IC50 values of 0.4991, 0.3535, 0.2294 and 0.0901 mg/mL, respectively. Twenty-five fractions were separated by gel filtration chromatography and the strongest ACE inhibitor activity was observed in a fraction with high contents of glycine, lysine and arginine from B. subtilis B1 fermented sample. Results indicated that the type of starter cultures affected significantly the production of ACE inhibitors in douchi qu, and that B. subtilis B1 could be potential candidate as an inoculant to prepare fermented soybeans with strong ACE inhibitor activity in functional food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermented foods 3asoybeans 3astarter cultures 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aBacillus subtilis 3aenzyme inhibitors 3abiosynthesis 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 0adouchi 0adouchi qu 0aMucor wutungkiao1 aYin, Li-Jun1 aCheng, Yong-Qiang1 aYamaki, Kohji1 aFan, Jun-Feng1 aLi, Lide,0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2009 July 4, v. 5, no. 2dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.16613Available from publisher's Web site  a20100104b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle03700naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012000173300001600293500002400309520242500333650001402758650001902772650002302791650001202814650001202826650002002838653002502858653002702883653002702910653001802937653001802955653002902973653002503002700001603027700002003043700001903063773010703082852000903189856009203198655001203290IND4431606420221119103618.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443160642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02204.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, Justine D.10aTaxonomic homogenization and differentiation across Southern Ocean Islands differ among insects and vascular plants  ap. 217-228.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate taxonomic homogenization and/or differentiation of insect and vascular plant assemblages across the Southern Ocean Islands (SOI), and how they differ with changing spatial extent and taxonomic resolution. Twenty-two islands located across the Southern Ocean, further subdivided into five island biogeographical provinces. These islands are used because comprehensive data on both indigenous and non-indigenous insect and plant species are available. An existing database was updated, using newly published species records, identifying the indigenous and non-indigenous insect and vascular plant species recorded for each island. Homogenization and differentiation were measured using Jaccard's index (JI) of similarity for assemblages across all islands on a pairwise basis, and for island pairs within each of the biogeographical provinces. The effects of taxonomic resolution (species, genus, family) and distance on levels of homogenization or differentiation were examined. To explore further the patterns of similarity among islands for each of the taxa and groupings (indigenous and non-indigenous), islands were clustered based on JI similarity matrices and using group averaging. Across the SOI, insect assemblages have become homogenized (0.7% increase in similarity at species level) while plant assemblages have become differentiated at genus and species levels. Homogenization was recorded only when pairwise distances among islands exceeded 3000 km for insect assemblages, but distances had to exceed 10,000 km for plant assemblages. Widely distributed non-indigenous plant species tend to have wider distributions across the SOI than do their insect counterparts, and this is also true of the indigenous species. Insect assemblages across the SOI have become homogenized as a consequence of the establishment of non-indigenous species, while plant assemblages have become more differentiated. The likely reason is that indigenous plant assemblages are more similar across the SOI than are insect assemblages, which show greater regionalization. Thus, although a suite of widespread, typically European, weedy, non-indigenous plant species has established on many islands, the outcome has largely been differentiation. Because further introductions of insects and vascular plants are probable as climates warm across the region, the patterns documented here are likely to change through time. 3adatabases 3ahomogenization 3aindigenous species 3ainsects 3aislands 3avascular plants 0aBiological invasions 0anon-indigenous species 0aSouthern Ocean Islands 0aspatial scale 0asub-Antarctic 0ataxonomic homogenization 0ataxonomic resolution1 aSpear, Dian1 aGreve, Michelle1 aChown, Steven.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2010 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.217-228dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2009.02204.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02656naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124072001700142100002200159245012200181520134100303592002801644650000901672650001501681650001901696650001701715650002301732650002501755650001401780650002401794650002301818650001401841650001601855650002101871650002401892650002201916653001901938773010301957852000902060856008202069930003302151945002502184946001302209655001202222IND4426914420221119103622.0091005e20090627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442691442DNAL7 a10.2202/1556-3758.11912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSobukola, Olajide10aEffect of Pre-Treatment on the Drying Characteristics and Kinetics of Okra (Abelmoschus esculetus (L.) Moench) Slices  aThe effects of air temperature (50, 60 and 70°C), sample thickness (2, 4 and 6mm) and pretreatment conditions (hot water blanching, 1 and 3% sodium metabisulphite solutions) on the drying characteristics and kinetics of okra were investigated using a convective hot air dryer at a flow rate of 1.5m/s. It was observed that pretreatment conditions, sample thickness and drying air temperature significantly (P<0.05) affected drying rate. Drying rate increases as temperature of drying air increases from 50 to 70°C. The drying curve for all experiments occurred in the falling rate period with no constant rate period. Three thin layer drying models (Page, modified Page I and Wang and Singh) were evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and the reduced chi square (?2). The three models can appropriately describe the drying kinetics of okra slices considering the different experimental conditions. The effective diffusivity was determined using the Ficks model and was observed to vary between 1.125x10-8  9.93x10-9m2/s and 1.165x10-8  7.131x10-9 m2/s for treated and untreated samples. The Arrhenius-type relationship describes the temperature dependence of diffusivity coefficient and was determined to be 16.749kJ/mol and 22.437kJ/mol for treated and untreated samples respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aokra 3aair drying 3adrying quality 3apretreatment 3achemical treatment 3asodium metabisulfite 3ablanching 3ahot water treatment 3adrying temperature 3athickness 3adiffusivity 3adried vegetables 3amathematical models 3athin-layer drying 0ahot air drying0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2009 June 27, v. 5, no. 2dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.11913Available from publisher's Web site  a20100104b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle02357naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012300128300001800251500001500269520129200284650002801576650001601604650001001620650002201630650001901652650001701671650001901688653002501707653001101732653001301743653004001756653001401796653001201810700001301822773008301835852000901918939003301927946001101960655001201971IND9205009920221119103616.0920807s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920500992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmendros, G.10aStructural study on the soil humin fraction--boron trifluoride-methanol transesterification of soil humin preparations  ap. 1147-1154.  a2019-12-04  aThe boron trifluoride-methanol transesterification method was used to depolymerize soil humin preparations from three contrasted soil types in order to examine the presence of biopolyester moieties in these non-colloidal soil humic fractions. The humin samples were isolated physically from the soil (ultrasonic treatment and flotation) and purified by extractions with organic and inorganic solvents. Such humin fractions amounted to between 10-20% of the soil organic C and their CHCl3-soluble transesterification products (6-8.5% wt) were analyzed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. When subjected to transesterification, the humins yielded approximately equal amounts of aromatic and alkyl compounds. The former fraction consisted mainly of phenolic acids. The major constituents of the alkyl fraction were omega-hydroxy fatty acids, di- and trihydroxy monobasic acids and long-chain dibasic acids, in addition to epoxy monobasic acids, mono and dienoic fatty acids, and a minor proportion of n- and b-fatty acids and beta-hydroxy monobasic acids. The results obtained suggest that an important amount of lipid polymers, such are cutins and suberins, tends to accumulate in the soil humin fraction incorporating a series of compounds derived from microbial metabolism. 3aorganic acids and salts 3abiopolymers 3ahumin 3achemical analysis 3aesterification 3aforest soils 3abiodegradation 0achemical composition 0aorigin 0apolymers 0arecalcitrant soil organic fractions 0aisolation 0asources1 aSanz, J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g1991, v. 23, no. 12 p.1147-1154x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01960naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010300169300001600272500002400288520099500312650000801307650001001315650001001325650001301335650001701348650003001365650001501395700001701410700002001427773009301447852000901540856008501549655001201634IND4431695120221119103500.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443169512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10528-009-9302-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenol Tuncay, Serap10aIdentification of NF-κB1 and NF-κBIΑ Polymorphisms Using PCR-RFLP Assay in a Turkish Population  ap. 104-112.  aIncludes references  aA polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was used in a Turkish population to determine the frequency of polymorphisms of the nuclear factor-kappa (NF-κB1) and NF-κBIA genes, which have been shown to be related to several inflammatory diseases and cancer pathogenesis. Total genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples taken from 565 healthy volunteers living in Aydın Province. The genomic regions in question were amplified by PCR, and the polymorphisms in these regions were detected by a PCR-RFLP assay. The frequencies were 10.3% for the NF-κB1 −94ins/delATTG del/del genotype, 49.1% for del/ins, and 40.6% for ins/ins. The genotype frequencies of the NF-κBIA 3′UTR A → G genotypes were A/A 19.2%, A/G 42.3%, and G/G 38.5%. Distribution of genotype frequencies was tested by Hardy-Weinberg; the NF-κB1 gene was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ² = 3.402, P > 0.05), the NF-κBIA gene was not (χ² = 8.293, P < 0.05). 3aDNA 3ablood 3agenes 3agenotype 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3avolunteers1 aOkyay, Pinar1 aBardakci, Fevzi0 tBiochemical genetics.g2010 Feb., v. 48, no. 1-2 p.104-112dSpringer USx0006-29287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-009-9302-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01767naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011900131300001800250500001500268520054900283650001800832650003900850650003100889650002300920650001700943650000900960650001000969653001700979653001900996653001401015653002201029653002401051653002401075653001901099653002101118653001501139700002301154700002001177773008301197852000901280939003301289946001101322655001201333IND9205010320221119103626.0920807s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920501032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrubetskoj, O.A.10aCharacterization of soil humic matter by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of denaturating agents  ap. 1179-1181.  a2019-12-04  aThe humic materials displaced by a carboxylate resin from six genetically different soil samples were fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gel with urea and sodium dodecyl sulphate.

The metal-contamination was caused by applications of metal-rich sewage-sludge which ceased about 30 yr ago. Soil metal concentrations in the high-metal soils are now at, or a little above, current European Community limits. This work was designed to see if heavy metals decreased soil microbial biomass by decreasing the input of plant material to the soil or if the synthesis of microbial biomass is less efficient in the presence of heavy metals. Either or both of these mechanisms could explain the effects of heavy metals on microbial biomass in the Woburn experiment. Sunflower (Helianthus annus L., cultivar Sunbred 246) seedlings were grown for 31 days under controlled conditions (12 h day at 20 degrees C, 12 h night at 17 degrees C) in a low-metal or a high-metal soil from the Woburn experiment. From days 21 to 31 of growth the plants were supplied with 14C-labelled CO2 on alternate days. The final dry matter yield (shoots plus roots) of the plants grown on the low-metal soil was about 30% greater than that of the plants grown on the high-metal soil. The distribution of total C and 14C-labelled C between the various plant and soil compartments viz. plant shoots, roots, soil microbial biomass and bulk soil, were measured 2 days after the final 14(CO)2 labelling. The percentage distribution of 14C within shoots, roots, soil microbial biomass and bulk soil was quite similar in both soils. Plant-derived 14C-labelled organic C inputs into the high-metal soil were about 20% less than in the low-metal soil. About 35% less of this 14C-labelled C was in the microbial biomass in the high-metal soil than the low-metal soil at harvest. The plants caused an increase in total biomass C of about 22 and 42 micrograms C g-1 soil respectively in the high-metal and low-metal soil at harvest, about half of which was 14C-labelled in both cases. These increases in biomass were thus in the same ratio as those of the biomass in high-metal and low-metal soils taken directly from the field. These results suggest that both mechanisms (i.e. decreased inputs of C from plants to the soil and decreased efficiency of conversion of this C into new biomass C) operate in causing smaller biomasses in metal-contaminated soils of the Woburn experiment. The latter mechanism would appear more important than the former. 3anutrient content 3aHelianthus annuus 3arhizosphere 3aanimal manures 3aheavy metals 3asewage sludge 3adry matter accumulation 3acarbon 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil toxicity 3apopulation 3abiomass 3aroots 3apolluted soils 3ashoots 3aUnited Kingdom 0arespiration 0amicroorganisms 0asewage sludge amended soils 0agrowth1 aBrookes, P.C.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g1991, v. 23, no. 12 p.1169-1177x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02317naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009100162300001600253500002400269500001500293520100300308650002901311650002201340650001501362650001101377650002501388650001001413650002701423650002001450650002201470650001801492650001601510650002301526650002601549653001901575700001501594700001601609700001301625700001401638773012501652852000901777856008501786655001201871IND4431464320221119103411.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443146432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-009-0182-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Liming10aAgrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of SOD gene to Trichoderma harzianum  ap. 353-358.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTrichoderma harzianum is a soil-borne filamentous fungus that exhibits biological control properties because it parasitizes a large variety of phytopathogenic fungi. In this study the SOD gene was successfully transferred into the bio-control fungus Trichoderma harzianum with an efficiency of 60-110 transformants per 10⁷ spores by using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Putative transformants were analyzed to test the transformation by the southern blot. Antifungal activities of the transformants were examined under abiotic stresses. The transformants were exposed to 40°C for three days and 2 mol/l NaCl at 27°C for 5-10 days to assay antifungal activities with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The inhibition rates of the transformants, comparing to Trichoderma harzianum with no SOD gene transferred, were respectively 83.96% after 40°C and 60.13% after 2 mol/l NaCl. The results showed that the SOD transformants had significantly higher resistance to heat and salt stress. 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aSouthern blotting 3aparasitism 3aspores 3asuperoxide dismutase 3agenes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asodium chloride 3aTrichoderma lixii 3aAgrobacterium 3asalt stress 3abiological control 3aantifungal properties 0aHypocrea lixii1 aYang, Qian1 aSun, Kening1 aTian, Ye1 aLi, Hulun0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.353-358dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-009-0182-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01809naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245005600148300001600204520091300220650001001133650001901143650001801162650001801180650001201198650003301210650001101243650001501254650002701269653001901296700001701315773007201332852000901404939003301413946001301446655001201459IND9205013020221119103418.0920810e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920501302DNAL7 a167270582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGinnis, L.K.10aIn vitro development of ovine embryos in CZB medium  ap. 559-569.  aOne- to four-cell embryos were collected from multiparous crossbred ewes and were cultured in vitro for 120 hours in CZB medium.

The embryos were examined every 12 hours, and all of the embryos were stained with a DNA-specific fluorochrome after the 120-hour evaluation to enable the counting of cell nuclei. Embryo development was analyzed for cleavage beyond 16 cells as well as for cleavage to at least the compact morula stage based upon both the 120-hour morphological evaluation and nuclear counts. Forty-eight percent of the embryos passed through the in vitro developmental block (i.e., cleaved beyond 16 cells), and 26% developed to 30 or more cells. Neither EDTA nor glucose affected in vitro embryo development based on the nuclear counts. 3asheep 3aembryo culture 3aembryogenesis 3aculture media 3aglucose 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3amorula 3ablastocyst 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 0ain vitro block1 aYoungs, C.R.0 tTheriogenology.g1992 Mar., v. 37, no. 3 p.559-569x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02044naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011800126300001800244500001500262520095500277650002101232650001801253650001201271650001301283650002001296650001401316650002001330650001101350650001801361650001001379650001901389653002701408653001901435653001901454653001101473700001401484773008301498852000901581939003301590946001101623655001201634IND9205010520221119103423.0920807s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920501052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaughan, D.10aInfluence of phenolic acids on the sodium, calcium and chloride contents of Pisum sativum under axenic conditions  ap. 1191-1193.  a2019-12-04  aWe have reported (Vaughan and Ord, 1990, 1991) that phenolic acids, commonly found in soil solutions (Whitehead, 1964; Hartley and Whitehead, 1985), can have dramatic effects on the fresh weights and morphology of pea roots. These phenolic acids can also have substantial effects on the uptake of nutrients. Thus, for example, it has been shown (Kobza and Einhellig, 1987) that 0.5 mM ferulic acid can lower the amounts of P, K and Mg in Sorghum bicolor L. and Vigna sinensis (cowpeas) grown in syringic and protocatechuic acids contained less N, P, K and Fe than the untreated controls (Al Saadawi et al., 1986). In none of these studies were axenic conditions used to eliminate complexities which may arise from the presence of micro-organisms using the phenolic acids as carbon sources (Vaughan et al., 1988). Similarly, relatively few attempts have been made to elucidate the mode of action of the phenolic acids on nutrient uptake (Balke, 1985). 3anutrient content 3avanillic acid 3acalcium 3aexplants 3anutrient uptake 3achlorides 3ap-coumaric acid 3asodium 3aPisum sativum 3aroots 3atissue culture 0ap-hydroxybenozoic acid 0aphenolic acids 0aplant analysis 0agrowth1 aOrd, B.G.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g1991, v. 23, no. 12 p.1191-1193x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245019600175300001600371500002400387520117800411650003101589650002601620650002501646650002801671650002701699650002601726650001001752650001001762650002001772650002901792650002901821650001701850700002501867700002001892700003101912700002801943700002501971700002701996700002202023773012502045852000902170856008502179655001202264IND4431464520221119103658.0100115s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443146452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-009-0160-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrazzon, Ana Paula Guedes10aPrevalence of antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of tetracycline resistance mediated by tet(M) and tet(L) genes in Enterococcus spp. isolated from food in Southern Brazil  ap. 365-370.  aIncludes references  aEnterococcus spp. are opportunistic pathogens that are widely distributed in the natural environment. Two remarkable characteristics of enterococci is their intrinsic resistance against several of the antimicrobial agents routinely prescribed in the treatment of Gram-positive cocci, and their enormous capacity to acquire different genetic markers by conjugation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and the frequency of tet(M) and tet(L) genes in 112 Enterococcus spp. strains isolated from food. Fifty-two strains (64%) of Enterococcus faecalis, 10 (55%) of Enterococcus faecium, 2 (66%) of Enterococcus casseliflavus and 3 (42%) of Enterococcus gallinarum showed multidrug resistance. Tet(M) gene associated with or without the tet(L) gene was the most prevalent genotype found in food. Nine erythromycin-resistant and tetracycline-susceptible enterococci strains harbor silencing tet(M) or tet(L) genes were present in our investigation. In conclusion, antibiotic-resistant enterococci current in food may act as a reservoir of resistant strains creating a potential route of genes transference by horizontal gene transfer. 3aEnterococcus casseliflavus 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aEnterococcus gallinarum 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aantibiotic resistance 3afoods 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amultiple drug resistance 3atetracycline1 aGama, Bianca Almeida1 aHermes, Vanessa1 aBierhals, Christine Garcia1 aPereira, Rebeca Inhoque1 aGuedes, Arthur Gomes1 ad'Azevedo, Pedro Alves1 aFrazzon, Jeverson0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.365-370dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-009-0160-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03078naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001900196245011000215300001600325500001500341520154000356592002801896650001401924650002401938650001401962650001201976650001001988650001601998650001202014650001002026650001402036650002202050650002702072650001702099650002002116653002402136700002202160700002002182700002002202773009802222852000902320856008502329856007702414930003302491945002502524946001102549655001202560IND4375024720221119103745.0051006e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437502472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-005-3157-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPeña, Elpidio10aRelationship between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) gluten proteins and dough rheological properties  ap. 169-177.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper reports the correlation between the rheological properties of bread wheat dough and the types and quantities of endosperm proteins in 28 common wheat cultivars. Different methods were used to analyse the allelic composition of these cultivars and the relative quantities of the different proteins contributing to the gluten structure. Neither dough strength (W) nor tenacity/extensibility (P/L) correlated with allelic composition. Different wheats with the same allelic composition (i.e., with respect to glutenins) showed different rheological properties. The glutenins were the most influential components of W and P/L, especially the high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits and in particular the type x form. These proteins seem to increase W and are the main constituents of the gluten network. The gliadins and low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits appear to act as a “solvent”, and thus modify the rheological properties of the dough by either interfering with the polymerisation of the HMW glutenin subunits, or by altering the relative amounts of the different types of glutenin available. Thus, the protein subunits coded for by the alleles Glu-B1x7 and Glu-D1x5 stabilised the gluten network, whereas those coded for by Glu-B1x17 and Glu-D1x2 had the opposite effect. Dough properties therefore appear to depend on the glutenin/gliadins balance, and on the ratio of the type x and type y HMW proteins. The influence of external factors seems to depend on the allelic composition of each cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3abreadmaking quality 3aglutenins 3aalleles 3adough 3awheat flour 3agliadin 3awheat 3aendosperm 3aTriticum aestivum 3arheological properties 3awheat gluten 3aprotein content 0aprotein composition1 aBernardo, Angeles1 aSoler, Consuelo1 aJouve, Nicolas,0 tEuphytica.g2005 Jan., v. 143, no. 1-2 p.169-177dKluwer Academic Publishersx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-005-3157-z3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3electronic resource  a20051018b20051102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/10/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001900154245016000173300001800333500001500351520123300366650001501599650001701614650001801631650001501649650001401664650002301678650004301701650000901744650002401753653005101777653001601828653001901844653001901863653002601882700001501908773010501923852000902028856007702037930003302114945002502147946001302172655001202185IND4378582420221119103622.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858242DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052455j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The four different columns prepared showed a high percentage of protein exclusion using water as the mobile phase and provided an appropriate retention profile for a series of five cephalosporin antibiotics (cefoperazone, cephacetril, cephalexin, cephapirin, and ceftiofur). Chromatographic conditions such as washing time, buffer pH, and type and percentage of organic modifier were fully evaluated with respect to the protein elution profile and retention of the antibiotic by RAM column. One of these columns was chosen to develop and validate a method for the determination of cefoperazone in bovine milk. The system used in this work was composed of a RAM-BSA phenyl column coupled to a C18 analytical column. The standard curve was linear over the range 0.100-2.50 microgram/mL. The limits of quantification and detection were 0.100 and 0.050 microgram/mL, respectively. The developed method showed high intermediate precision (CV of 2.37-2.63%) and accuracy (90.7-94.3%) with adequate sensitivity for drug monitoring in bovine milk samples. 3acephalexin 3acefoperazone 3amilk analysis 3acephapirin 3aceftiofur 3afood contamination 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amilk 3aantibiotic residues 0arestricted access medium column chromatography 0acephacetril 0achromatography 0acephalosporins 0acolumn chromatography1 aCass, Q.B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1180-1187x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052455j3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02037naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001900151245011400170300001600284500015600300500002400456520087200480650001301352650002201365650001601387650002801403650002001431651000901451700002301460773014001483852000901623856009101632655001201723IND4464319520221119103707.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446431952DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhaffari, S.M.10aChromosome counts and assessment of two heterochromatic chromosomes in some species of Pistachia L. from Iran  ap. 389-393.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aKaryotype analysis of species and subspecies of Pistacia from Iran are reported.

It was predicted that the Stroop task would trigger greater consumption of ice cream than a fearful film, and that this effect would be more pronounced for binge-eaters than non-binge-eaters. More ice cream was consumed following the Stroop task, however both binge-eaters and non-binge-eaters consumed more ice cream after the Stroop task than the film-task. This data suggests that the ego-threatening Stroop test has potential as a standardized method for use in studies of stress-induced eating. 3abinging 3afood intake 3aheart rate 3awomen 3adieting 3apsychological stress 3aice cream 3aself-perception 3aingestion 3aanxiety 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBulimiaxpsychology 2aEatingxpsychology 2aEgo 2aEmotions 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIce Cream 2aStress, Psychologicalxetiology 0askin 0aelectrical conductance 0abulimia0 tAppetite.g2001 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.187-188x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02242naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001400151245015500165300001600320500015600336500002400492520092000516650001801436650001401454650001101468650001401479650002101493650001101514650001001525700002501535700001401560700001901574700001901593700001601612773014001628852000901768856009101777655001201868IND4464319820221119103737.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446431982DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouta, H.10aPreliminary results on the effects of different Pistacia species pollen on fruit characteristics of two commercial cultivars 'Mateur' and 'El Guettar'  ap. 405-409.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of the pollen parent (xenia) on seed and fruit characters are known to occur in several nut crops. For pistachio this phenomenon is under discussion. In this experiment, effects of Pistacia vera, P. atlantica and P. terebinthus pollen on fruit size and weight of two commercially grown cultivars (P. vera cvs. 'Mateur' and 'El Guettar') were tested and compared to an open-pollinated control. For the two cultivars it was concluded that fruits obtained by pollination with P. atlantica pollen, were better than those resulting from pollination by other Pistacia species and a significant difference was noted for some parameters measured. In contrast, no effects of the different pollinators were observed for kernel weight. For 'Mateur' the percentage of blank fruits was lower (6.76%) under open pollination, while for 'El Guettar' the use of P. terebinthus pollen gave the lowest percentage (19.46%). 3aPistacia vera 3acultivars 3afruits 3anut crops 3aopen pollination 3apollen 3aseeds1 aChelli Chaabouni, A.1 aGhrab, M.1 aBen Aïssa, I.1 aBen Mimoun, M.1 aHellali, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.405-409dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.623Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02500naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001700188245006900205300001800274520124500292650001701537650001801554650001901572650002001591650001001611650001601621650001401637650002401651650001401675650001701689653002701706653002301733700001901756700001701775773010501792852000901897856007701906930003301983945002502016946001302041655001202054IND4378584220221119103841.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858422DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051751t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aManzocco, L.10aModeling bleaching of tomato derivatives at subzero temperatures  ap. 1302-1308.  aThis work was addressed to obtain a predictive model of the rate of bleaching in tomato derivatives at subzero temperatures. To this aim, a tomato puree was freeze-dried and equilibrated at increasing solid fractions. The bleaching rate was assessed by measuring tomato color during storage for up to 18 months at temperatures from -30 to 0 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the tomato-bleaching rate was neither predictable using the Arrhenius equation nor simply related to tomato physical state. The lack of a clear Arrhenius relation was attributed to the occurrence of temperature-dependent phenomena, such as ice crystallization and oxygen solubility modifications, which strongly changed the local concentration of reactants. A modified Arrhenius equation predicting the tomato-bleaching rate in the entire temperature range was proposed. Tomato concentration, and hence its physical state, affected the temperature dependence of bleaching, modifying apparent activation energy and frequency factor of the modified Arrhenius equation. In light of these considerations, a mathematical model was set up and validated to accurately predict the tomato-bleaching rate on the basis of only its concentration and storage temperature. 3atomato puree 3afreeze drying 3afrozen storage 3astorage quality 3acolor 3acarotenoids 3aoxidation 3amathematical models 3aequations 3astorage time 0atomato color bleaching 0aArrhenius equation1 aCalligaris, S.1 aNicoli, M.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1302-1308x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051751t3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02497naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002000151245013200171300001600303500015600319500002400475520134900499650001801848650002101866650000901887650001101896650001501907650001101922650001001933773014001943852000902083856009102092655001202183IND4464320020221119103432.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446432002DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehboodi, B.Sh.10aCytohistological study of vegetative and reproductive meristems of male and female pistachio trees (Pistacia vera, cv.

Shoot apical and floral meristem samples were collected monthly, immediately fixed and stained with cytological and cytochemical staining. This study revealed that meristematic activity and leaf initiation begins in March and its activity continues until May when buds become dormant until the following spring. The vegetative meristem is flat, big, and pyroninophilic with a single tunica layer and a flat corpus. The initiating ring has high pyroninophilic cells with a large nucleus that divides in all directions. Transversal and longitudinal sections showed that leaves rise one by one in a spiral pattern and make two leaf helices. In mid April, a group of meristematic cells begins to divide and produce floral meristems at the axis of some leaves. These reproductive meristems then divide and produce floral meristems within floral buds. Reproductive meristems have 3-4 tunica layers and a voluminous corpus. The corpus has high activity and the whole meristem is very bulgy. In mid August each male flower meristem produces stamen primordia and then inactivates until March. Female floral meristems only produce sepal primordia and the production of floral organs occurs in March. Thus anthesis and floral organ formation are separated in time. 3aPistacia vera 3aapical meristems 3abuds 3aleaves 3apistachios 3ashoots 3atrees0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.417-422dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.643Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02968naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245010800143300001400251500001500265520148900280650001701769650001601786650002001802650002601822650002101848650001701869650001501886650001001901650000901911650002201920650001201942650001201954650002101966650003301987650001102020650004202031650001102073650000902084650000902093650001602102650003202118650002402150650001702174651001802191653000902209653001102218700001602229700001502245773006402260852000902324930003302333945001302366946001102379655001202390IND2324798720221119103519.0020113e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232479872DNAL7 a115621542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPovey, R.10aAttitudes towards following meat, vegetarian and vegan diets: an examination of the role of ambivalence  ap. 15-26.  a2019-12-05  aVegetarianism within the U.K. is growing in popularity, with the current estimate of 7% of the population eating a vegetarian diet. This study examined differences between the attitudes and beliefs of four dietary groups (meat eaters, meat avoiders, vegetarians and vegans) and the extent to which attitudes influenced intentions to follow each diet. In addition, the role of attitudinal ambivalence as a moderator variable was examined. Completed questionnaires were obtained from 111 respondents (25 meat eaters, 26 meat avoiders, 34 vegetarians, 26 vegans). In general, predictions were supported, in that respondents displayed most positive attitudes and beliefs towards their own diets, and most negative attitudes and beliefs towards the diet most different from their own. Regression analyses showed that, as predicted by the Theory of Planned Behaviour, attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control were significant predictors of intention to follow each diet (apart from the vegetarian diet, where subjective norm was non-significant). In each case, attitudinal ambivalence was found to moderate the attitude-intention relationship, such that attitudes were found to be stronger predictors at lower levels of ambivalence. The results not only highlight the extent to which such alternative diets are an interesting focus for psychological research, but also lend further support to the argument that ambivalence in an important influence on attitude strength. 3afood beliefs 3afood intake 3avegetarian diet 3abehavior modification 3afeeding behavior 3afood choices 3aprediction 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnimals 2aCulture 2aDietxpsychology 2aDiet, Vegetarianxpsychology 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRegression Analysis 2aSelf Concept 0aGreat Britain 0adiet 0avegans1 aWellens, B.1 aConner, M.0 tAppetite.g2001 Aug., v. 37, no. 1 p.15-26x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01703naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245010300169300001600272500001500288520060500303650002400908650001800932650001900950650001300969650002100982650002101003650001001024650001101034650001101045653002101056653001801077653002501095773008701120852000901207856005701216930003301273946001101306655001201317IND9301788020221119103354.0930329s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178802DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0884972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathur, J.10aIn vitro morphogenesis in Nardostachys jatamansi DC.: shoot regeneration from callus derived roots  ap. 419-422.  a2019-12-04  aCallus cultures of Nardostachys jatamansi DC. maintained on Murashige and Skoog's medium containing 3.0 mg.l-1 of alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid and 0.25 mg.l-1 of kinetin when shifted to medium containing 0.25-1.0 mg.l-1 of indoleacetic 3-acid or indole-3-butyric acid showed profuse rhizogenesis.

  1 aMpofu, A.10aGenotype and environmental variation in phenolic content, phenolic acid composition, and antioxidant activity of hard spring wheat  ap. 1265-1270.  a2019-12-04  aThe health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation observed would delay and/or complicate this process. 3acultivars 3aphenolic acids 3ahard red spring wheat 3aspring wheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3afood composition 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aCanada 0ahard white spring wheat 0aphenolic compounds1 aSapirstein, H.D.1 aBeta, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1265-1270x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052683d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02166naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245006600167300001600233500015600249500002400405520085100429650001501280650001901295650001901314650001201333650001301345650001401358650003801372650001201410650001001422650001501432650001201447700001401459700003001473700002501503773014001528852000901668856009101677655001201768IND4464322420221119103523.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446432242DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDicenta, F.10aResistance of almond cultivars to sharka (plum pox potyvirus)  ap. 577-579.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aSharka, a disease caused by plum pox potyvirus (PPV), affects some Prunus species including apricot, peach and plum, and to a lesser degree, sweet and sour cherry. Previously, in almond, different PPV isolates have been experimentally transmitted to the 'Aï' cultivar. Some of these infected almond plants even acted as a source of virus for aphid vectors, showing the potential role of almond as a source of virus in the spread of sharka. In this study, the resistance of nine important almond cultivars to a Dideron Type PPV isolate was evaluated in controlled conditions, by grafting the cultivars onto inoculated GF305 peach rootstocks. The results demonstrated the resistance to PPV of all assayed almond cultivars. They did not show any symptoms and were ELISA negative in comparison to the strong symptoms observed in the GF305 rootstock. 3aAphidoidea 3aPlum pox virus 3aPrunus cerasus 3aalmonds 3aapricots 3acultivars 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3apeaches 3aplums 3arootstocks 3aviruses1 aRubio, M.1 aGambín García, Mariano,1 aMartínez-Gómez, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.577-579dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03548naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001400151245009700165300001600262500015600278500002400434520205000458650001902508650001802527650001102545650002002556650001602576650001502592650001902607650002602626650001502652650001202667650001102679650001302690651001502703700001602718700001602734700001802750700001402768700002002782700001902802700001702821773014002838852000902978856009102987655001203078IND4464322320221119103509.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446432232DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoltz, B.10aEvaluation of pruning and fungicide sprays to control Botryosphaeria blight of Pistacia vera  ap. 569-575.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aBotryosphaeria panicle and shoot blight (bot) is a yield devastating disease of pistachio in the San Joaquin Valley of California. The objective of this study was to evaluate fungicide sprays and inoculum removal via pruning on a large scale in order to determine which control measure showed the greatest potential to reduce Botryosphaeria Blight while also being cost effective for practical application. Four treatments were studied: Botryosphaeria (bot) pruning combined with fungicide applications, bot pruning without fungicides, fungicides without bot pruning, and a control which received neither fungicide applications or bot pruning. In the 1999 and 2000 seasons bot pruning average $488/hectare ($197.5/acre) while fungicide applications averaged $489.46/hectare ($198/acre). Total blight management average $977.49/hectare ($395.58/acre) for the two seasons. In 1999 the fungicide/pruning treatment had less disease than the no-fungicide/pruning and the fungicide/no-pruning treatments, which also had significantly less disease when compared to the no-fungicide/no-pruning control. In 2000, the two fungicide treatments had significantly less disease when compared to the pruning/no-fungicide and control treatments. But the pruning/no-fungicide treatment still had significantly less disease when compared to the control. When green fruit yields were compared in 1999 the no-fungicide/ pruning treatment had the highest yield and it was significantly greater than the control, but there were no statistical differences when compared to the fungicide/pruning and fungicide/no-pruning treatments. There were no differences in yield in 2000, but differences in nut quality were observed between treatments, and payable yield was reduced by $600 when nuts from the fungicide/pruning treatment were compared to control nuts. This study suggests that an aggressive Botryosphaeria Blight management program should include both fungicide applications and inoculum removal through pruning in order to achieve cost effective disease control. 3aBotryosphaeria 3aPistacia vera 3ablight 3adisease control 3afruit yield 3afungicides 3ainflorescences 3apesticide application 3apistachios 3apruning 3ashoots 3aspraying 3aCalifornia1 aSibbett, S.1 aKallsen, C.1 aHendricks, L.1 aBeede, B.1 aMichailides, T.1 aTeviotdale, B.1 aFerguson, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.569-575dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02315naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245011100172300001600283500001500299520098900314650001901303650002101322650001801343650001501361650001301376650001401389650001501403650002301418650002001441650001401461650002301475650002501498650001001523650001001533650001101543653001801554653001501572700001501587700001301602700001601615773009201631852000901723856005701732939003301789946001101822655001201833IND9301787720221119103517.0930326e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178772DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0884942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValenti, G.S.10aAnatomical changes in Prosopis cineraria (L.) druce seedlings growing at different levels of NaCl salinity  ap. 399-404.  a2019-12-04  aSeedlings of Prosopis cineraria were grown in artificial substrates with additions of 0, 50, 100. 200, 400 and 600 mM NaCl. At an NaCl concentration of 600 mM the germination was greatly hindered. At 400 mM the radicles scarcely emerged. An anatomical study of seedlings grown in the presence of 0-200 mM NaCl showed that salinity induced structural changes in the roots, hypocotyls, epicotyls and leaflets. The secondary xylem differentiated earlier in treated plants than in the controls especially in the root and epicotyl as salinity rose. This could be an adaptive strategy to facilitate water transport. The number of water storage cells in the epidermal and cortical layers of the hypocotyls increased with salt concentration. Leaflets of seedlings grown in increasing salinity tended to show a less dorsiventral and more isolateral organization, and a greater thickness of leaf mesophyll. A preliminary comparison with other species of the genus Prosopis is briefly discussed. 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3adose response 3ahypocotyls 3asalinity 3aseedlings 3ainternodes 3aProsopis cineraria 3asodium chloride 3aepicotyls 3aseedling emergence 3acell differentiation 3axylem 3aroots 3aleaves 0aplant anatomy 0ainhibition1 aMelone, L.1 aOrsi, O.1 aRiveros, F.0 tAnnals of botany.g1992 Nov., v. 70, no. 5 p.399-404wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088494  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002200119024001900141040001800160072001700178072001700195072001700212100002400229245011500253300001600368506007600384520152900460506003701989650001402026650002002040650002002060650002202080650001602102650001102118650001202129650001302141650001202154653003402166653002902200653002202229700001402251700001402265700001802279773010202297852000902399856007702408930003302485945002502518946001302543655001202556IND4378699420221207065514.0060313e20060208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437869942DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05260832doi7 aPMC14448862pmcid7 a164481702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To meet the rapidly increasing industrial need for all kinds of esterases, especially enantioselective esterases used to generate highly pure chiral compounds, general substrates are necessary for rapid screening, monitoring, purification, and characterization. In this study, general fluorescent substrates including phenolic derivatives and alpha-cyanoesters were evaluated for sensitivity in detecting esterases in buffer systems. Results with two different esterases and different incubation times suggested that the alpha-cyanoesters examined were significantly more sensitive at detecting esterases than the corresponding tested phenolic derivatives. More importantly, alpha-cyanoesters, containing a secondary alcohol, possess at least one chiral center; thus, they are tools to screen for enantioselective hydrolysis. Results indicated that the enantioselectivity of esterases toward general alpha-cyanoesters strongly depended on the esterase and the substrate, but the majority of esterases examined preferred S-isomers to their corresponding R-enantiomers. Most appealing was the very high enantioselectivity displayed in cytosolic esterases of the house fly. The potential utility of such esterases is discussed. In addition, the use of alpha-cyanoesters as chiral fluorescent substrates was demonstrated for monitoring in enantioselective esterases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aesterases 3astereochemistry 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme substrates 3aenantiomers 3aesters 3ainsects 3abacteria 3aanimals 0achiral fluorescent substrates 0achiral alpha-cyanoesters 0astereoselectively1 aNishi, K.1 aGee, S.J.1 aHammock, B.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 8, v. 54, no. 3 p.694-699x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05260833Available from publisher's Web site  a20060512b20060607c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle02695naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245010000169300001600269520118300285650001501468650003101483650001501514650000901529650001801538650003001556650001501586650002101601650002901622650000801651650001501659650003401674653001401708653001501722653001601737653004001753653001701793653003501810700001501845700002001860700002101880700001701901773010201918852000902020856007702029930003302106945002502139946001302164655001202177IND4378698920221119103640.0060313e20060208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437869892DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052257s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Compared to ELISA detection of expressed proteins, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplification has easier sample preparation and detection limits are lower. Of the different methods of DNA preparation CTAB method with high flexibility in starting material and generation of sufficient DNA with relevant quality was chosen. Previous RT-PCR data generated with the SYBR green detection method showed that the method is highly sensitive to sample matrices and genomic DNA content influencing the interpretation of results. Therefore, this paper describes a real-time DNA quantification based on the TaqMan probe method, indicating high accuracy and sensitivity with detection limits of lower than 18 copies per sample applicable and comparable to highly purified plasmid standards as well as complex matrices of genomic DNA samples. The results were evaluated with ValiData for homology of variance, linearity, accuracy of the standard curve, and standard deviation. 3acorn flour 3agenetically modified foods 3atransgenes 3acorn 3afood analysis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA probes 3apromoter regions 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aDNA 3aextraction 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 0aBT11 corn 0aNK603 corn 0aMon810 corn 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0a35S promoter 0acetyltrimethylammonium bromide1 aGach, J.S.1 aVorauer-Uhl, K.1 aEngel, Eberhard.1 aKatinger, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 8, v. 54, no. 3 p.678-681x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052257s3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle02873naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001900171245015500190300001600345520142500361650004301786650002801829650001301857650001901870650001701889650002101906650001801927650001101945650001601956650002801972650002402000650001502024650001102039653001302050653001602063700001702079700001502096700002102111773010202132852000902234856007702243930003302320945002502353946001302378655001202391IND4378700520221119103612.0060313e20060208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437870052DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05812692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The herbicide norflurazon was added to established cell suspension cultures of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. VFNT cherry), to induce the biosynthesis and accumulation of the lycopene precursors, phytoene and phytofluene, in their natural isomeric forms (15-cis-phytoene and two cis-phytofluene isomers). Norflurazon concentrations, solvent carrier type and concentration, and duration of culture exposure to norflurazon were screened to optimize phytoene and phytofluene synthesis. Maximum yields of both phytoene and phytofluene were achieved after 7 days of treatment with 0.03 mg norflurazon/40 mL fresh medium, provided in 0.07% solvent carrier. Introduction of 14C-sucrose to the tomato cell culture medium enabled the production of 14C-labeled phytoene for subsequent prostate tumor cell uptake studies. In DU 145 prostate tumor cells, it was determined that 15-cis-phytoene and an oxidized product of phytoene were taken up and partially metabolized by the cells. The ability to biosynthesize, radiolabel, and isolate these carotenoids from tomato cell cultures is a novel, valuable methodology for further in vitro and in vivo investigations into the roles of phytoene and phytofluene in cancer chemoprevention. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3acell suspension culture 3atomatoes 3acallus culture 3abiosynthesis 3aisotope labeling 3aradionuclides 3acarbon 3acarotenoids 3aphysiological transport 3aprostatic neoplasms 3acell lines 3ahumans 0aphytoene 0aphytofluene1 aRogers, R.B.1 aLila, M.A.1 aErdman, J.W.

  1 aS, Supreetha10aRetention of Lysine in Foods Processed with Microwave and Conventional Heating  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of moist and dry heat processing on lysine content of selected foods was investigated. Two moist heat (open and closed vessel) and dry heat (microwave and hot air oven) methods were chosen for processing samples from cereal, oilseed and pulse groups with whey protein concentrate as reference sample. Unheated samples served as controls. The samples were analysed for protein content, available lysine by fluorodinitrobenzene method and for in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD). Results indicated that in moist heat-treated samples lysine retention was between 69  83%. Dry heat treatment resulted in a greater loss of lysine, which was proportional to the degree of heating. The retention of lysine in dry heat-treated samples ranged from 31 to 65 %. All heated samples had higher digestibility than their raw controls. In between methods of heating, the IVPD of dry heat-treated samples were slightly lower than moist heat-treated samples. It can be concluded that heat treatments increase the in vitro digestibility of proteins but lysine content was affected adversely.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestible protein 3arice 3apeanuts 3alysine 3aEleusine coracana subsp. coracana 3afood nutrient losses 3ain vitro digestibility 3asunflower seed 3apigeon peas 3ablack gram 3asoybeans 3awheat 3achickpeas 3afood processing 3amung beans 3aamino acid composition 3amicrowave treatment 0amoist heat processing 0asmall grains 0aheat treatment 0asmall cereal grains 0adry heat processing1 aTiku, Purnima Kaul1 aPrakash, Jamuna0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2009 Aug. 4, v. 5, no. 3dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.11463Available from publisher's Web site  a20100104b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/01/04  aOther US 7aarticle01098naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115242010800141245010500249300001600354500002400370520012200394650002200516653002400538653003000562700001900592700001600611773010800627852000900735939003300744945000800777946001100785655001200796991586752890742620221119103310.0830324e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aPAR830030412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamano Carvalho, T.L.10aAlterations of the human testicle in Chagas' disease.

In most studies of inheritance of self-compatibility, crosses between self-compatible and self-incompatible cultivars were studied. However, progenies from self-pollination are scarce. In this work, self-compatibility of 214 seedlings from self-pollination of 30 self-compatible selections, obtained by the CEBAS Almond Breeding Programme, was studied by means of fluorescence microscopy and stylar ribonuclease assay. Results showed that self-fertilization of self-compatible genotypes guarantees self-compatibility in the offspring and allows homozygous individuals for the Sf allele to be obtained. Both methods are reliable for assessing self-compatibility in this species. Furthermore, stylar ribonuclease assay allowed the determination of the S genotype in the progeny and detected some unexpected S-genotypes. 3aalleles 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3afluorescence microscopy 3agametophytes 3agenotype 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aprogeny 3aribonucleases 3aseedlings 3aself-pollination 3aselfing1 aMartínez-Gómez, P.1 aDicenta, F.1 aBošković, R.1 aTobutt, K.R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.229-232dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.323Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01667naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001500151245005800166300001600224500015600240500002400396520054600420650001100966650002800977650001701005651001001022700001901032700001701051700001601068700001701084773014001101852000901241856009101250655001201341IND4464307520221119103413.0121011s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430752DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodini, A.14aThe Amygdalus webbii Spach in Apulia (Southern Italy)  ap. 279-283.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aLand explorations allowed several sites of natural diffusion of many hundreds of individuals of Amygdalus webbii Spach. to be singled out in Apulia (Southern Italy).

ApN activity in mucosal homogenates of dog small intestine was reduced significantly in deficient animals (13.4 (1.1) nmol min-1 mg-1 protein, n - 5, P < 0.002) compared to healthy control dogs (95.1 (6.7), n = 22). Alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, zinc-resistant alpha-glucosidase, maltase, sucrase and lactase in the ApN deficient dogs exhibited comparable activities to those in the control dogs. Microvillar membranes were analysed by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. ApN was represented by a single 145kDa band in all control dogs, identified by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Protein maps from deficient dogs were normal apart from the virtual absence of an ApN spot and there were no apparent abnormalities in the glycosylation of microvillar proteins. The findings suggest that intestinal ApN deficiency in these dogs is a primary lesion involving diminished expression of an otherwise normal enzyme protein. 3adogs 3amembrane alanyl aminopeptidase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme deficiencies 3asmall intestine 3amicrovilli 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aAnimals 2aCD13 Antigensxanalysisxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aDogsxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensionalxveterinary 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxveterinary 2aIntestine, Smallxchemistryxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aLactatesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aMembrane Proteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aMicrovillixenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aPeptide Mappingxveterinary 2aSucrasexanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aalpha-Glucosidasesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2agamma-Glutamyltransferasexanalysisxisolation & purification.1 aLobley, R.W.1 aSorensen, S.H.1 aBatt, R.M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 63, no. 2 p.133-138x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02634naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245008100168300001600249500015600265500002400421500001500445520126300460650001701723650001401740650001101754650002201765650001401787650003001801650001301831650001001844650001201854650001201866650001801878651001301896653001001909700002601919700002701945773014001972852000902112856009102121655001202212IND4464301420221119103448.0121011s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430142DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Rong-Cai10aMolecular evolution and distribution of S-RNase genes among almond cultivars  ap. 213-220.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSelf-incompatibility (SI)-associated S-RNase genes represent an extreme example of allele polymorphism. We have cloned and analysed eight novel S-RNase cDNA sequences from almond (Prunus dulcis) cultivars of European origin. Insertions/deletions of 10 to 20 amino acid residues are present between RC4 and C5 domains in Amygdaloideae S-RNases. Synonymous and non-synonymous substitution analysis of the codon data identified positive selection regions. S-RNase genes of almond and sweet cherry and of apple and pear show little heterogeneity in substitution rates, however, significant difference was detected between the two subfamilies Amygdaloideae and Maloideae. Gene sequences of almond S-RNases were amplified by PCR with degenerate primers. The introns located between C2 and C3 are very different in sizes, ranging from 80 to 1100 bp. However, these introns display conserved features in primary sequences. S-allele specific PCR, coupled with RFLP analysis of the PCR products was performed to identify S-genotypes of almond cultivars mainly from Portugal. Up to now, twenty-four almond cultivars were identified genotypically. Some S-allele combinations were further confirmed by comparing the data of S-allele analysis with those of breeding tests. 3aPrunus avium 3acultivars 3aapples 3acomplementary DNA 3aevolution 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abreeding 3apears 3aalmonds 3aintrons 3aPrunus dulcis 3aPortugal 0agenes1 aSánchez, Ana María,1 aOliveira, M.

Valnemulin showed exceptional activity against M hyopneumoniae (MIC90 0.0005 microgram ml-1) and M hyosynoviae (MIC range 0.0001 microgram ml-1 to 0.00025 microgram ml-1) field strains. Tiamulin was 100-fold less active (MIC90 0.05 microgram ml-1) and enrofloxacin 20-fold less active (MIC90 0.01 microgram ml-1) than valnemulin against M hyopneumoniae field isolates and 20-fold to 25-fold less active (MIC range 0.0025 microgram ml-1 to 0.005 microgram ml-1) and 400-fold to 500-fold less active (MIC range 0.05 microgram ml-1 to 0.1 microgram ml-1) respectively against M hyosynoviae field isolates. No significant resistance developed to valnemulin or tiamulin in the type strain of M hyopneumoniae (strain J) or in a recent field isolate (MEVT G23) exposed to 10 in vitro passages in broths containing these antibiotics. Only slight resistance to oxytetracycline was observed. High resistance to tylosin developed in both M hyopneumoniae strains within five to seven in vitro passages in tylosin-containing broth. Providing that similar results are obtained in vivo under field conditions, valnemulin may well prove to be effective in the treatment of enzootic pneumonia and acute polyarthritis in pigs. 3aenrofloxacin 3atylosin 3atiamulin 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3aoxytetracycline 3aMycoplasma hyosynoviae 3adrug resistance 0ain vitro 0aantimicrobial agents 0abiological resistance 0aanti-infective agents1 aWindsor, H.M.1 aRipley, P.H.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 63, no. 2 p.157-160x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle00898naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115242002000134245002100154300001600175500002400191520010700215650001400322653002000336700002400356773017900380852000900559939003300568945000800601946001100609655001200620991586751070742620221119103514.0830324e198203  xx |||||o|||||||||||spa||7 aPAR830027932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaya Munoz, J.10aHepatic abscess10aAbsceso hepatico  ap. 265-270.  aSummary in English.  ahepatic abscess, human amoebic and pyogenic, clinical review (diagnosis, etiology, therapy, prognosis) 3aamebiasis 0aAbscess, Amebic1 aGonzalez Calvin, J.0 tRevista Espanola de las Enfermedades del Aparato Digestivo.

Only a small fraction of these microbial encounters result in pathogenic or symbiotic interactions, whilst the majority appear to give rise to commensalistic or mutualistic associations. Considering the abundance of the latter associations the question arises whether plants evolved, besides the plant immune system, other dedicated mechanisms to communicate with and to host microbial communities in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere. We hypothesize that the constitutive and microbe-induced secretion of specialized plant-derived biomolecules creates a critical interface for all types of plant-microbe associations. Thus, the plant secretory machinery might serve an important role in establishing an extended phenotype with microbial life. 3aplant secretions and exudates 3arhizosphere 3aphyllosphere 3aphytochemicals 3aplant pathogens 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acell physiology 3asoil microorganisms 3acell membranes 3aimmune response 3amutualism 3aplant ecology 3aplant physiology 3acommensalism 3aABC transporters 3aplant proteins 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aMicrobial Interactions 2aPlantsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSNARE Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 0aliterature reviews 0aimmunity 0abiological resistance 0asymbiosis 0aadaptation1 aKwon, Chian1 aSchulze-Lefert, Paul0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2010 Aug. 1, v. 13, no. 4 p.378-387dPergamonx1369-52667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2010.05.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20101209b20110101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02893naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009100147300001600238520107200254650002601326650003001352650002301382650002301405650001401428650002501442650001201467650001801479650004301497650001001540650001001550650001401560650001101574650003501585650002201620650005101642650000901693650005001702650001101752650007901763650005201842650004601894650001001940650004401950650001201994653002702006653001802033653005802051700002002109700002402129773008402153852000902237930003302246945001302279946001102292655001202303IND2138051120221119103515.0980807e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213805112DNAL7 a94292492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTownsend, K.M.10aREP-PCR analysis of Pasteurella multocida isolates that cause haemorrhagic septicaemia  ap. 151-155.  aAmplification of multiple P multocida genomic DNA fragments by outwardly-direct ed primers based on the repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) consensus sequence, generated complex profiles in a PCR-based fingerprinting method known as REP-PCR. Polymorphisms within REP-PCR profiles were used to characterise 38 isolates of P multocida. The high degree of homogeneity observed among haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) strains of serotype B and E provided evidence of a disease-associated REP profile that may serve as a novel method for the identification of HS strains regardless of serotype. REP-PCR profiles of other P multocida serotypes were highly variable, illustrating the potential of this technique for the molecular fingerprinting of fowl cholera or atrophic rhinitis isolates. A specific amplified REP fragment was isolated and used to probe membrane-bound digested P multocida genomic DNA. Hybridisation patterns not only distinguished HS-causing isolates from non-HS P multocida, but also demonstrated a degree of relatedness between HS and HS-like strains. 3aPasteurella multocida 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA fingerprinting 3astrain differences 3avirulence 3arepetitive sequences 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBird Diseasesxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aBirds 2aBison 2aBuffaloes 2aCattle 2aDNA Fingerprintingxveterinary 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDeer 2aHemorrhagic Septicemiaxetiologyxveterinary. 2aHumans 2aPasteurella multocidaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aTurkeys 0ahemorrhagic septicemia 0aheterogeneity 0arepetitive extragenic palindromic consensus sequences1 aDawkins, H.J.S.1 aPapadimitriou, J.M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 63, no. 2 p.151-155x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02705naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001900173245005500192300001600247500009500263500002400358500001500382520081400397650002601211650001901237650003201256650001201288650001601300650002301316650003301339650001801372650002301390650002001413650001701433650002701450650001601477650002001493650002301513650003001536650001201566650004101578650002101619650005001640650001401690653002301704653002601727653002601753700002701779700002001806773010201826852000901928856008501937930003302022945002502055946001102080655001202091IND4440611720221119103522.0100730e20100801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444061172DNAL7 a204665832pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2010.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aHann, Dagmar R10aBacterial virulence effectors and their activities  ap. 388-393.  aIn the special issue: Biotic interactions / edited by Jane E.

Each bacterial strain possesses a set of 20-30 effectors which have overlapping activities, are functionally interchangeable, and diverge in composition between strains. Effectors target host molecules to suppress immunity. Two main strategies are apparent. Effectors that target host proteins seem to attack conserved structural domains but otherwise lack specificity. On the other hand, those that influence host gene transcription directly do so with extreme specificity. In both cases, examples are known where the host has exploited effector-target affinities to establish immune recognition of effectors. The molecular activity of each effector links virulence and immune outcomes. 3atranscription factors 3aimmune evasion 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aenzymes 3ahost plants 3astrain differences 3abacterial diseases of plants 3apathogenicity 3abacterial proteins 3aimmune response 3apathogenesis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3aPseudomonas 3aenzyme activity 3adefense mechanisms 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aPlantsxenzymologyximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aVirulence 0aliterature reviews 0aresistance mechanisms 0abiological resistance1 aGimenez-Ibanez, Selena1 aRathjen, John P0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2010 Aug. 1, v. 13, no. 4 p.388-393dPergamonx1369-52667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2010.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20101209b20110101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245008400143300001600227500001500243520095600258650001801214650001601232650001701248650001101265650002201276650001101298650001701309650001701326650001401343650001401357650001401371650005701385650001201442650002501454650003101479650004001510650003101550650001101581650003701592650004201629650005901671650004001730650003801770650000901808650004101817653002801858653002301886653002201909653001201931700001801943700001701961700001901978700002101997700001702018773008402035852000902119930003302128945001302161946001102174655001202185IND2138050920221119103715.0980807e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213805092DNAL7 a94292482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNair, J.10aEvaluation of a competitive immunoassay for the detection of bovine haptoglobin  ap. 145-149.  a2019-12-05  aA competitive immunoassay to quantify the serum concentration of bovine haptoglobin (hp) using time resolved fluorescence was compared with an indirect method of hp assay (haemoglobin binding assay), using sera taken from healthy animals (n=158), animals experimentally infected with Haemophilus somnus (n=10) and from sick animals requiring veterinary treatment (n=440). Upper limits of normality (for normal animals) were tentatively established for the immunoassay (2.1 micrograms ml-1) and for the haemoglobin binding assay (103 micrograms ml-1).

However, these parameters (serum globulin and copper) were found to be insensitive markers of inflammatory disease. 3aserum albumin 3ablood serum 3aimmunoassays 3acopper 3aHaemophilus somni 3acattle 3ahaptoglobins 3aerythrocytes 3acytolysis 3adetection 3aglobulins 2aAcute-Phase Reactionxbloodxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCattlexbloodxmetabolism. 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCopperxbloodxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGlobulinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHaemophilusxisolation & purification 2aHaemophilus Infectionsxbloodxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aHaptoglobinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aImmunoassayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aSerum Albuminxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aexperimental infections 0aHaemophilus somnus 0aacute phase serum 0aillness1 aKennedy, D.G.1 aBryson, D.G.1 aReilly, G.A.C.1 aMcDowell, S.W.J.1 aMackie, D.P.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 63, no. 2 p.145-149x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03515naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100002300193245007400216300001600290500002400306500001500330520179700345650002702142650000902169650002202178650002302200650001702223650001902240650002802259650002302287650001102310650002102321650001802342650002202360650002302382650002402405650001602429650002302445651001202468651003802480651002702518653002402545653002202569653002402591700002302615773010902638852000902747856008802756930003302844945002502877946001102902655001202913IND4440610920221119103706.0100730e20100730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444061092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aL300 0aP000 0aK001 0aK2501 aBeschta, Robert L.10aMexican wolves, elk, and aspen in Arizona: Is there a trophic cascade  ap. 915-922.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn 1998, Mexican gray wolves (Canis lupus baileyi) were introduced into the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area (BRWRA) that spans adjacent portions of Arizona and New Mexico. In 2009 we selected three mixed-conifer sites on the Apache National Forest, within the BRWRA of east-central Arizona, to characterize long-term age structure of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and to check for the possible occurrence of a tri-trophic cascade involving Mexican wolves, Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni), and aspen. These mixed-conifer sites included (a) a refugium site, (b) an old-growth site, and (c) a site thinned in 1991-1992. The refugium site was inaccessible to elk and cattle whereas the old-growth and thinned sites were accessible to elk, but not cattle. Age structure results indicated that aspen recruitment (i.e., the growth of sprouts/seedlings into tall saplings, poles, and eventually trees) at the refugium site had been ongoing over a period of many decades. In contrast, aspen recruitment at the old-growth and thinned sites decreased significantly (p <0.05) during the two most recent decades when elk populations, as indexed by annual harvest levels, were relatively “high”. From 2000 to 2008, only 2.9 Mexican wolves per 1000 elk were present on the Apache National Forest compared to 9.3 western gray wolves (Canis lupus occidentalis) per 1000 elk in Yellowstone National Park where tri-trophic cascades involving wolves, elk, and aspen have been reported. The low number of Mexican wolves relative to their primary prey (elk) suggests that an ecologically effective density of wolves has not become established in east-central Arizona. Furthermore, the lack of recent aspen recruitment in stands accessible to elk indicates an absence, to date, of a tri-trophic cascade. 3aspecies reintroduction 3aelks 3aprotected species 3athreatened species 3aforest trees 3aforest surveys 3atritrophic interactions 3aconiferous forests 3awolves 3anational forests 3aforest stands 3aforest ecosystems 3apopulation density 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aCanis lupus 3aconservation areas 3aArizona 3aApache-Sitgreaves National Forest 0aApache National Forest 0awildlife management 0aMexican gray wolf 0aCanis lupus baileyi1 aRipple, William J.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 July 30, v. 260, no. 5 p.915-922dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.06.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02525naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245008300151300001600234500002400250500002300274520132000297650002301617650001901640650001001659650002001669650001401689650001501703650002301718650001501741650001101756650001801767651001101785700002101796700001401817700001101831700001401842700001701856700001601873700001601889773009001905852000901995856007502004655001202079IND4464303820221119103530.0121011s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430382DNAL7 a10.4141/S01-0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, W.N.10aTesting the DNDC model using N2O emissions at two experimental sites in Canada  ap. 365-374.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aMeasured data from two experimental sites in Canada were used to test the ability of the DeNitrification and DeComposition model (DNDC) to predict N2O emissions from agricultural soils. The two sites, one from eastern Canada, and one from western Canada, provided a variety of crops, management practices, soils, and climates for testing the model. At the site in eastern Canada, the magnitude of total seasonal N2O flux from the seven treatments was accurately predicted with a slight average over-prediction (ARE) of 3% and a coefficient of variation of 41%. Nitrous oxide emissions based on International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) methodology had a relative error of 62% for the seven treatments. The DNDC estimates of total yearly emissions of N2O from the field site in western Canada showed an underestimation of 8% for the footslope landscape position and an overestimation of 46% for the shoulder position. The data input for the DNDC model were not of sufficient detail to characterize the moisture difference between the landscape positions. The estimates from IPCC guidelines showed an underestimation of 54% for the footslope and an overestimation of 161% for the shoulder. The results indicate that the DNDC model was more accurate than IPCC methodology at estimating N2O emissions at both sites. 3aagricultural soils 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adenitrification 3aemissions 3aguidelines 3alandscape position 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3aCanada1 aDesjardins, R.L.1 aGrant, B.1 aLi, C.1 aLemke, R.1 aRochette, P.1 aCorre, M.D.1 aPennock, D.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2002 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.365-374x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S01-0483Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02978naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245009700155300001600252500002400268500002300292520149500315650001901810650001901829650001201848650002001860650001301880650001801893650002701911650001101938650001201949650001401961650001401975650002101989650001602010650001302026650001802039650002302057650002002080650001702100650002402117650001802141650002302159650001202182650002202194650001702216651001202233700001702245773009002262852000902352856007502361655001202436IND4464303920221119103628.0121011s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430392DNAL7 a10.4141/S01-0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcPherson, T.S.10aAmelioration of degraded soils under red pine plantations on the Oak Ridges Moraine, Ontario  ap. 375-388.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aSoil degradation and subsequent amelioration were studied on soil chronosequences of old-growth forest, abandoned fields, and young and mature conifer plantations on the Oak Ridges Moraine, an environmentally vulnerable landform near Toronto threatened by encroaching urban development. The chronosequences reflect a history of pre-settlement deforestation, exploitive pioneer agriculture and ensuing land abandonment that led to soil fallowing and/or wind erosion in the 1920s followed by soil stabilization after extensive planting with red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.). Key pedogenic processes were identified and rates and magnitude of soil recovery were quantified in terms of morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of soil profiles. Soil degradation generally involved reduced fertility with profile simplification (haploidization) on non-eroded fallowed fields, and topsoil loss by wind erosion (deflation) on more exposed eroded fields. After reforestation, soil restoration was characterized by cessation of erosion, accelerated horizon development and differentiation, reduced soil bulk density, and increased fertility and acidification of the soil. Chronofunctions revealed substantial recovery in soil organic C, total N, available P, and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg status within 75 yr of initial reforestation on non-deflated, fallowed sites. In contrast, estimated recovery of these parameters on severely deflated sites was delayed far beyond plantation maturity. 3aPinus resinosa 3aabandoned land 3acalcium 3achronosequences 3aconifers 3adeforestation 3aexchangeable potassium 3afallow 3aforests 3alandforms 3amagnesium 3anitrogen content 3aplantations 3aplanting 3areforestation 3asoil acidification 3asoil amendments 3asoil density 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil stabilization 3atopsoil 3aurban development 3awind erosion 3aOntario1 aTimmer, V.R.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2002 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.375-388x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S01-0843Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02684naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245008100154300001600235500002400251500002300275520159700298650001301895650000801908650001201916650001201928650000901940650001801949650001501967650001801982650001502000650001302015650001402028650001302042650002002055650001302075650001202088773009002100852000902190856007502199655001202274IND4464303620221119102857.0121011s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430362DNAL7 a10.4141/S01-0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheppard, S.C.10aThree approaches to define the ecotoxicity threshold for atmospheric ammonia  ap. 341-354.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aAtmospheric NH3 is potentially toxic to terrestrial plants, and there are other environmental effects such as haze from (NH4)2SO4 aerosols and N enrichment of ecosystems that are normally very low in N. Toxic levels can arise from atmospheric releases from livestock operations. Plants detoxify NH3 by incorporation of the N into the plant, so direct toxic effects are most likely when plants are growing slowly, as in cold weather. Indirect effects include leaching of nitrates and cations, and cation imbalances, and are most likely in N-poor, non-agronomic settings. The concentrations in air that cause direct toxic effects were summarized, and the corresponding "expected no effect value" (ENEV) was established at 35 nmol NH3 mol-1(48 µg m-3). Critical loads, the threshold flux density of NHx-N to the landscape that causes detrimental effects, were also summarized. The critical load was 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Using deposition velocity values from the literature (0.3 to 3.6 cm s-1), the ENEV implies a load flux of 24 to 290 kg N ha-1 yr-1. This is above the critical load, suggesting that critical loads to the landscape are more limiting than are direct toxic effects on plants. Another novel approach was to define an ENEV as the mean compensation point (ENEVcp). Compensation point is the atmospheric concentration below which plants emit NH3 and above which they absorb NH3. Compensation point data were summarized and the ENEVcp was established at 3.7 nmol mol-1 (5.1 µg m-3). This coincides with a load flux of 4.8 to 58 kg N ha-1 yr-1, more consistent with the critical loads. 3aaerosols 3aair 3aammonia 3acations 3acold 3acritical load 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3alandscapes 3aleaching 3alivestock 3anitrates 3aplants (botany) 3atoxicity 3aweather0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2002 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.341-354x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S01-0293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02030naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245009900153300001600252500002400268500002300292520104100315650002301356650001401379650000901393650001901402650001301421650001801434650001201452650000901464650002001473700001301493773009001506852000901596856007501605655001201680IND4464303520221119102858.0121011s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446430352DNAL7 a10.4141/S01-0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColucci, M.S.10aDissipation of part per trillion concentrations of estrogenic hormones from agricultural soils  ap. 335-340.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aEstrogenic hormones can affect fish at extremely low aquatic concentrations. A study was therefore undertaken to determine if agricultural soils, which can receive steroidal estrogenic hormones via livestock, poultry or municipal biosolids, could dissipate ng kg-1 soil concentrations of 17ß -estradiol or 17α-ethynylestradiol. Incubations with [4-14C]-17ß-estradiol, [6,7-3H(N)]-17ß-estradiol and [6,7-3H(N)]-17α-ethynylestradiol revealed that the major pathway of hormone dissipation was formation of soil-bound, non-extractable residues. The dissipation kinetics and pathways of both these compounds at these very low concentrations were entirely consistent with those previously observed at 1000-fold higher concentrations. We conclude that, in the absence of preferential or surface flow, very low concentrations of hormones can be expected to be dissipated, and the risk of contamination of water adjacent to agricultural soils treated with estrogen-containing biosolids during a temperate growing season is likely to be low. 3aagricultural soils 3abiosolids 3afish 3agrowing season 3ahormones 3aoverland flow 3apoultry 3arisk 3awater pollution1 aTopp, E.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2002 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.335-340x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S01-0793Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02910naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010800143300001600251520120200267650001201469650001101481650001501492650001301507650001001520650001601530650001801546650001701564650001201581650002301593650003401616650006501650650006201715650003801777650002501815650005101840650005001891650004901941650004701990650001302037650002102050650001202071650001702083653001302100653002802113653002302141700001402164700001602178773008402194852000902278930003302287945001302320946001102333655001202344IND2138050420221119103043.0980807e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213805042DNAL7 a94292442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J.H.10aFibrin(ogen)-related antigens in rabbits experimentally infected with rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus  ap. 123-127.  aWe investigated fibrin(ogen)-related antigens in liver tissues of rabbits infected with rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) virus. Fibrin(ogen)-related antigens were detected in the sinusoids of liver at six hours post infection (pi). At 18 hours pi, the antigens were clearly detected in the hepatocytes infiltrated with heterophils rather than in the sinusoid. In the rabbits that spontaneously died (30 hours pi), fibrin(ogen)-related antigens were detected in both degenerating and some intact hepatocytes. They were also expressed in the necrotic foci of hepatocytes infiltrated by heterophils. By immunoprecipitation fibrin(ogen)-related antigens were extracted from the infected liver homogenates and analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. There was an increase in fibrinogen and A alpha polypeptide chains in the liver homogenates from rabbits sacrificed at 18 and 24 hours pi, including those that died. Disseminated intravascular coagulation developed after progress of degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes in RHD. It is assumed that the resultant consumption of fibrinogen triggers replenishment of fibrinogen by hepatocytes. 3arabbits 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3aantigens 3aliver 3ahepatocytes 3aCaliciviridae 3apolypeptides 2aAnimals 2aAntigensxanalysis 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aCaliciviridae Infectionsximmunologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxmethodsxveterinary. 2aHemorrhagic Disease Virus, Rabbit 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aKidneyximmunologyxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aLiverximmunologyxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aLungximmunologyxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electronxmethodsxveterinary. 2aNecrosis 2aPrecipitin Tests 2aRabbits 2aTime Factors 0aclotting 0aexperimental infections 0apolypeptide chains1 aLee, Y.S.1 aItakura, C.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g1997 , v. 63, no. 2 p.123-127x0034-52887nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03731naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100001800193245014300211300001600354500002400370520202800394650002602422650001902448650002202467650002402489650002402513650002502537650001702562650001502579650001502594650001502609650001102624650002102635650001902656650002302675650001402698650002002712650001302732651001102745700001902756700002102775700002702796700002402823700001902847773010902866852000902975856008802984930003303072945002503105946001103130655001203141IND4440610520221119102850.0100730e20100730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444061052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK110 0aK250 0aF600 0aF300 0aK0011 aKenzo, Tanaka10aChanges in above- and belowground biomass in early successional tropical secondary forests after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia  ap. 875-882.  aIncludes references  aUncertainties in the rate of biomass variation with forest ageing in tropical secondary forests, particularly in belowground components, limit the accuracy of carbon pool estimates in tropical regions. We monitored changes in above- and belowground biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and biomass allocation to the leaf component to determine the variation in carbon accumulation rate with forest age after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia. Nine plots in a 4-year-old forest and fourteen plots in a 10-year-old forest were monitored for 5 and 7 years, respectively. Forest and plant part biomass were calculated from an allometric equation obtained from the same forest stands. Both above- and belowground biomass increased rapidly during the initial decade after abandonment. In contrast, a much slower rate of biomass accumulation was observed after the initial decade. LAI also increased by approximately double from the 4-year-old to 10-year-old forest, and then gently increased to the 17-year-old forest. We also found that allocation variation in leaf biomass and nitrogen was closely related to the rate of biomass accumulation as a forest aged. During the first decade after abandonment, a high biomass and nitrogen allocation to the leaf component may have allowed for a high rate of biomass accumulation. However, reduction in those allocations to leaf component after the initial decade may have helped to suppress the biomass accumulation rate in older secondary forests. Roots accounted for 14.0-16.1% of total biomass in the 4-17-year-old abandoned secondary forests. We also verified the model predicted values for belowground biomass by and , although both models overestimated the values throughout our data sets by 45-50% in the 10-year-old forest. The low root:shoot ratio in the secondary forests may have caused this overestimation. Therefore, our results suggest that we should modify the models to estimate belowground biomass considering the low root:shoot ratio in tropical secondary forests. 3atropical rain forests 3aabandoned land 3aforest succession 3aaboveground biomass 3abelowground biomass 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aprediction 3aestimation 3abiomarkers 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aforest surveys 3aforest mensuration 3aallometry 3aleaf area index 3avalidity 3aBorneo1 aIchie, Tomoaki1 aHattori, Daisuke1 aKendawang, Joseph Jawa1 aSakurai, Katsutoshi1 aNinomiya, Ikuo0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 July 30, v. 260, no. 5 p.875-882dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.06.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02129naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245008600177300001600263520111600279650002201395650001401417650001101431650002501442650001801467650002601485653001601511653004301527700001901570773009201589852000901681856005701690939003301747946001101780655001201791IND9301788620221119102915.0930329e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178862DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0885032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaolillo, D.J.

One model, containing a defined growth maximum in the basal half of the EZ, is favoured in the literature and was derived from data published for perennial ryegrass. The other, containing a flat, broad maximum throughout the region of the EZ with stomates, was constructed from regressions of interstomatal distance against distance along the EZ in the first foliage leaf of wheat seedlings. The test strongly favoured the model with the flat maximum. Although the gibberellic acid (GA) insensitivity alleles Rht1 and Rht2 reduce length of extension zone (LEZ), leaf extension rate (LER) and final cell and leaf lengths, they had no effect on maximum RELEL. Results with an inhibitor of GA synthesis indicated that control of leaf elongation by the control of LEZ may be generalizable as a mechanism by which GA controls LER in the grass leaf. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aseedlings 3aleaves 3aspatial distribution 3agrowth models 3aquantitative analysis 0agrowth rate 0arelative elemental rates of elongation1 aSorrells, M.E.0 tAnnals of botany.g1992 Nov., v. 70, no. 5 p.461-470wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088503  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01052naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115242010700141245010200248300001600350500002400366520008000390650002200470653002400492653003000516700001900546700001600565773010800581852000900689939003300698945000800731946001100739655001200750991586747710742620221119103027.0830324e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aPAR830030402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamano Carvalho, T.L.10aAlterations of the human testicle in Chagas' disease.

Each of these glycosides was then purified, and the structures were assigned as follows: epigallocatechin gallate 7-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (EGCG-G1); epigallocatechin gallate 4'-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (EGCG-G1'); and epigallocatechin gallate 7,4'-O-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (EGCG-G2). One of these compounds (EGCG-G1) was a novel compound. The EGCG glycosides exhibited similar or slower antioxidant effects, depending on their structures (EGCG greater than or equal to EGCG-G1 > EGCG-G1' > EGCG-G2), and also manifested a higher degree of browning resistance than was previously noted in EGCG. Also, EGCG-G1, EGCG-G1', and EGCG-G2 were 49, 55, and 114 times as water soluble, respectively, as EGCG. 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3ahexosyltransferases 3aenzyme activity 3asucrose 3aflavanols 3aglycosides 3aglycosylation 3achemical structure 3aantioxidant activity 0aglucansucrase 0aepigallocatechin gallate 0aepigallocatechin gallate glycosides1 aLee, J.H.1 aAhn, J.S.1 aNam, S.H.1 aOh, D.K.1 aPark, D.H.1 aChung, H.J.1 aKang, S.1 aDay, D.F.1 aKim D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1230-1237x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052359i3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle03202naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002500154245013000179300001800309520183500327650002202162650001702184650001502201650002002216650004402236650001602280653001902296653002802315653005102343653003302394653002202427700001402449700001402463700001602477700001302493773010502506852000902611856007702620930003302697945002502730946001302755655001202768IND4378593720221119103028.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437859372DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051924e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSiebner-Freibach, H.10aThermospectroscopic study of the adsorption mechanism of the hydroxamic siderophore ferrioxamine B by calcium montmorillonite  ap. 1399-1408.  aThe behavior of iron-chelating agents in soils is highly affected by interactions with the solid phase. Still this aspect is frequently ignored. In this research the adsorption of the siderophore ferrioxamine B by Ca-montmorillonite, as a free ligand (desferrioxamine B, DFOB) and as a complex with Fe(3+) (ferrioxamine B, FOB), was studied, using thermo X-ray diffraction (thermo-XRD) in the temperature range 25-360 degrees C and thermo-FTIR spectroscopy in the temperature range 25-170 degrees C. The effect of pH (4-7.5) on the adsorption was examined. Extensive use of curve-fitting analysis was required due to significant overlapping of the characteristic absorption bands of the various functional groups. Thermo-XRD analysis showed that both DFOB and FOB penetrated into the interlayer space of Ca-montmorillonite. FTIR results indicated strong interactions of DFOB within the interlayer, which involved all functional groups (NH3(+), secondary amide groups, and hydroxamate groups). In contrast, the folded Fe complex of FOB retained its molecular configuration upon adsorption, and the basal spacing of the clay increased correspondingly. FOB interacted in the interlayer space of the clay, mainly through the NH of the secondary amide groups and NH3(+), while the functional groups bound to the central Fe cation remained unchanged. The suspension pH had no significant effect on both DFOB and FOB adsorption at the examined range. Adsorption protected the adsorbates from thermal degradation compared to the nonadsorbed samples up to 105 degrees C. At 170 degrees C both DFOB and FOB were already partially degraded, but to a lesser extent than the nonadsorbed samples. Degradation of the molecules occurred mainly through the hydroxamic groups, which constitute the Fe-chelating center in the hydroxamic siderophore. 3aX-ray diffraction 3asiderophores 3aadsorption 3amontmorillonite 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3atemperature 0aferrioxamine B 0acalcium montmorillonite 0athermo-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 0athermo-X-ray crystallography 0adesferrioxamine B1 aHadar, Y.1 aYariv, S.1 aLapides, I.1 aChen, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1399-1408x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051924e3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02539naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245007200169300001800241500001500259520123200274650002201506650001801528650002501546650002601571650001601597650002201613650001001635650002101645650002601666650001501692653002801707653002501735700001501760700001401775700001501789700001501804773010501819852000901924856007701933930003302010945002502043946001302068655001202081IND4378583220221119103236.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858322DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052521h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPark, Y.S.10aProlyl endopeptidase inhibitory activity of unsaturated fatty acids  ap. 1238-1242.  a2019-12-04  aProlyl endopeptidase (PEP, EC 3.4.21.26) is widely distributed in various organs, particularly in the brains of amnestic patients. Evaluation of PEP levels in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease patients revealed significant increases in PEP activity, suggesting that a specific PEP inhibitor can be a good candidate for an antiamnestic drug. In this study, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids were investigated to determine their role as PEP inhibitors. Oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) showed PEP inhibitory activities (IC50 values of 23.6 +/- 0.4, 43.8 +/- 1.8, 53.4 +/- 1.2, 99.4 +/- 1.2, and 46.2 +/- 1.0 micromolar, respectively), indicating that they were effective PEP inhibitors, with inhibition constant (K(i)) values of 26.7 +/- 0.3, 51.0 +/- 0.7, 91.3 +/- 3.1, 247.5 +/- 2.6, and 89.0 +/- 2.3 micromolar, respectively. Oleic acid showed the highest PEP inhibitory activity. Dixon plots of PEP inhibition showed oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids, EPA, and DHA are noncompetitive inhibitors; despite higher IC50 values of these unsaturated fatty acids than strong natural inhibitors, they may have potential use in preventing memory loss. 3aAlzheimer disease 3alinoleic acid 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aproteinases 3aenzyme inhibition 3abrain 3aarachidonic acid 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aoleic acid 0aunsaturated fatty acids 0aprolyl endopeptidase1 aJang, H.J.1 aLee, K.H.1 aHahn, T.R.1 aPaik, Y.S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1238-1242x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052521h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02572naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245010600169300001800275520115500293650001301448650003201461650002501493650002601518650001401544650001801558650001001576650001801586650002801604650001601632650002701648650001301675650002001688650000901708653001501717700001701732700001801749700001701767700001601784700001601800773010501816852000901921856007701930930003302007945002502040946001302065655001202078IND4378582720221119103309.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858272DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05180022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDanesi, F.10aCounteraction of adriamycin-induced oxidative damage in rat heart by selenium dietary supplementation  ap. 1203-1208.  aMany reports indicate that dietary selenium, potentially increasing the activity of glutathione peroxidase, could offer protection against free-radical-induced damage. The effects of diets moderately enriched in selenium, as sodium selenite or as a lyophilized selenium-rich food, were studied in rats. Adriamycin, an anticancer drug causing a free-radical-mediated cardiotoxicity, was administered intraperitoneally to some rats. The onset of an oxidative damage was indicated by the increase in the plasma level of reactive oxygen metabolites coupled to a decrease in the total antioxidant activity but without modification of glutathione peroxidase activity, which were observed in all rats, independent of the dietary treatment. On the contrary, in the heart, selenium supplementation caused an increase in the total antioxidant activity, glutathione concentration, and glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities leading to a decreased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites. These results clearly indicate that a moderate Se dietary supplementation counteracts adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity by preservation of endogenous antioxidants. 3aselenium 3adietary mineral supplements 3aantioxidant activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aoxidation 3adrug toxicity 3aheart 3afree radicals 3areactive oxygen species 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3arats 0aadriamycin1 aMalaguti, M.1 aDi Nunzio, M.1 aMaranesi, M.1 aBiagi, P.L.1 aBordoni, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1203-1208x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05180023Available from publisher's Web site  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle02747naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154072001700171100001400188245016500202300001800367520131300385650001001698650001001708650001401718650002301732650001701755650002501772650002101797650002201818650002201840653002601862653002001888653001101908653002201919653001301941700001501954700002001969700001401989773010502003852000902108856007702117930003302194945002502227946001302252655001202265IND4378583320221119103158.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858332DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052436+2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKerem, Z.10aAntioxidant activity and inhibition of α-glucosidase by trans-resveratrol, piceid, and a novel trans-stilbene from the roots of Israeli Rumex bucephalophorus L  ap. 1243-1247.  aThe roots of Rumex bucephalophorus, collected in Israel, were analyzed for trans-stilbenes. Two stilbene-O-glycosyl derivatives were identified, in addition to 3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene (1) (resveratrol). The stilbene-O-glycosyl derivatives were 5,4'-dihydroxystilbene-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2) (piceid) and the new 5,4'-dihydroxystilbene-3-O-alpha-arabinopyranoside (3), which is being named rumexoid. The structure of rumexoid was elucidated by using spectroscopic data. The antioxidant capacities of stilbenoids 1-3 were determined and expressed as trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). TEAC value for trans-resveratrol was highest (2.7) and for rumexoid lowest (1.5). In vitro, trans-resveratrol and rumexoid demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase activity (IC50 < 0.1 and < 0.5 mM, respectively). The commercial antidiabetic agent acarbose was shown to inhibit only 35% of the enzyme activity at 0.5 mM. The addition of piceid to the reaction mixture did not inhibit alpha-glucosidase in vitro in the range of concentrations used. These findings extend the range of reported beneficial effects of stilbene derivatives, and demonstrate the multifaceted activities that dietary polyphenols may exert in the intestine, where their concentrations are highest in the body. 3aRumex 3aroots 3astilbenes 3achemical structure 3aantioxidants 3aantioxidant activity 3amedicinal plants 3aenzyme inhibition 3aalpha-glucosidase 0aRumex bucephalophorus 0atrans-stilbenes 0apiceid 0atrans-resveratrol 0arumexoid1 aBilkis, I.1 aFlaishman, M.A.1 aSivan, L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1243-1247x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052436+3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle01730naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006800129300001600197500001500213520072000228650002100948650002500969650002000994650001201014650001501026650003701041650001501078650001401093650001501107650002001122650001901142653001501161653001901176700001501195773008101210852000901291939003301300946001101333655001201344IND9301787020221119103317.0930326e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillalobos, N.10aInvolvement of cytokinins in the germination of chick-pea seeds  ap. 277-291.  a2019-12-04  aEight cytokinins detected in germinated chick-pea (Cicer arietinum L. var.

The cytokinins detected in the cotyledons originate in the embryonic axes, but no passage of these substances from the cotyledons to the axes was detected, except when the seeds were treated with red light. It is concluded that the role played by the embryonic axis in mobilizating the main reserves of the cotyledons is mainly effected through these cytokinins. Both natural and synthetic cytokinins exert an important regulatory role in the hydrolysis of reserve proteins and calcium could be involved as an intermediate. 3aseed germination 3achemical composition 3aCucumis sativus 3acalcium 3acotyledons 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3acytokinins 3ared light 3ahydrolysis 3aCicer arietinum 3aplant proteins 0aregulation 0aembryo (plant)1 aMartin, L.0 tPlant growth regulation.g1992 Aug., v. 11, no. 3 p.277-291x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02687naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245017800153300001600331500002400347500002300371520130300394650001901697650002001716650002201736650002101758650001101779650001101790650001801801650001301819650001601832650001501848650001301863650002101876650002501897650002801922650001101950650001701961651001701978700001901995700001802014700001202032773008902044852000902133856007502142655001202217IND4464317820221119103125.0121015s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446431782DNAL7 a10.4141/S02-0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMooleki, S.P.10aEffect of rate, frequency and incorporation of feedlot cattle manure on soil nitrogen availability, crop performance and nitrogen use efficiency in east-central Saskatchewan  ap. 199-210.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aA study was initiated in 1996 in the Black Soil zone in east-central Saskatchewan to examine soil and crop response to application of feedlot cattle manure at different application rates, frequencies and incorporation timing in a sandy loam and loam soil. Three rates of feedlot cattle manure (approx. 100, 200 and 400 kg total N ha-1) were applied annually and under reduced frequency application regimes. Canola (Brassica napus, L.), spring wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.), hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) and canola were seeded in spring of 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. Pre-seeding available N (0–60 cm) increased with application rates. Annual application resulted in a linear increase in grain yield with application rates but had no effect on grain N concentration. Cumulative N use efficiency was low (7–10%) with no significant difference among treatments. Single application showed significant residual fertility benefit in the second year but not in the third year except at the high rate. Incorporation timing of feedlot cattle manure had no impact on soil or crop performance. Low availability of N in feedlot cattle manure over the short-term suggests the need for high application rates or addition of supplemental N fertilizer in order to meet crop N requirements. 3aBrassica napus 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTriticum aestivum 3aapplication rate 3abarley 3acanola 3acattle manure 3afeedlots 3agrain yield 3aloam soils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aspring 3aspring wheat 3aSaskatchewan1 aSchoenau, J.J.1 aCharles, J.L.1 aWen, G.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2004 May, v. 84, no. 2 p.199-210x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S02-0453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02823naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245009600154300001600250500002400266500002300290520156500313650001701878650002301895650001801918650002001936650001601956650002601972650001201998650001402010650001502024650001302039650000902052650000802061650001802069650001502087650001802102650002002120651001402140700002102154700001702175773008902192852000902281856007502290655001202365IND4464317620221119103119.0121015s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446431762DNAL7 a10.4141/S03-0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJankauskas, B.10aErosion-preventive crop rotations and water erosion rates on undulating slopes in Lithuania  ap. 177-186.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aA combination of perennial grass species and selected crop rotations can help prevent soil erosion in upland regions and minimize the risk of soil erosion and associated water pollution (to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems). Research data were obtained on sandy loam Eutric Albeluvisols at the Kaltinenai Research Station of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture on the undulating hilly topography of the Zemaiciai Uplands of Western Lithuania. The aim was to identify crops and crop rotations that would minimize soil erosion. Measured water erosion rates over 18 yr of field experiments were: 3.2–8.6 m3 ha-1 yr-1 under winter rye, 9.0–27.1 m3 ha-1 yr-1 under spring barley and 24.2–87.1 m3 ha-1 yr-1 under potatoes. Perennial grasses completely prevented water erosion, while the erosion-preventive grass-grain crop rotations (>50% grass) decreased soil losses on arable slopes of 2–5°, 5–10° and 10–14° by 75–80%. The grain-grass crop rotation (<50% grass) decreased rates by 23–24% compared to the field crop rotation. The main attributes of the proposed soil conservation systems were the careful selection of optimum erosion-preventive ecosystems (sod-forming perennial grasses or erosion-preventive crop rotations) with high erosion-resisting capabilities. These selected systems varied in response to slope gradient and thus assist erosion control and ecological stability of the undulating topography of Lithuania. These results may have wider applicability on the undulating landscapes of the temperate agricultural zone. 3aAlbeluvisols 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acrop rotation 3aerosion control 3afield crops 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3apotatoes 3arisk 3arye 3aspring barley 3atopography 3awater erosion 3awater pollution 3aLithuania1 aJankauskiene, G.1 aFullen, M.A.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2004 May, v. 84, no. 2 p.177-186x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S03-0293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02167naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001400151245007700165300001600242500015600258500002400414520102400438650001401462650001201476650001501488650001101503650001601514651001201530700001901542700001401561700001401575773014001589852000901729856009101738655001201829IND4464320720221119103103.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446432072DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhrab, M.10aEvaluation of the performance of seventeen male pistachio-tree specimens  ap. 473-477.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aThis study was carried out on a collection of seventeen male pistachio-tree specimens located in the central area of Tunisia. The evaluation of male pistachio-tree features was made during two years (1998-1999) based on the flowering period, flower density and the quantity of pollen per inflorescence in order to find the best pollinator for 'Mateur', the most widely cultivated pistachio cultivar in Tunisia. The phenological observations have shown three groups of male pistachio-trees. The first group has an early flowering period, which started 15 days before the female cultivar. This group was characterized by the best pollen production of 0.52 g per inflorescence. The second group covers the major part of 'Mateur' flowering period. However, it has a medium to weak density and the lowest pollen production (0.30 g). The third group with a late flowering period has a good density and pollen production (0.44 g). These results are discussed and the best pollination combination for ‘Mateur’ is suggested. 3acultivars 3aflowers 3apistachios 3apollen 3apollination 3aTunisia1 aBen Mimoun, M.1 aTriki, H.1 aGouta, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.473-477dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02501naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001400171245020400185300001800389500001500407520098300422650001701405650001801422650001401440650001801454650001601472650001401488650001701502650005801519650001501577653004801592653001901640700001601659700001501675700001501690700001301705700002101718700001801739773010501757852000901862856007701871930003301948945002501981946001302006655001202019IND4378582620221119103112.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858262DNAL7 a10.1021/jf052761x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A commercial phytosterols mixture, Generol 95S, was fractionated first by adsorption silica gel column chromatography and then separated by means of a semipreparative reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography fitted with a Polaris C8-A column (250 mm x 10 mm i.d., 5 micrometer) using isocratic acetonitrile:2-propanol:water (2:1:1, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. Milligram scales of six individual phytosterols, including citrostadienol, campesterol, beta-sitosterol, delta7-avenasterol, delta7-campesterol, and delta7-sitosterol, were obtained. Purities of these isolated sterols were 85-98%. Relative response factors (RRF) of these phytosterols were calculated against cholestanol as an authentic commercial standard. These RRF values were used to quantify by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) the phytosterols content in a reference material, oils, and chocolates. 3aphytosterols 3asunflower oil 3achocolate 3afood analysis 3asoybean oil 3aolive oil 3arapeseed oil 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aseparation 0aadsorption silica gel column chromatography 0achromatography1 aCambrai, A.1 aMiesch, M.1 aRoussi, S.1 aRaul, F.1 aAoude-Werner, D.1 aMarchioni, E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1196-1202x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052761x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle03564naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245014400152300001600296500002400312500002300336500001500359520211700374650001102491650002002502650001302522650001302535650001802548650002402566650002202590650001702612650002302629650001202652650002302664650001502687650001302702650001502715650001802730650002702748650001102775650001702786651002502803653001902828700002002847700001802867773008902885852000902974856007502983655001203058IND4464317920221119103102.0121015s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446431792DNAL7 a10.4141/S03-0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, M.R.10aInfluence of compost on the physical properties and organic matter fractions of a fine sandy loam throughout the cycle of a potato rotation  ap. 211-218.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) rotations often require organic amendments to maintain or improve soil organic matter levels and soil physical properties. However, beneficial effects of compost can be modified by time of application and rotating tillage depth and intensity. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of compost applied once at different phases in a 3-yr potato, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) rotation on a range of soil physical properties and organic matter fractions for a Charlottetown fine sandy loam (Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol) in Prince Edward Island. Soil samples (0–8 cm) were obtained during the second cycle of the rotation (after two compost applications) in the fifth year of the experiment. Soil properties were influenced by compost addition, time of compost addition, and crop phase. Compost-induced benefits in soil physical properties (bulk density, macro-porosity, oxygen diffusion rate, shear vane strength, water-filled pore space) were mainly expressed in the red clover phase of the rotation, where soil density was relatively high compared to the barley and potato phases, due to the absence of tillage. The soil physical parameters, however, were mainly within their established optimum ranges for this soil type. Soil water content at −0.033 MPa was increased by compost in the potato phase, compared to the control. Soil organic matter was influenced by both compost and crop C inputs. Compost increased soil particulate organic matter (POM) in the potato and barley phases. Due to differences in crop residue inputs, compost-related differences in organic matter were minimized in the red clover phase of the rotation. Compost addition increased potato tuber yield above the maximum yield obtained with nitrogen application. This “non-nitrogen” compost yield effect may be related to the slight, but significant, improvement in soil water-holding capacity. Overall , compost application in an intensive 3-yr potato rotation provided benefits for potato productivity and in both soil physical and biological properties. 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3anitrogen 3acomposts 3acrop residues 3asoil organic matter 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abulk density 3asoil water content 3atillage 3aTrifolium pratense 3acrop yield 3apotatoes 3asoil types 3asoil sampling 3awater holding capacity 3aoxygen 3asoil density 3aPrince Edward Island 0aorganic matter1 aSanderson, J.B.1 aMacLeod, J.A.0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2004 May, v. 84, no. 2 p.211-218x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S03-0583Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02121naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001600228500002300244500001500267520104100282650001801323650002101341650001501362650001301377650001901390650002201409650001501431650001701446650001801463650001601481650001001497653001501507653002301522653001101545653002101556773008101577852000901658939003301667946001101700655001201711IND9301786520221119103157.0930326e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Th.10aSome reflections on the relationship between endogenous hormones and light-mediated seed dormancy  ap. 239-248.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationships between phytochrome and endogenous hormones in the light-mediated control of seed dormancy are discussed. It is concluded that gibberellins are primarily involved in post-dormancy metabolic processes leading to embryo growth and radicle emergence, such as food reserve mobilisation and endosperm softening. Evidence is considered that germination inhibitors, particularly abscisic acid, are involved in the establishment and maintenance of primary dormancy. The role of cytokinins is not fully elucidated but there is considerable evidence to suggest that phytochrome control may involve cytokinin effects on transmembrane ion fluxes. In terms of hormonal control, phytochrome mediated dormancy is a complex phenomenon. There is a need for molecular studies of processes controlled by phytochrome, GAs, CKs and ABA during dormancy and germination to unravel the complexities of the dormancy mechanisms. Such studies would be facilitated by the availability of CK-deficient mutants of classical light-sensitive species. 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3ametabolism 3aethylene 3aembryo (plant) 3adormancy breaking 3acytokinins 3agibberellins 3aabscisic acid 3aphytochrome 3alight 0aregulation 0aliterature reviews 0agrowth 0aplant physiology0 tPlant growth regulation.g1992 Aug., v. 11, no. 3 p.239-248x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02618naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002100151245003100172300001600203500015600219500002400375520135600399650001801755650001201773650001401785650001501799650002101814650002101835650002001856650001601876650000901892650001601901650001001917650001501927651001501942700002301957773014001980852000902120856009102129655001202220IND4464321220221119103320.0121015s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446432122DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdstrom, John P.10aMicroirrigation of almonds  ap. 505-508.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Pistachios and Almonds and Twelfth Colloquium of GREMPA, held May 20-24, 2001, Zaragoza, Spain.  aIncludes references  aA large scale field trial was conducted at the Nickels Soils Laboratory in the Sacramento Valley of California to evaluate three microirrigation systems; Surface Drip, Subsurface Drip (SDI) and Micro-jet on four cultivars of almonds, 'Nonpareil', 'Butte', 'Carmel' and 'Monterey' (Prunus dulcis [Mill.] D.A.Webb.). Ten years of evaluation has shown that high commercial yields (2500 kg/ha) of high quality almonds can be produced using all three types of microirrigation. Micro-jet irrigated trees tended to outyield drip irrigated trees by about 10% in some years for some cultivars. No consistent yield differences were found. Tree growth under SDI, as measured by trunk size, was comparable to surface drip irrigation but slightly smaller than micro-jet irrigated trees when equal amounts of irrigation water were applied. Root development was more extensive under micro-jet irrigated trees compared to both single hose drip systems. No significant root intrusion was found in trifluralin impregnated SDI emitters but standard SDI emitters were plugged by almond root growth after five years of field operation. Minor root pinching was evident on the buried flexible supply hoses in both SDI and surface drip systems. Micro-jet irrigation increased system maintenance and resulted in higher herbicide use to control vegetation on the orchard floor. 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3aherbicides 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3amicroirrigation 3aroot growth 3asoil 3atree growth 3atrees 3avegetation 3aCalifornia1 aSchwankl, Larry J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2002 Nov., , no. 591 p.505-508dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.591.763Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03002naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245008000142300001400222500001500236520133200251650001701583650000801600650001601608650000901624650001501633650002101648650002301669650001001692650002501702650002101727650001501748650001201763650001401775650001001789650001001799650002301809650000901832650001201841650003401853650003301887650002001920650004201940650001101982650002401993650000902017650000902026650002002035650001602055650001602071650001502087650000902102651001202111651001202123653001002135653001002145700001702155700001402172773006402186852000902250930003302259945001302292946001102305655001202316IND2324799020221119102931.0020113e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232479902DNAL7 a115621572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoos, G.10aMen, masculinity and food: interviews with Finnish carpenters and engineers  ap. 47-56.  a2019-12-05  aThis study explores how Finnish men from two occupational groups describe food in their everyday life. The concept of masculinities is used in interpreting men's food-related behaviours and beliefs. Data are drawn from semi-structured interviews in the 1990s with twenty carpenters and twenty engineers involved in the building trade. The paper presents analyses of the similarities and differences in how the men talked about meat; vegetables; beer and wine as parts of meals; food as energy, health and pleasure; and cooking. The results show variation both between and within occupational groups. The men did not stress the role of meat, but rather emphasised the role of vegetables. The carpenters tended to favour meat whereas the engineers had a more positive attitude to vegetables. Eating was described as an everyday routine needed to refuel the body and stay healthy. In addition, the engineers talked about the pleasures of eating. The men described cooking as optional or exceptional. The carpenters seemed to more actively embrace hegemonic masculinity and reject what is feminine than the engineers, who have reformulated their definition of masculinity to encompass concerns with health. This study suggests that both masculinity and occupational class play a role in male food-related practices and preferences. 3afood beliefs 3amen 3aoccupations 3ameat 3ainterviews 3ahealth promotion 3agender differences 3awines 3asocioeconomic status 3afeeding behavior 3avegetables 3acooking 3aeducation 3abeers 2aAdult 2aAttitude to Health 2aBeer 2aCooking 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology. 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aGender Identity 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInterviews as Topic 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMenxpsychology 2aMiddle Aged 2aOccupations 2aVegetables 2aWine 3aFinland 0aFinland 0ameals 0afoods1 aPrattala, R.1 aKoski, K.0 tAppetite.g2001 Aug., v. 37, no. 1 p.47-56x0195-66637nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02244naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001300154245006600167300001800233500001500251520110800266650001201374650001401386650002201400650002401422650001201446650001001458650001001468650002301478650001601501650001601517653002101533700001801554773010501572852000901677856007701686930003301763945002501796946001301821655001201834IND4378584120221119103346.0060308e20060222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437858412DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05170412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Our objective was to investigate the process for the removal of oligosaccharides from pinto bean using enzymatic treatment and to compare it to removal by soaking and cooking methods. Crude enzyme preparation was produced by six fungal species on wheat bran- and okara-based substrates with soy tofu whey. The loss of raffinose oligosaccharides after soaking pinto beans for 16 h at the room temperature was 10%, after cooking for 90 min was 52%, and after autoclaving for 30 min was 58%. On the other hand, the treatment using crude alpha-galactosidase (60 U mL(-1)) produced by Aspergillus awamori NRRL 4869 from wheat bran-based substrate with soy tofu whey on pinto bean flour for 2 h completely hydrolyzed raffinose oligosaccharides. These results supported that the enzymatic treatment was the most effective among various processing methods tested for removing the raffinose oligosaccharides, and hence, crude alpha-galactosidases from fungi have potential use in the food industry. 3acooking 3araffinose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aenzymatic treatment 3asoaking 3aflour 3afungi 3afood biotechnology 3aautoclaving 3apinto beans 0aoligosaccharides1 aChang, S.K.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Feb. 22, v. 54, no. 4 p.1296-1301x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05170413Available from publisher's Web site  a20060725b20060804c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/21  aOther US 7aarticle04049naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002200181245016000203300001800363500002400381506007600405520138200481506003701863650003101900650001301931650001401944650001101958650001301969650001301982650001601995650001902011650002202030650000902052650001602061650001202077650001402089650001402103650002302117650001402140650001202154650003402166650003302200650002602233650003802259650002202297650001102319650002202330650003202352650003102384650003402415650003202449650001802481650004302499650000902542650002402551650002302575650004102598650002802639650002602667650004102693650003102734650004602765700001902811700001702830700002202847700001702869700003002886700002002916700002202936700002102958700002102979773011803000852000903118856008003127655001203207IND4424811720221207072739.0090821s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442481172DNAL7 a195967752pmid7 aPMC27379932pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00015-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurenuma, Takeshi14aThe RD1 Locus in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Genome Contributes to Activation of Caspase-1 via Induction of Potassium Ion Efflux in Infected Macrophages  ap. 3992-4001.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA genomic locus called "region of difference 1" (RD1) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to contribute to the generation of host protective immunity as well as to the virulence of the bacterium. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism, we investigated the difference in the cytokine-inducing ability between H37Rv and a mutant strain deficient for RD1 (ΔRD1). We found that RD1 is implicated in the production of caspase-1-dependent cytokines, interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-1β, from infected macrophages. The expression of these cytokines was similarly induced after infection with H37Rv and ΔRD1. However, the activation of caspase-1 was observed only in H37Rv-infected macrophages. The cytokine production and caspase-1 activation were induced independently of type I interferon receptor signaling events. We also found that the activation of caspase-1 was markedly inhibited with increasing concentrations of extracellular KCl. Furthermore, the production of IL-18 and IL-1β and caspase-1 activation were induced independently of a P2X7 purinergic receptor, and the inability of ΔRD1 in caspase-1 activation was compensated for by nigericin, an agent inducing the potassium ion efflux. Based on these results, we concluded that RD1 participates in caspase-1-dependent cytokine production via induction of the potassium ion efflux in infected macrophages.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3abacteria 3acaspase-1 3agenome 3agenomics 3aimmunity 3ainterferons 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aloci 3amacrophages 3amutants 3anigericin 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteins 2aCarrier Proteinsxphysiology 2aCaspase 1xmetabolism 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsxphysiology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aFemale 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aInterferon-betaxphysiology 2aInterleukin-18xphysiology 2aInterleukin-1betaxphysiology 2aInterleukin-6xbiosynthesis 2aIon Transport 2aMacrophagesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisxgenetics 2aNigericinxpharmacology 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Purinergic P2xphysiology 2aReceptors, Purinergic P2X7 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxbiosynthesis1 aKawamura, Ikuo1 aHara, Hideki1 aUchiyama, Ryosuke1 aDaim, Sylvia1 aDewamitta, Sita Ramyamali1 aSakai, Shunsuke1 aTsuchiya, Kohsuke1 aNomura, Takamasa1 aMitsuyama, Masao0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 Sept., v. 77, no. 9 p.3992-4001dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00015-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01067naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115242006500133245006400198300001600262500002400278520010500302650002200407650001300429650001300442650002400455653002200479700001600501700002200517700002100539773010800560852000900668939003300677945000800710946001100718655001200729991586742200742620221119101711.0830504e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aPAR830045392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, S.G.10aAntigenic analysis of different strains of Trypanosoma cruzi10aAnalise antigenica de diferentes cepas do Trypanosoma cruzi  ap. 245-250.  aSummary in English.  aTrypanosoma cruzi, antigenic analysis of 3 strains demonstrated differences in antigenic composition 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aantigens 3aimmunity 3aantigenic variation 0aStrains, Protozoa1 aAndrade, V.1 aRocha Filho, F.D.1 aBarral Netto, M.0 tRevista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.g1981 , v. 23, no. 6 p.245-250x0036-46657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830504c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01153naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115242007000133245007500203300001600278500002400294520020100318650002200519651001100541653003700552700001600589700001900605700001600624700001800640773010800658852000900766939003300775945000800808946001100816655001200827991586741850742620221119101734.0830505e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aPAR830045432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChocair, P.R.10aKidney transplantation: A new way of Chagas' disease transmission10aTransplante de rim: Nova modalidade de transmissao da doenca de Chagas  ap. 280-282.  aSummary in English.  aTrypanosoma cruzi, infection of kidney transplant patients suggests transplant organ as new means of disease transmission (transmission via blood transfusions ruled out by patient history): Brazil 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aBrazil 0aDisease transmission, Man to man1 aSabbaga, E.1 aAmato Neto, V.1 aShiroma, M.1 ade Goes, G.M.0 tRevista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.g1981 , v. 23, no. 6 p.280-282x0036-46657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830505c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02909naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012800181300001800309500002400327500001500351520111800366650002201484650001701506650001401523650001801537650001101555650001101566650001401577650002301591650002101614650002201635650004101657650001801698650003801716650003801754650001701792650003601809650002401845650004101869650003701910650003701947650002101984650005102005653002202056700001502078700001602093700001302109700001202122773011502134852000902249856008502258655001202343IND4431735620221119101619.0100122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443173562DNAL7 a197308492pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-009-2200-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yu-Ling10aProduction of diosgenin from Dioscorea zingiberensis tubers through enzymatic saccharification and microbial transformation  ap. 1409-1416.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn order to develop a clean and effective approach for producing the valuable drug diosgenin from Dioscorea zingiberensis tubers, two successive processes, enzymatic saccharification and microbial transformation, were used. With enzymatic saccharification, 98.0% of starch was excluded from the raw herb, releasing saponins from the network structure of starch. Subsequently, the treated tubers were fermented with Trichoderma reesei under optimal conditions for 156 h. During microbial transformation, glycosidic bonds, which link β-d-glucose or α-l-rhamnose with aglycone at the C-3 position in saponins, were broken down effectively to give a diosgenin yield of 90.6 ± 2.45%, 42.4% higher than that obtained from bioconversion of raw tubers directly. Scaled up fermentation was conducted in a 5.0-l bioreactor and gave a diosgenin yield of 91.2 ± 3.21%. This is the first report on the preparation of diosgenin from herbs through microbial transformation as well as utilizing other available components in the raw material, providing an environmentally friendly alternative to diosgenin production. 3abiotransformation 3afermentation 3adiosgenin 3araw materials 3astarch 3atubers 3aDioscorea 3aTrichoderma reesei 3asaccharification 2aBiotransformation 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCulture Media 2aDioscoreaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDiosgeninxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Tubersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRhamnosexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSaponinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStarchxanalysis 2aTrichodermaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aHypocrea jecorina1 aHuang, Wen1 aNi, Jin-Ren1 aLiu, Wei1 aLi, Hui0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Feb., v. 85, no. 5 p.1409-1416dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2200-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03493naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001900197245011800216300001800334506007600352520216000428592002802588506003702616650001602653650001602669650001802685650002102703650000902724650001102733650001802744650002302762650001802785650001902803650002502822700001902847700001902866773008702885856009002972852000903062655001203071IND60090517620221207084015.0141102e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009051762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0862doi7 aPMC36469812pmcid7 a236023642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaẓā, Asad,14aThe influence of matrix properties on growth and morphogenesis of human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells in 3D  ap. 5117-5127.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA highly tunable synthetic biomimetic hydrogel platform was developed to study the growth and morphogenesis of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDEC) under the influence of a myriad of instructive cues. A PDEC line, PANC-1, was used as a model system to illustrate the importance of matrix compositions on cell fate determination. PANC-1 is an immortalized ductal epithelial cell line widely used in the study of pancreatic tumor cell behaviors. PANC-1 cells are also increasingly explored as a potential cell source for endocrine differentiation. Thus far, most studies related to PANC-1, among other PDEC lines, are performed on 2D culture surfaces. Here, we evaluated the effect of matrix compositions on PANC-1 cell growth and morphogenesis in 3D. Specifically, PANC-1 cells were encapsulated in PEG-based hydrogels prepared by step-growth thiol-ene photopolymerization. It was found that thiol-ene hydrogels provided a cytocompatible environment for encapsulation and 3D culture of PANC-1 cells. In contrast to a monolayer morphology on 2D culture surfaces, PANC-1 cells formed clusters in 3D thiol-ene hydrogels within 4 days of culture. After culturing for 10 days, however, the growth and structures of these clusters were significantly impacted by gel matrix properties, including sensitivity of the matrix to proteases, stiffness of the matrix, and ECM-mimetic motifs. The use of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) sensitive linker or the immobilization of fibronectin-derived RGDS ligand in the matrix promoted PANC-1 cell growth and encouraged them to adopt ductal cyst-like structures. On the other hand, the encapsulated cells formed smaller and more compact aggregates in non-MMP responsive gels. The incorporation of laminin-derived YIGSR peptide did not enhance cell growth and caused the cells to form compact aggregates. Immobilized YIGSR also enhanced the expression of epithelial cell markers including β-catenin and E-cadherin. These studies have established PEG-peptide hydrogels formed by thiol-ene photo-click reaction as a suitable platform for studying and manipulating pancreatic epithelial cell growth and morphogenesis in 3D.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomimetics 3acell growth 3aencapsulation 3aepithelial cells 3agels 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3ametalloproteinases 3amorphogenesis 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms1 aKi, Chang Seok1 aLin, Chien-Chi0 tBiomaterials.g2013 July, v. 34, no. 21 p.5117-5127dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03774naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008600183300001600269520210800285592002802393650002502421650001602446650001302462650001102475650001402486650001302500650002202513650001402535650001202549650003902561650003902600650002402639650001202663650002002675650001702695650002302712650006202735650002802797650001402825650002502839650002702864650003402891700002102925700002702946700002202973773013302995852000903128856008203137961001303219655001203232IND4389651620221123004813.0190430e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438965162DNAL7 a169271252pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-006-0021-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetkov, Daniel10aFull-length sequence analysis of four IBDV strains with different pathogenicities  ap. 315-326.  aCharacterization of field isolate 9109, Lukert, Edgar cell culture-adapted (CCA), and Edgar chicken embryo-adapted (CEA) serotype 1 IBDV strains using full-length genomic sequences is reported. IBDV genomic segments A and B were sequenced and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were compared with previously reported full-length sequenced IBDV strains. We found that the viral protein VPX and amino acid sequences between aa 202–451 and 210–473 of VP2 but not the entire VP2 protein are the best representatives of the entire IBDV genome. The greatest variability was found in the VP2 and 5′ non-coding region of segment B among IBDV strains. The deduced amino acid sequences of the VP1 protein varies in length among the strains analyzed. The RNA-dependent, RNA-polymerase motifs within VP1 and the VP5 protein were highly conserved among isolates. Although within the VP2 processing site, amino acid sequence of Lukert was similar to the classical while the Edgar CCA, and CEA were more similar to the very virulent strains, it was determined that these strains have sequence characteristics of the classical strains. In addition, close relatedness between Lukert, Edgar CCA and CEA was observed. Although phylogenetic analysis of the VP1, VP3, and VP4 proteins indicated that 9109 is a classical type virus, this isolate shares unique amino acid changes with very virulent strains within the same proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the 3′ and 5′ non-coding regions of segment A revealed that 9109 is more similar to the very virulent strains compared to the classical strains. In the VP2 protein, several amino acids were conserved between variant E and 9109 strains. Thus, it appears that 9109 isolate has characteristics of classical, very virulent, and variant strains. Our analysis indicates that although VPX amino acid comparison may be initially useful for molecular typing, full-length genomic sequence analysis is essential for thorough molecular characterization as partial sequences may not designate a particular strain as very virulent, classical, or variant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3achickens 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes 3aviruses 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxanalysis. 2a5' Untranslated Regionsxanalysis. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aChickensxvirology 2aInfectious bursal disease virusxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxanalysis 2aSequence Analysis, RNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aLinnemann, Erich1 aKapczynski, Darrell R.1 aSellers, Holly S.0 tVirus genes.g2007 June, v. 34, no. 3 p.315-326dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl53274x0920-85697nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-006-0021-83Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03668naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013300169300001800302520201100320592002802331650002102359650001902380650002902399650002402428650001702452650002602469650002502495650001702520650001302537650001602550650001302566650001102579650001802590650001802608650001102626650001402637650002002651650002602671650001602697651001802713653001402731653001702745653000802762653001302770653002802783653000902811700002402820700001902844700002902863700002202892773008302914856008402997852000903081655001203090IND60088327120221116181202.0160901e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008832712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Tiezheng10aCytotoxicity of commercial nano-TiO2 to Escherichia coli assessed by high-throughput screening: Effects of environmental factors  ap. 2352-2362.  aThe extensive use of nano-TiO2 in industry has led to growing concerns about its potential environmental impacts. However, negligible toxicity is commonly reported under insufficient illumination and artificial solution conditions in the literature, which rarely includes discussion of the regulating role of environmental factors. Herein, we report the results of a high-throughput screening assay to evaluate the acute cytotoxicity of six commercial nano-TiO2 materials to Escherichia coli (E. coli) using Lake Michigan water as a model for aquatic surface environments. In particular, we investigate the specific effects of illumination wavelength and natural organic matter (NOM) content. Under simulated solar irradiation, four anatase-based nano-TiO2 materials including Pigment White 6 exhibit significant bacterial toxicity (2 h-IC50 value of 2.7–9.1 mg/L), with toxicity thresholds much lower than previously reported. Negligible toxicity is caused either by pure-phase rutile or under dark condition. Formation of nano-TiO2 aggregates well beyond nano-scale does not eliminate their toxic effect, but photoactivity dominates over the primary size and extent of aggregation in determining the acute cytotoxicity of nano-TiO2. Under visible light irradiation (UVA&B blocked) the antibacterial activity of nano-TiO2 is essentially erased, whereas removing only UVB wavelengths slightly mitigates the toxicity. Suwannee River fulvic acid, acting as a natural dispersant, reverses the extent of nano-TiO2 aggregation, but also reduces its bacterial cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that despite particle aggregation, the short-term cytotoxicity of nano-TiO2 is predominantly attributed to its phototoxicity, emphasizing the importance of illumination conditions in toxicological screening of photoactive nanomaterials. In the natural aquatic environment, however, this acute toxicity may be mitigated by the attenuation of UV irradiation and increased NOM concentration in the water column.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacute toxicity 3aantibacterial properties 3aaquatic environment 3acytotoxicity 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3afulvic acids 3aindustry 3airradiation 3alighting 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3aphototoxicity 3arivers 3ascreening 3asolar radiation 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths 3aLake Michigan 0aNano-TiO2 0aCytotoxicity 0aHTS 0aBacteria 0aIllumination wavelength 0aSRFA1 aBinh, Chu Thi Thanh1 aKelly, John J.1 aGaillard, Jean-François1 aGray, Kimberly A.0 tWater research.g2013 May 01, v. 47 p.2352-2362dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010200168300001800270520123600288592002801524650001201552650001201564650000901576650001301585650001701598650002601615650002001641650001601661650002101677700002001698700001801718773010301736856008101839852000901920655001201929IND60440336520221119034539.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1554-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlahovec, Jiří10aLow-Temperature Carrot Cooking Supported by Pulsed Electric Field—DMA and DETA Thermal Analysis  ap. 2027-2035.  aThe paper deals with carrot processing that combines the effect of the electric pulse loading with the low-temperature heating. The pulse procedure was formed by one 10-ms long electric pulse (amplitude, 600 V/cm; basic frequency, 20 kHz) on the 160-ms long electric background less than 30 V/cm. The procedure was followed by the combined dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and dielectric thermal analysis (DETA) tests with the initial temperature of 30 °C and final temperature of 90 °C. Humidity in the test chamber was kept at 90 % during the whole heating test, with the heating rate of 1 °C/min. During the whole test, both components of the complex modulus of elasticity (DMA) of the specimen as well as both components of the specimen’s permittivity (DETA) were registered. A similar test was also performed with other specimens without the initial pulse procedure. Ratios of corresponding data (storage modulus, loss modulus, dielectric constant, and dielectric loss) are approximately constant up to the temperature of approximately 70 °C where it starts to reduce substantially. The obtained results denote that can be processed using electric pulses reaching the similar state as during the tissue heating.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrots 3acooking 3aheat 3ahumidity 3aloss modulus 3amodulus of elasticity 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3athermal analysis1 aKouřím, Pavel1 aKindl, Martin0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.2027-2035dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1554-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245013300166520169500299592002801994650002402022650002202046650002302068650001102091650001802102650001402120650001402134650001502148650001902163650001702182650001602199650002102215650001602236650001202252650001402264650001302278650001902291650001102310650001202321650003502333650000902368700002202377700002302399700002802422700002202450700002202472700002602494700002002520700001802540773011902558856007802677852000902755655001202764IND60703711120221120052805.0200721e20200419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070371112DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90405272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorman, Prince  E.10aPaternity Assignment in White Guinea Yam (Dioscorea Rotundata) Half-Sib Progenies from Polycross Mating Design Using SNP Markers  aWhite Guinea yam is mostly a dioecious outcrossing crop with male and female flowers produced on distinct plants. Fertile parents produce high fruit set in an open pollination polycross block, which is a cost-effective and convenient way of generating variability in yam breeding. However, the pollen parent of progeny from polycross mating is usually unknown. This study aimed to determine paternity in white Guinea yam half-sib progenies from polycross mating design. A total of 394 half-sib progenies from random open pollination involving nine female and three male parents was genotyped with 6602 SNP markers from DArTSeq platform to recover full pedigree. A higher proportion of expected heterozygosity, allelic richness, and evenness were observed in the half-sib progenies. A complete pedigree was established for all progenies from two families (TDr1685 and TDr1688) with 100% accuracy, while in the remaining families, paternity was assigned successfully only for 56 to 98% of the progenies. Our results indicated unequal paternal contribution under natural open pollination in yam, suggesting unequal pollen migrations or gene flow among the crossing parents. A total of 3.8% of progenies lacking paternal identity due to foreign pollen contamination outside the polycross block was observed. This study established the efficient determination of parental reconstruction and allelic contributions in the white Guinea yam half-sib progenies generated from open pollination polycross using SNP markers. Findings are useful for parental reconstruction, accurate dissection of the genetic effects, and selection in white Guinea yam breeding program utilizing polycross mating design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea rotundata 3abreeding programs 3acost effectiveness 3adioecy 3afemale plants 3afruit set 3agene flow 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3amale flowers 3amale plants 3aopen pollination 3aoutcrossing 3aparents 3apaternity 3apedigree 3aplant breeding 3apollen 3aprogeny 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ayams1 aPaterne, Agre  A.1 aDanquah, Agyemang 1 aTongoona, Pangirayi  B.1 aDanquah, Eric  Y.1 aDe Koeyer, David 1 aIkeogu, Ugochukwu  N.1 aAsiedu, Robert 1 aAsfaw, Asrat 0 tPlants.g2020 Apr. 19, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90405273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013700160300001800297520102600315592002801341650001501369650001401384650002501398650001201423650002901435650002101464650001801485650001401503650002101517650001401538650002301552650001201575650004301587650001601630650000901646650002101655650000901676650002801685650002001713650001101733650002701744650001101771700001901782700001701801700001201818700001301830773010301843856008101946852000902027655001202036IND60440336620221119034412.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1557-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ang10aPhysicochemical and Bioactive Properties of Soluble Dietary Fibers from Blasting Extrusion Processing (BEP)-Extruded Carrot Residues  ap. 2036-2046.  aA 50 % increase in the content of water-soluble dietary fibers from carrot residues (CRSDF) was obtained by a novel blasting extrusion processing (BEP) with improved water holding capacity and oil retention capacity. A neutral polysaccharide (CRSDF-2) was successfully separated by a DEAE-52-cellulose column chromatography system. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) showed that CRSDF-2 contained four sorts of monosaccharides: arabinose, xylose, glucose, and galactose with a molar ratio of 0.58:1.50:1.0:2.02. The average molecular weight of CRSDF-2 was estimated to be approximately 5.98 × 10⁴ Da. Moreover, it was illustrated that CRSDF displayed a high cation-exchange capacity and a high adsorption capacity for Pb cation. Furthermore, CRSDF was capable of binding sodium deoxycholate sodium cholate, sodium deoxycholate, and sodium taurocholate. CRSDF could be potentially used as a promising ingredient in functional food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarabinose 3abioactive properties 3acarrots 3acation exchange capacity 3adeoxycholic acid 3adietary fiber 3aextrusion 3afunctional foods 3agalactose 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aingredients 3alead 3amolecular weight 3aoils 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolysaccharides 3asodium 3awater holding capacity 3axylose1 aYan, Xiaoguang1 aXu, Xingyang1 aYe, Ran1 aChen, Ye0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.2036-2046dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1557-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245010200190300001600292520112500308592002801433653002101461653001801482653001401500653001501514653001701529653001201546700002101558700002401579700001901603773014101622856011501763852000901878655001201887IND60128236820221118132807.0151115e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823682DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[806:ROYPDT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruemper, Holly A.10aResponse of Yellow Perch Diet to a Changing Forage Base in Southern Lake Michigan, 1984––2002  ap. 806-816.  aThis study evaluated yellow perch (Perca flavescens) diet in southern Lake Michigan to determine whether prey consumed fluctuated with abundance of zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, and fish species during the period 1984 to 2002. Some change in benthic community abundance was evident from samples collected in the region during the period, including the naturalization of the round goby and the zebra mussel between 1993 and 2002. In addition, changes in fish abundance were evident from 1984 to 2002, when spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) increased, while yellow perch, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) declined. Non-indigenous species eaten by yellow perch in 2002 included spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes longimanus), round gobies, and alewives with the latter two species dominating the diet by volume. Yellow perch did exhibit prey preferences, although they consumed a variety of different organisms over the period of study. This euryphagous characteristic of yellow perch is expected to promote its persistence in southern Lake Michigan, despite a changing prey base.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPerca flavescens 0aLake Michigan 0afish diet 0around goby 0aBythotrephes 0aalewife1 aLauer, Thomas E.1 aMcComish, Thomas S.1 aEdgell, Rod A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2006 Dec., v. 32, no. 4 p.806-816dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282006%2932%5B806%3AROYPDT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245008100213300001600294520086700310592002801177650001201205650001901217650002501236650003301261650001201294773012701306856008501433852000901518655001201527IND60754692020221123011433.0220124e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075469202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2021.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSisco, Matthew Ryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0296-766414aThe effects of weather experiences on climate change attitudes and behaviors  ap. 111-117.  aUnderstanding how experiences with weather affect attitudes and behaviors related to climate change supports our efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

This review overviews recent research that has contributed further evidence regarding the effects of weather experiences on climate attitudes and behaviors. Studies on three accounts of mechanisms by which these effects may occur (affect activation, issue salience, and psychological distance) and three categories of potential moderators (media attention, motivated reasoning, and event attribution) are discussed. Lastly, recent work on how weather experiences may create climate policy windows is reviewed and general conclusions are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aweather0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2021 Oct., v. 52 p.111-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2021.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01509naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245007600167520054400243592002800787650002600815650002000841650001400861650002400875650002600899700003400925700002300959700001600982773012600998856007401124852000901198655001201207IND60652949420221120083419.0190713e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065294942DNAL7 a10.3390/su110925262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabregat-Aibar, Laura 12aA Bibliometric and Visualization Analysis of Socially Responsible Funds  aThe aims of this paper are (i) to identify which documents are the most influential when analyzing socially responsible funds, and (ii) to identify the conceptual structure of the field of research through co-word analysis.

This is very significant for preventing diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, oat bran is rich in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Therefore, it can be stated that oat bran can be used as a functional additive in bakery products. This study examined the effects of adding oat bran to wheat flour at different rates (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) on the rheological properties of dough, and functional and technological properties of breads made with three different methods (straight, sponge, and sourdough methods). Oat bran increased the amounts of dietary fiber, and the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of breads made with all three methods; it also increased the phytic acid content a little. The lowest phytic acid content was found in breads containing oat bran made with the sourdough method. In terms of phenolic content and antioxidant activity, there was not much difference between breads made with the sponge and sourdough methods, but breads made with straight dough methods had lower phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The highest recoverable work, elasticity, and cohesiveness values were obtained for breads made by the straight method, while the hardest and chewiest breads were those made with the sourdough method. In the sensory evaluation, breads made by the straight method received mostly the highest scores, and breads made with the sponge method were more appreciated in terms of taste and odor characteristics. According to the scores given by the panelists, breads containing up to 10% oat bran made by all three methods had acceptable properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abreadmaking 3abreads 3acohesion 3adiabetes 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3agastronomy 3aoat bran 3aobesity 3aodors 3aphytic acid 3arice bran 3asensory evaluation 3asourdough 3ataste 3awheat 3awheat flour 0aFunctional compounds 0aBread-making methods 0aBread quality1 aÖzkaya, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7326-73691 aSaka, İ.0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2021 Dec., v. 26 p.100439-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1004393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002700146245006900173300001100242520106600253592002801319650001301347650001001360650001801370650002601388650003301414651001201447651001301459700002101472773013701493852000901630856008201639930003301721945001301754946001301767655001201780IND2322937020221118044140.0160903e200103  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232293702DNAL7 a10.1198/1085711013003252562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadima, Jorge F.

The first few principal components (PCs) of a set of variables are derived variables with optimal properties in terms of approximating the original variables. This paper considers the problem of identifying subsets of variables that best approximate the full set of variables or their first few PCs, thus stressing dimensionality reduction in terms of the original variables rather than in terms of derived variables (PCs) whose definition requires all the original variables. Criteria for selecting variables are often ill defined and may produce inappropriate subsets. Indicators of the performance of different subsets of the variables are discussed and two criteria are defined. These criteria are used in stepwise selection-type algorithms to choose good subsets. Examples are given that show, among other things, that the selection of variable subsets should not be based only on the PC loadings of the variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrayfish 3afarms 3adata analysis 3amultivariate analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3aOntario 3aPortugal1 aJolliffe, I.

Azoxystrobin resistance related to mutations at the P. oryzae target protein (F129L of Cytb) has been reported worldwide. To quickly identify and detect resistant strains in the field, this research established a rapid loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection system for the F129L mutation. The system could detect the P. oryzae F129L (TTC-TTA) mutation at 62 °C within 60 min, with a detection limit of 100 fg/μL, which is 10 times higher than for conventional PCR. The method had high specificity and repeatability and could detect the F129L (TTC-TTA) mutation in plant tissues within 3 h. The LAMP method established in this study will be useful to detect azoxystrobin-resistant P. oryzae F129L mutant strains and generate significant data for the management of resistant P. oryzae isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aazoxystrobin 3ablast disease 3adetection limit 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amutants 3amutation 3amycology 0aLAMP 0aF129L mutation 0aPyricularia oryzae 0aResistance detection1 aWang, Kai1 aZhang, Huazhong1 aYang, Di1 aDeng, Yunyan1 aWang, Yingzi1 aQi, Zhiqiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8022-786X0 tFungal biology.g2022 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.47-53dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2021.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001800301520112100319592002801440650001901468650001701487650002501504650001101529650001901540650002501559650001001584650001101594650001401605650001101619650002201630650001701652650001201669650001601681650002301697650001201720650002301732650001901755700002001774700002001794700001701814773010301831856008101934852000902015655001202024IND60440336920221119034414.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1561-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowicka, Paulina10aChemical Composition, Antioxidant Capacity, and Sensory Quality of Dried Sour Cherry Fruits pre-Dehydrated in Fruit Concentrates  ap. 2076-2095.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of combined drying methods by osmotic dehydration (OD) using several fruit concentrates (apple, blackcurrant, chokeberry, sour cherry, raspberry, quince, flowering quince) or sucrose solution, before combined drying involving convective drying (CD) and vacuum-microwave finish drying (VMFD), on the quality parameters (phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, color, and other chemical parameters (titratable acidity, pH, dry matter, and water activity)) of dried sour cherry (DSC). OD in some concentrates resulted in enriching the DSC in polyphenols (from 6.4 to 22.4 % OD in sour cherry and chokeberry, respectively), especially in polymeric procyanidins (up to 1.5 times OD in the chokeberry concentrate), but it also reduced the content of anthocyanins (from 10.14 to 65.07 % OD in blackcurrant and sucrose solution, respectively). OD pre-treatment stimulated also the antioxidant activity and other chemical parameters of the DSC. The study revealed that DSC osmo-dehydrated prior to combined drying approach allowed for obtaining attractive final products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus cerasus 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3ablack currants 3achemical composition 3acolor 3adrying 3aflowering 3afruits 3aosmotic treatment 3aprocyanidins 3aquinces 3araspberries 3asensory properties 3asucrose 3atitratable acidity 3awater activity1 aWojdyło, Aneta1 aLech, Krzysztof1 aFigiel, Adam0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.2076-2095dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1561-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009500159300001400254500002000268520089400288592002801182650002101210650002501231650002201256650002101278650002001299650001001319650001901329650001401348650001801362650000901380700002401389773010901413856007401522852000901596655001201605IND60765893420221118001237.0220204e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076589342DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.216492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Kadie10aMortality trends for five species of macropods from a single institution from 1995 to 2016  ap. 44-49.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMacropods are commonly kept and exhibited species worldwide. Mortality records were reviewed for five species of macropods housed at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo from 1995 to 2016. One hundred sixty‐seven deaths occurred including Western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) (n = 22), Bennett's wallaby (M. rufogriseus) (n = 64), red kangaroo (M. rufus) (n = 56), wallaroo (M. robustus) (n = 9), and Tammar wallaby (M. eugenii) (n = 16). The leading cause of death was trauma, followed by bronchopneumonia for all species. Gastric dilatation was identified as a concern for red kangaroo. Females lived longer than males across species and were overrepresented by the data set. Oral necrobacillosis and osteomyelitis were health concerns for macropods in this review. Mortality reviews are important as they identifying collection trends and influencing long‐term care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropus eugenii 3aMacropus fuliginosus 3aMacropus robustus 3abronchopneumonia 3adata collection 3adeath 3along term care 3amortality 3aosteomyelitis 3azoos1 aDennis, Patricia M.0 tZoo biology.g2022 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.44-49dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34050x0733-31887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/zoo.216493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245015200165300001600317500001900333500002000352520099900372592002801371650002201399650001101421650001101432650001601443650001701459650001301476650001901489650001101508650001401519650001001533700002901543700002201572700003401594700005901628700001801687773013301705856007301838852000901911655001201920IND60722281820221121145913.0201230e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072228182DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.125212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAliyu, Mohammed Kabir10aMobility of copper and its micro‐structure characteristics in contaminated river sediment through stabilization by using cement and rice husk ash  ap. 229-238.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effectiveness of replacing cement with rice husk ash (RHA) on the leachability of copper from stabilized sediment was studied. RHA was added at 5, 10 15 and 20% and also cement was added at 10% throughout to the total dry weight of mixture, after which curing was undertaken at room atmosphere for 7, 14 and 28 days. The immobilization efficiency of amendments was evaluated using TCLP and SPLP. The high percentage efficiency of treatment was observed for the TCLP as 97.82 and 99.92% at 28 days for the SPLP. Characterization study was carried out using X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to study the reaction products and crystalline phases of the treated sediment after 28 days to observe the possible mechanisms responsible for the immobilization of the investigated heavy metal. Results have indicated that partial replacement of cement with RHA in binder system has increased the strength and reduced leachability of copper of the treated sediment compared to untreated sediment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acement 3acopper 3aenvironment 3aheavy metals 3ahusk ash 3amicrostructure 3arivers 3asediments 3awater1 aKarim, Ahmad Tarmizi Abd1 aChan, Chee‐Ming1 aOyekanmi, Adeleke Abdulrahman1 aHossain, Kaizar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3903-61611 aIsmail, Norli0 tWater and environment journal.g2020 Dec., v. 34 Suppl S1 p.229-238dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245007700151300001400228520138400242592002801626650002501654650002201679650001701701650000901718650001201727650001001739650002601749650001301775650001201788650001401800650000901814650001501823651002201838653001801860653001401878653001701892653000901909653001301918700001701931773008901948856003802037852000902075655001202084IND4485554220221116192132.0120319s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448555422DNAL7 a10.1071/AM110172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShort, Jeff10aDistribution and status of the red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura)  ap. 88-99.  aThe red-tailed phascogale once extended widely across semiarid and arid Australia, but is now entirely confined to the southern wheatbelt of Western Australia, occupying less than 1% of its former range. Here it occurs in a portion of the Avon Wheatbelt, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, and Esperance Plains biogeographical regions. The species persists only in areas that have been extensively cleared for agriculture and where the remaining bushland is highly fragmented. It does not appear to extend into unfragmented habitat in either the Jarrah Forest to the west or Mallee region to the east. It occurs primarily in woodland habitat with old-growth hollow-producing eucalypts, primarily wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) or York Gum (E. loxophleba), but records from the periphery of its current range appear to come from a broader range of habitats, including shrublands and various mosaics of woodland, shrubland, and scrub-heath. Key factors limiting persistence are likely to be fragmentation of habitat that is likely to greatly increase the risks associated with dispersal, a shortage of suitable nesting hollows in many vegetation associations, and predation by feral and domestic cats and by foxes. These factors, particularly fragmentation and lack of suitable nesting hollows, suggest that the species’ long-term persistence in areas beyond the wandoo belt is far from assured.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus marginata 3aEucalyptus wandoo 3abiogeography 3acats 3aforests 3afoxes 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3anesting 3apredation 3arisk 3ashrublands 3aWestern Australia 0afragmentation 0aferal cat 0atree hollows 0afire 0adasyurid1 aHide, Andrew0 tAustralian mammalogy.g2012, v. 34, no. 1 p.88-99dCSIRO Publishingx0310-00497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AM11017  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007800169500001900247520175000266592002802016650001502044650001702059650001402076650003002090650002402120650001602144650002102160650002402181650002102205650001502226650002402241650001202265650001002277650001702287653002302304653001702327653002002344653002302364653001802387700001502405700002602420700002102446773011602467856008502583852000902668655001202677IND60735726320221118175659.0210527e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073572632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Sarah10aRestored river-floodplain connectivity promotes woody plant establishment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRiparian forest ecosystems are declining globally. Many floodplains no longer flood and thus cease to satisfy the hydrologic requirements for riparian tree maintenance and regeneration. To promote woody riparian plant recruitment where flood regimes have been altered by flow regulation, effective approaches to restoration need to be developed. We implemented a landscape-scale experiment in a remnant, temperate floodplain forest. By constructing two weirs within channelized reaches of a stream, we redirected flows into networks of historic distributary channels, which facilitated widespread floodplain inundation. Using a control-reference-impact study design, we assessed the establishment and growth of planted seedlings of three woody species (Eucalyptus camphora, Leptospermum lanigerum and Melaleuca squarrosa) over 13 months in response to flooding achieved by floodplain reconnection. Planted seedlings had higher height and diameter growth rates at both induced (19–29 cm, 1 mm) and naturally flooded (34–44 cm, 3–5 mm) than at non-flooded (4–10 cm, −5 to −3 mm) sites. However, survival rates and temporal growth patterns differed between species according to variation in flood duration and soil moisture, illustrating the different hydrological requirements of the coexisting species. This highlights that variable flooding and drying patterns are essential to create recruitment niches for different riparian plant species and shows the importance of river-floodplain connectivity for providing adequate flooding regimes. Our study demonstrates the suitability of two complementary restoration approaches – restoring hydrology and active revegetation – for promoting the regeneration of riparian forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aLeptospermum 3aMelaleuca 3aadministrative management 3aexperimental design 3afloodplains 3aland restoration 3aplant establishment 3ariparian forests 3asoil water 3aspecies recruitment 3astreams 3atrees 3awoody plants 0aForest restoration 0aRevegetation 0aFlooding regime 0aHydrological niche 0aSoil moisture1 aGreet, Joe1 aWalsh, Christopher J.1 aCatford, Jane A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 493 p.119264-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245007800170300001300248520139100261592002801652650001901680650002001699650001201719650001601731650001601747650001301763650001201776650001701788651001001805653001301815653002501828653002801853653001501881653001001896700001501906700001901921773009101940856008902031852000902120655001202129IND60629745520221121003448.0190319e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yansui10aStrategic adjustment of land use policy under the economic transformation  ap. 5-14.  aChina is experiencing a huge change in its social, economic and ecological development. It has entered a transformational period of the “new normal” of its economy while its gravity center of the grain production presents a northward trend cased by global climate change, with ecological civilization construction proposing an unprecedented urgent request regarding the optimization of territorial management and the reconstruction of production, living and ecology space. Due to China’s new normal, new ideas and countermeasures are needed to develop land use patterns and policies to adapt to China's strategic transformation. Regarding the challenges to land use during the transformation, this paper explores the strategic adjustment of land use policy in China's new normal and proposes the optimization of urban-rural spatial structure with a focus on urban-rural coordinated development in future land development by land engineering and land consolidation. Utilizing China's second largest economy is the key to finding solutions in the adjustment of land use and policymaking during economic transformation, whereas healthful and reasonable urbanization serves a vital role in building a harmonious society. Continuous work by government at all levels to reform land systems and research of land use by different divisions should be adopted according to local conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3aecology 3aengineering 3aland policy 3aland use 3asociety 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aLand use 0aStrategic adjustment 0aEconomic transformation 0aNew normal 0aChina1 aLi, Jintao1 aYang, Yuanyuan0 tLand use policy.g2018 May, v. 74 p.5-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014500168300001800313520166100331592002801992650001102020650001202031650001302043650001802056650001302074650001202087650001502099650001602114650001102130650002502141650001602166700001802182700003002200700002302230700001702253700001602270700001902286700001802305773010302323856008102426852000902507655001202516IND60440337220221119032034.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1562-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Beers, Robbe10aOptimal Illumination-Detection Distance and Detector Size for Predicting Braeburn Apple Maturity from Vis/NIR Laser Reflectance Measurements  ap. 2123-2136.  aThe storage potential of apples highly depends on the maturity at harvest. Optical methods have been proposed to measure maturity in a fast, reliable and non-destructive way. However, the signal is often composed of photons with different penetration depths into the material. An attempt to separate these photons might result in more precise correlations with quality attributes, as these could relate to a specific layer/depth into the sample. Therefore, a Vis/NIR spatially resolved laser reflectance setup was used, combining a supercontinuum laser and a monochromator to illuminate samples with a monochrome focused beam in the 550–1000 nm wavelength range. A panchromatic camera was used to obtain diffuse reflectance profiles at each wavelength. In the period starting 50 days before until 11 days after commercial harvest, 320 Braeburn apples were measured. Partial least squares regression models were developed to relate apple maturity/quality to the diffuse reflectance spectra at different distances from the illumination point. The effect of detector size (spatial bandwidth) was also evaluated. A bandwidth of 0.82 mm in combination with a parameter specific illumination-detection distance, gave the best results. Using an internal test set, an R ² of prediction of 0.98 and 0.93, and a ratio of prediction to performance (RPD) of 5.84 and 3.42, predicting, respectively, the Streif index and starch conversion values was obtained. The predictions of soluble solids content (SSC) (R ² of 0.81; RPD of 2.04) and firmness (R ² of 0.65; RPD of 1.66) were less accurate. Also, worse predictions were obtained using an external test set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acameras 3afirmness 3aleast squares 3alighting 3aphotons 3aprediction 3areflectance 3astarch 3atotal soluble solids 3awavelengths1 aAernouts, Ben1 aLeón Gutiérrez, Lorenzo1 aErkinbaev, Chyngyz1 aRutten, Koen1 aSchenk, Ann1 aNicolaï, Bart1 aSaeys, Wouter0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 Oct., v. 8, no. 10 p.2123-2136dSpringer USx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1562-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017100163300001800334500001500352520147000367592002801837650001901865650002001884650002101904650001601925650001801941650001501959650002801974650001802002650002302020650000702043650001502050650002502065650001902090650002302109650001402132653002002146700002002166700001902186700001802205700002002223773010202243856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60440337320221119032318.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1521-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Ashay10aMicroencapsulation by Complex Coacervation Using Whey Protein Isolates and Gum Acacia: An Approach to Preserve the Functionality and Controlled Release of β-Carotene  ap. 1635-1644.  a2019-12-06  aβ-Carotene is a red–orange pigment, a known source of vitamin A and has exceptional antioxidant and free radical scavenging potential. However, uses of β-carotene in food industry are inadequate mostly because of their poor water solubility and low stability. Using the complex coacervation technique, the work is meant to fabricate the microcapsules of β-carotene, to examine the physicochemical properties of microcapsules and finally to evaluate the extent of stability improvement. The configuration of electrostatic complexes between whey protein isolate (WPI) and gum acacia (Acacia arabica, GA) was optimized as a function of pH, ionic strength, WPI/GA ratio, core material load and size of final micromolecules. The optimum process conditions were balanced by the ratio of wall materials WPI/GA 2.0/1.0 % and pH value 4.2. Morphological observations showed that microcapsules presented spherical shape, and smooth and continuous surface. The effective amount of encapsulated core was greater than 70 % for all formulations evaluated. In vitro release data indicated an initial burst release followed by sustained release behavior. The microstructure and viscoelastic properties of WPI and GA complex were studied using dynamic rheometer. The encapsulation method and the wall materials used in this work gave effective protection during storage and eventually resulted sustained release of bioactive while used in food matrix, at suitable conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrostructure 3aviscoelasticity 3awater solubility 3afood matrix 3afood industry 3agum arabic 3afree radical scavengers 3abeta-carotene 3amicroencapsulation 3apH 3arheometers 3awhey protein isolate 3aionic strength 3aVachellia nilotica 3avitamin A 0aAcacia nilotica1 aThakur, Deepika1 aGhoshal, Gargi1 aKatare, O.

Quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of urban expansion is essential to monitor and assess the process of urbanization and offer a theoretical basis for rural restructuring and landscape dynamics. In this paper, we used the remotely sensed land use data to quantify and research spatio-temporal patterns of urban expansion from 1985 to 2013 in Beijing, China. This study integrated methods of statistical analysis (i.e., calculation of time series landscape matrices and urban expansion index) and the gravity-center model to study the landscape configuration, the holistic change of urban land in area, size, expansion speed and movement direction, respectively. Meanwhile, GIS-based buffer analysis was also applied to study the spatial mode of urban expansion in Beijing. Results demonstrated that (1) Beijing has experienced magnificent urban sprawl in the last 28 years. The combination of time series landscape matrices exhibited a typical spatial configuration of urban sprawling in Beijing: leapfrog development of new urban nuclei formation in areas which were non-adjacent to existing urban centers with obvious fragmentation, as well as expansion of existing urban areas resulting in contiguous urban entities in each time interval; (2) The gravity center of urban land continued moving northeastward, except during the time intervals of 1995–2000 and 2010–2013 when it moved southward; (3) The northern fan-shaped suburb was the most active area of urban expansion before 2005, and urban later had a concentrated expansion toward the southern inverted-triangle-shaped area; and (4) Urban sprawl presented denotative features along the motorways, while urban also expanded in the form of a big pancake.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3ahighways 3aindustrialization 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amodernization 3astatistical analysis 3asuburban areas 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrban expansion 0aChange of spatio-temporal patterns 0aRural-urban development transformation 0aBeijing1 aLiu, Yansui1 aLi, Yurui1 aDu, Guoming0 tLand use policy.g2018 May, v. 74 p.220-230dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245014700169520143700316592002801753650004401781650000901825650002201834650000901856650002001865650004301885650002101928650002501949650001301974650001901987650001602006650002002022650001702042650002602059650002502085650001002110651002102120700002002141700001802161700002702179700001902206773011902225856007802344852000902422655001202431IND60703711820221117161324.0200721e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070371182DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90405342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkter, Kazi-Marjahan 10aComparative Studies of Fraxinus Species from Korea Using Microscopic Characterization, Phytochemical Analysis, and Anti-Lipase Enzyme Activity  aFraxinus species belongs to the Oleaceae family, commonly known as Ash tree, and has been utilized as a folk medicine with various medicinal properties, including anti-obesity activity. The goal of the present study was to establish quality control parameters using microscopic characterization, phytochemical differentiation, and anti-lipase activity evaluation of five Fraxinus plants in Korea. Microscopic evaluation of the lower surface, petiole, and midrib of leaves, and stem bark showed discriminative anatomical characteristics, such as the stomatal index of the lower leaf surface; the number of sclerenchyma cells, and the diameter of parenchyma cells in the petiole and midrib; and the cork cell size and fiber frequency in the stem bark. Phytochemical analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography revealed the significant variation in the chemical profiles of the 12 major secondary metabolites among the samples. The orthogonal projections to latent structure-discrimination analysis efficiently differentiated each group belonging to each Fraxinus plant with the anatomical and quantification data. F. rhynchophylla and ligstroside showed the most potent anti-lipase activity among the plants and the 12 major metabolites, respectively. These findings could serve as the scientific criteria for the appropriate identification and establishment of standards for the use of Fraxinus species as medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFraxinus chinensis subsp. rhynchophylla 3abark 3acomparative study 3acork 3aenzyme activity 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3apetioles 3aphytochemicals 3aplant veins 3aquality control 3asclerenchyma 3asecondary metabolites 3atraditional medicine 3atrees 3aKorean Peninsula1 aPark, Woo  Sung1 aKim, Hye-jin,1 aKhalil, Atif  Ali Khan1 aAhn, Mi-Jeong 0 tPlants.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90405343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007500167300001500242500001500257520133500272592002801607650001401635650000901649650001701658650001201675650002001687650002301707650001701730650001801747650000901765650001201774650001801786650001401804650001901818650002401837650001101861650001101872650001201883650001301895650003501908650001201943650001301955650000901968650002001977650001401997650000802011650001302019650001102032650002302043650001602066651001102082651001102093651001402104653001402118653002602132653001802158700002102176773009402197856008402291852000902375655001202384IND60479763020221119180421.0160123e20070301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047976302DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.36.2007.1.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuzouni, P.

The primary underlying assumption in such studies is that a sample of wastewater is equivalent to a cumulative sample of urine. Drug metabolism in humans is predominantly enzymatically mediated, but these processes are not exclusive to the human body, and are found to occur in the environment and the sewer network. Understanding what happens to drugs and their urinary metabolites in the sewer system between the point of excretion and sampling is particularly important since it is possible that in-sewer transformation may influence final biomarker concentration. The present study uses batch experiments to measure and assess the biotransformation processes of cocaine and its two major human metabolites, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The activated sludge modelling framework for xenobiotic organic micro-pollutants (ASM-X) is used for model structure identification and calibration. Biotransformation was observed to follow pseudo first-order kinetics. The biodegradation kinetics of cocaine, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester is not significantly affected by the availability of dissolved oxygen. Results obtained in this study show that omitting in-pipe biotransformation affects the accuracy of back-calculated cocaine use estimates. This varies markedly depending on the in-sewer hydraulic retention time, total biomass concentration and the relative concentration of each metabolite. However, back-calculated cocaine use estimates derived from wastewater concentrations of benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester do show very close agreement if ex-vivo biotransformation of these compounds is considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiodegradation 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acocaine 3adissolved oxygen 3aexcretion 3ahumans 3aillicit drugs 3ametabolites 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3aquantitative analysis 3asorption 3astreams 3aurine 3awastewater 2aAdsorption 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aBiotransformation 2aCocainexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aComputer Simulation 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 0aTrace chemicals or micro-pollutants 0aCocaine biomarkers 0aBiotransformation kinetics 0aSorption 0aBack-calculation of illicit drug consumption 0aSewage epidemiology1 aReid, Malcolm J.1 aBorup, Morten1 aLangford, Katherine H.1 aThomas, Kevin V.0 tWater research.g2013 May 01, v. 47 p.2129-2140dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011000166300001800276500001400294520144800308592002801756650002201784650001601806650001201822650001601834650002001850650001801870650001701888650002001905650001201925650002101937650001501958650002201973650001701995650001902012650001402031650001102045700002702056700002502083700002802108700005802136700006202194773011902256856008302375852000902458655001202467IND60675335820221120133223.0191105e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067533582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b007142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Yu-Chen10aDevelopment of an Efficient Enzyme Production and Structure-Based Discovery Platform for BACE1 Inhibitors  ap. 4424-4435.  aNAL-light  aBACE1 (Beta-site Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) Cleaving Enzyme 1) is a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, efficient expression, purification, and crystallization systems are not well described or detailed in the literature nor are approaches for treatment of enzyme kinetic data for potent inhibitors well described. We therefore developed a platform for expression and purification of BACE1, including protein refolding from E.coli inclusion bodies, in addition to optimizing a reproducible crystallization procedure of BACE1 bound with inhibitors. We also report a detailed approach to the proper analysis of enzyme kinetic data for compounds that exhibit either rapid-equilibrium or tight-binding mechanisms. Our methods allow for the purification of ∼15 mg of BACE1 enzyme from 1 L of culture which is higher than reported yields in the current literature. To evaluate the data analysis approach developed here, a well-known potent inhibitor and two of its derivatives were tested, analyzed, and compared. The inhibitory constants (Kᵢ) obtained from the kinetic studies are in agreement with dissociation constants (Kd) that were also determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The X-ray structures of these three compounds in complex with BACE1 were readily obtained and provide important insight into the structure and thermodynamics of the BACE1-inhibitor interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aX-radiation 3aamyloid 3acalorimetry 3acrystallization 3adata analysis 3adissociation 3aenzyme kinetics 3aenzymes 3ainclusion bodies 3aliterature 3aprotein refolding 3atherapeutics 3athermodynamics 3atitration 3ayields1 aKammeyer, Annalissa M.1 aJensen, Katherine C.1 aTirlangi, Jagannadharao1 aGhosh, Arun K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2472-18411 aMesecar, Andrew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-25770 tBiochemistry.g2019 Sept. 24, v. 58, no. 44 p.4424-4435dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b007143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011600162300001600278520101800294592002801312650002501340650001401365650000901379650002001388650002001408650001601428700001901444773010301463856008101566990002301647852000901670655001201679IND60093401220221118172618.0141103e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009340122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aAnalysis of MHD thermosolutal Marangoni convection with the heat generation and a first-order chemical reaction  ap. 449-455.  aThe paper deals with thermosolutal Marangoni convection, which can be formed with an electrically conducting fluid along a vertical surface in the presence of a magnetic field, heat generation and a first-order chemical reaction. In conformity to actuality, it is assumed that the surface tension varies linearly with both the temperature and concentration and that both interface temperature and concentration are quadratic functions of the interface arc length x. The general governing partial differential equations are converted into nonlinear ordinary differential equations using unique similarity transformations. The analytical approximate solutions of similarity equations are firstly obtained by double-parameter transformation perturbation expansion method and Padé approximants technique. The effects of Hartmann number, heat generation coefficient and the chemical reaction coefficient on the velocity, temperature and concentration profiles as well as the wall velocity are presented and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3aequations 3aheat 3amagnetic fields 3asurface tension 3atemperature1 aZheng, Liancun0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 69, no. 1 p.449-455dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.0693Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011500131300001600246520109300262592002801355650001301383650001301396650001701409650000901426650002101435650001001456650001401466650001201480650001601492650001201508650001101520650001801531650001301549650001101562650001701573650001301590650001001603651001001613653000801623653002901631653001701660700002101677700001801698773019801716852000901914655001201923IND60706287120221120155747.0201224e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070628712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Rakesh10aInitiatives of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in Doubling of Farmers Income: A Case Study of Village Sagoon, Jammu  ap. 379-383.  aThe study was conducted in Jammu district of Jammu and Kashmir state to assess the impact of KVK interventions. Situation analysis revealed that majority of the farmers lacked knowledge about improved varieties and practices of cereals, pulses and oilseed crops which contributes for higher productivity. KVK conducted frontline demonstrations and capacity building programmes to built the confidence of the stakeholders in order to shift them from traditional Maize-wheat cropping system to pulses and oilseed based cropping system. The adoption of hybrid maize seed and line sowing helped the farmers to obtain 36 percent more grain yield and an additional income of Rs. 6446 per hectare. Cultivation of pulses and oilseeds helped the farmers to fetch an additional income of Rs. 40, 800 and 6100 per ha, respectively. Moreover, demonstrations of proven technologies of wheat helped the farmers to fetch more yield per unit area. Overall, the KVK activities opens new horizons and helped farmers to think differently than the routine cultivation of traditional crops namely maize-wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3aZea mays 3acase studies 3acorn 3acropping systems 3acrops 3acultivars 3afarmers 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3aincome 3aoilseed crops 3aoilseeds 3asowing 3astakeholders 3avillages 3awheat 3aIndia 0aKVK 0aFrontline demonstrations 0aTechnologies1 aChoudhary, Punit1 aTandon, Vikas0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2019 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.379-383dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005800167300001600225520123600241592002801477650001901505650001601524650001401540650002801554650002001582650001601602650000901618650001401627650001801641650001101659650001201670650002601682650003601708650001301744650003801757650001001795700002001805700001801825700001901843700002201862700002001884773012801904856008202032852000902114655001202123IND60516395420221121172117.0190727e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639542DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797120004392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMSILINI, NAJOUA10aResponses of two lettuce cultivars to iron deficiency  ap. 523-535.  aA comparative study of two lettuce varieties (Lactuca sativa: ‘Romaine’ and ‘Vista’) was conducted to understand the effect of iron deficiency on growth, biomass allocation, chlorophyll fluorescence and root and leaf enzymatic activity. After 15 days of growth in hydroponic solution under Fe-deficient and Fe-sufficient conditions, leaf chlorophyll concentration, activities of ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in leaves extract, ferric chelate reductase (FCR) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in root extracts were measured. We found that there were significant differences in fresh matter accumulation and pigment concentration between the varieties. Fresh weight and total leaf area and leaf number were significantly reduced under iron deficiency. There was also a significant decrease in photosynthetic pigment concentration in both varieties. In response to Fe deficiency, ‘Vista’ variety showed higher FCR and PEPC activities compared to ‘Romaine’ variety. Moreover, this increase was accompanied by an enhanced accumulation of phenolic compound in roots of ‘Vista’ variety. These findings show that ‘Romaine’ was more affected by iron deficiency than ‘Vista’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3adry matter partitioning 3aenzyme activity 3ahydroponics 3airon 3aleaf area 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alettuce 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aribulose 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aroots1 aATTIA, HOUNEIDA1 aRABHI, MOKDED1 aKARRAY, NAJOUA1 aLACHAÂL, MOKHTAR1 aOUERGHI, ZEINEB0 tExperimental agriculture.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 4 p.523-535dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797120004393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014700166506031000313520122700623592002801850650001201878650002001890650001001910650001101920650002401931650001201955650001301967650001701980650001201997650001302009650002702022650001202049650001502061653001802076653001502094653001502109653002502124653001702149700002502166700002402191700002002215773010902235856008102344852000902425655001202434IND60519191820221123004850.0160421e20151013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051919182DNAL7 a10.4081/jlimnol.2015.12622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBERACKO, Pavel10aCommunity Structure, Life Histories and Secondary Production of Stoneflies in Two Small Mountain Streams with Different Degree of Forest Cover  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aOur study examines community structure and nymphal biology (life cycles and secondary production) of stoneflies in two adjacent mountain streams with different degree of forest cover in the Prosiečanka River Basin (Chočské Vrchy Mts., West Carpathians). One of the streams has non-forested catchment, converted to meadows and pastures, while the other one has catchment with 60% covered by spruce forest. Differences in forest cover and in thermal regime of the streams were reflected by the difference of stonefly communities at their structural and functional level. Species Nemoura cinerea and Leuctra aurita created stonefly assemblage in non-forested stream, whereas Nemoura cinerea also occurred in naturally forested stream together with species Leuctra armata, Leuctra nigra, Leuctra prima, Siphonoperla neglecta and Arcynopteryx dichroa. All examined species had maximally annual life cycle and in eudominant species Nemoura cinerea one month shift was found in nymphal hatching and adult emergence between streams. Total secondary production of stoneflies in undisturbed stream (126.46 mg DW m–² y–¹) was more than two times higher than the production in non-forested stream (47.39 mg DW m–² y–¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeuctra 3aNemoura cinerea 3aPicea 3aadults 3acommunity structure 3aforests 3ahatching 3alife history 3ameadows 3apastures 3asecondary productivity 3astreams 3awatersheds 0aDeforestation 0aPlecoptera 0alife cycle 0asecondary production 0asmall stream1 aKUŠNÍROVÁ, Andrea1 aPARTLOVÁ, Michaela1 aCICEKOVÁ, Jana0 tJournal of limnology.g2015 Oct. 13, v. 75, no. 1dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx1723-86337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2015.12623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013800158300002000296520038900316592002800705650001800733650001300751650003000764650001900794650003400813650001900847650002100866700001700887700002600904700002200930700003300952700002000985700001801005700002001023700001901043700001801062700002301080773013601103856007401239852000901313655001201322IND60660981620221121190330.0190827e20150630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098162DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02989a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolmer, Marek10aOn-surface polymerization on a semiconducting oxide: aryl halide coupling controlled by surface hydroxyl groups on rutile TiO₂(011)  ap. 11276-11279.  aBased on scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, we show that the covalent coupling of aryl halide monomers on the rutile TiO₂(011)-(2 × 1) surface is controlled by the density of surface hydroxyl groups.

Three types of replacement dolomite can be distinguished: (1) micritic-microcrystalline dolomite (<30μm) with some shale content (Type 1); (2) very fine crystalline dolomite (30–100μm) with anhedral-subhedral dolomite crystals (Type 2); and (3) fine crystalline dolomite (>100μm) with anhedral-subhedral dolomite crystals (Type 3). The anhedral to subhedral fine crystalline crystals in Type 3 dolomite are truncated by a stylolite, which indicates that the formation of Type 3 dolomite most likely occurred simultaneously or predated the stylolite formation. Stratigraphic, petrographic and geochemical data indicate that the ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios (0.70839 to 0.71117) of the D2g dolomites, which are higher than those of the contemporaneous seawater (0.70780–0.70830), were affected by the underlying siliciclastic rocks of the Jinbaoshi Formation (D2j), Pingyipu Formation (D1p) and Silurian strata. The dolomitizing fluids incorporated elemental Sr, which tends to be abundant in crustal fluids. The rare earth element (REE) compositions of the D2g dolomites are characterized by enrichment in light REEs and depletion in heavy REEs, Ce, and Eu, indicating that the dolomites of the D2g inherited the characteristics of the contemporaneous seawater and formed in a low-temperature, relatively oxic environment. The δ¹⁸O values of Type 1 and Type 2 dolomites (−6.3‰ to +0.43‰ and −7.2‰ to −1.69‰, respectively) are slightly higher than those of seawater-derived dolomite, suggesting that these dolomites may be related to the evaporation of seawater during the penecontemporaneous stage. The δ¹⁸O values of Type 3 dolomite (−8.32‰ to −0.83‰) are slightly lower than those of the seawater-derived dolomites, indicating that this dolomite may have formed at a higher temperature during shallow-moderate burial. Type 1 dolomite has higher δ¹⁸O values, Sr²⁺ concentrations and total REE (∑REE) concentrations and slightly lower Mn²⁺ concentrations than the other two types of dolomite, suggesting that Type 1 dolomite formed via capillary concentration dolomitization from evaporated seawater. Type 2 dolomite has lower δ¹⁸O values and ∑REE contents and slightly higher Mn²⁺ and Sr²⁺ concentrations than Type 1 dolomite, suggesting that Type 2 dolomite formed via the seepage-reflux process from denser seawater. Type 3 dolomite has a stylolite, lower δ¹⁸O values, Sr²⁺ concentrations and ∑REE concentrations and slightly higher Mn²⁺ concentrations and Mg/Ca values, suggesting that Type 3 dolomite formed during shallow-moderate burial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDevonian period 3aSilurian period 3aaerobic conditions 3abasins 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3acrystals 3adolomite 3aevaporation 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3arare earth elements 3aseawater 3ashale 3astable isotopes 3astrontium 3atemperature 3aChina 0aRimmed carbonate platform 0aDolomitization 0aGeochemistry 0aDolomitizing fluids 0aSequence stratigraphy 0aDiagenetic environment1 aYao, Genshun1 aXiong, Shaoyun1 aWang, Jian1 aNi, Chao1 aShen, Anjiang1 aHao, Yi0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 495 p.113-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245006000167300001600227520176600243592002802009650002702037650001002064650001302074650002102087650001502108650001502123650001202138650001902150650002302169650001402192650001002206650001702216650000902233651001502242653001702257653002702274653002002301653001902321653002302340700002402363773010902387856007802496961001302574852000902587655001202596IND60524280320221119165800.0160705e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428032DNAL7 a10.3955/046.090.02132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLongland, William S.10aAre Western Juniper Seeds Dispersed Through Diplochory?  ap. 235-244.  aWestern juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) “berries ” are consumed by frugivorous birds, which then defecate and disperse the seeds. However, rodents also consume western juniper seeds, and seedlings can establish from rodent scatterhoards. To explore relative roles of potential seed dispersal agents, we experimentally quantified removal rates by birds and rodents of intact western juniper berries versus seeds cleaned either manually or by passage through bird guts at two northeastern California sites (Likely and Shinn Peak). We also conducted seedling emergence experiments with berries, hand-cleaned, and bird-passed seeds placed on the soil surface or buried at a depth typical of rodent caches. Birds removed juniper berries from plots and left seeds undisturbed at Likely, but bird activity was negligible at Shinn Peak. Rodent removal of seeds versus berries was similar at Likely, but at Shinn Peak rodents removed significantly more seeds. In the seedling emergence experiment, juniper seeds or berries on the surface failed to produce seedlings. When buried, however, emergence was significantly greater for bird-passed than for hand-cleaned seeds, which both produced significantly more seedlings than intact berries. Our results indicate that: (1) birds may enhance western juniper seed germinability through gut passage, (2) most rodent species do not harvest intact berries, (3) rodents harvest seeds defecated by birds and may therefore secondarily disperse bird-passed seeds, and (4) seeds must be removed from berries and buried to establish seedlings. Sequential dispersal, or diplochory, with primary dispersal by frugivorous birds and secondary dispersal by seed-caching rodents, is ideal for satisfying these respective requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus occidentalis 3abirds 3acleaning 3adigestive system 3afrugivores 3aharvesting 3arodents 3aseed dispersal 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asmall fruits 3asoil 3aCalifornia 0aEndozoochory 0aJuniperus occidentalis 0ascatterhoarding 0aseed dispersal 0aseedling emergence1 aDimitri, Lindsay A.0 tNorthwest science.g2016 May, v. 90, no. 2 p.235-244dWashington State University Pressx0029-344X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3955%2F046.090.02133Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010400169300001800273520164000291536020301931592002802134596001102162650001102173650001302184650001202197650001702209650001002226650001502236650001902251650001302270653001902283653001602302653002902318653002502347653001502372653001702387700001402404700001602418773011402434856008502548852000902633655001202642IND60744156920221118085104.0210709e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074415692DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2020.17421482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rongtang10aTechno-economic analysis of the lignite-fired power plant integrated with a steam or flue gas dryer  ap. 1271-1284.  aLignite is considered as an raw energy material with abundant supply worldwide. However, power plants that directly fire lignite exhibit low efficiency, which can be improved by applying lignite pre-drying technologies. Lignite-Fired power plants integrated with a steam or flue gas dryer (SPLPS or FPLPS) are designed and optimized. Previous studies mainly focused on the thermodynamic performance and techno-economic analyses of single drying technology. However, sensitivity analyses of parameters are disregarded in the techno-economic analysis. Therefore, system configurations are optimized in this study, and different drying technologies are subsequently compared on the basis of their techno-economic performance. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses of key parameters are investigated. Optimization results show that the steam extraction pressure of SPLPS should not be substantially low, and optimum extraction should be performed at steam turbine 4# regenerative extraction (0.9539 MPa, 360.9 °C) or 5# (0.3758 MPa, 249.6 °C). This approach differs from the thermodynamic performance presented in previous studies. Moreover, the detailed optimization strategy of SPLPS is realized on the basis of net present value (NPV) and payback period. The comparison results show that the maximum NPV of FPLPS would be 9.5 million USD more than the earnings from a conventional lignite-fired power system (CLPS), whereas that of SPLPS would be 40.1 million USD more than the earnings from CLPS. However, the economic benefits of FPLPS and SPLPS can be reversed with the fluctuation of parameters based on sensitivity analyses.  aThis work was supported by the Provincial Key Research & Development Program of Shaanxi, China (Grant Number 2018GY-093) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 51436006).  aPublisher supplied data  aGY-093 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3alignite 3apower plants 3asteam 3atechnology 3athermodynamics 3aturbines 0aLignite drying 0apower plant 0atechno-economic analysis 0asensitivity analysis 0acomparison 0aoptimization1 aLiu, Ming1 aYan, Junjie0 tDrying technology.g2021 July 12, v. 39, no. 10 p.1271-1284dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2020.17421483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012400164300001600288520173500304592002802039650001102067650002402078650002202102650002202124650001502146650002602161650001902187650001702206650000902223650002302232650001602255653002902271653001802300653002502318653001602343653001802359700001902377700001702396773012402413856008202537852000902619655001202628IND4476413820221118075520.0200513e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447641382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-011-0320-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJomura, Mayuko10aDifferences between coarse woody debris and leaf litter in the response of heterotrophic respiration to rainfall events  ap. 305-311.  aHeterotrophic respiration strongly influences carbon cycles at the ecosystem and global scales. We used an automated chamber system to measure the heterotrophic respiration of coarse woody debris (CWD) and leaf litter in a secondary broadleaved forest in southern Kyoto Prefecture. This system, which targeted only organic matter, could detect heterotrophic respiration responses to changes in environmental factors, especially rainfall events. The temporal trends and responses of respiration to environmental factors differed dramatically between CWD and leaf litter. CWD respiration showed a clear diurnal change corresponding to changes in CWD temperature and a clear decrease during rainfall events. Leaf litter respiration did not change clearly but increased at the beginning of rain events and returned to pre-rain rates when soil water content declined. The temporal patterns of the residuals between the observed respiration and baseline respiration, developed from the temperature–response curves under pre-rain conditions, differed between CWD and leaf litter respiration. The typical trend in CWD respiration response to rainfall events was a clear decrease and then gradual increase in the residuals after the event. The response of leaf litter respiration to wetting was an increase in the residuals during rainfall events and then a gradual decrease during drying. The difference in the responses of these respirations to wetting and drying processes are likely caused by differences in the physical characteristics of the CWD and the leaf litter layer. Measurements targeting only organic matter using an automated chamber system could detect the responses of heterotrophic respiration to environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoarse woody debris 3adeciduous forests 3adiurnal variation 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aorganic matter 3aplant litter 3arain 3asoil water content 3atemperature 0aAutomated chamber system 0aDecomposition 0aForest carbon budget 0aTemperature 0aWater content1 aKominami, Yuji1 aAtaka, Mioko0 tJournal of forest research.g2012 June 1, v. 17, no. 3 p.305-311dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-011-0320-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245015800167300002000325500001900345520168900364592002802053650001502081650000802096650001302104650001202117650001402129650001402143650002302157650001102180650001902191650001402210650001602224700002102240700005902261773017302320856008002493852000902573655001202582IND60704241120210421000000.0200722e20200623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070424112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c023312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbà, Carlos G.10aAssessment on Separating Hydrofluoroolefins from Hydrofluorocarbons at the Azeotropic Mixture R513A by Using Fluorinated Ionic Liquids: A Soft-SAFT Study  ap. 13315-13324.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, the commercial blend R513A (integrated by R134a and R1234yf) has been proposed to replace R134a in air conditioning applications, given the lower global warming potential of R513A versus R134a. However, little is known about the best approach to recover these compounds by adequately separating them after the end of life of the equipment. In this contribution, we present a computational study of the capability of three fluorinated ionic liquids (imidazolium-based ILs with the [BF₄]⁻, [PF₆]⁻, and [TF₂N]⁻ anions) to selectively separate R134a and R1234yf from the R513A mixture. A thermodynamic analysis of the absorption of these gases in the selected ionic liquids has been performed with the soft-SAFT molecular-based equation of state (EoS), with the model validated using available experimental data. Soft-SAFT has then been used to predict the Henry constant, the solvation enthalpy and entropy, and the ideal selectivity in order to assess the best solvent to carry out the separation. Results indicate that [C₆C₁im][PF₆] exhibits the highest ideal selectivity and the highest difference of molar enthalpy between both compounds. Hence, the ternary diagrams with this IL, R134a, and R1234yf are predicted, showing the competitive selectivity between both gases at the R513A mixture composition and evaluating the effect of pressure and temperature in the system. It has been observed that the competitive selectivity is similar to the ideal selectivity at the studied conditions. From the results obtained, it is recommended to work at low temperature and moderate pressure conditions to carry out this separation with [C₆C₁im][PF₆].  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aequations 3aequipment 3ahydrofluorocarbons 3amodels 3aprocess design 3asolvation 3atemperature1 aVega, Lourdes F.1 aLlovell, Fèlix1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7109-68100 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 June 23, v. 59, no. 29 p.13315-13324dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c023313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100005700190245014900247300001800396500001400414506007600428520151900504592002802023506003702051650000802088650001502096650002102111650000802132650001602140650001702156650001302173650001602186650001502202650001402217650002602231650001802257650002602275650001402301700005902315700005902374773011802433856008302551852000902634655001202643IND60675336120221207065858.0191105e20191020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067533612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b008062doi7 aPMC68387872pmcid7 a316316492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLietard, Jory1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4523-600110aLarge-Scale Photolithographic Synthesis of Chimeric DNA/RNA Hairpin Microarrays To Explore Sequence Specificity Landscapes of RNase HII Cleavage  ap. 4389-4397.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRibonuclease HII (RNase HII) is an essential endoribonuclease that binds to double-stranded DNA with RNA nucleotide incorporations and cleaves 5′ of the ribonucleotide at RNA–DNA junctions. Thought to be present in all domains of life, RNase HII protects genomic integrity by initiating excision repair pathways that protect the encoded information from rapid degradation. There is sparse evidence that the enzyme cleaves some substrates better than others, but a large-scale study is missing. Such large-scale studies can be carried out on microarrays, and we employ chemical photolithography to synthesize very large combinatorial libraries of fluorescently labeled DNA/RNA chimeric sequences that self-anneal to form hairpin structures that are substrates for Escherichia coli RNase HII. The relative activity is determined by the loss of fluorescence upon cleavage. Each substrate includes a double-stranded 5 bp variable region with one to five consecutive ribonucleotide substitutions. We also examined the effect of all possible single and double mismatches, for a total of >9500 unique structures. Differences in cleavage efficiency indicate some level of substrate preference, and we identified the 5′-dC/rC-rA-dX-3′ motif in well-cleaved substrates. The results significantly extend known patterns of RNase HII sequence specificity and serve as a template using large-scale photolithographic synthesis to comprehensively map landscapes of substrate specificity of nucleic acid-processing enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3adegradation 3afluorescence 3agenomics 3ainformation 3alandscapes 3alibraries 3amicroarray technology 3aribonucleases 3asubstrate specificity 3asynthesis1 aDamha, Masad J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4458-16231 aSomoza, Mark M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8039-13410 tBiochemistry.g2019 Oct. 20, v. 58, no. 44 p.4389-4397dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b008063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003300112245008100145300001600226520176500242592002802007650000802035650001302043650001502056650001802071650002002089650001002109650003302119650001102152650001402163650002002177650001902197650001302216650001102229650001402240650001702254653001102271653003202282653001502314653001402329653001602343653001102359700002302370773011402393852000902507655001202516IND60524280520221119171813.0160705e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardinal-McTeague, Warren M.10aMolecular Phylogeny and Pollen Evolution of Euphorbiaceae Tribe Plukenetieae  ap. 329-347.  aTribe Plukenetieae (Euphorbiaceae, Acalyphoideae) is a pantropical lineage of mostly stinging, twining vines and lianas with diverse floral and pollen morphology. To elucidate generic relationships in the tribe and examine patterns of pollen morphology evolution, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid psbA-trnH DNA sequence and indel gap-scored data. We sampled all genera in subtribes Dalechampiinae and Tragiinae, and most in Plukenetiinae; species sampling was broad in the latter two subtribes. Our efforts produced a 2,207 character dataset of 154 terminals (representing ca. 93 species). Analyses of these data support the monophyly of each subtribe and weakly suggest Dalechampiinae (Dalechampia) is sister to Plukenetiinae + Tragiinae. Within Plukenetiinae, Haematostemon is resolved as sister to Romanoa + Plukenetia, and Plukenetia is divided into five subclades that mostly correspond to the current infrageneric classification. Tragiinae is resolved into an Old World lineage and a mostly New World lineage, and is divided into ten subclades also supported by floral and/or pollen morphology. Species-rich Tragia is recovered as para- or polyphyletic and intermixed with all other currently recognized Tragiinae genera. The recently segregated genera, Bia, Ctenomeria, and Zuckertia, are upheld, and Gitara is resurrected from Acidoton, resulting in two new combinations: Gitara nicaraguensis and Zuckertia manuelii. Pollen aperture and exine morphology are largely correlated with phylogeny. The loss of pollen endopores is a potential synapomorphy of Plukenetiinae + Tragiinae, and we hypothesize that weakly defined apertures and inaperturate pollen originated independently four and three times, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFlueggea 3aPlukenetia 3adata analysis 3adata collection 3aexine 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alianas 3amonophyly 3anew combination 3aplant taxonomy 3aplastids 3apollen 3apolyphyly 3asynapomorphy 0aGitara 0ainternal transcribed spacer 0aPlukenetia 0apsbA-trnH 0asystematics 0aTragia1 aGillespie, Lynn J.0 tSystematic botany.g2016 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.329-347dAmerican Society of Plant Toxonomistsx0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245007300177300001400250520115300264592002801417650000801445650002601453650001001479650001101489650001301500650002001513650001601533650002201549651001901571651001201590651001201602651001601614651001801630651001101648653005401659653002101713653003801734700005701772700002501829700002101854773013101875856008402006852000902090655001202099IND60589474720221119053305.0180222e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058947472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHufthammer, Anne Karin10aGrey whale (Eschrichtius robustus) in Norwegian waters 2000years ago  ap. 42-47.  aThe modern distribution of the grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is restricted to the North Pacific Ocean, but during the Holocene it occurred also in the North Atlantic Ocean, perhaps as recently as the 17th century. In the western Atlantic, subfossil bones of 12 specimens of grey whale have previously been reported, whereas in the eastern Atlantic there are at least 25 subfossil remains of grey whale from the postglacial period, mostly from the Netherlands, along with one in Belgium, three in England and one in Sweden, ranging in age from approximately 10,000 to a few hundred years ago. Here we utilise a new method of identifying species from fragmentary bones, using collagen fingerprinting, to screen 373 cetacean remains from along the Norwegian coast, including the remains of at least one grey whale specimen dating to 1930–1750years ago, which was recovered from Kringlevågen in the municipality of Solund (61°, 01″ N, 4°73″E). This find, confirmed by ancient DNA analysis, is the most northerly record of this locally extinct species and increases our understanding of grey whale palaeobiogeography in the North Atlantic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEschrichtius robustus 3abones 3acoasts 3acollagen 3aextinct species 3amethodology 3apaleobiogeography 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBelgium 3aEngland 3aNetherlands 3aPacific Ocean 3aSweden 0aSpecies identification by collagen fingerprinting 0aAncient proteins 0aMarine mammal bone identification1 aArntsen, Lena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3519-84351 aKitchener, Andrew C.1 aBuckley, Michael0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 495 p.42-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245016100166300001800327520024300345592002800588650002600616650002100642650001700663650002000680700002000700700002400720700002000744700002100764700003400785700002200819700002100841773013300862856007400995852000901069655001201078IND60660981820221121190305.0190827e20150528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098182DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02991k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahapatra, Ajit Kumar12aA cyclization-induced emission enhancement (CIEE)-based ratiometric fluorogenic and chromogenic probe for the facile detection of a nerve agent simulant DCP  ap. 9729-9732.  aThe first ratiometric fluorescent probe for the detection of a nerve agent simulant was developed based on tandem phosphorylation and intramolecular cyclization, by which high sensitivity as well as large emission shift could be achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclization reactions 3afluorescent dyes 3anerve agents 3aphosphorylation1 aMaiti, Kalipada1 aManna, Saikat Kumar1 aMaji, Rajkishor1 aMondal, Sanchita1 aDas Mukhopadhyay, Chitrangada1 aSahoo, Prithidipa1 aMandal, Debasish0 tChemical communications.g2015 May 28, v. 51, no. 47 p.9729-9732dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc02991k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245011200178300001600290500001900306520145500325592002801780650001801808650001401826650001201840650001101852650002301863653002701886653002001913653003101933653002001964653002601984653002902010700001602039700002002055773012202075856008302197852000902280655001202289IND60720502020221119013032.0210219e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072050202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Toledano, J-C.10aTaking a closer look: A molecular-dynamics investigation of microscopic and apparent dynamic contact angles  ap. 311-323.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMolecular dynamics (MD) may be used to investigate the velocity dependence of both the microscopic and apparent dynamic contact angles (θm and θapp).We use large-scale MD to explore the steady displacement of a water-like liquid bridge between two molecularly-smooth solid plates under the influence of an external force F0. A coarse-grained model of water reduces the computational demand and the solid-liquid affinity is varied to adjust the equilibrium contact angle θ0. Protocols are devised to measure θm and θapp as a function of contact-line velocity Ucl.For all θ0, θm is velocity-dependent and consistent with the molecular-kinetic theory of dynamic wetting (MKT). However, θapp diverges from θm as F0 is increased, especially at the receding meniscus. The behavior of θapp follows that predicted by Voinov: (θₐₚₚ)³ = (θₘ)³ + 9Ca·ln(L/Lₘ), where Ca is the capillary number and L and Lm are suitably-chosen macroscopic and microscopic length scales. For each θ0, there is a critical velocity Ucrit and contact angle θcrit at which θapp→0 and the receding meniscus deposits a liquid film. Setting θapp=0, θm=θcrit and Ucl=Ucrit in the Voinov equation yields the value of L/Lm. The predicted values of θapp then agree well with those measured from the simulations. Since θm obeys the MKT, we have, therefore, demonstrated the utility of the combined model of dynamic wetting proposed by Petrov and Petrov.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3aequations 3aliquids 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 0aDynamic contact angles 0aViscous bending 0aDynamic wetting transition 0aFilm deposition 0aSolid-liquid affinity 0aMolecular-kinetic theory1 aBlake, T.D.1 aConinck, J. de,0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Apr., v. 587 p.311-323dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03702naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012800173300001300301520215100314592002802465650003102493650001902524650001302543650003002556650001102586650001102597650001902608650001202627650001102639650002202650650001202672650001502684650001102699650002102710650002002731650001602751650001702767650001402784651002802798653002502826653002002851653003002871653001102901653002802912700002102940773013002961856008403091852000903175655001203184IND60589474820221119053119.0180222e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058947482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrewicz, Amanda E.10aStable isotopes in large herbivore tooth enamel capture a mid-Miocene precipitation spike in the interior Pacific Northwest  ap. 1-12.  aStable carbon and oxygen isotopes of fossil ungulate tooth enamel were used to investigate the paleoclimate of the Pacific Northwest from the mid-Oligocene through Pleistocene, particularly targeting the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO). We specifically test whether precipitation, as inferred from tooth enamel δ¹³C values relative to the δ¹³C values of atmospheric CO2 (Δ¹³C), increased with increasing partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2). Analysis emphasized water-dependent equids, rhinos, and proboscideans, but several artiodactyls and Castor were also analyzed as available. Values of Δ¹³C>+19.5‰ in the lower John Day (~27 and ~18Ma) and Mascall (15–16Ma) localities imply relatively high mean annual precipitation (MAP=ca. 550–800mm/yr). Values of Δ¹³C<+18.5‰ at ~18Ma and at four levels between 15 and 3Ma imply low MAP (≤250mm/yr), similar to modern climate. High vs. low MAP generally correlates with high vs. low pCO2, implicating pCO2 as a probable driver of MAP in the Pacific Northwest. A climate oscillation model best explains data, such that warm-wet conditions during high pCO2 events alternated with cool-dry conditions during low pCO2 events on timescales of 100kyr. Because of poor time constraints associated with many of the specimens, changes in pCO2 are mainly inferred from marine isotopic data, rather than direct comparison between terrestrial pCO2 reconstructions and MAP. High δ¹⁸O values in specimens from the John Day (+21.8±1.0‰; VSMOW) and Mascall (+21.3±0.8‰) Formations could reflect lower elevations for the upwind Cascade Range prior to ~7Ma, or proximity to the coast compared to younger, more inland sites (δ¹⁸O=+17.7±0.9 to +19.6±1.1‰). Unusually high δ¹⁸O values of Dromomeryx sp. from Red Basin (+27.4±0.2‰) probably reflect drought tolerance. General circulation models commonly reproduce temperature but underestimate precipitation during the MMCO in the Pacific Northwest, suggesting that refinements are needed to predict more accurately how western North American precipitation will respond to increases in pCO2 during the next century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aRhinocerotidae 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adrought tolerance 3afossils 3aherbivores 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3atooth enamel 3aungulates 3aCascade Mountain region 0aPaleoclimate proxies 0aStable isotopes 0aMean annual precipitation 0aEquids 0aLarge herbivore mammals1 aKohn, Matthew J.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 495 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007600163300001400239520097900253592002801232650001201260650001001272650001901282650001901301650001901320650002001339650001601359653001201375653001901387653001201406653001001418653002901428700001901457700001601476700002001492773010001512856008301612852000901695655001201704IND60678191620221119145209.0200705e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067819162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zizhen10aBismuth chromate (Bi2CrO6): A promising semiconductor in photocatalysis  ap. 40-48.  aBismuth chromate, a semiconductor in the bismuth-based materials family, was successfully prepared in this work. This semiconductor exhibited high solar and visible-light responsivity, making it a promising candidate for photocatalysis under solar light. Compared to other two widely reported photocatalysts (i.e. Bi₂WO₆ and Bi₂MoO₆), Bi₂CrO₆ exhibited superiorities, including narrower band gap (2.00 eV), wider responsive wavelength range of the solar spectrum (up to 622 nm) and one-dimensional morphology. However, one of the most challenging problems for Bi₂CrO₆ applied in photocatalysis may be due to its high recombination of photogenerated charge carriers (lifetime of photoactivated charges: 0.660 ns). This should be further addressed in future work with advanced strategies. This work provides a method to experimentally prepare Bi₂CrO₆ and sheds a light on the significance of this ‘new’ bismuth-based semiconductor in photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asolar radiation 3awavelengths 0aBi2CrO6 0aPhotocatalysis 0aBismuth 0aSolar 0aVisible light-responsive1 aZhang, Zisheng1 aWang, Liang1 aMeng, Xiangchao0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Feb., v. 382 p.40-48dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012800187300001800315520077800333592002801111650003001139650002601169650001801195650001501213650001501228650001101243650001901254650000901273650001501282650001901297650001201316650001201328650007401340650006401414650001801478650002101496650003701517650007301554650003901627650001601666650003701682650001101719650005001730650001701780650001101797650001501808650004901823650000901872650002401881650001501905650003301920650002801953650002001981650003202001650003602033650003402069650003602103650006602139700001402205700001402219700001702233700001702250700001402267700001802281700001202299700001402311700001802325700001402343700001802357700001602375700001602391700001702407773010902424856008102533990002302614852000902637655001202646IND60090853220221119044527.0141102e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009085322DNAL7 a239936682pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guangcheng10aDesign, synthesis and biological evaluation of millepachine derivatives as a new class of tubulin polymerization inhibitors  ap. 6844-6854.  aA series of novel tubulin polymerization inhibitors (9a–9p) have been synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo biological activities. Among these compounds, 9e displayed strong antiproliferative activity against several tumor cell lines (IC₅₀=0.15–0.62μM). Compound 9e was also shown to arrest cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and inhibit the polymerization of tubulin. Molecular docking studies suggested that 9e binds into the colchicine binding site of tubulin. In xenograft experiments, 9e exerted more potent anticancer effect than anticancer drug taxol against the H460 Human lung carcinoma in BALB/c nude mice. In summary, these findings suggest that 9e is a promising new antimitotic compound for the potential treatment of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3abinding sites 3acell cycle 3acolchicine 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amice 3apaclitaxel 3apolymerization 3atubulin 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemical synthesisxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aBenzopyransxchemical synthesisxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChalconesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aColchicinexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDrug Design 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aFemale 2aG2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpointsxdrug effects 2aHep G2 Cells 2aHumans 2aK562 Cells 2aM Phase Cell Cycle Checkpointsxdrug effects 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Nude 2aMolecular Docking Simulation 2aNeoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTransplantation, Heterologous 2aTubulinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTubulin Modulatorsxchemical synthesisxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aPeng, Fei1 aCao, Dong1 aYang, Zhuang1 aHan, Xiaolei1 aLiu, Juan1 aWu, Wenshuang1 aHe, Lin1 aMa, Liang1 aChen, Jinying1 aSang, Yun1 aXiang, Mingli1 aPeng, Aihua1 aWei, Yuquan1 aChen, Lijuan0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 21, no. 21 p.6844-6854dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.02.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245012700137300001600264520081900280592002801099650001101127650001201138650001501150650001201165650001401177650001401191650001901205651001101224651001401235653001301249653001401262653001201276653001501288653001401303700001901317700001901336700001801355773011401373852000901487655001201496IND60524280820221119165519.0160711e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Christine E.10aPhylogenetic Relationships in Calyptranthes (Myrtaceae) with Particular Emphasis on Its Monophyly Relative to Myrcia s. l.  ap. 378-386.  aCalyptranthes is the largest clade of Myrcia s. l., and is a group of considerable diversity in the threatened Atlantic forest biome of Brazil, as well as in the Amazon, Caribbean, and Cerrado. Here an expanded, geographically and morphologically representative sample of Calyptranthes is tested for monophyly; the majority of species are shown to emerge as a monophyletic clade embedded within Myrcia s. l. A single species, Calyptranthes multiflora, emerges in an independent clade, suggesting wider non-monophyly. Patterns of relationships within the group are detected, and these correlate more closely with geography than with morphology, and suggest that the oldest lineages of Calyptranthes are from what is now the Amazon forest, with later radiations to the Caribbean, Atlantic forest, and Cerrado biomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyrcia 3acerrado 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ageography 3amonophyly 3aplant taxonomy 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 0aCalyptra 0aevolution 0aMyrteae 0aNeotropics 0aphylogeny1 aForest, Felix,1 aDevey, Dion S.1 aLucas, Eve J.0 tSystematic botany.g2016 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.378-386dAmerican Society of Plant Toxonomistsx0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245009300136300001600229520088600245592002801131650001001159650002001169650002001189650002001209650001001229650001301239650001001252653001601262653002001278653002001298653001501318700001901333773019801352852000901550655001201559IND60706287820221120150553.0201224e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070628782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBal, Sharanbir Kaur10aRole of Women as Decision Makers with Respect to Farm Operations in Malwa Belt of Punjab  ap. 425-429.  aSome historians believe that first crop plants were domesticated by woman and so the art and science of farming was started.

Therefore, the present study was undertaken with the objectives to examine the role of farm women as decision maker in farm related decisions and to find out the extent of involvement they may have in farm related decisions. The study was conducted in Bathinda district of Punjab state and 20 women from each of the four randomly selected villages were selected purposively, thus comprising a total sample of 80 women.

One likely consequence is a change in nutrient limitation—some nutrients become more abundant in the diet, others become more scarce. Individuals’ behavior should change accordingly to match this new limitation regime: they should seek out nutrients that are deficient in the new diet. We investigated the relationship between diet and responses to nutrients using adult Costa Rican butterflies with contrasting feeding habits, testing the hypothesis that animals will respond more positively to nutrients that are scarcer in their diets. Via literature searches and our own data, we showed that nitrogen and sodium are both at lower concentration in nectar than in fruit. We therefore assessed butterflies’ acceptance of sodium and four nitrogenous compounds that ranged in complexity from inorganic nitrogen (ammonium chloride) to protein (albumin). We captured wild butterflies, offered them aqueous solutions of each substance, and recorded whether they accepted (drank) or rejected each substance. Support for our hypothesis was mixed. Across the sexes, frugivores were four times more likely to accept amino acids (hydrolyzed casein) than nectivores, in opposition to expectation. In males, nectivores accepted sodium almost three times more frequently than frugivores, supporting expectations. Together, these results suggest that in butterflies, becoming frugivorous is associated with an increased receptivity to amino acids and decreased receptivity to sodium. Nectivory and frugivory are widespread feeding strategies in organisms as diverse as insects, birds, and bats; our results suggest that these feeding strategies may put different pressures on how animals fulfill their nutritional requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aalbumins 3aaqueous solutions 3anectar 3afeeding methods 3anitrogen 3afrugivores 3amales 3aChiroptera 3aamino acids 3acasein 3anutrient requirements 3asodium 3abutterflies 3ahydrolysis 3anutrients 3aammonium chloride 3aadults 0adiet1 aBoggs, Carol L.0 tOecologia.g2016 May, v. 181, no. 1 p.1-12dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3403-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012800171300001800299520158600317592002801903650002001931650001301951650001401964650001201978650001901990650001302009653002902022653001302051653001202064653002802076653002402104653002602128653000902154653000802163653000902171653000702180653001002187653000802197653000702205653000802212653002402220653000802244653000802252653001002260653001002270653000902280653000902289653000902298653001302307653000802320653000802328653000902336653000902345653001002354653000702364653000702371700002202378700001802400700001902418700001502437700002402452700002102476710003802497773009902535856008602634852000902720655001202729IND60635497920221118063657.0200217e20190627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063549792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStudholme, Lucy10aEvaluation of the monocyte activation test for the safety testing of meningococcal B vaccine Bexsero: A collaborative study  ap. 3761-3769.  aThe aim of this collaborative study was to evaluate the robustness of the monocyte activation test (MAT) for quantifying the pyrogenic content in the outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-containing vaccine Bexsero: the first meningococcal B vaccine to be licenced. We analysed datasets from 9 laboratories covering 15 test systems for 3 batches of Bexsero with higher, equivalent and lower activity relative to a reference lot in the MAT. Activity was measured in terms of relative pyrogen units (RPU) based on European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) MAT Chapter 2.6.30 Method C: Reference Lot Comparison Test. We report that all 15 test systems were consistent in that they showed sample A to be the most active in the MAT; that 13 of 15 test systems had an accuracy of more than 80% and an overall geometric mean RPU of 1.03 with lower and upper 95% confidence limits of 0.97 and 1.09 respectively for a sample with an expected value of 1.00 RPU. We also report larger variability in the results for test systems involving cells from individual blood donations for sample A suggesting that there could be donor to donor differences in sensitivity to the vaccine constituents responsible for the higher activity of this batch. Overall, the consistency and accuracy of the MAT was remarkable given the range of test systems used by participants, all of which are permitted by the Ph. Eur. General MAT Chapter. This is important given the limitations of the rabbit pyrogen test for the control of pyrogenicity in general and particularly with products with intrinsic pyrogenicity such as Bexsero.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageometry 3amonocytes 3arabbits 3asafety testing 3avaccines 0aMonocyte activation test 0aPyrogens 0aBexsero 0aOuter membrane vesicles 0aRabbit pyrogen test 0aMeningococcal vaccine 0aATCC 0aBET 0aDSMZ 0aEE 0aELISA 0aGCV 0aGM 0aGSK 0aIL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 0aMAT 0aMM6 0aNIBSC 0aOCABR 0aOMCL 0aOMVs 0aPBMC 0aPh.

A number of the synthesized compounds emerged as cytotoxic in cell-based assays (MT-4, HeLa and MCF-7 cells) at low micromolar concentrations. In a National Cancer Institute screening, selected member of the series showed a broad spectrum of antiproliferative activity against various tumours (melanoma, renal, CNS, colon and breast cancers). The acid–base and steric properties of the substituent at position 7 of the pyrimidopyrimidine scaffold deeply affected potency. Enzymatic assays evidenced that a subset of tested derivatives efficiently inhibit topoisomerase IIα accordingly to merbarone mechanism of action. However this property does not fully rationalize the cytotoxicity data of the full ligand panel, suggesting that different target(s) should be additionally involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3abreast neoplasms 3acolon 3acytotoxicity 3amechanism of action 3amelanoma 3ascreening 2aAntigens, Neoplasmxmetabolism 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aBridged Bicyclo Compoundsxchemistry. 2aCell Line 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDNA Topoisomerases, Type IIxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Screening Assays, Antitumor 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aMCF-7 Cells 2aPyrimidinesxchemical synthesisxtoxicity. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aThiobarbituratesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aThionesxchemical synthesisxtoxicity. 2aTopoisomerase II Inhibitorsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxtoxicity.1 aRotolo, Chiara1 aSissi, Claudia1 aMarson, Giuseppe1 aGreco, Maria Laura1 aRanise, Angelo1 aLa Colla, Paolo1 aBusonera, Bernardetta1 aLoddo, Roberta0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 21, no. 21 p.6328-6336dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.08.0563Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003700192245011400229300001300343506007600356520211700432592002802549506003702577650002602614650001302640650001202653650001102665650002502676650002802701650001102729650001702740650002602757650001302783650003902796650001302835650004702848650001402895650001402909653001402923653003102937700004502968773010703013856008503120852000903205655001203214IND60555200320221207084920.0161026e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055520032DNAL7 a10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60200-82doi7 aPMC38194882pmcid7 a241441232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Mohamed-Wael Abdelazeem10aMolecular analysis of Pasteurella multocida strains isolated from fowl cholera infection in backyard chickens  ap. 8-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo characterize Pasteurella isolated from backyard chickens using whole cell protein lysate profiles and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques to show their genetic relationship because Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) is an important cause of fatal infections in backyard chickens.Twenty one P. multocida isolates were recovered previously from clinical cases of fowl cholera belonging to individual owners and phenotypically analyzed using biochemical tests and serotyping were used for the genetic characterization.Phylogenetic study based on both methods revealed that the recovered population of P. multocida isolated from backyard chickens differs markedly, constituting a well-separated cluster and appearance of 3 distinguishing lineages with greater discrimination shown by RAPD-PCR that resulted in two suclusters in cluster A and three subclusters in cluster B and were related greatly with capsular serogroups for the examined strains. The whole cell protein revealed the presence of dominant protein bands at approximately 41 and 61 kDa in all of the examined isolates that may be a virulent proteins share in the increasing of its pathogenicity. Clear distinctive bands ranged from 123 to 1554 bp.Based on the previous findings, there are three spreading clusters that may indicate the association of a small number of P. multocida variants with the majority of cases suggesting that certain clones of P. multocida are able to colonize the examined backyard chickens. Also, the ease and rapidity of RAPD-PCR support the use of this technique as alternative to the more labour-intensive SDS-PAGE system for strain differentiation and epidemiological studies of avian P. multocida. Further application of RAPD technology to the examination of avian cholera outbreaks in commercially available flocks may facilitate more effective management of this disease by providing the potential to investigate correlations of P. multocida genotypes, to identify affiliations between bird types and bacterial genotypes, and to elucidate the role of specific bird species in disease transmission.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPasteurella multocida 3achickens 3acholera 3aclones 3adisease transmission 3aepidemiological studies 3aflocks 3afowl cholera 3agenetic relationships 3agenotype 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aserotypes 3avirulence 0aVariation 0aMolecular characterization1 aMageed, Moemen Abdel Azeem Mohamed Abdel0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Jan., v. 4 p.8-12dElsevier B.V.x2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60200-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245022500173300001600398520119900414592002801613650002601641650001101667650001501678650001001693650001701703650001701720650001501737650001401752650001501766650003001781650001601811651001201827651001701839700002301856700002101879700002101900773013301921856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60589475020221119053209.0180222e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058947502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilbert, Meagan M.10aPaleoecology and sedimentology of a vertebrate microfossil assemblage from the easternmost Dinosaur Park Formation (Late Cretaceous, Upper Campanian,) Saskatchewan, Canada: Reconstructing diversity in a coastal ecosystem  ap. 227-244.  aA ~42 m section of Late Cretaceous Upper Campanian sediments in Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park, southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada, represents the easternmost outcrop of the Dinosaur Park Formation in the Western Interior Basin. Herein we document a new microvertebrate locality from the upper part of this formation that shows high diversity in a mixed coastal and marine assemblage. Palynology, ichnology, sedimentology, and vertebrate palaeontology are integrated to determine paleoenvironmental and paleoecological conditions in the region. The site is interpreted as having been deposited under marginal-marine conditions near a shoreline undergoing transgression by the encroaching Bearpaw Sea. Though well studied and sampled in Alberta, the Dinosaur Park Formation is poorly exposed with little known associated vertebrate assemblages in Saskatchewan. These discoveries from the new microvertebrate site offer new insights into Late Cretaceous ecosystems near paleocoastlines, allowing for future studies of spatial diversity patterns relative to Albertan faunas. Herein is also presented the first published occurrences of several Late Campanian vertebrate taxa in Saskatchewan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3abasins 3aecosystems 3afauna 3amicrofossils 3apaleoecology 3apalynology 3asediments 3ashorelines 3atransgressive segregation 3avertebrates 3aAlberta 3aSaskatchewan1 aBamforth, Emily L.1 aBuatois, Luis A.1 aRenaut, Robin W.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 495 p.227-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008100174300001400255520104900269592002801318650002001346650002301366650001001389650000901399650001101408650001701419650002101436650001101457650001201468650001301480650001401493650000901507650001601516651002801532651001201560651001101572700002401583700002301607700002101630700001901651700001901670700001401689700002701703700002901730773010601759856005401865852000901919655001201928IND50060206620221118075913.0130318e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006020662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalassi, Silvana10app′DDE contamination of the blood and diet in central European populations  ap. 45-52.  aIn this study, the actual risk of DDT pollution to two European human populations was assessed by analysing DDT residues in the diet, which is the main route of pollution for man, and in the blood and placenta, which are components affecting organs and new generations, respectively. The Gdańsk region was selected as representative of areas subjected to a recent DDT ban in Europe, while a rural area in Western Germany was considered representative of European regions where DDT use and production ceased many years ago. The results of three food series of food sampling carried out with market basket methods during 2003 showed that pp′DDE, which is by far the main constituent of DDT residues, was present in foods of animal origin and in cereals at rather high concentrations in both countries, and that a risk for human health cannot be excluded. The total daily intake was higher in Poland than in Germany, and agrees with the finding that body tissues, on the average, are more polluted in donors from Poland than those from Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aanimal-based foods 3ablood 3adiet 3agrains 3ahuman health 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3amarkets 3aplacenta 3apollution 3arisk 3arural areas 3aGerman Federal Republic 3aGermany 3aPoland1 aBettinetti, Roberta1 aNeri, Maria Chiara1 aFalandysz, Jerzy1 aKotecka, Wanda1 aKing, Isabella1 aLo, Susan1 aKlingmueller, Dietrich1 aSchulte-Oehlmann, Ulrike0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 390, no. 1 p.45-52dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.09.029  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007600166300001800242500001100260520134400271592002801615650001401643650001801657650001401675650001401689650001301703650001201716650001101728650002301739650001501762650001601777650002801793650001901821650001301840650001301853650002101866650002001887650001401907650001901921700002401940700002401964773014401988852000902132856008202141655001202223IND4418696320221118035530.0200207e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441869632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-009-1905-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Ana,10aMicrobial and enzymatic control of pitch in the pulp and paper industry  ap. 1005-1018.  aReview  aPitch control is an important aspect in pulp and paper manufacture, and the first example where microbial biotechnology provided successful solutions in this industrial sector. Triglycerides cause deposits in softwood mechanical pulping, and both microbial and enzymatic products have been commercialized to be applied on wood and pulp, respectively. The former are based on colorless strains of sapstain fungi. The latter are improved lipases, including thermostable variants from directed evolution. These enzymes are among the additives of choice in pulping of high-resin-content softwoods. However, lipases are not useful when pitch originates from other lipids, such as steroids and terpenes, and the sapstain inocula are also only partially effective. In the search for stronger biocatalysts to degrade recalcitrant lipids, the potential of white-rot fungi and their enzymes has been demonstrated. When inocula of these fungi are used, wood treatment must be controlled to avoid cellulose degradation. However, the efficiency and selectivity of the laccase-mediator system permits its integration as an additional bleaching stage. A double benefit can be obtained from these treatments since pitch is controlled at the same time that residual lignin is removed facilitating the implementation of totally chlorine free pulp bleaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abiotechnology 3ableaching 3acellulose 3achlorine 3aenzymes 3alignin 3amechanical pulping 3apaper pulp 3apapermaking 3apulp and paper industry 3asapstain fungi 3asoftwood 3asteroids 3atriacylglycerols 3awhite-rot fungi 3awood pulp 3awood treatment1 aRío, José C. del,1 aMartinez, Angel T.,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2009 Apr., v. 82, no. 6 p.1005-1018dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-1905-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03528naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245020000161520182300361592002802184650001602212650001502228650001202243650001802255650002002273650001702293650001602310650001902326650002602345650003302371650001202404650001602416650001402432650000702446650001302453650001802466650001102484650001302495650003102508653003902539653002202578653003402600653002502634700001302659700001602672700001802688700001602706700005602722773011402778856008502892852000902977655001202986IND60678191920221119145012.0200419e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067819192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4607302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ke10aIn situ formation of thymol-based hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents: Application to antibiotics analysis in surface water based on liquid-liquid microextraction followed by liquid chromatography  aA simple and ecofriendly sample preparation method was developed for quantifying fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics in surface water. Seventeen combinations of monoterpenes (menthol, thymol, and camphor), fatty acids (heptanoic, octanoic, nonanoic, and decanoic acids), and a benzoate ester (salol) were utilized for the in situ formation of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (hDESs) for liquid-liquid microextraction (LLME). The hDES comprising thymol and heptanoic acid (HA) exhibited the highest extraction efficiency for ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin. Optimization via the one-variable-at-a-time strategy revealed that a 2:1 ratio of thymol to HA yielded the highest efficiency for antibiotic extraction at pH 4−7. Further, response surface methodology-based optimization suggested that the optimal extraction conditions involved the use of appropriate amounts of thymol and HA to generate 100 μL of hDES in 10 mL of aqueous sample with incubation at 52 °C for 5 min, followed by automated shaking for 1 min. The collected hDES phase was diluted and subjected to liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection analysis. The established method based on in situ formation of hDES coupled with shaker-assisted LLME (in situ hDES-SA-LLME) was validated. The method was specific and showed good linearity in the 15-3000 ng mL⁻¹ concentration range (r² ≥ 0.9997), with a limit of detection of 3.0 ng mL⁻¹, limit of quantification of 9.0 ng mL⁻¹, accuracy of 84.1–113.65%, and intra-day and inter-day precision of ≤7.78% RSD and ≤7.91% RSD, respectively. The method was successfully applied to three different types of real surface water samples. Without toxic volatile organic solvents, the developed method allows for safe and rapid, yet reliable, analysis of FQ antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aautomation 3acamphor 3aciprofloxacin 3adetection limit 3aenrofloxacin 3afatty acids 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amenthol 3anorfloxacin 3aofloxacin 3apH 3asolvents 3asurface water 3athymol 3atoxicity 3avolatile organic compounds 0aHydrophobic deep eutectic solvents 0aIn situ formation 0aLiquid-liquid microextraction 0aSurface water sample1 aJin, Yan1 aJung, Dasom1 aPark, Keunbae1 aKim, Hireem1 aLee, Jeongmi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9948-75540 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 1614 p.460730-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4607303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04104naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003400192245008300226300001400309506007600323520189400399592002802293506003702321650003402358650002002392650001602412650001402428650002102442650002902463650002502492650001802517650001302535650001602548650002502564650003602589650001502625650001002640650001202650650001502662650002802677650003202705650001402737650001102751650001902762650002002781650002402801650001002825650001302835650001402848650001302862650001202875650002502887650002102912653001602933653001802949653001402967653000902981653002802990700002203018700003603040700002503076700003403101700002103135773010803156856008503264852000903349655001203358IND60555200520221207084925.0161026e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055520052DNAL7 a10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60202-12doi7 aPMC38194902pmcid7 a241441252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMomin, Mohammad Abdul Motalib10aPhytopharmacological evaluation of ethanol extract of Sida cordifolia L. roots  ap. 18-24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate the phytochemical screening (group determination) and selected pharmacological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial and analgesic activity) of the plant Sida cordifolia Linn (S. cordifolia).Eighty percent concentrated ethanol extract of the roots was used. To identify the chemical constituents of plant extract standard procedures were followed. In phytochemical screening the crude extract was tested for the presence of different chemical groups like reducing sugar, tannins, saponins, steroids, flavonoids, gums, alkaloids and glycosides. The antioxidant property of ethanolic extract of S. cordifolia was assessed by DPPH free radical scavenging activity. Analgesic activity of the extract was tested using the model of acetic acid induced writhing in mice. Diclofenac sodium is used as reference standard drug for the analgesic activity test. Antibacterial activity of plant extract was carried out using disc diffusion method with five pathogenic bacteria comparison with kanamycin as a standard.Phytochemical analysis of the ethanolic extract of the roots of S. cordifolia indicated the presence of reducing sugar, alkaloids, steroids and saponins. In DPPH scavenging assay the IC50 value was found to be 50 μg/mL which was not comparable to the standard ascorbic acid. The crude extract produced 44.30% inhibition of writhing at the dose of 500 mg/kg body weight which is statistically significant (P>0.001). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract of the roots of S. cordifolia showed no antimicrobial activity against five types of microorganisms. The experiment was conducted only with five species of bacteria as test species, which do not at all indicate the total inactivity against micro-organisms.The obtained results provide a support for the use of this plant in traditional medicine but further pharmacological studies are required.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSida cordifolia 3aacetic acid 3aalkaloids 3aanalgesic effect 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abacteria 3abody weight 3achemical composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akanamycin 3amodels 3aplant extracts 3areducing sugars 3areference standards 3aroots 3asaponins 3ascreening 3asteroids 3atannins 3atraditional medicine 3avirulent strains 0aAntioxidant 0aAntimicrobial 0aAnalgesic 0aDPPH 0aPhytochemical screening1 aBellah, Sm Faysal1 aRahman, Sarder Mohammad Raussel1 aRahman, Ahmed Ayedur1 aMurshid, Gazi Mohammad Monjur1 aEmran, Talha Bin0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Jan., v. 4 p.18-24dElsevier B.V.x2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2221-1691(14)60202-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245008100135300001600216520128500232592002801517650000801545650001301553650001101566650001201577650001101589650001401600650001601614650001901630651001701649651001001666651000901676653002201685653001901707653001601726653001601742653001401758700001801772700002801790700002201818773011401840852000901954655001201963IND60524281220221119165658.0160705e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052428122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaldivia, Patricio10aDomeykoa andina (Apiaceae; Azorelloideae), a New Species from Northern Chile  ap. 457-463.  aThis study reports a new species of Domeykoa (Apiaceae; Azorelloideae) from the Andes of northern Chile. A detailed description and an illustration of the species are provided. Diagnostic morphological characters that distinguish it from similar species are its erect habit, fewer flowers per umbel, and opposite leaves. The new species is an erect annual or short-lived perennial herb, it is glabrous, up to 25 cm high, and is profusely branched close to the base. Its umbels are simple, sessile, or sub-sessile with three or four yellow flowers. DNA was obtained for molecular phylogenetic analyses. Bayesian analyses showed that the new species, D. andina, is nested within the previously recognized Clade Eremocharis-Domeykoa, as sister to D. amplexicaulis from the southern coast of Peru. This study confirms previous findings that neither of the two genera in the clade are monophyletic, raising questions about the nomenclature. The phylogeny also suggests an interesting Peru-Chile latitudinal disjunction of more than 500 km, also seen in other recently described species. However, a more complete phylogeny is needed to make conclusions on this matter. Based on IUCN criteria and categories, we suggest assigning a critically endangered (CR) category to Domeykoa andina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDomeykoa 3acoasts 3aflowers 3aleaves 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aplant taxonomy 3aAndes region 3aChile 3aPeru 0aAsteriscium clade 0aAtacama Desert 0adisjunction 0aEremocharis 0aphylogeny1 aFaundez, Luis1 aUrbina-Casanova, Rafael1 aScherson, Rosa A.0 tSystematic botany.g2016 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.457-463dAmerican Society of Plant Toxonomistsx0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009900168300001600267500001500283520165700298592002801955650003001983650001102013650001102024650001202035650001102047650001002058650001602068650000902084650001502093650001202108650002002120650001602140650001702156650000902173650001202182650001602194653001002210700002102220700001902241700002402260700002302284773012802307856008202435852000902517655001202526IND60516396220221121045411.0190727e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639622DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797120010812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARKS, SOPHIE E.10aPropagation and production of gac (momordica cochinchinensis spreng.), a greenhouse case study  ap. 234-243.  a2019-12-06  aGreater cultivation of the underutilised Gac fruit, Momordica cochinchinensis, by poorly resourced householders and farmers would potentially improve livelihoods, and, on a larger scale, meet the increasing demand for Gac as a health product. Cultivation methods need to be developed to suit small- and large-scale production and must consider the unpredictable ratio of male to female plants grown from seed, and slow growth induced by cool temperatures. In this study, we examined the responses of Gac to propagation and protected cropping techniques to identify potential methods for increasing production. Plants germinated from seed in seed-raising mix under warm and humid conditions were grown hydroponically to maturity in a climate-controlled greenhouse during a temperate winter, producing fruits that were harvested ripe, from 44 weeks after sowing. Cuttings taken from female plants were dipped in indole-3-butyric rooting hormone powder or gel, or were left untreated, and then placed in rock wool, potting mix, water or closed media sachet. All treatment combinations, with the exception of the untreated potting mix, permitted the development of healthy plants in a second greenhouse crop. Growing plants from seed, then vegetatively increasing the number of productive female plants by cuttings is a means to increase Gac production with limited resources. Gac production using greenhouse technology, as described here for the first time, is relevant to other temperate regions. The finding that larger fruits have a higher percentage of edible aril than smaller fruits provides a new area of investigation towards enhancing production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica cochinchinensis 3afruits 3awinter 3afarmers 3asowing 3amales 3ahydroponics 3agels 3alivelihood 3arooting 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3acase studies 3aaril 3afemales 3agreenhouses 0aseeds1 aMURRAY, CARLY T.1 aGALE, DAVID L.1 aAL-KHAWALDEH, BASEM1 aSPOHR, LORRAINE J.0 tExperimental agriculture.g2013 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.234-243dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797120010813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008400175300001600259500001900275520140600294592002801700650002501728650001201753650002101765650001401786650001701800650001801817650001301835650001601848650001701864650002201881650001901903653002001922653001801942653003501960653002901995653002902024653002302053700002602076700001702102700001702119700002402136700003202160773012202192856008302314852000902397655001202406IND60720502620221119012942.0210219e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072050262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Nguyet-Minh Nguyen10aPolyphosphate coatings: A promising strategy to overcome the polycation dilemma  ap. 279-289.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt was the aim of this study to develop a zeta potential changing drug delivery system by decorating lipid-based nanocarriers with a polycationic cell penetrating peptide (CPP) and subsequently masking these cationic substructures with polyphosphates.In order to anchor the CPP poly-l-lysine (PLL) on the surface of the oily droplets of an o/w nanoemulsion, stearic acid was covalently attached to the peptide. The resulting CPP-decorated oily droplets were coated with phytic acid and tripolyphosphate. The elimination of these polyphosphates due to cleavage by alkaline phosphatase was monitored by the release of monophosphate from the surface of the nanocarriers, by the change in zeta potential and by cellular uptake studies on Caco-2 cells.Polyphosphate coated PLL-decorated nanocarriers exhibited a pronounced conversion of zeta potential from −14.1 mV to +4.2 mV in case of tripolyphosphate coated nanocarriers and from −9.9 mV to −2.6 mV in case of phytic acid coated nanocarriers. The cellular uptake on Caco-2 cells of the polyphosphate coated nanocarriers was 4-fold improved compared to the control nanocarriers. Furthermore, confocal images showed that the majority of nanodroplets distributed in cytoplasm not being internalized into lysosomes.Polyphosphate coating of CPP-decorated nanocarriers seems to be a promising and simple strategy to overcome the polycation dilemma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acations 3achemical bonding 3acytoplasm 3ananocarriers 3ananoemulsions 3apeptides 3aphytic acid 3astearic acid 3atripolyphosphates 3azeta potential 0aAnionic coating 0aPolyphosphate 0aZeta potential changing system 0aCell penetrating peptide 0aLipid-based nanocarriers 0aPolycation dilemma1 aSteinbring, Christian1 aLe-Vinh, Bao1 aJalil, Aamir1 aMatuszczak, Barbara1 aBernkop-Schnürch, Andreas,0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Apr., v. 587 p.279-289dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245010000191300001600291520195600307592002802263650002902291650001202320650001302332650001902345650002402364650001402388650001402402650001002416650004102426650001202467650003102479650000902510650002202519650001902541650002702560650004002587650005602627650004902683650001702732650004102749700001702790700001802807700001802825700002502843700001902868773010002887856008402987852000903071655001203080IND4460474520221118075900.0141111e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446047452DNAL7 a217777312pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrullage, Joseph B.14aThe combined mode of action of fipronil and amitraz on the motility of Rhipicephalus sanguineus  ap. 302-310.  aThe motility of adult Rhipicephalus sanguineus was evaluated subsequent to treatments of amitraz, fipronil and the combination of fipronil plus amitraz against a vehicle control in a Petri dish assay using the LemnaTec Scanalyzer Imaging System. The assay was run using a fixed dilution of amitraz (0.32μg/cm²); serial dilutions of fipronil (1.3, 0.33, 0.08, 0.02, or 0.005μg/cm²); and the same serial dilutions of fipronil in combination with the fixed dilution of amitraz. Measurement of motility was made of unstimulated ticks and then after stimulation at 1, 4, 18–22, and 24h post exposure (hpe) of the Petri dishes. For the unstimulated ticks, there was no difference in motility between the amitraz treatment group and the fipronil plus amitraz treatment group at the early time points. However, these two treatment groups had significantly higher motility than the solvent control and fipronil treatment groups. The unstimulated ticks in the amitraz treatment group had significantly higher motility than the fipronil plus amitraz treatment group at the later time points. Measurements after stimulation demonstrated there was no difference in motility between the amitraz treatment group and the fipronil plus amitraz treatment group at the early time points. By 18hpe, the fipronil plus amitraz treatment group had significantly lower motility than all other treatment groups and at 21–22 and 24hpe the other treatment groups did not differ from the control group. The action could be divided in two phases in the combination experiment: phase 1: an early increase in motility due to amitraz is identified in both amitraz alone or fipronil plus amitraz groups; phase 2: the combination of fipronil plus amitraz caused a significantly greater reduction in motility, suggesting mortality of the ticks, compared to fipronil or amitraz alone. These results demonstrate a synergism resulting from the combination of fipronil plus amitraz.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aamitraz 3afipronil 3aimage analysis 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3asynergism 3aticks 2aAcaricidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxparasitology 2aDogs 2aDrug Combinations 2aDrug Synergism 2aMovementxdrug effects 2aPyrazolesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aRhipicephalus sanguineusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTick Infestationsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 2aToluidinesxchemistryxpharmacology.1 aTran, Hai V.1 aTimmons, Phil1 aHarriman, Jay1 aChester, S.

Here we show that complex hybridization has led to contrasting patterns of genomic composition among closely related species of the Neotropical cat genus Leopardus. We show strong evidence of ancient hybridization and introgression between the pampas cat (L. colocolo) and northeastern populations of tigrina (L. tigrinus), leading to remarkable cytonuclear discordance in the latter. In contrast, southern tigrina populations show recent and continuing hybridization with Geoffroy’s cat (L. geoffroyi), leading to extreme levels of interspecific admixture at their contact zone. Finally, we demonstrate that two seemingly continuous Brazilian tigrina populations show no evidence of ongoing gene flow between them, leading us to support their formal recognition as distinct species, namely L. tigrinus in the northeast and L. guttulus in the south.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeopardus 3aanimals 3agene flow 3aintrogression 3atropics 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxchemistry 2aFelidaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Speciation 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 0aSouth America1 aSchneider, Alexsandra1 ade Oliveira, Tadeu G.1 aLehugeur, Livia M.1 aSilveira, Leandro1 aFreitas, Thales R.O.1 aEizirik, Eduardo0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Dec. 16, v. 23, no. 24 p.2528-2533dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.10.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245007400212300001800286520088200304592002801186650001101214650001401225650003701239650001701276650002901293650001901322650001801341650003601359650008001395650007001475650001101545650003301556650002001589650003201609650007401641650003601715650004501751650001901796700002301815700001801838700001801856700001901874700002201893700002201915773011001937856008102047990002302128852000902151655001202160IND60090853620221119044706.0141102e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009085362DNAL7 a241132392pmid7 aPMC38988302pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickens, Michael P.10a5-Deazaflavin derivatives as inhibitors of p53 ubiquitination by HDM2  ap. 6868-6877.  aBased on previous reports of certain 5-deazaflavin derivatives being capable of activating the tumour suppressor p53 in cancer cells through inhibition of the p53-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase HDM2, we have conducted an structure–activity relationship (SAR) analysis through systematic modification of the 5-deazaflavin template. This analysis shows that HDM2-inhibitory activity depends on a combination of factors. The most active compounds (e.g., 15) contain a trifluoromethyl or chloro substituent at the deazaflavin C9 position and this activity depends to a large extent on the presence of at least one additional halogen or methyl substituent of the phenyl group at N10. Our SAR results, in combination with the HDM2 RING domain receptor recognition model we present, form the basis for the design of drug-like and potent activators of p53 for potential cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3astructure-activity relationships 3atherapeutics 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 2aBinding Sites 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFlavinsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Docking Simulation 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2xantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTumor Suppressor Protein p53xmetabolism 2aUbiquitination1 aRoxburgh, Patricia1 aHock, Andreas1 aMezna, Mokdad1 aKellam, Barrie1 aVousden, Karen H.1 aFischer, Peter M.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 21, no. 22 p.6868-6877dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.09.0383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01679naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008100158300002000239520052100259592002800780650001400808650002300822650002200845650001300867650002400880650002800904650001400932650001700946700001500963700002000978700002100998700001701019700001901036700001901055773013601074856007401210852000901284655001201293IND60660982520221121084610.0190827e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066098252DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03006d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoltau, S.

Also, the identification of major QTLs by high linkage disequilibrium is highly useful for breeders in order for crop improvement programs and the further fine mapping of particular genes. Consequently, simultaneous consideration of segregation distortion and linkage disequilibrium leads to developing fertile hybrids and normal inheritance of agronomically favorable genes. Hence, the goal of this study was to investigate genomic regions known to contain fragrance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in terms of segregation distortion and linkage disequilibrium pattern, and to seek for a possible relationship between them using codominant markers on chromosomes 3, 4, and 8 in a set containing 189 F₂ progenies. For the first time, we discovered the presence and extent of segregation distortion and linkage disequilibrium across the fragrance chromosomal areas of rice. The high frequency of skewed allelic segregations in the chromosomes 3 and 4 supports reports of possible gametic selection (ga) and hybrid sterility (S) genes. Finally, the highest linkage disequilibrium values, the lowest recombination frequency, and the shortest distances were observed in the chromosomal regions without segregation distortion. High linkage disequilibrium correlations between markers at short distances may show that such markers can maintain high linkage disequilibrium with linked QTLs and are influential for both MAS and QTL mapping analysis. Moreover, an indirect relationship between segregation distortion and linkage disequilibrium was detected, and thus linkage disequilibrium maps were introduced as useful diagnostic tools for segregation distortion.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosomes 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aodors 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asegregation distortion1 aRafii, Mohd Y.1 aMohd.

The 24 and 96‐h median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) values of ABI were determined as 75.9 and 42.2 mg/L active ingredient (AI)/L, respectively. In addition, the activity of five biochemical marker enzymes, including glutathione S‐transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), carboxylesterase (CaE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was measured after 24 and 96‐h exposure to three different concentrations of the ABI to evaluate its sublethal effects. The acetamiprid concentrations in the exposure media were measured using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. Our results showed that GST and LDH activities were increased and there were concentration‐dependent changes in the integrated biomarker response (IBR) indexes after 24‐h ABI exposure. However, the examined biomarkers were not useful for examining the effects of the ABI exposure for 96‐h exposure periods, even at the highest concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia holbrooki 3aacetamiprid 3aactive ingredients 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiomarkers 3acarboxylesterase 3aenvironment 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alethal concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3anontarget organisms 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awater1 aGüngördü, Abbas0 tWater and environment journal.g2020 Dec., v. 34 Suppl S1 p.481-489dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.125493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245013500168300001800303520155700321592002801878650002201906650001501928650003001943650001401973650001401987650002302001650001902024650002502043650001302068650001102081650001902092650001402111650003202125650002102157650001702178700001702195700001802212700001402230700001402244700001702258700001802275700001702293700001602310700001402326700001602340700001502356700001702371700001602388700001502404700001502419700001702434773008702451856009002538852000902628655001202637IND60090515420221120205926.0141102e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009051542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Bo10aPotent killing of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma by a chimeric protein of anti-HBsAg single-chain antibody and truncated Bid  ap. 4880-4889.  aTargeted therapy is needed for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which shows overexpression of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). We previously developed scFv15, a human single-chain antibody against HBsAg. Here we tested the strategic feasibility of scFv15-mediated delivery of apoptotic effectors for HBsAg-targeted HCC therapy and application of HA2 motif of influenza hemagglutinin to enhance endosome escape and antitumor effect. A class of HBsAg-targeted immunoproapoptotic molecule was generated by sequentially fusing scFv15, the furin-cleavable motif from diphtheria toxin (Fdt), HA2 and a truncated apoptotic protein Bid (tBid). The resulting scFv15-Fdt-HA2-tBid was prokaryotically expressed and functionally characterized for HBsAg-binding capacity, endosome escape activity and antitumor effect as compared with scFv15-Fdt-tBid. Both scFv15-Fdt-HA2-tBid and scFv15-Fdt-tBid retained affinity and specificity for HBsAg, and bound and selectively killed HBsAg-positive HCC cells via apoptosis. Notably, the IC₅₀ of scFv15-Fdt-HA2-tBid in HBsAg-positive PLC/PRF/5 cells was 10 times lower than that of scFv15-Fdt-tBid. In vivo imaging of antitumor activity demonstrated 95% growth inhibition of orthotopic HCC by scFv15-Fdt-HA2-tBid compared with 75% suppression by scFv15-Fdt-tBid. This study represents an extended application of the immunoproapoptotic strategy in the treatment of HBsAg-positive HCC and shows significant potential of HA2 as a functional enhancer for endosome-encapsulated antibody-conjugates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aantibodies 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aapoptosis 3achimerism 3agrowth retardation 3ahemagglutinins 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ainfluenza 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3asurface antigens 3atherapeutics1 aOuyang, Qing1 aZhao, Zhining1 aCao, Feng1 aWang, Tao1 aJia, Xiaofei1 aMeng, Yanling1 aJiang, Shuai1 aLiu, Jiayun1 aChen, Rui1 aJia, Lintao1 aZhang, Rui1 aWen, Weihong1 aJin, Boquan1 aChen, Siyi1 aZhao, Jing1 aYang, Angang0 tBiomaterials.g2013 July, v. 34, no. 20 p.4880-4889dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008400172300001600256520177300272592002802045650002302073650002002096650001702116650001102133650002002144650001502164650002602179650001202205650001102217650001502228650001502243650001502258650000902273650001602282650001602298651002302314653004002337653000802377653002102385653001102406653003102417700001902448700002202467700002202489700001802511700001702529773023502546856008402781852000902865655001202874IND60543645820221119183528.0190411e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054364582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2015.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriguchi, Sachiko10aEstimating colonization and invasion risk maps for Linepithema humile, in Japan  ap. 343-350.  aOur goal was to create colonization and invasion risk maps for the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, based on occurrence data in Japan, by combining colonization- and invasion-related variables and spatial filters that alleviate spatial autocorrelation. With these data, we will be better able to implement surveillance and control programs. Species distribution models were generated, using the maximum entropy approach, from presence-only data collected from 12 locations. Colonization-related variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and invasion-related variables (e.g., urban area, distance from ports) were used as environmental variables and spatial filters that alleviate spatial autocorrelation were included at the same time. The high invasion risk area was restricted to coastal areas, whereas high colonization risk applied to a broader area. Elevation, minimum temperature, and flow accumulation were the most effective variables for predicting colonization risk, whereas urban area, elevation, and the port distance index were the most effective variables for predicting invasion risk. The invasion risk map had a higher level of accuracy than the colonization risk map. We identified those areas with a high risk of invasion in the early stages and strong propagule pressure with a model using both invasion-related variables and colonization-related variables to accurately estimate the initial invasion distributions. We found that high colonization risk areas were concentrated in the Okinawa and Ogasawara Islands; ecosystems with highly endemic ant species that are likely to have a high sensitivity to L. humile introduction. Our data will aid in strengthening both domestic and international quarantine systems to prevent such introductions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinepithema humile 3aautocorrelation 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aislands 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aquarantine 3arisk 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3aRyukyu Archipelago 0aEigenvector-based spatial filtering 0aGIS 0aInvasive species 0aMAXENT 0aSpecies distribution model1 aInoue, Maki N.1 aKishimoto, Toshio1 aKameyama, Takeshi1 aIto, Fuminori1 aGoka, Koichi0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2015 June, v. 18, no. 2 p.343-350dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245006400206500001900270520141600289592002801705650002501733650001701758650000901775650002201784650001201806650001901818650001901837650001901856650001501875650001901890650001301909650002301922650002001945653003001965653001401995653001302009653001902022700001702041700001502058700001702073700002102090700001902111773011202130856008502242852000902327655001202336IND60735723820221118180625.0210527e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073572382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1193542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiangyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9794-528610aMetal-organic polyhedron membranes for molecular separation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPore constructing in polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes through the mixed matrix strategy is of great interest to the production of nanofiltration membranes with high liquid permeance, however still facing challenges in fine control of filler distribution and filler-polymer interfacial microstructure. Herein, ZrT-1-NH₂, one kind of water stable metal-organic polyhedron (MOP) molecular cages with intrinsic porosity, was exploited to construct porous MOP membranes through interfacial polymerization assembly for the first time. Continuous and defect-free separating layer can be facilely assembled on polymer ultrafiltration support by crosslinking ZrT-1-NH₂ with trimesoyl chloride (TMC). The permanent pores inherited from ZrT-1-NH₂ and the network pores originated from the mismatch in molecular volume of ZrT-1-NH₂ and TMC offer the MOP membrane great water permeance (82.0 L·m⁻²·h⁻¹·bar⁻¹), as well as attractive dye rejection (99.7% for congo red) and dye/salt separation performance. Moreover, the ZrT-1-NH₂/TMC composite membrane also exhibited good antifouling and antibacterial properties. The MOP membrane can well combine the developed porous structure of thin film nanocomposite membranes with the advantages of polyamide membranes in simplicity and scalability of membrane fabrication, showing good potential for application in practical molecular separations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3acrosslinking 3adyes 3afilms (materials) 3aliquids 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3ananofiltration 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3atrimesoyl chloride 3aultrafiltration 0aMetal-organic polyhedrons 0aPolyamide 0aMembrane 0aPorous monomer1 aXu, Shanshan1 aSun, Yuxiu1 aQiao, Zhihua1 aHuang, Hongliang1 aZhong, Chongli0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 632 p.119354-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1193543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245009600171300001800267520188100285592002802166650001202194650001602206650001902222650003802241650002302279650001102302650001802313650001902331650001902350650001302369650001302382700001402395700001502409700001402424700001702438700001602455700001802471700001602489700001602505700001502521773008702536856009002623852000902713655001202722IND60090515520221120215727.0141102e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009051552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chao10aProbing structure–antifouling activity relationships of polyacrylamides and polyacrylates  ap. 4714-4724.  aWe have synthesized two different polyacrylamide polymers with amide groups (polySBAA and polyHEAA) and two corresponding polyacrylate polymers without amide groups (polySBMA and polyHEA), with particular attention to the evaluation of the effect of amide group on the hydration and antifouling ability of these systems using both computational and experimental approaches. The influence of polymer architectures of brushes, hydrogels, and nanogels, prepared by different polymerization methods, on antifouling performance is also studied. SPR and ELISA data reveal that all polymers exhibit excellent antifouling ability to repel proteins from undiluted human blood serum/plasma, and such antifouling ability can be further enhanced by presenting amide groups in polySBAA and polyHEAA as compared to polySBMA and polyHEA. The antifouling performance is positively correlated with the hydration properties. Simulations confirm that four polymers indeed have different hydration characteristics, while all presenting a strong hydration overall. Integration of amide group with pendant hydroxyl or sulfobetaine group in polymer backbones is found to increase their surface hydration of polymer chains and thus to improve their antifouling ability. Importantly, we present a proof-of-concept experiment to synthesize polySBAA nanogels, which show a switchable property between antifouling and pH-responsive functions driven by acid–base conditions, while still maintaining high stability in undiluted fetal bovine serum and minimal toxicity to cultured cells. This work provides important structural insights into how very subtle structural changes in polymers can yield great improvement in biological activity, specifically the inclusion of amide group in polymer backbone/sidechain enables to obtain antifouling materials with better performance for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrushes 3acorrelation 3acultured cells 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afetal bovine serum 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3atoxicity1 aZhao, Jun1 aLi, Xiaosi1 aWu, Jiang1 aChen, Shenfu1 aChen, Qiang1 aWang, Qiuming1 aGong, Xiong1 aLi, Lingyan1 aZheng, Jie0 tBiomaterials.g2013 July, v. 34, no. 20 p.4714-4724dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03835naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010800171300001600279520230900295592002802604650001302632650001902645650001902664650001102683650003302694650001602727650001102743650002302754650001702777650001602794650002102810650001702831650001302848650001702861650001302878650002402891650001402915650001302929650002202942650001502964650003002979650001603009651001003025700002403035700002303059700002203082773011103104856008103215852000903296655001203305IND60440333120221120134842.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-015-0409-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeriesh, Mohamed H.10aImplications of climate change on the groundwater flow regime and geochemistry of the Nile Delta, Egypt  ap. 589-608.  aEnvironmental isotope analyses in conjunction with the hydro-geochemical investigations and tentative reviewing of the paleoclimatic sea level changes are carried out to fingerprint the implications of climatic changes on the groundwater flow regime and geochemistry at the Nile Delta. Following up the footprints of groundwater flow history, it is observed that the Pleistocene, main groundwater aquifer of the Nile Delta was drained and refilled with Nile water several times due to the eustatic sea level propagations between dry and wet periods. Therefore, the present-day groundwater flow regime could be affected by the latest Holocene phase of climate changes during which no significant dramatic sea level changes were recorded. After the time slice of the Mediterranean humid phase, 8000-5500 BP, the sea level started to rise steeply from –15 m to the present-day level. Under this rising rate, the seawater invaded most of the northern delta lope and several 10ᵗʰˢ of kilometres inland via the mouths of the ancient Nile branches. During these arid conditions, deterioration of the Pleistocene unconfined aquifer could take place. This finding matches a famine and economic instabilities during the arid periods and flourishing and economic stabilities during the humid pluvial periods along the history of the ancient Egyptian civilization. In accordance to the latest active sea level rise stage in conjunction with the delta subsidence, a contagious groundwater level rise with a recent order of 3 cm/year is taking place leading to form several lake-like lagoons, water logging and soil salinization along the coastal plain and the eastern low lands. The Nile Delta is expected to suffer extreme soil salinization and gradual merging under the groundwater logging and seawater transgression especially, along the eastern coastal zone which suffers a high subsidence rate of about 5 mm/year. In contrast to previous studies, our findings show that, the present groundwater composition and salinity in the Nile Delta aquifers cannot be attributed to a recent seawater intrusion. The physico-chemical processes that explain this composition are combination of salt dissolution (mainly from Holocene fluvio-marine aquifer), flushing by recent Nile water, ion exchange and evaporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclimate change 3acoastal plains 3acoasts 3adry environmental conditions 3aevaporation 3afamine 3aflooded conditions 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aion exchange 3aisotopes 3ariver deltas 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3aseawater 3asoil salinization 3asubsidence 3atransgressive segregation 3awater table 3aEgypt1 aBalke, Klaus-Dieter1 aEl-Rayes, Ahmed E.1 aMansour, Basma M.0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2015 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.589-608dSpringer Netherlandsx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-015-0409-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245012600189300001600315520187800331592002802209653002502237653000802262653001902270653000802289653001902297653001402316653002402330700002202354700002302376773010102399856011502500852000902615655001202624IND60131233820221119002828.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123382DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[917:COOCMB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDettling, Mark D.10aControl of organic carbon mineralization by alternative electron acceptors in four peatlands, central new york state, usa  ap. 917-927.  aTerminal mineralization of organic carbon ((C)) in northern peat soils usually produces more carbon dioxide ((CO₂)) than methane ((CH₄)), but the maintenance of microbial CO₂ production is unclear. Carbon dioxide production relies on oxygen ((O₂)) or alternative ((to O₂)) electron acceptors ((NO₃⁻⁻, Fe((III)), SO₄²⁻⁻)). We examined rates of CO₂ production and CH₄ production in peat soils from two ombrotrophic bogs and two minerotrophic fens incubated in vitro with and without added glucose ((an electron donor)) and added electron acceptors. Soil interstitial water had dissolved NO₃⁻⁻ ((2––17 µµmol L⁻⁻¹)) in three sites, and SO₄²⁻⁻ ((2––20 µµmol L⁻⁻¹)) and Fe((III)) ((0.02––0.8 µµmol L⁻⁻¹)) in all four sites. Peat soils incubated in vitro without added glucose or electron acceptors had rates of CH₄ production between 0.2 and 1.5 µµmol g⁻⁻¹ day⁻⁻¹ and rates of CO₂ production between 8 and 17 µµmol g⁻⁻¹ day⁻⁻¹. Added glucose increased CO₂ production in all of the peat soils, although adding an electron acceptor with glucose had no additional impact in the bogs. Nitrate plus glucose had the largest increase in CO₂ production in both fens, and SO₄²⁻⁻ plus glucose enhanced CO₂ production in one fen. Added glucose alone or with O₂ or Fe increased CH₄ production in peat soil from the two bogs, whereas glucose plus SO₄²⁻⁻ or NO₃⁻⁻ inhibited CH₄ production. Glucose plus an electron acceptor inhibited CH₄ production in the forest fen but enhanced CH₄ production in sedge fen. Terminal electron acceptors did not universally divert C and electron flow away from CH₄ production and towards CO₂ production in these peat soils, and thus maintenance of CO₂ production is still uncertain, with no single explanation likely.  aPublisher supplied data 0aanaerobic metabolism 0abog 0aCO2 production 0afen 0amethanogenesis 0apeat soil 0aterminal metabolism1 aYavitt, Joseph B.1 aZinder, Stephen H.0 tWetlands.g2006 Dec., v. 26, no. 4 p.917-927dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282006%2926%5B917%3ACOOCMB%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009000162300001600252520088400268592002801152650001601180650001801196650001701214650001001231650002101241650002601262650001201288700002101300773009101321856008101412852000901493655001201502IND60519933420221117065340.0160511e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051993342DNAL7 a10.1134/S002626171602003X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, R.10aIdentification of novel gene clusters for secondary metabolism in Trichoderma genomes  ap. 185-190.  aTrichoderma species are widely used in agriculture as biofungicides. These fungi are rich source of secondary metabolites and the mycoparasitic species are enriched in genes for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Most often, genes for secondary metabolism are clustered in fungal genomes. Previously, no systematic study was undertaken to identify the secondary-metabolism related gene clusters in Trichoderma genomes. In the present study, a survey of the three Trichoderma genomes viz. T. reesei, T. atroviride and T. virens, was made to identify the putative gene clusters associated with secondary metabolism. In T. reesei genome, we identified one new NRPS and 6 new PKS clusters, which is much less than that found in T. atroviride (4 and 8) and T. virens (8 and 7). This work would pave the way for discovery of novel secondary metabolites and pathways in Trichoderma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma 3abiopesticides 3abiosynthesis 3afungi 3amultigene family 3asecondary metabolites 3asurveys1 aMukherjee, P.

In mice, the 14th postnatal day is believed to correspond to the third trimester of human embryonic development and is considered a vital period for central nervous system development. It has been shown that ASD affects 2 to 3 times more male than female individuals. In the present study, ASD was induced in 14 postnatal day (PND) BALB/c mice using valproic acid (VPA). VPA administration brought about substantial differences in the histoarchitecture of the brain in both male and female mice, linked to behavioural deficits. We observed that both male and female mice showed similar morphological changes in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells. We also observed hair loss from PND 17 to 25, which was again similar between male and female mice. However, there were higher rates of change in the cerebral cortex, frontal cortex and temporal lobe and hippocampus in VPA-treated male animals. With respect to the cerebellum, we did not observe any alterations by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, but detailed morphological observation using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a higher rate of phenotype changes in VPA-treated male animals. Moreover, 5-HT2A receptor protein levels were upregulated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and Purkinje cells in VPA-treated male mice compared with control animals and VPA-treated female mice, as shown by immunohistochemical analysis. Based on all these findings, we conclude that male animals are more susceptible to VPA-induced ASD than females.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalopecia 3aautism 3abiomarkers 3acerebellum 3aembryogenesis 3aeosin 3afemales 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amales 3aneurodevelopment 3anonverbal communication 3aphenotype 3aprefrontal cortex 3asocial behavior 3avalproic acid1 aSinha, Sukesh Narayan1 aChalamaiah, Meram 1 aVakdevi, Validandi 1 aShashikala, Patangay 1 aVeeresh, Bantal 1 aSurekha, Venkata Mullapudi1 aKasturi, Vasudev 1 aBoiroju, Naveen Kumar0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011200163520114800275592002801423650002501451650001501476650001201491650001201503650002101515650001101536650001601547650001301563650002801576650001001604773012701614856007401741852000901815655001201824IND60652947720221120083437.0190713e20190430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065294772DNAL7 a10.3390/su110925112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPactwa, Katarzyna 10aIs There a Place for Women in the Polish Mines?—Selected Issues in the Context of Sustainable Development  aThis article demonstrates the situation of women in the Polish mining industry through the prism of the implementation of sustainable development goals. The conducted analysis allowed us to verify the thesis that the actions that have been taken with the aim of gender equality are not enough, and mining is therefore not sustainable. Despite the fact that regulations have changed over the years, and women are now allowed to undertake jobs in mining plants, the sector is still highly masculinized. This phenomenon was found to be particularly disadvantageous after conducting an analysis of data referring to the number of female students graduating each year in mining and geology majors. It can be concluded, based on information concerning the share of women employed in the mining industry in general, as well as information on several other factors, that the majority of women who have pursued higher education in the field of mining will not find a job in this profession. This phenomenon clearly indicates the necessity of changes in the scope of education, and the need for companies to broaden internship and apprenticeship offers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aemployment 3afemales 3ageology 3ahigher education 3amining 3aoccupations 3astudents 3asustainable development 3awomen0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 30, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110925113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245005300169506002800222520123500250592002801485506003701513650001101550650002501561650002201586650001101608650000901619700001801628700001801646700002301664700002301687773009601710856008401806852000901890655001201899IND60753593520221207101843.0211005s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075359352DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202136060442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadezhda, Momot10aAnatomic features of horse and manchurian wapiti  aResource is Open Access  aCarrying out a sanitary and veterinary expertise is a mandatory requirement which is necessary for the admission of livestock products, meat in particular, to sale. When carrying veterinary and sanitary expertise we often come up the attempts of meat products adulteration, for example when livestock meat is replaced to wild one and vice versa. Most often such adulteration cases are the results of illegal hunting. The purpose of our work is study horse and Manchurian wapiti carcasses anatomic features. The main methods of meat species determine are analysis of carcass appearance, organoleptic parameters analysis, laboratory tests as well as analysis and feature examination of anatomic structure of the inspected carcass. To determine meat species we applied methods of comparative and anatomic examination, organoleptic parameters analysis of meat samples, and laboratory tests. The suggested methods of examination can be used not only for determination of the whole animal carcasses species, but for small parts of the body. It is of great importance in conducting forensic and veterinary researches, when the number of parts can be finite. Maximal efficiency can be achieved only with complex use of enumerated methods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCervus 3aadulterated products 3aforensic sciences 3ahorses 3ameat1 aYulia, Kolina1 aIgor, Kamliya1 aSvetlana, Terebova1 aTatiana, Timofeeva0 tBIO web of conferences.g2021, v. 36 p.06044-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202136060443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04211naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245016400164520294000328592002803268650001603296650001303312650002503325650003103350650001703381650001703398650001103415650001403426650001403440650000903454650001903463650002803482651001403510651001303524651001303537651001203550700002903562773012103591856008003712852000903792655001203801IND60763407420221116204314.0220120e20211221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076340742DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110100072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYap, Chee Kong10aEcological-Health Risk Assessments of Heavy Metals (Cu, Pb, and Zn) in Aquatic Sediments from the ASEAN-5 Emerging Developing Countries: A Review and Synthesis  aThe ASEAN-5 countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam) of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as a group is an ever-increasing major economy developmental hub in Asia besides having wealthy natural resources. However, heavy metal (HM) pollution in the region is of increasing environmental and public concern. This study aimed to review and compile the concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in the aquatic sediments of the ASEAN-5 countries published in the literature from 1981 to February 2021. The mean values of Cu, Pb, and Zn in aquatic sediments were elevated and localized in high human activity sites and compared to the earth’s upper continental crust and reference values. Based on 176 reports from 113 publications, the ranges of concentrations (mg/kg dry weight) were 0.09–3080 for Cu, 0.37–4950 for Zn, and 0.07–2666 for Pb. The ecological risk (ER) values ranged from 0.02–1077 for Cu, 0.01–95.2 for Zn, and 0.02–784 for Pb. All reports (100%) showed the Zn ER values were categorized as being between ‘low potential ecological risk’ and ‘considerable potential ecological risk’. Almost all Cu ER values (97.7%) also showed similar ranges of the above two risk categories except for a few reports. The highest Cu level (3080 mg/kg dry weight) was reported from a mine-tailing spill in Marinduque Island of the Philippines with ‘very high ecological risk’. In addition, drainage sediments in the western part of Peninsular Malaysia were categorized as Cu ’high potential ecological risk’. Almost all reports (96%) showed Pb ER values categorized as between ‘low potential ecological risk’ and ‘moderate potential ecological risk’ except for a few reports. Six reports showed Pb ER values of ‘considerable potential ecological risk’, while one report from Semarang (Indonesia) showed Pb ER of ‘very high ecological risk’ (Pb level of 2666 mg/kg dry weight). For the ingestion and dermal contact pathways for sediments from the ASEAN-5 countries, all non-carcinogenic risk (NCR) values (HI values 1.0) for Cu, Pb, and Zn reflected no NCR. The ER and human health risk assessment of Cu, Pb, and Zn were compared in an integrative and accurate manner after we reassessed the HM data mentioned in the literature. The synthesis carried out in this review provided the basis for us to consider Cu, Pb, and Zn as being of localized elevated levels. This provided evidence for the ASEAN-5 group of countries to be considered as being a new socio-economic corridor. Beyond any reasonable doubt, an ever-increasing anthropogenic input of HMs is to be expected to a certain degree. We believe that this paper provides the most fundamental useful baseline data for the future management and sustainable development of the aquatic ecosystems in the region. Lastly, we claim that this review is currently the most up-to-date review on this topic in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3adrainage 3aenvironmental health 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aingestion 3apollution 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia 3aThailand 3aVietnam1 aAl-Mutairi, Khalid Awadh0 tBiology.g2021 Dec. 21, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003500132040001800167100002200185245015400207300001600361520123400377592002801611650002501639650001101664650001701675650001501692650003201707650002801739650001701767650002901784650002301813650001201836650001501848650004801863650002301911650002401934650001701958650002001975650002401995650006102019650002402080650005202104650002302156700001902179700002302198700002202221773014302243856011202386856008202498961001302580852000902593655001202602IND4409942420221120124432.0200207e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440994242DNAL7 a186294942pmid7 a10113/201802hdl7 a10.1007/s00253-008-1583-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHector, Ronald E.10aExpression of a heterologous xylose transporter in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain engineered to utilize xylose improves aerobic xylose consumption  ap. 675-684.  aThe goal of this investigation was to determine the effect of a xylose transport system on glucose and xylose co-consumption as well as total xylose consumption in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We expressed two heterologous transporters from Arabidopsis thaliana in recombinant xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae cells. Strains expressing the heterologous transporters were grown on glucose and xylose mixtures. Sugar consumption rates and ethanol concentrations were determined and compared to an isogenic control strain lacking the A. thaliana transporters. Expression of the transporters increased xylose uptake and xylose consumption up to 46% and 40%, respectively. Xylose co-consumption rates (prior to glucose depletion) were also increased by up to 2.5-fold compared to the control strain. Increased xylose consumption correlated with increased ethanol concentration and productivity. During the xylose/glucose co-consumption phase, strains expressing the transporters had up to a 70% increase in ethanol production rate. It was concluded that in these strains, xylose transport was a limiting factor for xylose utilization and that increasing xylose/glucose co-consumption is a viable strategy for improving xylose fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3axylose 3atransporters 3atransgenes 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afermentation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aaerobic conditions 3aethanol 2aAerobiosis 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMonosaccharide Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Engineering 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aXylosexmetabolism1 aQureshi, Nasib1 aHughes, Stephen R.1 aCotta, Michael A.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2008 Sept., v. 80, no. 4 p.675-684dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/201803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1583-23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015300167500001900320520148000339592002801819650003701847650001701884650000901901650002201910650001501932650001801947650001501965650001901980650001301999650001302012650001902025653004302044653004702087653003602134653002802170653001602198700001802214700005502232700001702287700001702304773011202321856008502433852000902518655001202527IND60735724420221118180543.0210527e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073572442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1193692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhongbao10aElectrospray interface-less polymerization to fabricate high-performance thin film composite polyamide membranes with controllable skin layer growth  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHigh-performance thin film composite polyamide (TFC-PA) membranes with controllable structure and transport properties are of great significance. However, TFC-PA membranes prepared by interfacial polymerization are far from ideal due to their quick and uncontrollable reaction process. In this study, we reported a novel strategy to fabricate TFC-PA membranes via an electrospray interface-less polymerization (EILP) technique with a miscible solvent system. The miscible solvent system facilitated both the stable and fine spraying of monomer solutions and the efficient polymerization of monomers, and thus resulting in the formation of a smooth and defect-free PA skin layer. Moreover, the crosslinking degree and thickness of the EILP membrane skin layer could be controlled easily by regulating the concentration and dose of sprayed monomers. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta potential and mean effective pore size were employed to characterize the EILP membrane and clarify the separation mechanism. The optimum EILP membrane showed excellent filtration performance with a high water flux of up to 17.7 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹, high salt rejection (98.2% of Na₂SO₄) and complete dye rejection for Congo red. This study provides new insights into the understanding of electrospray procedures and enlightens the design and manufacture of advanced membrane materials through electrospray.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3adyes 3afilms (materials) 3afiltration 3amanufacturing 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3asolvents 3azeta potential 0aThin film composite polyamide membrane 0aElectrospray interface-less polymerization 0aElectrospray process parameters 0aControllable skin layer 0aDye removal1 aRen, Long-Fei1 aYing, Diwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6449-06491 aJia, Jinping1 aShao, Jiahui0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 632 p.119369-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1193693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245011700160520121600277592002801493650002501521650002201546650003101568650001601599650001201615650001401627650002601641650001501667651001001682700001901692773012101711856008001832852000901912655001201921IND60763407520221116204409.0220120e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076340752DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110100802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wei 10aEarly Starvation Contributes to the Adaptive Capacity of Corythucha marmorata (Uhler), an Emerging Pest in China  aFood shortages severely reduce the prospects of insect survival in natural settings, including in the case of herbivorous insects. However, the early starvation experience of some insects has positive effects throughout their entire lifespan. It is important to discuss the effects of refeeding and host plants on the capacity of herbivorous insects to adapt to starvation and low temperatures, considering that starvation resistance is expected to show some degree of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. We tested the relationship between host plant, starvation, and the supercooling capacity of the invasive pest Corythucha marmorata. In particular, we highlighted how early starvation affects the refeeding and recovery phases. Among the various range of hosts, the chrysanthemum lace bug has the fastest growth rate on Helianthus annuus, and the strongest supercooling capacity on Symphyotrichum novi-belgii. Especially, starvation for 2 days increases the rates of survival, development, and number of eggs upon refeeding, in comparison to no starvation. A 3-day starvation period in the nymphal stage significantly increased the supercooling capacity of 5th instar nymphs and adults, as observed in our study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorythucha marmorata 3aHelianthus annuus 3aSymphyotrichum novi-belgii 3ahost plants 3ainstars 3alongevity 3aphenotypic plasticity 3astarvation 3aChina1 aChen, Wenlong 0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012300170300001600293520042800309592002800737650001500765650001600780650001700796650002800813650002300841651001000864653001500874653001600889653001800905653001500923653001600938653001000954700002200964773023600986856008401222852000901306655001201315IND60543646620221119183423.0190411e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054364662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2015.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharti, Himender10aFirst record of genus Protanilla (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Leptanillinae) from India with description of a new species  ap. 573-576.  aProtanilla wardi sp. nov. from Kerala, India is described and illustrated, which also confirms first record of the genus from this country.

When ignoring the wind field, the results showed that the gravity flow and top‐lifted flow both drove Cu particles to move from south to north, and the backward flow slowed down the velocity of Cu particles, but did not affect the final trend. When considering the wind field, wind‐driven currents had an effect on the horizontal lake flow patterns. Under the influence of wind‐driven current, the top‐lifted flow was the most vulnerable, the backward flow ranks the second and the gravity flow ranks the third. The results demonstrated the importance of the effect of wind on lake circulation and mixing. Better knowledge on heavy metal footprints in large river‐connected lake was provided to guide the future water management.  aPublisher supplied data  aCKWV2017504/KYcChangjiang River Scientific Research Institute  a2018‐12cQinglan Project of Jiangsu Province of China  aKT201623cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province  a51779075cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51479064cPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions 3aenvironment 3agravity 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3amodels 3awater 3awater management 3awind1 aWang, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8144-73031 aFan, Lili1 aDeng, Yanqing1 aZeng, Yichuan0 tWater and environment journal.g2020 Dec., v. 34 Suppl S1 p.586-596dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.125623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245012500188300001600313520148300329592002801812653003501840653000801875653002501883653002601908653001901934653002301953700002301976700002301999700002302022700001902045773010102064856011502165852000902280655001202289IND60131234620221119002947.0151127e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123462DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[141:AMAOCI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHierl, Lauren A.12aA multivariate assessment of changes in wetland habitat for waterbirds at moosehorn national wildlife refuge, maine, usa  ap. 141-152.  aWe assessed changes in vegetative structure of 49 impoundments at Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge (MNWR), Maine, USA, between the periods 1984––1985 to 2002 with a multivariate, adaptive approach that may be useful in a variety of wetland and other habitat management situations. We used Mahalanobis Distance (MD) analysis to classify the refuge's wetlands as poor or good waterbird habitat based on five variables: percent emergent vegetation, percent shrub, percent open water, relative richness of vegetative types, and an interspersion juxtaposition index that measures adjacency of vegetation patches. Mahalanobis Distance is a multivariate statistic that examines whether a particular data point is an outlier or a member of a data cluster while accounting for correlations among inputs. For each wetland, we used MD analysis to quantify a distance from a reference condition defined a priori by habitat conditions measured in MNWR wetlands used by waterbirds. Twenty-five wetlands declined in quality between the two periods, whereas 23 wetlands improved. We identified specific wetland characteristics that may be modified to improve habitat conditions for waterbirds. The MD analysis seems ideal for instituting an adaptive wetland management approach because metrics can be easily added or removed, ranges of target habitat conditions can be defined by field-collected data, and the analysis can identify priorities for single or multiple management objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 0ageographic information systems 0aGIS 0aMahalanobis Distance 0amultivariate analysis 0awetland change 0awetland management1 aLoftin, Cynthia S.1 aLongcore, Jerry R.1 aMcAuley, Daniel G.1 aUrban, Dean L.0 tWetlands.g2007 Mar., v. 27, no. 1 p.141-152dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282007%2927%5B141%3AAMAOCI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001800296520183200314592002802146650001402174650001702188650001402205650001702219650001002236650000902246650001302255650002602268650001602294650001302310650001302323651001002336653003002346653002602376653001702402700002002419700001702439700001602456700001402472773009902486856008602585852000902671655001202680IND60629743720221121055026.0200210e20190307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tiantian10aEpidemiology study of pediatric primary intussusception aged ≤24 months in pre-rotavirus vaccine era of Jinan, China  ap. 1436-1442.  aFew studies have reported on the epidemiological characteristics of pediatric primary intussusception in the pre-rotavirus vaccine era of China. It is important to complementary baseline data before rotavirus vaccine introduction in China. This study conduct a retrospective investigation and evaluated the incidence rate, described the epidemiology of pediatric primary intussusception aged ≤24 months.We conducted a retrospective investigation in all secondary- and tertiary-hospitals in Jinan. Pediatric primary intussusception inpatients aged ≤24 months were identified depending on ICD-10 discharge code from a total of 63 hospitals from 2011 to 2015. Demographic and clinical information were extracting from the electronic clinical record systems.A total of 575 pediatric primary intussusception inpatients were identified with average annual incidence of 86.5 per 100,000. A significantly higher incidence was observed in males (χ2 = 13.8, P < 0.01), in the ≤12 months old age group (χ2 = 19.5, P < 0.01) and from the urban areas (χ2 = 63.31, P < 0.001). No clear seasonality found. Abdominal pain (80.9%) and vomiting (63.3%) were the most frequently reported. Most intussusception cases occurred in ileo-cecum. Over 92% of intussusception cases were diagnosed by ultrasound alone and 77.4% was successfully treated by air enema. 99.7% were cured. The median time of hospitalization was 2 days (range: 0–35 days).This retrospective study provides baseline information of incidence, epidemiologyand clinical characteristics of pediatric primary intussusception in Jinan City during 2011–2016 before the introduction of rotavirus vaccine. It will be important for evaluating safety of rotavirus vaccine if it will be introduced to the routine immunization program in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aepidemiology 3ahospitals 3aimmunization 3amales 3apain 3apatients 3aretrospective studies 3aurban areas 3avaccines 3avomiting 3aChina 0aPediatric intussusception 0aRotavirus vaccination 0aEpidemiology1 aCui, Liangliang1 aGeng, Xingyi1 aYu, Xiaolin1 aZhang, Ji0 tVaccine.g2019 Mar. 07, v. 37, no. 11 p.1436-1442dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011600155300001400271500002000285520139400305592002801699650002101727650002601748650001001774650001101784650001401795650003801809650001201847650001001859650001101869651002501880651001001905700001701915700001701932700002301949700001401972700002401986700002902010700002002039700001502059700001502074773013302089856007402222852000902296655001202305IND60765891820221118001311.0220204e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076589182DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.125482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemesar, S.10aTraumatic myiasis by Wohlfahrtia magnifica in sheep flocks from southeastern Spain: prevalence and risk factors  ap. 30-37.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is an obligate myiasis‐causing fly of livestock that is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean basin. A total of 73 683 sheep from 122 flocks in Albacete Province (southeastern [SE] Spain) were examined to detect active traumatic myiasis. The influence of several individual and flock factors on the prevalence was also assessed. The overall flock prevalence of traumatic myiasis was 95.9%, with an individual prevalence of 7.1%. Wohlfahrtia magnifica was identified in all of the positive animals except one that was infested by Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae). Adults of both genders showed a higher risk of infestation than juveniles, whereas males of all ages displayed an increased risk of infestation than females of all ages; the existence of a lambing building on the farm, poor husbandry facilities and the location area were also identified as risk factors. Prevalence was highest in the summer, and the fly season lasted from March to November. Genitalia were the main location of infestation in males (94.4%) and females (76.3%).

At extraction stage, nitrosamines were extracted from sausage and salami samples with 10 mL of a hydrolyzing solvent using microwave at 500 MHz for 1.5 min. Effective parameters on DLLME, such as volumes of extraction and disperser solvents, pH, and salt addition, were optimized using response surface methodology based on central composite design. This technique provided acceptable repeatability in the range of 3.5–5.4 % for spiked samples. The recoveries of NAs were in the range 83.9–109.4 %. Limits of detection and limits of quantification for NAs in the real samples were within the ranges of 0.11–0.48 and 0.41–1.45 ng g⁻¹, respectively. Good linear ranges were obtained for seven NAs in the range of 0.1–200 ng mL⁻¹, with the coefficient (R²) higher than 0.99. The merit figures, compared with other methods, showed that new proposed method is an accurate, precise, and reliable sample pretreatment method that substantially reduces sample matrix interference and gives very good enrichment factors (126–152).  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3anitrosamines 3afood research 3arapid methods 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3amicrowave treatment 3asalami 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0agas-chromatography-mass spectrometry1 aHosseini, Hedayat1 aKamankesh, Marzieh1 aGhasemzadeh-Mohammadi, Vahid1 aMohammadi, Abdorreza0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2015 Feb., v. 240, no. 2 p.441-450dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-014-2343-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04537naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001400304520162200318536071401940592002802654596005702682596008302739596010302822596009702925596010003022596009903122650001503221650002103236650002503257650001303282650002403295650002203319650003203341650001103373650001603384650000903400650001403409650002203423650001403445650001403459650001403473650001303487650001603500650003203516653005703548653000903605653001603614653001403630653002003644700001803664700002003682700001303702773011403715856008503829852000903914655001203923IND60634490620221117225753.0190323e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063449062DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2018.14920472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanmin10aHyperthermophilic Anaerobic Nitrate-Dependent Fe(II) Oxidization by Tibetan Hot Spring Microbiota and the Formation of Fe Minerals  ap. 30-41.  aFe(II) in geothermal fluids was among the most important electron and energy sources for extremophiles and early life, and microbial oxidation of Fe(II) in turn contributed to the global Fe deposits such as banded iron formation (BIF). However, information was rare on Fe(II) bio-oxidation and consequent mineral formation in geothermal systems. In the present study, we investigated the anaerobic nitrate-depending Fe(II) oxidation (ANDFO) in the Tibetan hot springs with temperature ranging 52–86°C. ANDFO cultivation was established by inoculating sediments from the studied hot springs. Positive ANDFO reaction was observed in the cultures from three high-temperature hot springs (>80°C). Phylogenetic analysis showed that bacteria in the three obtained ANDFO cultures were mainly affiliated with phyla of Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes. In the obtained ANDFO cultures, ferrous iron oxidation occurred with nitrate reduction, accompanied with the formation of magnetite and/or siderite, which could be finished within one week. The resulting euhedral magnetite was at the micrometer scale, which was larger in size and showed better crystallinity than its counterparts (usually <1 µm) formed by chemical reactions. Thus, it can be concluded that ANDFO bacteria and denitrifiers played important roles in the magnetite and siderite precipitation in the studied Tibetan hot springs. The coupling between Fe(II) oxidation and nitrate reduction mediated by thermophiles might provide a new mechanism for euhedral magnetite and siderite deposition in BIFs during the Precambrian period.  aThis work was supported by the Special Foundation for Basic Research Program of China Ministry of Science & Technology (MOST) (No. 2015FY110100), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41422208, 41502318, and 41521001), the Key Project of International Cooperation of China Ministry of Science and Technology (No. 2013DFA31980), the 111 Program (State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs & the Ministry of Education of China, Grant B18049), the cooperation foundation from Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, CAS (KLMM20170101), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the China Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).  aPublisher supplied data  a2015FY110100cChina Ministry of Science & Technology  a41422208, 41502318, and 41521001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2013DFA31980cKey Project of International Cooperation of China Ministry of Science and Technology  aB18049cState Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs & the Ministry of Education of China  aKLMM20170101cKey Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry  cFundamental Research Funds for the China Central Universities, China University of Geosciences 3aFirmicutes 3aPrecambrian time 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacteria 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3acrystal structure 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenergy 3ahot springs 3airon 3amagnetite 3anitrate reduction 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3asediments 3asiderite 3atemperature 3athermophilic microorganisms 0aAnaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidation (ANDFO) 0aBIFs 0ahot springs 0amagnetite 0aTibetan Plateau1 aHuang, Liuqin1 aJiang, Hongchen1 aWu, Geng0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 36, no. 1 p.30-41dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12314x1521-05297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2018.14920473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245010100208300001400309520230000323592002802623653002202651653002702673653001002700653003902710653002902749700001602778700002002794700001302814700001302827700001302840773010602853856008702959852000903046655001203055IND60629743820221121055131.0190202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2017.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSciarra, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3767-310510aRadon and carbon gas anomalies along the Watukosek Fault System and Lusi mud eruption, Indonesia  ap. 77-90.  aAn extensive survey was carried out in the Sidoarjo district (East Java, Indonesia) to investigate the gas leaking properties along fractured zones coinciding with a strike-slip system, the Watukosek Fault System (WFS) in NE Java. This structure has been the focus of attention since the beginning of the spectacular Lusi mud eruption on the 29th May 2006. The sinistral strike-slip WFS originates from the Arjuno-Welirang volcanic complex, intersects the active Lusi eruption site displaying a system of antithetic faults, and extends towards the NE of Java where mud volcanic structures reside.In the Lusi region we completed a geochemical survey along three profiles combining measurements of a) 220Rn and 222Rn activity, b) CO2 and CH4 soil gas content, c) CO2 and CH4 fluxes, and d) gas analyses. The profiles are up to ∼1.2 km long and intersect perpendicularly areas with intense fracturing and surface deformation along the WFS. The purpose was to investigate the presence and origin of soil degassing activity in potentially active fault zones.Results show that the peripheral sectors of the profiles have high 220Rn activity and reduced CO2 and CH4 fluxes and concentrations. This suggests low fluids migration that could be affected by shallow circulation. In contrast, the segments of profiles intersecting the fractured zones have the highest 222Rn activity, CO2 and CH4 flux and gas concentration values.The relationship existing among the measured parameters suggests that the WFS acts as a preferential pathway for active rise of deep fluids. The presence of such advective processes is suggested by the relatively high rate of migration needed to obtain anomalies of short-lived 222Rn in the soil pores. Gas molecular and isotopic composition reveals that all sampled localities have a mixed hydrocarbon origin implying the presence of shallow microbial and deeper thermogenic hydrocarbons. CO2 isotopic values (δ13C-CO2 ranges between −9.48‰ and 4.12‰ V-PDB) indicate the presence of mantle derived CO2 and thermo-metamorphic CO2 suggesting that elevated temperatures have a key role in this active system. The samples collected from fractured and faulted zones reveal to have gas composition similar to that obtained from Lusi crater, indicating deep origin fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLusi mud eruption 0aWatukosek Fault System 0aRadon 0aCO2 – CH4 flux and concentration 0aGas migration and origin1 aMazzini, A.1 aInguaggiato, S.1 aVita, F.1 aLupi, M.1 aHadi, S.0 tMarine and petroleum geology.g2018 Feb., v. 90 p.77-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:26796x0264-81727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2017.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168500001900263520177500282592002802057650002302085650001902108650000802127650001902135650001802154650001602172650002402188650002402212650002102236650001002257650001702267650001802284650001502302650001202317651001002329653001302339653001602352653002402368700001902392700001602411700001402427700001502441700001302456700001802469700001902487700001402506773011002520856008502630852000902715655001202724IND60714951720221119231316.0210212e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071495172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinhan10aAssociations between air pollution and COVID-19 epidemic during quarantine period in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global public health threaten. A series of strict prevention and control measures were implemented in China, contributing to the improvement of air quality. In this study, we described the trend of air pollutant concentrations and the incidence of COVID-19 during the epidemic and applied generalized additive models (GAMs) to assess the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 235 Chinese cities. Disease progression based on both onset and report dates as well as control measures as potential confounding were considered in the analyses. We found that stringent prevention and control measures intending to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, contributed to a significant decline in the concentrations of air pollutants except ozone (O₃). Significant positive associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5 μm (PM₂.₅), particulate matter with diameters ≤10 μm (PM₁₀), and nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) with daily new confirmed cases were observed during the epidemic. Per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM₂.₅ (lag0-15), PM₁₀ (lag0-15), and NO₂ (lag0-20) were associated with a 7% [95% confidence interval (CI): (4–9)], 6% [95% CI: (3–8)], and 19% [95% CI: (13–24)] increase in the counts of daily onset cases, respectively. Our results suggest that there is a statistically significant association between ambient air pollution and the spread of COVID-19. Thus, the quarantine measures can not only cut off the transmission of virus, but also retard the spread by improving ambient air quality, which might provide implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aacute exposure 3aair 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aconfidence interval 3adisease progression 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apublic health 3aquarantine 3aviruses 3aChina 0aCOVID-19 0aTime series 0aShort-term exposure1 aTang, Mengling1 aGuo, Fanjia1 aWei, Fang1 aYu, Zhebin1 aGao, Kai1 aJin, Mingjuan1 aWang, Jianbing1 aChen, Kun0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 268 p.115897-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245010000188300001600288520174900304592002802053653002302081653002802104653002102132653002502153653001702178653002002195700001902215700002402234773014202258856011502400852000902515655001202524IND60128235120221118132806.0151115e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823512DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[578:SATOBP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, Glenn S.10aStatus and Trends of Benthic Populations in a Coastal Drowned River Mouth Lake of Lake Michigan  ap. 578-595.  aMuskegon Lake was designated an Area of Concern because of severe environmental impairments from direct discharge of industrial and municipal wastes. Since diversion of all municipal and industrial wastewater in 1973, few studies have assessed ecological changes associated with improved water quality. We examined distributions and long-term changes in the benthic macroinvertebrate community at 27 sites. Distributions were evaluated relative to distance from the river mouth, water depth, grain size, and known areas of sediment contamination. Temporal changes were assessed relative to wastewater diversion. Oligochaeta and Chironomidae dominated the community, and the oligochaete trophic condition index indicated that, in 1999, the lake was generally mesotrophic to eutrophic. Cluster analysis resulted in four distinct site groupings. A cluster of sites near the river mouth had the highest total density (9,375 m⁻⁻²) and lowest diversity (Shannon Weaver Index 1.05) suggesting an enriched habitat. A site cluster in the south central region had the lowest oligochaete density (2,782 m⁻⁻²), lowest oligochaete trophic condition index scores (1.00), and highest diversity (2.24), suggesting the best habitat. The chironomid community in this site cluster was dominated by predatory species, possibly resulting from high concentrations of heavy metals at some sites. Densities of all major taxonomic groups increased significantly between 1972 and 1999. Decreasing proportions of oligochaetes (0.85 to 0.68) and increasing diversity suggest improved environmental conditions over this period. Evidence suggests that changes in Muskegon Lake's benthic community were more a result of wastewater diversion than Dreissena invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMacroinvertebrates 0amultivariate statistics 0ahistoric changes 0awastewater diversion 0acontaminants 0aArea of Concern1 aNalepa, T.

In this study, we identified and characterized one DAHP synthase encoding gene phzC, which differs from the reported DAHP synthase encoding genes aroF, aroG and aroH in E. coli. PhzC accounts for approximately 90% of the total DAHP synthase activities in P. chlororaphis HT66 and plays the most critical role in four DAHP synthases in the shikimate pathway. Inactivation of phzC resulted in the reduction of PCN production by more than 90%, while the absence of genes aroF, aroG and aroH reduced PCN yield by less than 15%, and the production of PCN was restored after the complementation of gene phzC. Moreover, the results showed that phzC in P. chlororaphis HT66 is not sensitive to feedback inhibition. This study demonstrated that gene phzC is essential for PCN biosynthesis.

The dominant constituents assessed in the essential oil of E. maritimum were germacrene D (45.2%) in the fruits; hexadecanoic acid (18.5%), menthol (16.8%), and menthone (10.9%) in the roots; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) and germacrene D (10.5%) in the leaves; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) in the shoot culture. In the case of E. alpinum, the main components of the leaf oil were: β-elemenone (10.3%), germacrone (5.8%), two selinadienes (7.1% and 6.7%), and 1,8-cineole (5.3%), which were not found in the oil from shoot culture, whereas the shoot culture oil was dominated by hexadecanoic acid (15.5%), spathulenol (7.5%), (E)-β-farnesene (4.9%), germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1α-ol (4.7%), and falcarinol (4.3%). The essential oils obtained from E. maritimum fruits and leaves of the intact plants, measured by the broth microdilution method, were the most active against T. mentagophytes and S. aureus. Moreover, the essential oil of leaves had the moderate activity against C. albicans and E. coli. The results showed that the chemical compositions of the essential oils differed decidedly between the two studied species and between the organs. Furthermore, the essential oil of E. maritimum may play an important role as antimicrobial agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aEryngium alpinum 3aEryngium maritimum 3aEscherichia coli 3aanti-infective agents 3achemical composition 3acineole 3aendangered species 3aessential oils 3afruits 3agermacrene 3ahydrodistillation 3aleaves 3amenthol 3amenthone 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoils 3apalmitic acid 3aroots 3aspathulenol1 aKalemba, Danuta 1 aDlugaszewska, Jolanta 1 aThiem, Barbara 0 tPlants.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90404173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162300001600280520119300296592002801489650001201517650002401529650002501553650002301578650002501601650001901626650000901645650001701654650001401671650001001685650001201695650000901707650000701716650001301723650001101736650001101747650003701758653002801795653001801823653001401841653003001855700002001885700002301905700002101928773009601949856008302045852000902128655001202137IND60479761220221119180556.0160123e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047976122DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.35.2006.3.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarga, Zs.10aDevelopment of Therapeutic kefir-like products with low galactose content for patients with galactose intolerance  ap. 295-304.  aGalactosaemia is a rare, life-threatening inborn error. It is treated by life-long galactose restriction. People with galactose intolerance cannot consume milk and milk products. The aim of this work was to produce fermented milk products with low galactose content. Lactose hydrolysed milk and two types of mixture of lactose hydrolysed milk supplemented with galactose free nutriments (Pregomin and Nutrilon) were fermented in a 2:1 ratio. For fermentation traditional kefir culture (Lactococcus lactis sp. lactis + Lactococcus lactis sp. cremoris + Lactobacillus casei + Lactobacillus kefir + Candida kefir) was used. Number of viable cells, pH and galactose level were measured. Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance and t-test. Level of galactose reduction was measured by UV spectrometry for the determination of lactose and D-galactose in foodstuffs (Boehringer Mannheim enzyme test). Galactose content was below 200 mg/100 cm3 in the mixtures of lactose hydrolysed milk and galactose free nutriments after 48 h of fermentation. So, the kefir-like products based on mixed milk with nutriments are suitable for use in the diet of patients suffering from galactosaemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus kefiri 3aLactococcus lactis 3aanalysis of variance 3acell viability 3adiet 3afermentation 3agalactose 3akefir 3alactose 3amilk 3apH 3apatients 3apeople 3at-test 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0afermented dairy product 0agalactosaemia 0agalactose 0agalactose free nutriments1 aPálvölgyi, M.1 aJuhász-Román, M.1 aTóth-Markus, M.0 tActa alimentaria.g2006 Sept. 1, v. 35, no. 3 p.295-304dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.35.2006.3.73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011000161520272000271592002802991650001503019650001403034650002203048650002003070650000903090650001703099650001803116650001603134650003303150650001403183650001803197650002603215700002503241700002803266700002603294700002303320700001703343773012703360856007403487852000903561655001203570IND60652948420221120083428.0190713e20190430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065294842DNAL7 a10.3390/su110925172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhilis, Gaspard 10aComparing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Salmonid Aquaculture Production Systems: Status and Perspectives  aAquaculture is the fastest growing food sector worldwide, mostly driven by a steadily increasing protein demand. In response to growing ecological concerns, life cycle assessment (LCA) emerged as a key environmental tool to measure the impacts of various production systems, including aquaculture. In this review, we focused on farmed salmonids to perform an in-depth analysis, investigating methodologies and comparing results of LCA studies of this finfish family in relation to species and production technologies. Identifying the environmental strengths and weaknesses of salmonid production technologies is central to ensure that industrial actors and policymakers make informed choices to take the production of this important marine livestock to a more sustainable path. Three critical aspects of salmonid LCAs were studied based on 24 articles and reports: (1) Methodological application, (2) construction of inventories, and (3) comparison of production technologies across studies. Our first assessment provides an overview and compares important methodological choices. The second analysis maps the main foreground and background data sources, as well as the state of process inclusion and exclusion. In the third section, a first attempt to compare life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) data across production technologies was conducted using a single factor statistical protocol. Overall, findings suggested a lack of methodological completeness and reporting in the literature and demonstrated that inventories suffered from incomplete description and partial disclosure. Our attempt to compare LCA results across studies was challenging due to confounding factors and poor data availability, but useful as a first step in highlighting the importance of production technology for salmonids. In groups where the data was robust enough for statistical comparison, both differences and mean equalities were identified, allowing ranking of technology clusters based on their average scores. We statistically demonstrated that sea-based systems outperform land-based technology in terms of energy demand and that sea-based systems have a generally higher FCR than land-based ones. Cross-study analytics also strongly suggest that open systems generate on average more eutrophying emissions than closed designs. We further discuss how to overcome bottlenecks currently hampering such LCA meta-analysis. Arguments are made in favor of further developing cross-study LCA analysis, particularly by increasing the number of salmonid LCA available (to improve sample sizes) and by reforming in-depth LCA practices to enable full reproducibility and greater access to inventory data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish culture 3afood industry 3ainventories 3alife cycle impact assessment 3alivestock 3ameta-analysis 3aproduction technology1 aZiegler, Friederike 1 aGansel, Lars  Christian1 aJansen, Mona  Dverdal1 aGracey, Erik  Olav1 aStene, Anne 0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 30, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110925173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010600163520147800269592002801747650001501775650001101790650001701801650001601818650002201834650001101856700001701867773012101884856008002005852000902085655001202094IND60763408220221116204349.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076340822DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110100872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeys, Kamryn 10aIdentifying Blunt Force Traumatic Injury on Thermally Altered Remains: A Pilot Study Using Sus scrofa  aIn forensic scenarios involving homicide, human remains are often exposed to fire as a means of disposal and/or obscuring identity. Burning human remains can result in the concealment of traumatic injury, the creation of artifacts resembling injury, or the destruction of preexisting trauma. Since fire exposure can greatly influence trauma preservation, methods to differentiate trauma signatures from burning artifacts are necessary to conduct forensic analyses. Specifically, in the field of forensic anthropology, criteria to distinguish trauma from fire signatures on bone is inconsistent and sparse. This study aims to supplement current forensic anthropological literature by identifying criteria found to be the most diagnostic of fire damage or blunt force trauma. Using the skulls of 11 adult pigs (Sus scrofa), blunt force trauma was manually produced using a crowbar and flat-faced hammer. Three specimens received no impacts and were utilized as controls. All skulls were relocated to an outdoor, open-air fire where they were burned until a calcined state was achieved across all samples. Results from this experiment found that blunt force trauma signatures remained after burning and were identifiable in all samples where reassociation of fragments was possible. This study concludes that distinct patterns attributed to thermal fractures and blunt force fractures are identifiable, allowing for diagnostic criteria to be narrowed down for future analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aadults 3aanthropology 3afire damage 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans1 aRoss, Ann H.0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245017500190300001600365520156600381592002801947653001801975653001401993653001202007653002702019653001302046700002602059700002502085700002802110700001702138700002902155773014102184856011502325852000902440655001202449IND60128235620221118132814.0151115e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823562DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[657:SHATGD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilhelm, Steven W.10aSeasonal Hypoxia and the Genetic Diversity of Prokaryote Populations in the Central Basin Hypolimnion of Lake Erie: Evidence for Abundant Cyanobacteria and Photosynthesis  ap. 657-671.  aThe reoccurring region of seasonal hypoxia in the central basin of Lake Erie (““the dead zone””) has been of significant interest to researchers over the past several years. Surprisingly however, no efforts to characterize the endemic microbial community, responsible for the consumption of oxygen in this system, have been published. To understand how the microbial community may be interacting with this event, we have begun to characterize microbial members by using molecular tools. Phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacteria appear abundant and active in a narrow region (∼∼ 1.5 m) below the thermocline during hypoxic conditions, reaching abundances of greater than 10⁵mL⁻⁻¹and being the primary agent releasing 1.5 mg O₂ L⁻⁻¹above the daytime demands in this region. Sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicons, generated with universal eubacterial primer sets, from the Lake Erie's hypolimnion during seasonal oxygen depletion demonstrated that cyanobacteria, most closely related to phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus spp., dominate during rapid drawdown of oxygen (0.083 mg L⁻⁻¹d⁻⁻¹in 2004) in this region. Analyses of another conserved marker of phylogeny (RuBisCO) has been used to confirm the presence of these cell types. Numerous distinct taxa of heterotrophic bacteria are also represented in the 16S library. The results of this study suggest that novel groups of cyanobacteria may persist within the Lake Erie dead zone during hypoxic conditions and, along with the heterotrophic community, strongly influence system geochemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSynechococcus 0adead zone 0ahypoxia 0amolecular microbiology 0abacteria1 aBullerjahn, George S.1 aEldridge, Melanie L.1 aRinta-Kanto, Johanna M.1 aPoorvin, Leo1 aBourbonniere, Richard A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2006 Dec., v. 32, no. 4 p.657-671dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282006%2932%5B657%3ASHATGD%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006800142245007900210500002000289520167800309592002801987596014202015596003002157596006402187596003902251596001902290596002502309596003102334596002602365650001202391650001902403650001602422650001202438650000902450650001702459650001302476650000902489650001002498700003102508700005902539700006302598773013002661856007702791852000902868655001202877IND60788191220221117233415.0220811e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078819122DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0287452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Mohammadjavad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6394-216710aSubsurface Migration of Methane From Oil Sands Thermal Recovery Operations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSteam injection into oil sands reservoirs for bitumen extraction leads to the in situ generation of gases (mainly methane). Many oil sands formations have permeable cap rocks that may allow these gases to migrate to the overlying formations and pose environmental challenges to the groundwater. We present a detailed analysis of the long‐term fate of the in situ generated gases over the course of thermal oil recovery operations. The impacts of capillary barriers on upward migration of the in situ generated gases are quantified. Our findings reveal that the upward migration of gases over a 100‐year period in formations with continuous flow barriers with a permeability of less than ∼1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m² is negligible. However, for formations with discontinuous flow barriers, the migrated gas can potentially leak to the surface depending on the capillary entry pressure of the preferential pathways (e.g., sand layers). In this case, the upward migration is primarily controlled by high permeability pathways. It was found that the migrated gas is effectively trapped by the residual and dissolution trapping mechanisms, and the gas migration to the overlying formations is prevented or significantly reduced by capillary pressure of sand layers. The results indicate that the migrated gas to the shallow groundwater is primarily comprised of methane and is free of CO₂ and H₂S. These results provide valuable insights into the long‐term fate of these gases in thermal oil recovery operations. They also offer potential opportunities for the development of regulatory frameworks and screening considerations for caprock/seal integrity/risk assessments.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CRSNG)  cSHARP Research Consortium  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cCanadian Natural Resources Limited  cCenovus Energy  cImperial Oil Limited  cSuncor Energy Incorporated  cUniversity of Calgary 3abitumen 3acarbon dioxide 3agroundwater 3amethane 3aoils 3apermeability 3aresearch 3arisk 3asteam1 aJafari Raad, Seyed Mostafa1 aZirrahi, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9228-19941 aHassanzadeh, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3029-65300 tWater resources research.g2021 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.e2020WR028745-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0287453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245010400129300001600233520096400249592002801213650002701241650002601268650003001294650003001324650001301354650001501367650002001382650001301402650001201415650001301427651001001440653001501450653002101465653002001486653001101506653002101517700001301538700001801551700002501569773019601594852000901790655001201799IND60706285720221118214801.0201224e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070628572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, D.K.10aImpact of Information and Communication Technologies on Agricultural Education: Users ’Perception  ap. 299-304.  aThis article reports the impacts of technology integration on teaching and learning from a study that examines the impact of ICT deployment in higher learning institutions in agricultural sciences of North Eastern Hill States of India. The survey data were drawn from 463 respondents (students and teachers). The study finds impacts of ICT in teaching and learning such as-time saving, accuracy and ease in exchange of ideas, research works, professional attainment and updation of knowledge. There appears to be general consensus that both teachers and students feel ICT use greatly contributes to student motivation for learning. However, security, privacy, social problems, lack of innovation & creativity and time wastage were also perceived by the respondents as challenges with integration of ICT in education. Authors argue that users must exercise utmost care and discretion is using ICT tools so as to maximize its benefits in agricultural education.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural education 3aagricultural sciences 3acommunications technology 3ainformation dissemination 3alearning 3amotivation 3asocial problems 3astudents 3asurveys 3ateachers 3aIndia 0ae-Learning 0aHigher education 0aICT integration 0aImpact 0aNorth-East India1 aDe, H.K.1 aGeetarani, L.1 aSingh, N.

Alternative splicing of cTnT exon 5 is developmentally regulated. cTnT isoforms containing exon 5 are expressed in the fetal and neonatal heart but not in the mature heart. SRp55 is an essential splicing factor involved in cTnT exon 5 splicing and it is phosphorylated by Dyrk1A (dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A). In the present study, we found Dyrk1A interacted with SRp55 and enhanced its promotion of cTnT exon 5 inclusion. The shift from cTnT exon 5 inclusion to exclusion during development was delayed in the heart of Ts65Dn mice due to Dyrk1A overexpression. These results provide new insight into the role of Dyrk1A in the neonatal cardiac development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3atroponin T 3atyrosine 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3aheart 3aexons 0aCardiac troponin T 0aExon 5 0agenes 0aAlternative splicing 0aDyrk1A1 aYin, Xiaomin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 May 13, v. 473 p.993-998dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245007100161300001600232520192000248592002802168650001002196650001902206650002202225650001702247650001002264650001102274650001502285650001202300650001002312650001702322650001902339650001202358650001302370650001002383650001602393651001802409651001102427700002102438700001802459700002102477700002602498700001802524773014102542856007202683852000902755655001202764IND60661865120221119095318.0190904e20040204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186512DNAL7 a10.1039/b311662j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerge, John Arthur10aOrganotins in marine mammals and seabirds from Norwegian territory  ap. 108-112.  aAn increasing number of studies indicate that marine mammals and some seabirds are exposed to organotins. However, results from northern and Arctic areas are few. Here results from analysis of tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), monobutyltin (MBT), triphenyltin (TPhT), diphenyltin (DPhT) and monophenyltin (MPhT) in harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), common seal (Phoca vitulina), ringed seal (Phoca hispida) and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) from Norwegian territory are presented. Relatively high concentrations of DBT, TBT and MBT were observed in muscle, kidney and liver from harbour porpoises caught in northern Norway in 1988, just before restrictions on the use of tributyltin (TBT) (mainly on small boats) were introduced in several European countries. The concentrations in harbour porpoise muscle tissue were reduced significantly 11 years later, possibly as a result of the introduced restrictions. Considerably lower concentrations of butyltins were observed in the seals compared to porpoises. The lowest levels of organotins were found in ringed seals from Spitsbergen, where only traces of dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT) were observed. Traces of DBT and MBT were also found in some individual glaucous gulls from Bear Island. The sum of the degradation products MBT and DBT in liver samples from all analysed species were generally higher than TBT itself. Triphenyltin (TPhT) was observed in all porpoise samples and in livers of common seals. Also the sum of the degradation products MPhT and DPhT in liver samples from porpoise and common seals were higher than TPhT. No traces of phenyltins were found in ringed seals from Spitsbergen or in glaucous gulls from Bear Island. The limited data available indicate low to moderate exposure to organotins in northern areas (Spitsbergen and Bear Island). Marine mammals are however more exposed further south along the Norwegian Coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus 3aPhoca vitulina 3aPhocoena phocoena 3aPusa hispida 3aboats 3acoasts 3adibutyltin 3akidneys 3aliver 3amonobutyltin 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3aseabirds 3aseals 3atributyltin 3aArctic region 3aNorway1 aBrevik, Einar M.1 aBjørge, Arne1 aFølsvik, Norunn1 aGabrielsen, Geir Wing1 aWolkers, Hans0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Feb. 4, v. 6, no. 2 p.108-112dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b311662j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245011100163300001400274520218600288592002802474650001502502650001202517650000802529650002302537650002202560650001302582650001202595650001702607650002102624650001002645650001402655650001302669700002002682773013902702856007202841852000902913655001202922IND60661865220221119095222.0190904e20040107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186522DNAL7 a10.1039/b311869j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamilton, Richard P.10aEvaluation of method of preparation of passive diffusion tubes for measurement of ambient nitrogen dioxide  ap. 12-17.  aThis study was carried out in response to suggestions that the measurement of NO₂ by Palmes-type passive diffusion tubes (PDT) is affected by the method of preparation of the triethanolamine (TEA) absorbent coating on the grids. The following combinations of factors were investigated: TEA solvent (acetone or water), volume composition of TEA in solvent (50% or 20%), and grid coating method (dipping in solution prior to assembly or pipetting solution on after assembly). Duplicate PDTs prepared by each of the 8 methods were exposed in parallel, in urban air, for a total of 80 separate 1 week exposures. NO₂ concentrations derived from PDTs prepared by pipetting methods were significantly less precise than concentrations from dipping methods, with mean RSDs for duplicate measurements of 13.8% and 8.5%, respectively (n = 316 each category). Pipetting methods using solutions of 50% TEA composition were particularly imprecise (mean RSD 17.2%). Data from PDTs prepared by pipetting methods were systematically more poorly correlated with each other and with data from co-located chemiluminescence analysers, than corresponding data from PDTs prepared by dipping methods, indicating that more consistent accuracy was also obtained by the latter PDTs. The statistical evidence suggested that PDTs prepared by pipetting 50% TEA in water generally gave lower NO₂ concentrations. Although this is in agreement with a previous study, it is also possible that such an observation here may be a statistical artefact given the demonstrably poorer precision of this method. The general tendency of PDTs to show positive bias in NO₂ measurement in urban air in 1 week exposures was again evident in this study (mean biases at roadside and urban centre locations of +35% (n = 475) and +18% (n = 112), respectively) consistent with augmentation of within-tube NO₂ flux by chemical reaction between co-diffusing NO and O₃. Overall, it is recommended that the pipetting method of PDT grid preparation is avoided, or at least investigated further, because of the apparent degradation in precision and accuracy of NO₂ measurement. Potential reasons for the effect are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aacetone 3aair 3achemical reactions 3achemiluminescence 3acoatings 3adipping 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aroadsides 3asolvents1 aHeal, Mathew R.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Jan. 7, v. 6, no. 1 p.12-17dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b311869j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012900158300002000287520133200307592002801639650001501667650001001682650001301692650001401705650002201719650001501741650001901756650001601775650001801791700002001809700001501829700002201844700002501866700001901891773014301910856007502053852000902128655001202137IND60755639320221119232007.0211105e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075563932DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta05011g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorizet, Yann10aImmobilization of ¹²⁹I in nuclear waste glass matrixes synthesized under high-pressure conditions: an experimental study  ap. 23902-23915.  aThere is major environmental interest in finding a sustainable solution to immobilize ¹²⁹I, a by-product of the nuclear industry. The use of aluminoborosilicate glasses represents a good compromise. However, this solution does not appear adequate for ¹²⁹I owing to its volatility at high temperature during the vitrification process. In the present work, we use a high-pressure (1.5 GPa) apparatus to synthesize I-rich aluminoborosilicate glasses. We show that the use of high-pressure conditions enhances the I solubility in glasses by several orders of magnitude as compared to 1 bar synthesis, with I solubility up to 5.7 mol%. We observed that I is more solubilized in Na-rich as compared to Ca-rich glass. Investigation of the I speciation using XPS also reveals that I solubility in glasses is much higher as I dissolves as I⁵⁺ in comparison to I⁻. Our work shows that using high-pressure appears to be a reliable solution for dissolving a large quantity of I within the structure of aluminoborosilicate glasses for the conditioning of nuclear waste. We also demonstrate that the oxidized I waste form should be employed to greatly increase I solubility in nuclear waste glasses. Therefore, it represents a potential pathway for solving the immobilization of ¹²⁹I produced by anthropic nuclear activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3aglass 3aindustry 3aoxidation 3aradioactive waste 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3avitrification1 aHamon, Jonathan1 aLa, Carole1 aJolivet, Valentin1 aSuzuki-Muresan, Tomo1 aParis, Michael0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Nov. 2, v. 9, no. 42 p.23902-23915dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta05011g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010400164520165500268592002801923650001401951650002001965650001901985650001702004650002002021650001402041650002002055650003002075650001402105650002402119650001602143651001802159700003102177700003302208700002102241700003702262700002202299700002302321700002402344700003502368700002602403700002902429700001702458773012402475856007402599852000902673655001202682IND60794140520221116221822.0220922e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079414052DNAL7 a10.3390/d140907572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStandring, Samantha 10aEvolution and Biogeographic History of Rubyspot Damselflies (Hetaerininae: Calopterygidae: Odonata)  aThe damselflies Hetaerininae, a subfamily of Calopterygidae, comprise four genera distributed from North to South America: Hetaerina, Mnesarete, Ormenophlebia and Bryoplathanon. While several studies have focused on the intriguing behavioral and morphological modifications within Hetaerina, little of the evolutionary history of the group is well understood. Understanding the biogeographical history of Hetaerininae is further complicated by uncertainty in important geological events, such as the closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS). We generated a phylogenetic hypothesis to test the relationships and divergence times within Hetaerininae using IQtree and BEAST2 and found that Mnesarete and Ormenophlebia render Hetaerina paraphyletic. Reclassification of the genera within Hetaerininae is necessary based on our results. We also tested the fit to our dataset of two different hypotheses for the closure of CAS. Our results supported a gradual closure, starting in the Oligocene and ending in the Pliocene. Using Ancestral Character State Reconstruction, we found that the rubyspot, which is associated with higher fecundity in several species, was ancestral for Hetaerininae and subsequently lost four times. Estimates of diversification in association with the rubyspot are needed to understand the plasticity of this important character. Forest habitat was the ancestral state for Hetaerininae, with transitions to generalist species of Hetaerina found primarily in the Mesoamerican region. These results add to our understanding of the relationship between morphology, biogeography and habitat in a charismatic group of damselflies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHetaerina 3aOligocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3afecundity 3aforest habitats 3ageographical distribution 3aparaphyly 3ataxonomic revisions 3auncertainty 3aSouth America1 aSánchez-Herrera, Melissa 1 aGuillermo-Ferreira, Rhainer 1 aWare, Jessica L.1 aVega-Sánchez, Yesenia Margarita1 aClement, Rebecca 1 aDrury, Jonathan P.1 aGrether, Gregory F.1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, Antonio 1 aMendoza-Cuenca, Luis 1 aBota-Sierra, Cornelio A.1 aBybee, Seth 0 tDiversity.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d140907573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158300001800264500001900282520105100301592002801352650002201380650001901402650001301421650001401434650001701448650002201465650001601487700002701503700001801530700001601548773012201564856007401686852000901760655001201769IND60681009620221123005047.0200113e20200107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068100962DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09460a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Neeru10aFabrication of LaFeO₃ and rGO-LaFeO₃ microspheres based gas sensors for detection of NO₂ and CO  ap. 1297-1308.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present report, gas sensing devices based on LaFeO₃ and rGO-LaFeO₃ were fabricated by a photolithography technique. The X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra and FT-IR results confirm the formation of a perovskite phase and composite. XPS and TEM give the chemical compositions for both products. The higher roughness, greater surface area (62.1 m² g⁻¹), larger pore size (16.4 nm) and lower band gap (1.94 eV) of rGO-LaFeO₃ make it a suitable candidate to obtain high sensitivity. The gas sensing performance of the devices was investigated for various concentrations of NO₂ and CO gases at temperatures of 200 and 250 °C. It was observed that the rGO-LaFeO₃ based device exhibited a high relative response (183.4%) for a 3 ppm concentration of NO₂ at a 250 °C operating temperature. This higher response is attributed to the large surface area, greater surface roughness, and numerous active sites of rGO-LaFeO₃. The gas sensing properties investigated show that rGO-LaFeO₃ is an excellent candidate for an NO₂ sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3amicroparticles 3aporosity 3aroughness 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3atemperature1 aKushwaha, Himmat Singh1 aSharma, S.

However, investigating the ATP-sensitive P2X1 platelet receptor is difficult due to its rapid desensitization in the washed platelet sample matrix. To minimize desensitization, most studies involving P2X1 activity in washed platelets require apyrase in the sample to reduce matrix ATP levels. Unfortunately, the apyrase will also rapidly degrade any ATP added exogenously during the studies. Here, we describe a method that employs the reported P2X1 inhibitor NF449 to sensitize washed platelets in the absence of any added apyrase. Sensitization is verified by spectrofluorometric determination of Ca²⁺ entry into the platelets after stimulation with concentrations of ATP ranging from 0.625 μM to 5 μM. Results suggest that sensitization of the P2X1 receptor by NF449 is not necessarily dependent upon the inhibitor concentration, but rather the ratio of the inhibitor to exogenously-added ATP concentrations. With a ratio of ATP agonist to NF440 concentration of ∼5 : 1, the resulting percent change in fluorescence due to Ca²⁺ entry into the platelet is 39.3 ± 0.8%; however, at a ratio of 1 : 8 ATP to NF449 the percent change is reduced to 13.1 ± 2.2%. The sensitizing effect is also investigated as a function of time. The results obtained verify that NF449 can behave as a concentration-dependent inhibitor and sensitizer of the platelet P2X1 receptor in washed platelet samples, depending on the ATP concentration in the matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aagonists 3aanalytical methods 3aapyrase 3ablood platelets 3acalcium 3afluorescence 3apurinergic receptors1 aKarunarathne, Welivitiya1 aSpence, Dana M.0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 4, no. 1 p.101-105dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ay05530e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011400159520162200273592002801895650001401923650001701937650001401954650001401968650001401982650001501996650001702011650001702028650002902045650001502074650002002089650001702109650001802126650002002144650001802164650001302182650001402195650002102209650001502230650000902245650002802254650001602282650001502298700001802313700001802331700002002349700001802369700001802387700001302405773012402418856007402542852000902616655001202625IND60794140620221116222138.0220922e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079414062DNAL7 a10.3390/d140907562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Xiaodong 10aProtective Effects of Theaflavins and Epigallocatechin Gallate against ZnO-NP-Induced Cell Apoptosis In Vitro  aZinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are commonly used in various commercial applications, causing toxic effects on organisms and destroying biodiversity, but information about their protective approaches remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of theaflavins (TFs) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against ZnO-NP-induced cytotoxicity in rat tracheal epithelial (RTE) cells. Herein, RTE cells were exposed to 100 μg/L ZnO-NPs for 12 h, then treated with 0, 10, 100, and 1000 μg/L TFs or EGCG for another 12 h; subsequently, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis analyses were conducted. Relative to the control groups, TFs and EGCG treatment significantly inhibited the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content. Exposure to 1000 μg/L TFs or EGCG treatment downregulated cytochrome C gene expression levels by 59.10% and 77.27%; Caspase 3 gene expression by 50.03% and 60.01%; Caspase 8 gene expression by 45.11% and 55.57%; and Caspase 9 gene expression by 51.33% and 66.67%, respectively. Meanwhile, interleukin 1β and interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and the other inflammatory chemokines such as C-C motif chemokine 2 and C-X-C motif chemokine 8 expression were all gradually rescued after the addition of TFs or EGCG. These results imply that TFs or EGCG possibly ameliorated ZnO-NPs-induced toxicity through antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study provides novel approaches which mitigate the emerging nanoparticle pollutant toxicity in organisms, which may potentially slow down the destruction of biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiodiversity 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3achemokines 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3amalondialdehyde 3ananoparticles 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3atheaflavins 3azinc oxide1 aChen, Feifei 1 aLin, Huikang 1 aZhang, Hangjun 1 aZhong, Yuchi 1 aLiu, Zhiquan 1 aLi, Yan 0 tDiversity.g2022 Sept. 14, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d140907563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245017100171300001200342520137600354592002801730596007301758650001601831650002301847650001201870650002301882650001301905650000701918650003301925650001601958650001901974650001601993650002102009650001102030700002102041700002802062700003602090700006902126773011802195856008302313852000902396655001202405IND60792625120221120210409.0220923e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079262512DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-022-03322-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbertini, Jessica10aPhosphate solubilization and indole acetic acid production by rhizosphere yeast Torulaspora globosa: improvement of culture conditions for better performance in vitro  ap. 262.  aThe rhizosphere yeast Torulaspora globosa is known to produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and to solubilize minerals. Due to the prospective use of this yeast as a biostimulant for agricultural applications, this work aimed to optimize the cultural conditions for both IAA production and phosphate solubilization. For phosphate solubilization, the temperature (20, 25 and 30 °C), initial medium pH (3.0, 5.0, and 7.0), and shaker speed (without mixing, 100 rpm, 150 rpm, and 200 rpm) were considered using the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) design. Temperature of 25 °C, initial medium pH 7.0, and static cultures were the conditions of greatest phosphate solubilization, with 40% of the total phosphorus content solubilized from calcium phosphate (419.86 mg L⁻¹) after 48 h. By using the response surface methodology, the maximum IAA production (217.73 µg mL⁻¹) was obtained with the highest initial pH 7.0, the lowest nitrogen, and glucose concentrations (5 g L⁻¹ and 10 g L⁻¹, respectively) and the lowest agitator speed (100 rpm). Further tests indicated that nitrogen affected significantly IAA production and the absence of nitrogen in the medium promoted higher IAA production (457 µg mL⁻¹). The results obtained here may contribute to the scaling up for industrial and agricultural applications of a yeast-based product with T. globosa.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aTorulaspora 3acalcium phosphates 3aglucose 3aindole acetic acid 3anitrogen 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3arhizosphere 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3atotal phosphorus 3ayeasts1 aRocha, Renata K.1 aBastos, Reinaldo Gaspar1 aCeccato-Antonini, Sandra Regina1 aRosa-Magri, Márcia Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3541-12400 t3 Biotech.g2022 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.262-262dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-022-03322-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011400176300001600290520149800306592002801804650001201832650002701844650001101871650001201882650000901894650001201903650001501915650001001930650001501940650001601955650001801971650000901989650001901998650001202017653002102029653001002050653000802060653001802068773009702086856008902183852000902272655001202281IND60688612720200616000000.0200429e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068861272DNAL7 a10.2752/175303714X140239227978692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Bradley P.10aLiving with Wild Dogs: Personality Dimensions in Captive Dingoes (Canis dingo) and Implications for Ownership  ap. 423-433.  aDespite the commonly held belief that wild canines do not make “good” household companions, many people choose to live with them. The aim of the present study was to investigate owner-rated personality in a population of dingoes living as companion animals. Owners recruited from a registered dingo organization assessed the personality of 40 dingoes using the Monash Canine Personality Questionnaire- Revised (MCPQ-R). The dingoes (22 female; 18 male) ranged in age from 6 months to 11 years (M = 3.6 years, SD = 2.4); weighed an average of 19.07 kg (SD = 3.41); were mostly entire (i.e., not de-sexed or spayed or neutered; 62.5%) and lived in multiple dingo households (72.5%). Results show that dingoes were rated significantly higher than domestic dogs (n = 455; various breeds from a previous Australian study) for the dimension Motivation/Self-Assuredness (p < 0.001), and significantly lower than dogs for Training Focus (p < 0.001). Many of the personality traits of dingoes reside outside what is considered “ideal” characteristics important for a successful and rewarding dog–owner relationship. It is possible that dingo personality rests within the realms of what is “acceptable” pet canine behavior, at least for some owners, and that they may have adjusted their perception and attitudes to meet their expectations of the species. Motivations for dingo ownership and the applicability of using a domestic dog personality questionnaire on wild canids are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanidae 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreeds 3adingoes 3adogs 3afemales 3ahouseholds 3amales 3amotivation 3apersonality 3apet ownership 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3aspaying 0acompanion animal 0adingo 0adog 0adomestication0 tAnthrozoös.g2014 Sept. 1, v. 27, no. 3 p.423-433dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2752/175303714X140239227978693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011100169300001600280500002000296520223700316592002802553596004002581650001602621650006002637650001102697650002902708650002302737650002402760650001202784650001202796650003102808650001302839650001002852650001202862650001502874650001402889650001202903650001202915650001302927650001102940651001002951651001302961700002702974700002703001700001803028773013003046856008303176852000903259655001203268IND60130824920221122010032.0220424e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013082492DNAL7 a10.2981/0909-6396-14.4.4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaczensky, Petra14aThe Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia ‐ refuge or sink for wolves Canis lupus in the Gobi  ap. 444-456.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Mongolian hunting law does not mention the wolf Canis lupus, which is generally interpreted in the way that wolves can be hunted anytime and anywhere, including in protected areas. We investigated whether the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area (SPA), a strict nature reserve in southwestern Mongolia, acts as a refuge or a sink for wolves in the Gobi. Our expectations were that wolves in the Gobi 1) have large ranges similar to those in other equally unproductive habitats, 2) experience a high hunting pressure, and 3) have recently become an important export item for cross‐border trade to China. We combined GPS positions of two adult wolves, wolf harvest data and a market survey on wildlife products to address the above questions. Range use of the two collared wolves was huge, but varied widely between the two animals (6,670 km² for an adult female and 26,619 km² for an adult male) and over time. Reproductive status and residency status were only known during the initial 8‐months monitoring period of the female. During this ‘resident’ period her range size was 1,275 km². Both wolves showed a clear preference of mountainous terrain over flat steppe, suggesting that only 21% of the SPA constitute preferred wolf habitat. Annual harvest in the park and its vicinity averaged 1 wolf/265 km² in 2002/03, 1 wolf/120 km² in 2003/04 and 1 wolf/310 km² in 2004/05. However, hunting pressure was unequally distributed and particularly high in the northeastern corner of the park. During the active monitoring period of wolf F1, 35 wolves were killed within her ‘resident’ range, suggesting a high hunting pressure. Most wolves were shot from motorised vehicles, possibly explaining the preference of wolves for mountainous terrain which is inaccessible for vehicles. The market surveys revealed products from ∼2,000 wolves on the two border markets, a huge discrepancy to only 150 CITES permits officially issued annually. Although our data are insufficient to allow a truly quantitative assessment of the impact of human induced mortality on wolf conservation status in the Great Gobi B SPA, it points towards a potentially severe conservation problem requiring further attention.  aPublisher supplied data  aP14992cAustrian Science Foundation 3aCanis lupus 3aConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aconservation areas 3aconservation status 3aexports 3afemales 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitats 3amales 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3amortality 3asteppes 3asurveys 3awildlife 3awolves 3aChina 3aMongolia1 aĖnkhsaĭkhan, Namtar,1 aGanbaatar, Oyunsaikhan1 aWalzer, Chris0 tWildlife biology.g2008 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.444-456dNordic Board for Wildlife ResearchwJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/0909-6396-14.4.4443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019100159300002000350520167100370592002802041650001102069650001502080650003102095650002102126650001502147650001102162650001902173650001002192650001702202650001402219650001502233650001402248700002602262700002202288700001502310773014302325856007502468852000902543655001202552IND60755639620221119231913.0211105e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075563962DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta06209c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcharya, Jiwan10aConstruction of self-supported bimetallic MOF-mediated hollow and porous tri-metallic selenide nanosheet arrays as battery-type electrodes for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors  ap. 23977-23993.  aThe meticulous architecture of novel materials, integrating a rationally constructed highly conductive polyphase transition metal selenide with a carbonaceous nanostructure onto a 3D substrate has been acknowledging the challenging but appealing strategies for the development of auspicious electrode materials for energy storage devices. In this work, for the first time, hollow and porous nickel–zinc–cobalt selenide (Ni–Zn–Co–Se) nanosheet arrays were designated onto a chemically reduced rGO embellished Ni foam (rGO/NF) via a self-sacrificing template, ion exchange and selenization affair, where a Zn–Co-organic framework acts as a template. Ameliorating from the unique porous and hollow nanoarchitecture, the Ni–Zn–Co–Se@rGO/NF electrode tenders sheer electroactive sites, ample accessible territories for facile insertion of electrolytes and curtailed ion diffusion subways, reflecting the superlative electrochemical properties, in terms of an exceptional specific capacity of 464.4 mA h g⁻¹, an admirable rate performance of 68.9% and a remarkable cyclic life span of 93.24% after 7000 cycles in a three-electrode assembly for supercapacitors. To demonstrate the practical applicability, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was assembled using Ni–Zn–Co–Se@rGO/NF and metal–organic framework-derived hollow porous carbon (MDHPC) as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. The as-sandwiched Ni–Zn–Co–Se@rGO/NF//MDHPC ASC device exhibited a high energy density of 74.6 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 796.91 W kg⁻¹ with a remarkable durability of 96.4% after 7000 successive charge–discharge cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adurability 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afoams 3aion exchange 3alongevity 3ananosheets 3aselenides1 aOjha, Gunendra Prasad1 aPant, Bishweshwar1 aPark, Mira0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Nov. 2, v. 9, no. 42 p.23977-23993dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta06209c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245015200161300002000313500001900333520166900352592002802021650001902049650001502068650001402083650001402097650002202111650001302133650001202146650001202158650001302170650002102183650001902204650002702223650001702250650001302267700001802280700001402298700005802312700005402370700005402424700005302478700001802531773017202549856008002721852000902801655001202810IND60699363320221118003454.0200617e20200522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069936332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c007502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Miao10aAluminous ZSM-48 Zeolite Synthesis Using a Hydroisomerization Intermediate Mimicking Allyltrimethylammonium Chloride as a Structure-Directing Agent  ap. 11139-11148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aManipulation of zeolite composition through judicious choice of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) is essential to regulate its physicochemical properties. ZSM-48 is a unidimensional zeolite that often crystallizes into siliceous form, and direct synthesis of the aluminous counterpart using low-cost OSDAs is thus far a bottleneck that has obstructed its deployment in large-scale implementation. This work shows the use of a specific OSDA, allyltrimethylammonium chloride, which structurally mimics the iso-alkyl carbenium ion intermediate found in n-heptane skeletal isomerization, is capable of producing aluminous ZSM-48 with more accessible protonic sites. The specificity of this OSDA is ascribed to the good match of its molecular size and shape to the microchannel geometry of the structure and its rigidity endowed by the presence of the CH═CH₂ moiety. The obtained material (a Si/Al ratio of ca. 23.0) possesses more medium-to-strong Bronsted acid sites (by a factor of 1.36) and enhanced diffusion property (12 times) with respect to a control sample (Si/Al of ca. 26.7) derived from an expensive, often used OSDA, pentamethonium bromide, as evidenced by NH₃-IR spectroscopy and gravimetric adsorption uptake measurement using 2-methylhexane as a probe molecule, respectively. The difference in acid site density between the two samples can be ascribed to the influences of OSDA on crystallinity, amount of Al incorporation, and associated Al sitting. A significant increase in isomer yield from 44 to 72% in n-heptane hydroisomerization has been attained using the obtained ZSM-48 as an acid catalyst with respect to the control sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3acrystal structure 3ageometry 3aheptane 3aisomers 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aprocess design 3askeletal isomerization 3aspectroscopy 3azeolites1 aDing, Hongxin1 aZeng, Shu1 aJiang, Jiuxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9664-32351 aXu, Shutao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4722-83711 aLi, Xiujie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2649-46731 aZhu, Kake1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3071-08821 aZhou, Xinggui0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 May 22, v. 59, no. 24 p.11139-11148dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c007503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012100170300001600291520128200307592002801589650001101617650001901628650001201647650001301659650002001672650000801692650001001700650001601710650001601726653002801742653001901770653001601789653001501805653002301820700001501843700001701858773011801875856009001993852000902083655001202092IND50068727920221118091149.0190405e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006872792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsegay, T.10aComparative evaluation of growth and carcass traits of indigenous and crossbred (Dorper×Indigenous) Ethiopian Sheep  ap. 247-252.  aAn experiment was conducted to evaluate growth and carcass traits of indigenous (Blackhead Ogaden [B1] & Hararghe Highland [B2]) and crossbred (Dorper×B1 [B3] & Dorper×B2 [B4]) F1 lambs under different feeding regimens. The feeding regimens constituted feeding hay ad libtum supplemented with 150g/head/day concentrate mix [D1] and hay ad libtum supplemented 350g/head/day concentrate mix [D2]. The experiment was arranged as a 4×2 factorial (4 breeds and 2 levels of nutrition) and laid out completely at random. Hararghe Highland lambs had the highest (P<0.01) TDMI (90.0±1.4), gDM/kgW0.75 compared with B4. Lambs fed D2 had higher TDMI (P<0.0001), TDMI per metabolic body weight (P<0.01) than lambs fed D1. Dorper×Hararghe Highland had greater average daily weight gain (69.4±4.1g), empty body weight, hot (12.9±0.5) and cold carcass weight (12.6±0.5kg) than did both B1 and B2. However, weight loss after chilling was higher (5.7±0.3%) in pure Blackhead Ogaden compared with rest of lamb breeds.This study leads to the conclusion that crossing B2 with Dorper improved feed utilization, growth rate and carcass parameters, but crossing B1 with Dorper provided little benefit since the B1 tend to perform similar to the crosses in some economically important traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorper 3acarcass weight 3acooling 3acrossing 3afeed conversion 3ahay 3alambs 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 0aCarcass characteristics 0aCrossbred lams 0aFeed intake 0aIndigenous 0aLive weight change1 aYoseph, M.1 aMengistu, U.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 Sept., v. 114, no. 2-3 p.247-252dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013700160300002000297500001900317520156100336592002801897650001401925650001601939650003301955650001301988650001902001650001902020650002102039700001302060700001502073700001502088700001902103700001502122700005402137700005502191773017202246856008002418852000902498655001202507IND60699363420221118003410.0200617e20200528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069936342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c008252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tong10aSelf-Reinforced Polypropylene/Graphene Composite with Segregated Structures To Achieve Balanced Electrical and Mechanical Properties  ap. 11206-11218.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConductive polymer composites (CPCs) play an important role in various industrial applications including anti-static materials, electromagnetic interference shielding, sensors, and so forth. However, the contradiction between high conductivity and mechanical properties, especially tensile strength, is hard to balance many CPCs. In this paper, a self-reinforced polypropylene (PP)/graphene composite with segregated structures was fabricated by a novel coating-reducing-pressing method. By controlling the hot-pressing parameters, a special structure consisting of both an interconnected conductive graphene network and an unmolten fiber phase in a PP matrix can be obtained. PP/graphene composites with such a structure showed not only excellent electric properties but also outstanding mechanical properties. A super-low electrical percolation threshold of 0.0043 vol % was reached for the composites because of an effective formation of the conductive graphene network. The conductivity of composites with only 1.85 wt % graphene reached to 4.09 S/m. The composites also showed good electromagnetic shielding effectiveness under an X band with the highest EMI of 29.3 dB at 10 GHz. The existence of the PP fiber phase contributed to the improved mechanical strength and toughness of the self-reinforcing conductive composites compared to the blending samples, which made it even stimuli-responsive for bending deformation. These results were believed helpful in the design and fabrication of a new kind of conductive self-reinforced polymer composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3adeformation 3aelectromagnetic interference 3agraphene 3apolypropylenes 3aprocess design 3atensile strength1 aLuo, Wei1 aLuo, Yinfu1 aWang, Yuan1 aZhou, Shengtai1 aLiang, Mei1 aChen, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1228-32501 aZou, Huawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2411-58950 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 May 28, v. 59, no. 24 p.11206-11218dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c008253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168300001400286520140900300592002801709650002501737650002401762650001901786650001301805650002301818650001701841650001601858650001001874653001301884653003901897653001701936653001401953653002901967653002301996700001202019700001902031700001502050700001502065700001602080700001702096773010302113856008502216852000902301655001202310IND60644165120221120054921.0190613e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064416512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xue-Na10aFormation mechanism of organo-chromium (III) complexes from bioreduction of chromium (VI) by Aeromonas hydrophila  ap. 86-94.  aChromium is a common heavy metal widely present in aquatic environments. Cost-effective remediation of chromium-contaminated environment can be realized by microbial reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The genus Aeromonas species is one of such Cr(VI) reducers, whose reduction mechanism remains unrevealed and the main factors governing the Cr(VI) reduction pathways are unknown yet. In this work, the performances and mechanisms of Cr(VI) anaerobic reduction by Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966 were investigated. This strain exhibited excellent Cr(VI) resistance and could utilize a suite of electron donors to support Cr(VI) bioreduction. The Cr(VI) bioreduction processes involved both extracellular (the metal-reducing and respiratory pathway) and intracellular reaction pathways. Adding anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate or humic acid as a mediator substantially enhanced the Cr(VI) bioreduction. The forms and distribution of the Cr(VI) bioreduction products were affected by the medium composition. Soluble organo-Cr(III) complexes were identified as the main Cr(VI) reduction products when basal salts medium was adopted. Given the environmental ubiquity of the genus Aeromonas, the findings in this work may facilitate a better understanding about the transformation behaviors and fates of Cr(VI) in environments and provide useful clues to tune the bioremediation of chromium-contaminated environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aaquatic environment 3abioremediation 3achromium 3acost effectiveness 3aheavy metals 3ahumic acids 3asalts 0aChromium 0aChromium-contaminated environments 0aBioreduction 0aAeromonas 0aOrgano-Cr(III) complexes 0aMedium composition1 aMin, Di1 aLiu, Dong-Feng1 aCheng, Lei1 aQian, Chen1 aLi, Wen-Wei1 aYu, Han-Qing0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Aug., v. 129 p.86-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008800161300001800249520169100267592002801958650001401986650002302000650001502023650002202038650002202060650002502082650001302107650001702120650001402137650001202151650002202163650001102185650000902196650002002205650001402225650001102239650001002250650001002260650001902270651001202289700002002301700002302321700002002344700002302364773013902387856007302526852000902599655001202608IND60652985920221117223846.0190713e20131127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065298592DNAL7 a10.3390/su51250202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessagie, Maarten10aEnvironmental and Financial Evaluation of Passenger Vehicle Technologies in Belgium  ap. 5020-5033.  aVehicles with alternative drive trains are regarded as a promising substitute for conventional cars, considering the growing concern about oil depletion and the environmental impact of our transportation system. However, “clean” technologies will only be viable when they are cost-efficient. In this paper, the environmental impacts and the financial costs of different vehicle technologies are calculated for an average Belgian driver. Environmentally friendly vehicles are compared with conventional petrol and diesel vehicles. The assessments are done from a life cycle perspective. The effect on human health, resources and ecosystems is considered when calculating the environmental impact. The total cost of ownership (TCO) model includes the purchase price, registration and road taxes, insurance, fuel or electricity cost, maintenance, tires replacement, technical control, battery leasing and battery replacement. In the presented analysis different vehicle technologies and fuels are compared (petrol, diesel, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)) on their level of environmental impact and cost per kilometer. The analysis shows a lower environmental impact for electric vehicles. However, electric vehicles have a higher total cost of ownership compared to conventional vehicles, even though the fuel operating costs are significantly lower. The purchase cost of electric vehicles is highly linked to the size of the battery pack, and not to the size of the electric vehicle. This explains the relative high cost for the electric city cars and the comparable cost for the medium and premium cars.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystems 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectricity costs 3aenvironmental impact 3agasoline 3ahuman health 3ainsurance 3aleasing 3amechanical drives 3amodels 3aoils 3aoperating costs 3aownership 3aprices 3ataxes 3atires 3atransportation 3aBelgium1 aLebeau, Kenneth1 aCoosemans, Thierry1 aMacharis, Cathy1 aMierlo, Joeri van,0 tSustainability.g2013 Nov. 27, v. 5, no. 12 p.5020-5033dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su51250203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007900172300001600251520087900267592002801146650006601174650001301240650004401253650001101297650001501308650001301323650000901336700001801345700002201363773008901385856008401474990002301558852000901581655001201590IND60095037020221119234636.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009503702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraca, Hüseyin,10aSynthesis of l-prolinol substituted novel optically active phthalocyanines  ap. 100-105.  aThe novel optically active Pc-4 (neutral) and Pc-5 (ionic), zinc(II) phthalocyanines having four N-benzyl protected l-prolinol unit were synthesized. l-prolinol has binucleophilic character and can be anchored to phthalonitrile derivative from both nitrogen and oxygen atoms. In order to overcome this problem and to enhance the solubility of phthalonitrile (S)-(-)-3 and the target phthalocyanines, the nitrogen atom of l-prolinol was first protected with benzyl chloride. All the compounds were characterized by ¹H and ¹³C NMR, MALDI–TOF MS, IR, UV–vis, and Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Pc-4 is highly soluble in most common organic solvents, whereas ionic Pc-5 is soluble in water.

A custom-built slot-die was used in a continuous roll-to-roll process to coat the nanomaterial suspension onto substrates with varying surface smoothness, thickness, pore structure, and wet strength. The influence of a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) additive on suspension rheology, water release properties, and coating quality was probed. CMC addition reduced the suspension yield stress by 2 orders of magnitude and the average pore diameter of the coated electrodes by 70%. Sheet resistances of 5–9 Ω sq–¹ were obtained for the conductive coatings with a coat weight of 12–24 g m–². Calendering reduced the sheet resistance to 1–3 Ω sq–¹ and resistivity to as low as 12 μΩ m. The coated electrodes were used to demonstrate a metal-free aqueous-electrolyte supercapacitor with a specific capacitance of 63 F g–¹. The results increase our understanding of continuous processing of nanographite–nanocellulose suspensions into electrodes, with potential uses in flexible, lightweight, and environmentally friendly energy devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achemistry 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy 3aprocess design 3arheology 3awet strength1 aBlomquist, Nicklas1 aDahlström, Christina1 aToivakka, Martti0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 May 27, v. 59, no. 24 p.11232-11240dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c011123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005400152245013600206300001600342520107600358592002801434650001501462650002801477650001501505650002401520650002201544650001101566650002201577650002001599650001601619653003401635653003301669653001201702653001901714653002101733653002101754700001801775700001501793700001701808773009701825856008701922852000902009655001202018IND60591046020221120151402.0200607e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059104602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4608-759710aBattery and ultracapacitor in-the-loop approach to validate a real-time power management method for an all-climate electric vehicle  ap. 153-165.  aIn order to meet the requirements of high specific energy and high specific power together and extend the service life of the energy storage system in temperature abusive conditions, a multi-power configuration with high specific energy lithium-ion battery and high specific power ultracapacitor is the best choice for the all-climate electric vehicle (ACEV). Aiming at real-time power management of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), three power management strategies, which are respectively based on rules, dynamic programming algorithm, and real-time reinforcement learning algorithm, have been systematically compared in this study. To verify the performance of the control strategies, the hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulation test platform based on xPC Target has been built. The results show that the real-time power management strategy based on reinforcement learning algorithm is superior to the others. This strategy can reduce the charge and discharge ratio of the battery pack, which extends the life of battery pack and improves the efficiency of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3adurability 3adynamic programming 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3alithium batteries 3aspecific energy 3atemperature 0aAll-climate electric vehicles 0aHybrid energy storage system 0aBattery 0aUltracapacitor 0aPower management 0aHardware in loop1 aDuan, Yanzhou1 aCao, Jiayi1 aYu, Quanqing0 tApplied energy.g2018 May 01, v. 217 p.153-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010500168300001600273520118200289592002801471650002201499650003801521650001701559650001201576650002201588650001501610650004401625650001501669650001901684650001601703650002101719650001201740700002001752700001601772773008901788856008401877990002301961852000901984655001201993IND60095037320221119234410.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009503732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuksel, Fatma10aPhotophysical, photochemical and liquid-crystalline properties of novel gallium(III) phthalocyanines  ap. 191-200.  aThe synthesis, liquid crystalline, photophysical and photochemical properties of the peripheral- and non-peripheral-tetra-substituted alkylthio gallium(III) phthalocyanines are reported here for the first time. These novel compounds have been characterized by elemental analysis, UV–Vis, IR and ¹H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The thermal stabilities of the phthalocyanine compounds have been determined by thermogravimetric analysis. The mesogenic properties of these new materials have been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarized optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. The investigation of thermotropic behavior showed that all of the new compounds are liquid crystalline over a wide range of temperature. The X-ray diffraction patterns confirm that the phthalocyanines form a hexagonal columnar mesophase. Photophysical (fluorescence and photodegradation quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes) and photochemical (singlet oxygen quantum yields) properties of these compounds have been investigated in toluene. The fluorescence of the substituted gallium(III) phthalocyanines is effectively quenched by 1,4-benzoquinone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afluorescence 3agallium 3amass spectrometry 3amicroscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotolysis 3asinglet oxygen 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atoluene1 aDurmuş, Mahmut1 aAhsen, Vefa0 tDyes and pigments.g2011 Aug., v. 90, no. 2 p.191-200dElsevier Ltdx0143-72087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.12.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245014100173300001600314520122400330592002801554650002201582650003101604650001301635650001201648650002001660650001501680650001301695650001001708650001301718650001601731650001601747650001001763651001101773651001901784700002201803700002301825700002701848700002201875773013001897856008202027852000902109655001202118IND60688613220221116163337.0200415e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068861322DNAL7 a10.1657/1938-4246-45.2.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarvis, Stephanie K.12aA Warming-Induced Biome Shift Detected in Tree Growth of Mountain Hemlock [Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière] Along the Gulf of Alaska  ap. 211-218.  aRecent observations of divergence between tree growth at high-latitude sites and temperature, as well as the decline of yellow cedar [Callitropsis nootkatensis (D. Don) Oerst. ex D.P. Little] in southeast Alaska due to warming, emphasize a need to investigate nonstationary climate response of Alaskan coastal forests to warming in other tree species. Comparison of annual tree growth in mountain hemlock [Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière] to mean monthly temperature and precipitation data from Sitka, Alaska, from A.D. 1830s to 1990s along an elevational transect reveals nonstationarity in tree growth response to climate that suggests an ongoing biome shift. We observe a marked weakening in the positive relationship between annual growth and warmer growth season temperatures at low-elevation hemlock sites, and a concurrent increase in growth and sensitivity at higher elevations coupled with increased correlation between growth and April precipitation at all sites along our transects. As previously observed with yellow cedar, the mechanism of the hemlock biome shift may be due to an increased susceptibility of roots to damage from late frosts resulting from earlier seasonal loss of protective snowpack.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTsuga mertensiana 3aXanthocyparis nootkatensis 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3acoastal forests 3aecosystems 3alatitude 3aroots 3asnowpack 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atrees 3aAlaska 3aGulf of Alaska1 aWiles, Gregory C.1 aAppleton, Sarah N.1 aD’Arrigo, Rosanne D.1 aLawson, Daniel E.0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2013 May 1, v. 45, no. 2 p.211-218dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-45.2.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245014700167300001600314520111800330592002801448650002001476650000801496650001601504650002301520650001301543650001601556650001201572650001101584650001501595650001301610700002701623700002101650700020001671700002601871700002201897773012401919856007402043852000902117655001202126IND60656547920221120050728.0190814e20120202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065654792DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ay05562c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Muñoz, Marta10aComparison of three high-flow single-stage impaction-based air samplers for bacteria quantification: DUO SAS SUPER 360, SAMPL'AIR and SPIN AIR  ap. 399-405.  aIndoor Air Quality (IAQ) can be significantly deteriorated by high levels of bioaerosols that may cause adverse health effects in building occupants. There is no standard method for the quantification of this kind of pollutants and several protocols and sampling devices are used. The aim of this work was to compare three commonly used portable air samplers available in the market. DUO SAS SUPER 360, SAMPL'AIR and SPIN AIR units were tested simultaneously for bacteria quantification in a laboratory room in realistic conditions. The results obtained showed that the SPIN AIR unit was the most precise and recovered a higher amount of colony-forming units; consequently this sampler seems to be better for indoor-air bioaerosol concentration measurements. Additionally, positive-hole correction can be avoided due to the SPIN AIR sampling head rotation mechanism. The mean bacterial concentration measured by the other two models was not significantly different. However, due to the high dispersion of the DUO SAS SUPER 360 results, many repetitions are necessary to obtain a reliable measure with this device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aair 3aair quality 3aanalytical methods 3abacteria 3abioaerosols 3amarkets 3amodels 3apollutants 3asamplers1 aMuñoz-Vicente, María1 aCobas, Guillermo1 aPortelaPresent address: Instituto de Catálisis y Petroleoquímica (CSIC), C/Marie Curie, 2 Cantoblanco, 28049, Madrid, Spain, raquel.portela@csic.es, Fax: +34913466037, Tel: +34915854799, Raquel1 aAmils, R.q(Ricardo),1 aSánchez, Benigno0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Feb. 2, v. 4, no. 2 p.399-405dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ay05562c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245009800175300002000273500001900293520141600312592002801728650002101756650002301777650002501800650002101825650001301846650001701859650001101876650002101887650001801908650001901926650001601945650002401961700001801985700001702003700002002020700006102040700005602101773017202157856008002329852000902409655001202418IND60699363820210419000000.0200617e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069936382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c011222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomán-Ramírez, Luis A.10aChemical Degradation of End-of-Life Poly(lactic acid) into Methyl Lactate by a Zn(II) Complex  ap. 11149-11156.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe catalyzed methanolysis of end-of-life poly(lactic acid) (PLA) products by an ethylenediamine Zn(II) complex to form biodegradable methyl lactate was studied experimentally at 70, 90, and 110 °C. The PLA samples consisted of typical consumer waste materials, including a cup, a toy, and a three-dimensional (3D) printing material. High selectivities and yields (>94%) were possible depending on temperature and reaction time. Additionally, and to develop a predictive kinetic model, kinetic parameters (pre-exponential factor and activation energies) of the PLA transesterification reaction were first obtained from virgin PLA. These parameters were subsequently used to estimate the conversion of PLA, selectivity, and yield of methyl lactate after 1 and 4 h of the reaction, and the results were compared with the experimental values of the end-of-life PLA. Despite the presence of unknown additives in the PLA waste material and uncontrolled particle size, the model was able to predict the overall conversion, selectivity, and yield to an average deviation of 5, 7, and 12%, respectively. A greater agreement between the model and experimental values is observed for the higher temperatures and the longer reaction time. Larger deviations were observed for the PLA toy, which we attribute to the presence of additives, since despite its lower molecular weight, it possessed a higher structural strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acatalytic activity 3achemical degradation 3aethylenediamines 3akinetics 3amethanolysis 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3aprocess design 3atemperature 3atransesterification1 aMcKeown, Paul1 aShah, Chanak1 aAbraham, Joshua1 aJones, Matthew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5991-56171 aWood, Joseph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2040-54970 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 May 01, v. 59, no. 24 p.11149-11156dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c011223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011900177300001600296520143400312592002801746650001501774650001701789650002301806650001501829650000901844650001301853650001301866650002201879700002401901700002301925700002401948700002401972700002301996700002602019700002702045700002502072773008902097856008402186990002302270852000902293655001202302IND60095037420221119234528.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009503742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedyunyayeva, Iryna A.14aThe synthesis, structure and spectral properties of new long-wavelength benzodipyrroleninium-based bis-styryl dyes  ap. 201-210.  aNovel bis-styryl dyes based on a quaternized centrosymmetrical benzodipyrrolenine moiety were synthesized by reaction of a quaternized benzodipyrrolenine with two equivalents of 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 4-dimethylaminocinnamoic aldehyde or 4-(3,5-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-1-pyrazolyl)benzaldehyde. The molecular structures and spectral properties of these dyes were investigated using PM3 and PPP CI quantum chemical simulations and compared with biscyanines and parent “monomeric” styryl dyes. Conjugation of two uniform “monomeric” styryl chromophores to form a bis-chromophoric system was found to cause a pronounced red-shift (∼100 nm) of the absorption and emission maxima, an increase of the extinction coefficients but also a conformational rigidization of the molecules. This results in better vibrationally resolved absorption and emission bands and, in general, in increased quantum yields. Bis-styryl dyes absorb and emit in the red and near-IR spectral region (643–812 nm). They have high extinction coefficients (≤133,000 M⁻¹ cm⁻¹), large Stokes’ shifts (up to 55 nm in chloroform and 90 nm in methanol), and quantum yields in chloroform ≤10%, whereas polar solvents decrease quantum yields. Despite their symmetrical structures these bis-styryl dyes exhibit spectral properties in solvents of different polarity that are more resemble those of unsymmetrical “monomeric” styryls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abenzaldehyde 3achemical structure 3achloroform 3adyes 3amethanol 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis1 aKlochko, Oleksii P.1 aSemenova, Оlga M.1 aKhabuseva, Sania U.1 aPovrozin, Yevgen A.1 aSokolyk, Oksana O.1 aStepanenko, Olena Yu.1 aTerpetschnig, Ewald A.1 aPatsenker, Leonid D.0 tDyes and pigments.g2011 Aug., v. 90, no. 2 p.201-210dElsevier Ltdx0143-72087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245007400164300001800238520167600256536016401932592002802096650001602124650001002140650001102150650001302161650002102174650001502195650001902210650001502229650001702244650001802261651001002279653002702289653001802316653002902334653002102363653003602384700001802420700001102438700001502449700001602464700001302480773013402493856008602627852000902713655001202722IND60789982920221120080201.0220822e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078998292DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2021.19879162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ning12aA novel two-dimensional entrainment wake model for wind turbine wakes  ap. 1252-1265.  aThe wake model for stand-alone turbine is an essential ingredient of wind farm wake research, which is of great concern for optimization of wind turbine layout, power generation simulation, and operation control on a wind farm. One-dimensional wake models (e.g., Jensen model and Frandsen model) based on single conservation theorem were approximately described by top-hat shape, which cannot represent the non-uniform distribution characteristics of wind turbine wake in the crosswind direction accurately and tend to underestimate the velocity deficit. Different from the above-mentioned models, entrainment wake model (EWM) can conserve both of mass and momentum within the control volume, which improves the accuracy of wake simulation to a certain extent. But the top-hat hypothesis limits the wake prediction accuracy of EWM. In this case, a novel two-dimensional EWM is proposed for the first time in this paper. Different from the advanced two-dimensional Bastankah and Porté-Agel wake model and Jensen-Gaussian wake model, the proposed model considers the influence of variable entrainment parameter on wake recovery, of which the key entrainment parameter was considered as a variable that is associated with downstream distance, ambient turbulence, and wake turbulence. The proposed Gaussian EWM has been validated by the data from Garrad Hassan (GH) wind tunnel laboratory experiments, Sexberium wind farm measurements, and the field measurements with lidar in Northwestern China. It has been concluded that the proposed model can predict the wake velocity distribution most accurately and provides the minimal power prediction error under various scenarios.  aThis work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2018YFB1501105); National Key Research and Development Program of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aingredients 3alidar 3amodels 3amomentum 3apower generation 3aprediction 3aturbulent flow 3awind farms 3awind tunnels 3awind turbines 3aChina 0aEntrainment wake model 0atop-hat shape 0anon-uniform distribution 0agaussian profile 0agaussian entrainment wake model1 aLiu, Yongqian1 aLi, Li1 aMeng, Hang1 aHan, Shuang1 aYan, Jie0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 19, no. 11 p.1252-1265dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2181x1543-50837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2021.19879163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010000172300001600272520140200288592002801690650001701718650001401735650001101749650001801760650001301778650001801791650002001809650001201829651001001841653001401851653001201865653001701877653002001894653001801914653002001932653000801952653001401960700002201974700002101996700002202017773009202039856008402131852000902215655001202224IND60547514020221120040114.0160903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054751402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassard, Harry A.10aAssessing the Impact of the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster on Policy Dynamics and the Public Sphere  ap. 566-575.  aSocial and political fallout following the March 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster permanently altered the zeitgeist of global public attitude towards nuclear power and towards energy technology in general. This area of public policy, which in Japan is particularly opaque and stagnant, was forced into a period of energy sector review amid domestic and worldwide debate.

This quantitative approach yielded the following hypothesis verifications; 1) in an AHP-style online survey, exposure to real and simulated nuclear-related disaster headlines reduced collective partiality towards nuclear power by 3% and 4% respectively, and 2) retrospective opinion mining of Twitter procured an relative increase in negative nuclear-related posts of 38% and 134% in Japanese and English respectively, from the pre to post-Fukushima world. Using nuclear power and Fukushima as a case study, this paper attempts to elucidate both the influence of media on the public sphere, and the influence of the public sphere on policy and policymakers. From the results it is possible to make the conjecture that a lack of scientific education with regard to energy issues increases the former influence, and similarly reduces the latter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeducation 3aenergy 3anuclear power 3apolitics 3apublic policy 3asocial networks 3asurveys 3aJapan 0aFukushima 0aTwitter 0aSocial media 0aNuclear profile 0aPublic sphere 0aPolicy dynamics 0aAHP 0aHeadlines1 aSwee, Joshua K.Y.1 aGhanem, Moustafa1 aUnesaki, Hironobu0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2013, v. 17 p.566-575dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014000154300001800294500001900312520092500331592002801256650001401284650001701298650001401315650002301329650001101352650001701363700001601380700001901396700001701415700001401432773012201446856007401568852000901642655001201651IND60681010420221123043424.0200113e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068101042DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09737f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yakun12aA recyclable heterogeneous–homogeneous–heterogeneous NiO/AlOOH catalysis system for hydrocarboxylation of acetylene to acrylic acid  ap. 1634-1638.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConcerns about the high-valued utilization of coal- and natural gas-based acetylene has provided particular impetus for exploration of acrylic acid (AA) production via one-step hydrocarboxylation reaction. Motivated by simple recovery, recycling and reuse of the catalyst, we report a high-performance NiO/AlOOH catalyst with AA space-time-yield of 412 gAA gcₐₜ.⁻¹ h⁻¹, obtainable by a simple incipient wetness impregnation method. Detailed kinetic and controlled experiments confirmed that nickel species on such a solid catalyst provide a heterogeneous–homogeneous–heterogeneous catalytic cycle where the chelates formed between CO and leached nickel act as the active species. The thorough recovery of leached nickel species improves the catalyst stability greatly. These preliminary findings indicate further prospects for new heterogeneous catalyst design in traditional homogeneous catalytic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aacrylic acid 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3anickel 3anickel oxide1 aYan, Lifang1 aZhang, Qiaofei1 aYan, Binhang1 aCheng, Yi0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 10, no. 3 p.1634-1638dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra09737f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014300169300001400312520134200326592002801668650002501696650001401721650001501735650002101750650001401771650001501785650001201800650002001812650001301832650001901845650002101864650001901885650001301904650001401917650001501931650001301946650002401959653002701983653002302010653001602033653002702049653002102076700002102097700002302118773011002141856008402251852000902335655001202344IND60604821820221120032249.0180718e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060482182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyravi, Majid10aDeveloping nanocomposite PI membranes: Morphology and performance to glycerol removal at the downstream processing of biodiesel production  ap. 72-84.  aNanocomposite solvent resistant (NCSR) membranes were developed and utilized for separation of organic biodiesel rich phase. The modified membranes were fabricated via nonsolvent induced phase separation by addition of different concentrations of functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in the polyimide (PI) casting solution. The morphological studies, molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), mean pore size, pore size distribution and porosity were evaluated and discussed. The physicochemical properties of the membrane were improved significantly after bulk modification with functionalized MWCNTs. Surface hydrophilicity and roughness were improved with an increase in MWCNTs up to 1wt%. This was confirmed by fouling analysis where flux recovery (FR) was strongly increased by more than 47% for M2 at the maximum value. To evaluate the performance of modified PI membranes, the crude biodiesel prepared by transesterification reaction of canola oil with an alkaline catalyst was filtered with a dead-end filtration system at 5bar and 25°C. The glycerol removal increased with increasing MWCNTs content in the modified PI membranes until it reached to 100% for M3 membrane without any significant changes in methyl ester flux. It may be due to the smaller surface pore size and higher membrane porosity after bulk modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abiodiesel 3acanola oil 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3afiltration 3afouling 3afuel production 3aglycerol 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular weight 3ananocomposites 3aporosity 3aroughness 3aseparation 3asolvents 3atransesterification 0aNanocomposite membrane 0aChemical resistant 0aAntifouling 0aBiodiesel purification 0aGlycerol removal1 aRahimpour, Ahmad1 aJahanshahi, Mohsen0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 473 p.72-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002400136245012800160300001400288500002000302520209200322592002802414596003002442596004502472596002702517596003902544596005602583650002502639650001302664650002602677650001702703650001102720650001202731650001102743650002002754650001402774650001302788650001102801650002202812651001102834651001402845700002402859700002402883700002602907700002902933700002102962700002002983773012803003856007103131852000903202655001203211IND60130825720221122005923.0220424e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013082572DNAL7 a10.2981/07-0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilliland, Scott G.10aEvaluating the Sustainability of Harvest Among Northern Common Eiders Somateria Mollissima Borealis in Greenland and Canada  ap. 24-36.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSustainable harvest, the extraction of game without affecting population viability, is a desirable approach to the use of wildlife. However, overharvest has been responsible for the decline of many wildlife populations globally, so there is an urgent need to balance human requirements while avoiding the severe depletion of wild populations. Northern common eiders Somateria mollissima borealis are heavily hunted in Canada and Greenland, but the effect of this intensive harvest has not been examined. We developed a population model to investigate the sustainability of the reported harvest, which consisted of two wintering areas in Greenland and Atlantic Canada and three breeding populations. The model indicated that harvest in Atlantic Canada was sustainable, but a number of conditions could lead to slow declines. In contrast, the annual winter harvest of 55,000–70,000 eiders reported during 1993–2000 in Greenland was not sustainable, and this conclusion held under a wide range of alternate conditions. The model indicated that harvest during late winter may have a greater effect on populations than harvest in early winter. We further refined the model to assume that at some low population level the success of hunters would decline and that harvest became a function of population size (a rate). This scenario had the expected and undesirable result of stabilizing populations at very low levels. Overall, our model suggests that the high harvest reported in Greenland during 1993–2000 endangers the sustainable use of the northern common eider population and that management actions are required. Common eider harvest levels in Greenland should be reduced by at least 40% of the 1993–2000 levels to stop projected declines, and allow for recovery of the decimated Greenland breeding population. Encouragingly, new hunting regulations were introduced in Greenland in 2002–2004, and harvest levels appear to be decreasing. If these harvest reductions continue, our population model could be used to re‐evaluate the status of populations in the two countries.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanadian Wildlife Service  cGreenland Institute of Natural Resources  cNunavut Research Trust  cAmerican Museum of Natural History  cNorthern Ecosystem Initiative of Environment Canada 3aSomateria mollissima 3abreeding 3afish and wildlife law 3aharvest date 3ahumans 3ahunters 3amodels 3apopulation size 3aviability 3awildlife 3awinter 3awintering grounds 3aCanada 3aGreenland1 aGrant Gilchrist, H.1 aRockwell, Robert F.1 aRobertson, Gregory J.1 aSavard, Jean‐Pierre L.1 aMerkel, Flemming1 aMosbech, Anders0 tWildlife biology.g2009 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.24-36dNordic Board for Wildlife ResearchwJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/07-0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007200150245012600222500001900348520202300367592002802390650001502418650001502433650001402448650002102462650001102483650001602494650002402510650001002534650002302544650001702567650001402584650002902598650001602627650001302643650004402656650000902700650001802709651001102727651000902738651001802747651002602765653003202791653002402823653001502847653001902862653001802881653001802899700002902917700006302946700003303009700002503042700002003067700003003087773011403117856008503231852000903316655001203325IND60735617320221119200901.0210527e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073561732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4621802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradanas-González, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0727-773710aMycotoxin extraction from edible insects with natural deep eutectic solvents: a green alternative to conventional methods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEdible insects are widely consumed in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America, but less commonly so in Western countries. Since the turn of the millennium, however, entomophagy has aroused growing interest worldwide in response to the increasing scarcity of food resources. In fact, edible insects can be a source of high-quality protein, and also of fat, energy, minerals and vitamins. However, the lack of regulatory guidelines for microbiologically or chemically hazardous agents potentially present in these new foods (e.g., mycotoxins) may make their consumption unsafe. In this work, we developed an environmentally friendly analytical method using natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES or natural DES) in combination with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of six mycotoxins of great concern owing to their toxic effects on humans and animals (namely, fumonisin B₁, fumonisin B₂, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, ochratoxin A and mycophenolic acid) in insect-based food products. The target mycotoxins were co-extracted from cricket flour by using the optimum DES composition (namely, a mixture of choline chloride and urea, in a 1:2 mole ratio, containing 15% water which resulted in the highest extraction recoveries for all toxins). An experimental design method (Fractional Factorial Design (FFD) was used to examine the influence of the operational variables DES volume and water content, amount of sample, extraction time and extraction temperature on the extraction efficiency for each mycotoxin. Under optimum conditions, extraction recoveries were close to 100% except for fumonisin B₂ (70%) and T-2 toxin (50%), with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 13% in all cases. The proposed NADES-UHPLC–MS/MS method was validated in accordance with the European Commission 2002/657/EC and 2006/401/EC decisions, and used to determine the target compounds in cricket flour, silkworm pupae powder and black cricket powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHT-2 toxin 3aOrthoptera 3aT-2 toxin 3acholine chloride 3aenergy 3aentomophagy 3aexperimental design 3aflour 3ainsect-based foods 3aochratoxin A 3asilkworms 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurea 3awater content 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aLatin America 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aDeep eutectic solvent (DES) 0anatural DES (NADES) 0amycotoxins 0aedible insects 0acricket flour 0aUHPLC–MS/MS1 aÁlvarez-Rivera, Gerardo1 aBenito-Peña, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5685-55591 aNavarro-Villoslada, Fernando1 aCifuentes, Alejandro1 aHerrero, Miguel1 aMoreno-Bondi, María Cruz0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 July 05, v. 1648 p.462180-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4621803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245009300163300001600256520090200272592002801174650001401202650002101216650001701237650001101254653002101265653001801286653001501304653002401319653002001343700001601363700002301379700005301402700005601455773009701511856008701608852000901695655001201704IND60591046220221120134327.0200607e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059104622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xu12aA counter-flow-based dual-electrolyte protocol for multiple electrochemical applications  ap. 241-248.  aThis paper reports a computational demonstration and analysis of an innovative counter-flow-based microfluidic unit and its upscaling network, which is compatible with previously developed dual-electrolyte protocols and numerous other electrochemical applications.

We also documented that emergence intensity varies with distance from the reef, leading us to hypothesize that the spatial pattern of emergence is determined by the foraging patterns of nocturnally active, bottom-feeding, mid-level consumers (mainly grunts). In this second study, we coupled those previously published data with nocturnal fish surveys concurrently conducted along belt transects placed at the same locations as the emergence trap collections, and a controlled laboratory experiment, to test this hypothesis. The results of these analyses find that variability in the density of nocturnally active, bottom-feeding fish is strongly positively correlated with emergence intensity, regardless of site or season. Results from the laboratory experiments show that nocturnal invertebrate emergence is significantly higher in the presence of one bottom-feeding fish (the blue-striped grunt Haemulon sciurus) than in microcosms that do not contain this predator. Overall, this study shows that such processes may explain how benthic prey can avoid capture by nocturnally active, bottom-feeding predators and persist in the predator-rich seagrass habitats that surround coral reefs in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. This study also points out the need to consider nocturnal processes when studying seagrass biodiversity in a predator-rich environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemulon 3aSciurus 3abiodiversity 3acorals 3afish 3alaboratory experimentation 3amacroinvertebrates 3amarine protected areas 3aplankton 3aseagrasses 3aFlorida1 aValentine, John F.0 tDiversity.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d140907623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01710naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009600161300002000257500001900277520070200296592002800998650001701026650001401043650001101057650001901068700007201087773017201159856008001331852000901411655001201420IND60699364020221118003328.0200617e20200529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069936402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c011962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yuhe10aToward an Envelope of Design Solutions for Combined/Intensified Reaction/Separation Systems  ap. 11350-11354.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, we develop an envelope of design solutions for combined intensified reaction/separation systems.

Single stage processes cannot provide both, high product gas purity and high recovery at the same time, but multistage processes do. Commonly, the design of multistage gas permeation processes relies on heuristics and experience, so that often sub-optimal separation processes are designed. We apply a structural optimization approach to biogas upgrading processes. This systematic method determines the most profitable process layout including membrane areas and pressures required for two commercial membranes. Furthermore, we determine the optimal selectivity and CO2 permeance following the upper bound of the Robeson plot. The process model is implemented using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). For commercial membranes a three stage gas permeation process is the most profitable process which operates with only a single compressor. Optimizing the process layout together with the membrane properties a two stage process is the best process configuration. CO2/CH4 selectivities of approximately 120 are optimal. The impact of changed feed conditions and required product purity was investigated. The results highlight that for biogas upgrading commercial gas permeation membranes already provide powerful separation characteristics. The optimal membrane processes are capable to economically compete with conventional biogas upgrading techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3amethane 3amodels 0aProcess modeling 0aStructural optimization 0aGas permeation 0aBiogas upgrading1 aAlders, Michael1 aLohaus, Theresa1 aWessling, Matthias0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 474 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011900171300001400290520102700304592002801331650001501359650001401374650001101388650000901399650001501408650002901423650001601452650001101468650001301479653002701492653001501519653002601534653001401560700002401574700001601598773009501614856008701709852000901796655001201805IND60591046420221120151317.0200607e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059104642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdiaye, Khadim10aExperimental evaluation of two low temperature energy storage prototypes based on innovative cementitious material  ap. 47-55.  aThe world’s energy consumption has huge environmental and socioeconomic impacts.

Ettringite material has the advantage of high energy storage density at low temperature (60 °C) compared to existing adsorbent materials such as zeolites (around 200 °C). The objective of this study was to build and improve an experimental prototype of a thermochemical reactor to serve as a proof of concept. A previously modelled cylindrical thermochemical reactor with an axial metal tube was built in the laboratory. It was the first prototype, with a heat storage yield of 44% or storage capacity of 61 kWh/m³. To improve the heat storage performance of the thermochemical reactor, a second prototype without the metal tube was also developed in the laboratory. The storage tests with this second prototype showed a heat storage yield increase from 44% to 71%, with a storage density of 117 kWh/m³.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3abuildings 3aenergy 3aheat 3aprototypes 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3ayields 3azeolites 0aThermochemical storage 0aEttringite 0aHydration-dehydration 0aPrototype1 aGinestet, Stéphane1 aCyr, Martin0 tApplied energy.g2018 May 01, v. 217 p.47-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001800271520101800289536024401307592002801551596002601579596002301605650001401628650001301642650002101655650001701676650001101693650002901704650001601733653002601749653002901775653001601804653002501820653001801845700001501863773013401878856008602012852000902098655001202107IND60789983220221120095019.0220822e20220926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078998322DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2021.19900672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aElectrochemical analysis of electrolyte temperature and composition for all-iron redox flow battery  ap. 1285-1289.  aAt present, aqueous all-iron flow batteries have become one of the most potentials flow batteries system due to their low cost and environmental-friendly operation. However, the battery performance and cycle-life will to a great extent be limited by the electrolytes, which are mainly influenced by temperature, electrolyte concentration, and electrolyte additives. Herein, we repeatedly conducted the electrochemical tests on catholyte and anolyte in varied temperatures and electrolyte concentrations. Based on the analyses, it is proved that the electrolyte of an all-iron flow battery is suitable for high-temperature conditions. By comparing the electrochemical performance of anolyte and anolyte with citrate, the citrate is proved to be an effective additive in solving the problem of anolyte reversibility. This work can guide the conditional design of all-iron flow battery energy storage devices, and meanwhile, the solution is proposed to enhance the anolyte reversibility of the all-iron flow battery.  aThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [Grant No. 2020-MS-012], the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 21805290] and the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 2020-MS-012  aGrant No. 21805290 3abatteries 3acitrates 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aAll-iron flow battery 0aelectrochemical analysis 0aelectrolyte 0aelectrolyte additive 0areversibility1 aSong, Yuxi0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2022 Sept. 26, v. 19, no. 12 p.1285-1289dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2181x1543-50837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2021.19900673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245009300205300001800298500002000316520137900336592002801715650001301743650002201756650001901778650001601797650002101813650001601834650002301850650001701873650001001890650001101900650001701911650001701928650002301945650002701968650001301995650001202008650001302020700002702033700002302060700006202083773013402145856007802279852000902357655001202366IND60609542020221120023936.0180823e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060954202DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018005282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopov, Alekxander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5737-370010aHypercrosslinked polymeric restricted access materials for analysis of biological fluids  ap. 3302-3309.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNew restricted access materials based on microporous hypercrosslinked polystyrene have been developed. The materials are aimed to use as packings for solid‐phase extraction cartridges to isolate low‐molecular‐weight analytes from biological fluids (for instance, blood plasma or serum). Two features distinguish these polymers from all known restricted access materials. The first one consists of the microporous hypercrosslinked polystyrene that not only exclude proteins from the sorbent phase but also do not adsorb them on the bead outer surface, and so they do not cause coagulation of blood protein components. Therefore, these materials do not require any chemical modification. The second distinguishing feature is the ability of hypercrosslinked sorbents to take up a wide variety of polar and nonpolar organic compounds. The sorbents were obtained in the form of beads of 60–70 μm in diameter by cross‐linking styrene copolymers with 1, 2, and 3% divinylbenzene with monochlorodimethyl ether to 100, 150, and 200% cross‐linking degree. The sorbents exhibit all typical properties of hypercrosslinked networks. They do not take up albumin, the major blood protein, and cytochrome C, representative of smaller protein molecules, but are capable of adsorbing drugs, vitamins, and phenyl carboxylic acids (markers of sepsis) from model aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aaqueous solutions 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acarboxylic acids 3acoagulation 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3amodels 3apolystyrenes 3aporous media 3asepsis (infection) 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3astyrene 3avitamins1 aBlinnikova, Zinaida K.1 aTsyurupa, Maria P.1 aDavankov, Vadim A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1018-18400 tJournal of separation science.g2018 Aug., v. 41, no. 16 p.3302-3309dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018005283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245011100158300002000269500001900289520147800308592002801786650002201814650003701836650001101873650001901884650002301903650001501926650001201941650001801953650001601971650001401987650001302001650001902014650001602033650001602049650002202065650003702087700001302124700001802137700001602155700005402171700005802225773017202283856008002455852000902535655001202544IND60699364320221118003445.0200617e20200525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069936432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c013622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Wei10aMethane Combustion with a Pd–Pt Catalyst Stabilized by Magnesia–Alumina Spinel in a High-Humidity Feed  ap. 11170-11176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSupported bimetallic nanocatalysts have attracted extensive attention in catalysis related to environmental remediation because of their unique performance. In order to fulfill their catalytic tasks under real operating conditions, these nanocatalysts should maintain their structural, chemical, and thermal stability. However, the maintenance has been challenging. Herein, we developed a Pd–Pt bimetallic nanocatalyst stabilized by magnesia–alumina spinel (MgAl₂O₄) on an alumina support. The stabilization of MgAl₂O₄ on the catalyst was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning TEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. During aging treatment, the structure of the catalyst showed insignificant changes without the sintering of the palladium and platinum nanoparticles. The formation of a less-active Pd–Pt alloy was depressed, and the active Pd species in the oxidized state was maintained. In a model reaction stimulating the abatement of methane emitted by natural gas vehicles, the catalyst completely converted methane at a low temperature (427 °C). After aging, this temperature increased by about 20 °C. By contrast, the aged analogous catalyst without MgAl₂O₄ stabilization failed to fulfill the complete conversion even at 550 °C. In this work, an efficient method used to design supported nanobimetallic catalysts with outstanding performance for environmental remediation was provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3amethane 3ananocatalysts 3anatural gas 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aprocess design 3aremediation 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWu, Yang1 aChen, Jianjun1 aQu, Pengfei1 aZhong, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5661-68971 aChen, Yaoqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2382-71880 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 May 25, v. 59, no. 24 p.11170-11176dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c013623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011000169520074100279592002801020650001901048650003201067650001201099650002401111650002101135650001601156650001601172650002201188650002401210653001101234653004001245653001801285653003301303653004201336653000901378653000801387653000901395700001501404700002101419700002701440700002101467700002001488773010301508856008701611852000901698655001201707IND60776096920221121005052.0220621e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077609692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppe, Jakub13aAn effect of choline lactate based low transition temperature mixtures on the lipase catalytic properties  aA new series of low transition temperature mixures (LTTM) based on choline lactate quaternary ammonium salt and various hydrogen bond donors was prepared and characterized towards their physicochemical properties and usability as an enzymatic reaction mixture for lipase-catalyzed transesterification reactions.

Conducted transesterification reactions were characterized by high yields – up to 98% – and high purity of the obtained products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium salts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acholine 3aenzymatic reactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3alactic acid 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atransesterification 0aLipase 0aLow transition temperature mixtures 0aIonic liquids 0aTransesterification activity 0aHydrolytic activity thermal stability 0aLTTM 0aDES 0aCALB1 aByzia, Ewa1 aDrozd, Radosław1 aSzymańska, Magdalena,1 aBielecki, Patryk1 aSmiglak, Marcin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Aug., v. 216 p.112518-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245008100183300001800264520147800282536005701760592002801817596001801845650001101863650001201874650001401886650001201900650001901912650000901931650001901940650000901959650001201968650001501980653002401995653002002019653002302039653001302062700003302075700002802108700003002136700002702166700002802193773014802221856008602369852000902455655001202464IND60792626920221120225831.0220908e20221113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079262692DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20896802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Almeida, Gbison Ferreira10aDecomposition and Nutrient Release from Grass Residue in Tropical Conditions  ap. 2766-2777.  aThe use of grasses as ground cover in tropical climate guarantees soil protection against erosion processes, however, its capacity for nutrients mineralization is poorly understood. In this sense, the aim of the study was to evaluate the decomposition of vegetable residues from grasses and the mineralization of macronutrients in tropical conditions. The study was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications, in a 4 × 9 factorial scheme with four cultural residues: sorghum, millet, black oats, and fallow; and nine evaluation times: 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, and 112 days after setting up the study (DAA), in the field. Vegetable residues were disposed on the soil surface for remaining dry matter (RDM), half-life (t₁/₂) and mineralization rates. Lower decomposition rates were observed in sorghum and millet residues, with RDMs of 40% and 31% when compared to oats and fallow (17% RDM). Thus, the waste mineralization rates decreased in the following order: fallow = oats > millet > sorghum. The mineralization of macronutrients was considered high and decreased in the following order: K > P > N > C > Mg > S > Ca, corresponding to 96, 88, 88, 80, 76, and 74%. The fallow, millet, oat, and sorghum residues released 84, 17, 225, and 17 kg t⁻¹ of N, P, K, and S, with different mineralization rates. The largest fraction of these nutrients was mineralized in the first 30 DAA, what indicates its potential use in agriculture.  aThis work was supported by the CNPq [309399/2019-0].  aPublisher supplied data  a309399/2019-0 3afallow 3agrasses 3ahalf life 3amillets 3amineralization 3aoats 3aplant analysis 3asoil 3atropics 3avegetables 0aMineralization rate 0asorghum bicolor 0aPennisetum glaucum 0aavena sp1 ade Almeida Neta, Maria Nilfa1 aFernandes, Luiz Arnaldo1 aSampaio, Regynaldo Arruda1 aTeixeira, Gustavo Leal1 aFacco Pegoraro, Rodinei0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 Nov. 13, v. 53, no. 20 p.2766-2777dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20896803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245018800210500001900398520167800417592002802095650002002123650001802143650002702161650001202188650001802200650003302218650000902251650001802260650001102278650001702289650002002306650004602326650001602372650001802388650001002406650001502416650004302431650002202474650002002496650002002516650001902536650001202555650002102567653002802588653002502616653002002641653001402661653001002675653000902685653001702694700002302711700002202734700006102756773011402817856008502931852000903016655001203025IND60735617720221119200818.0210527e20210705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073561772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4621852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVítová, Milada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0552-329510aDetailed structural characterization of cardiolipins from various biological sources using a complex analytical strategy comprising fractionation, hydrolysis and chiral chromatography  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCardiolipins (1,3-bis(sn-3′-phosphatidyl)-sn-glycerol) (CLs) are widespread in many organisms, from bacteria to higher green plants and mammals. CLs were observed in Gram-positive bacterium of the genus Kocuria, brewer's yeast Saccharomyces, the green alga Chlamydomonas, spinach and beef heart. A mixture of molecular species of CLs was obtained from total lipids by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), and these were further separated and identified by reversed phase LC/MS with negative tandem electrospray ionization. The majority of CLs molecular species from each organism were cleaved using phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus. This phospholipase cleaves CLs into 1,2-diglycerols and phosphatidylglycerol 3-phosphates, which were then separated. After CLs cleavage, diacylglycerols such as sn-1,2-diacyl-3-acetyl-glycerols (i.e., triacylglycerols) were separated and identified by chiral chromatography/MS-positive tandem ESI. Significant differences in the composition of the molecular species between the 3-(3-sn-phosphatidyl) and 1-(3-sn-phosphatidyl) moieties of CLs were found in all organisms tested. Molecular species of CLs that contained four different fatty acids were identified in all five samples, and CLs containing very long chain fatty acids were identified in yeast. In addition, CLs containing both enantiomers (at the sn-2 carbon) were present in the bacterium tested. These findings were further supported by data already published in GenBank where, in the same family - Micrococcaceae - both enzymes responsible for chirality in the sn-2 position, glycerol-3-phosphate and glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenases, were present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aChlamydomonas 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aKocuria 3aSaccharomyces 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3abeef 3abrewers yeast 3acarbon 3acardiolipins 3adiacylglycerols 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenantiomers 3afractionation 3aheart 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aoptical isomerism 3aoxidoreductases 3aphospholipase C 3aphospholipases 3aspinach 3atriacylglycerols 0aEnantiomeric separation 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aRP-HPLC/MS-ESI+ 0aBacterium 0aYeast 0aAlga 0aBovine heart1 aStránská, Milena1 aPalyzová, Andrea1 aŘezanka, Tomáš1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8704-96450 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 July 05, v. 1648 p.462185-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2021.4621853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168300001400294520138300308592002801691650002501719650001401744650001701758650001401775650001101789650001301800650001901813650001901832650001201851650001701863650001501880650001301895650002001908650002701928650001601955653002001971653002001991653003302011700002202044700001902066700002302085773011002108856008402218852000902302655001202311IND60604822320221120032119.0180718e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060482232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Rui Chin10aNovel cellulose ester substrates for high performance flat-sheet thin-film composite (TFC) forward osmosis (FO) membranes  ap. 63-71.  aA novel hydrophilic cellulose ester with a high intrinsic water permeability and a water partition coefficient was discovered to construct membrane supports for flat-sheet thin film composite (TFC) forward osmosis (FO) membranes for water reuse and seawater desalination with high performance. The performance of TFC-FO membranes prepared from the hydrophilic cellulose ester containing a high degree of OH and a moderate degree of Pr substitutions clearly surpasses those prepared from cellulose esters and other polymers with moderate hydrophilicity. Post-treatments of TFC-FO membranes using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and glycerol followed by heat treatment further enhance the water flux without compromising the selectivity. Positron annihilation lifetime analyses have confirmed that the SDS/glycerol post-treatment increases the free volume size and fractional free volume of the polyamide selective layer. The newly developed post-treated TFC-FO membranes exhibit a remarkably high water flux up to 90 LMH when the selective layer is oriented towards the draw solution (i.e., PRO mode) using 1M NaCl as the draw solution and DI water as the feed. For seawater desalination, the membranes display a high water flux up to 35 LMH using a 2M NaCl draw solution. These water fluxes exceeded the water fluxes achieved by other types of FO membranes reported in literatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acellulose 3adesalination 3aelectrons 3aesters 3aglycerol 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophilicity 3aosmosis 3apermeability 3apolyamides 3aseawater 3asodium chloride 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3awater reuse 0aCellulose ester 0aForward osmosis 0aThin film composite membrane1 aChung, Tai-shung,1 ade Wit, Jos.S.1 aHelmer, Bradley J.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 473 p.63-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017800173300001600351520105900367592002801426650001701454650001901471650001301490650001301503650001601516650003701532700002101569700001901590773008901609856008401698990002301782852000901805655001201814IND60095038320221119234705.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009503832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoxburgh, Craig J.10aSteric and substituent control on the photoreversibility of some novel N-alkyl-3,3′-disubstituted-6-nitro-indolospirobenzopyrans: Evaluation using UV spectroscopic studies  ap. 146-162.  aA series of novel 6-nitro substituted indolospirobenzopyrans are reported. The effects of substitution on their photoreversibility are investigated by: synthesising derivatives that possess sterically hindering (with regard to the spiropyran-opening ↔ closing) groups contained within the spirocyclic skeleton. Specifically, spirobenzopyrans possessing combinations of various N-alkyl, and/or, simultaneously, 3,3′-geminal methyl and/or cyclohexyl groups are synthesised. Further, these systems are evaluated in three solvents; methanol, acetonitrile and dichloroethane. The thermal decolourisation rates of the gem-dimethyl and 3,3′-cyclohexyl compounds are additionally evaluated at the temperature of 50 °C. The above systems, and changes in physical parameters are extensively evaluated, and the subsequent biasing of the equilibria established using UV spectroscopy. Rates of colourisation, decolourisation and the equilibrium constants are obtained. The overall photochromic ’tuneability’ of these systems is subsequently established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3adecolorization 3amethanol 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aSammes, Peter G.1 aAbdullah, Ayse0 tDyes and pigments.g2011 Aug., v. 90, no. 2 p.146-162dElsevier Ltdx0143-72087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dyepig.2010.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012100163300002000284520059000304592002800894650002900922650001200951650001300963650002200976650002200998650001601020700001301036700001801049700001701067700001701084700005601101700005301157700005401210700005601264773013601320856008001456852000901536655001201545IND60755656520221119210131.0211105e20211019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075565652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c019532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yanxin10aPractical Synthesis of (Z)-α,β-Unsaturated Nitriles via a One-Pot Sequential Hydroformylation/Knoevenagel Reaction  ap. 15413-15422.  aHerein, the synthesis of (Z)-α,β-unsaturated nitriles by a sequential hydroformylation/Knoevenagel reaction has been first developed.

Light-induced damage of the dyes and proteins were measured in aqueous solution at pH 4 and 8 under the exclusion of oxygen. The results were compared with those of bovine serum albumin, where virtually no photooxidation takes place. Non-covalent binding to the proteins is strongest for the diprotonated porphyrins. The porphyrin triplet state is longer lived due to shielding by binding to a protein but such binding essentially inhibits further reactions. Electron transfer to the excited porphyrin singlet state is indicated by a lower triplet yield for loading to lysozyme, in contrast to serum albumin. The quantum yields of protein damage are comparable and rather low, they depend on the protonation state and are largest (1.4 × 10⁻³) for the meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin/lysozyme system.

Mean round goby biomass was 5 tonnes/km² for the upper bay and 11.2 tonnes/km² for the lower bay. Round goby populations were dominated by age-0 to age-2 individuals; older individuals were rare although they constituted a greater portion of total biomass in the earlier invaded lower bay than the upper bay. Estimated round goby consumption was 78.4 tonnes/km² for the upper bay and 127.1 tonnes/km² for the lower bay; dreissenids were the most important prey followed by chironomids, Zooplankton and amphipods. Diet analysis showed that round gobies were consumed by all predator species analyzed, and constituted a high percentage of stomach content biomass in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and northern pike (Esox lucius). Age structure differences between the upper and lower bay are consistent with those expected between expanding and stable populations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBioenergetics 0aDreissenids 0aInvasive species 0aPrey 0aPredators1 aFox, Michael G.1 aJohnson, Timothy B.1 aSchaner, Ted0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2010 Dec., v. 36, no. 4 p.625-632dElsevierx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jglr.2010.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009700163300001600260520172300276592002801999650001802027650002302045650002502068650001702093650001402110650001502124650001702139650001102156650001202167650002102179650001302200650001302213650002602226650001002252650001902262653001302281653001302294653001602307700001702323700001802340700001902358700002002377700001802397700001902415700002002434773011802454856008102572852000902653655001202662IND60716372220221120172401.0201104e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071637222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Ji Yeon10aInvestigation of ginsenosides in different tissues after elicitor treatment in Panax ginseng  ap. 270-277.  aThe effect of methyl jasmonate (MJ) on ginsenoside production in different organs of ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) was evaluated after the whole plant was dipped in an MJ-containing solution. MJ can induce the production of antioxidant defense genes and secondary metabolites in plants. In ginseng, MJ treatment in adventitious root resulted in the increase of dammarenediol synthase expression but a decrease of cycloartenol synthase expression, thereby enhancing ginsenoside biosynthesis. Although a previous study focused on the application of MJ to affect ginsenoside production in adventitious roots, we conducted our research on entire plants by evaluating the effect of exogenous MJ on ginsenoside production with the aim of obtaining new approaches to study ginsenoside biosynthesis response to MJ in vivo.Different parts of MJ-treated ginseng plants were analyzed for ginsenoside contents (fine root, root body, epidermis, rhizome, stem, and leaf) by high-performance liquid chromatography.The total ginsenoside content of the ginseng root significantly increased after 2 d of MJ treatment compared with the control not subjected to MJ. Our results revealed that MJ treatment enhances ginsenoside production not in the epidermis but in the stele of the ginseng root, implying transportation of ginsenosides from the root vasculature to the epidermis. Application of MJ enhanced protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides, whereas chilling treatment induced protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type ginsenosides.These findings indicate that the production of PPD-type and PPT-type ginsenosides is differently affected by abiotic and biotic stresses in the ginseng plant, and they might play different defense mechanism roles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3aadventitious roots 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosynthesis 3aelicitors 3afine roots 3aginsenosides 3aleaves 3aliquids 3amethyl jasmonate 3aresearch 3arhizomes 3asecondary metabolites 3astele 3atransportation 0achilling 0aelicitor 0aginsenoside1 aKim, Yu-jin,1 aJang, Moon-Gi1 aJoo, Sung Chul1 aKwon, Woo-Saeng1 aKim, Se-Yeong1 aJung, Seok-Kyu1 aYang, Deok-Chun0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 38, no. 4 p.270-277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002800171245012500199300001600324520119500340592002801535650001901563650002001582650001501602650001101617650003201628650001401660650000701674650001301681650001201694650002401706650001301730650001601743650001001759650001701769650006401786650002201850650001901872653001201891653000901903653002101912653001701933653002901950700002301979700001902002773009902021856008702120852000902207655001202216IND50071416320221121043249.0190402e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007141632DNAL7 a243604502pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobert-Peillard, Fabien10aDevelopment of a simple fluorescence-based microplate method for the high-throughput analysis of proline in wine samples  ap. 274-279.  aThis paper presents a simple, accurate and multi-sample method for the determination of proline in wines thanks to a 96-well microplate technique. Proline is the most abundant amino acid in wine and is an important parameter related to wine characteristics or maturation processes of grape. In the current study, an improved application of the general method based on sodium hypochlorite oxidation and o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA)-thiol spectrofluorometric detection is described. The main interfering compounds for specific proline detection in wines are strongly reduced by selective reaction with OPA in a preliminary step under well-defined pH conditions. Application of the protocol after a 500-fold dilution of wine samples provides a working range between 0.02 and 2.90gL−1, with a limit of detection of 7.50mgL−1. Comparison and validation on real wine samples by ion-exchange chromatography prove that this procedure yields accurate results. Simplicity of the protocol used, with no need for centrifugation or filtration, organic solvents or high temperature enables its full implementation in plastic microplates and efficient application for routine analysis of proline in wines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3adetection limit 3afiltration 3agrapes 3aion exchange chromatography 3aoxidation 3apH 3aplastics 3aproline 3asodium hypochlorite 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awines 2aFluorescence 2aHigh-Throughput Screening Assaysxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aProlinexanalysis 2aWinexanalysis 0aProline 0aWine 0aMicroplate assay 0aFluorescence 0aHigh-throughput analysis1 aBoudenne, Jean-Luc1 aCoulomb, Bruno0 tFood chemistry.g2014 May 01, v. 150 p.274-279dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245010000188300001600288500001500304520130300319592002801622650001301650650003001663650001701693650001101710650003001721650002301751650002901774650001301803650001201816650003101828650001401859650001801873650001201891650002001903650001701923650003001940650003601970650002802006650003902034653002502073700002002098700001702118700002002135773010002155852000902255856008202264655001202346IND4428337020221121061246.0190430e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442833702DNAL7 a197280682pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-009-0397-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRachamadugu, Rakesh10aIdentification and expression analysis of infectious laryngotracheitis virus encoding microRNAs  ap. 301-308.  a2019-12-06  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that play a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression at the post transcriptional level. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alphaherpesvirus belonging to the herpesviridae family. It causes an acute respiratory disorder in chicken resulting in high mortality rates. ILTV encoding miRNAs have been identified in cell cultures infected by ILTV. Seven candidates ILTV encoding miRNAs were identified by the 454 FLX genome sequencing method. Five ILTV miRNAs identified in this study were identical to those previously reported by Waidner et al. (Virology 388:128, 2009). Two unique ILTV miRNAs, iltv-miR-I1-3p and iltv-miR-I7-3p, were identified in this study. The iltv-miR-I1-3p is the passenger strand of I1-5p, which was previously known. The iltv-miR-I7-3p showed a perfect match with the complementary passenger strand in contrast to other miRNA species showing imperfect complementarity with the passenger strand. The I7-3p was mapped in the replication origin (oriL) of the palindrome stem loop sequence of the ILTV genome. Expression of all ILTV miRNAs were confirmed by the end point PCR using small RNA libraries generated from either ILTV infected or uninfected control chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 1 3acell culture 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areplication origin 3atranscription (genetics) 3amicroRNA 3akidneys 3agene expression regulation 3amortality 3aRNA libraries 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHerpesvirus 1, Gallidxgenetics 2aMicroRNAsxbiosynthesis 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 0aGallid herpesvirus 11 aLee, Jeong Yoon1 aWooming, Ann1 aKong, Byung-Whi0 tVirus genes.g2009 Dec., v. 39, no. 3 p.301-308dSpringer USwJournal:jnl53274x0920-85697nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-009-0397-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02984naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009800171300001600269520171200285592002801997650001302025650001902038650002102057650002202078650001402100650001602114650001502130650002702145650002502172650002402197650001002221700002802231700001902259700001902278700001902297700002902316700002102345700003402366773009302400856004802493852000902541655001202550IND4480779620221120112219.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448077962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-011-9569-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreisigacker, Susanne10aGenetic structures of the CIMMYT international yield trial targeted to irrigated environments  ap. 529-541.  aInternational yield trials are assembled by CIMMYT to disseminate promising wheat breeding materials worldwide. To assess the genomic structure and linkage disequilibrium (LD) within this germplasm, wheat lines disseminated during 25 years of the Elite Spring Wheat Yield Trial (ESWYT) targeted for irrigated environments of the world were genotyped with the high-throughput Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) marker system. Analyses of population structure assigned the ESWYT germplasm into five major sub-populations that are shaped by prominent CIMMYT wheat lines and their descendants. Based on genetic distance, we concluded that a constant level of genetic diversity was maintained over the years of ESWYT dissemination. Genetic distance between the individual ESWYT lines significantly increased when the ESWYT were grouped according to the differences in years of ESWYT dissemination, suggesting a systematic change in allele frequencies over time, most probably due to breeding and directional selection. By means of multiple regression analyses, 78 markers displaying a significant change in allele frequency across years were identified and interpreted as an indicator for constant selection. The markers identified were partly associated with grain yield, leaf, stem, and yellow rust and point to key genomic regions for further investigation. Large numbers of adjacent DArT marker pairs showed significant LD across the ESWYT population and within each of the five sub-populations identified. Sub-population differentiation measured by the fixation index and average genetic distance were highly correlated with LD levels, suggesting that the sub-populations themselves explain much of the LD.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3agene frequency 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3apopulation structure 3aregression analysis 3awheat1 aShewayrga, Hailemichael1 aCrossa, José,1 aArief, Vivi N.1 aDeLacy, Ian H.1 aSingh, R.

Rhizobia response and legume interaction under Al conditions are still unknown; it is important to understand how to develop and improve legume cultivation under Al stress. In this study, rhizobia response was recorded under different Al concentrations. Al effect on rhizobial cells was characterized by combination with different two pH conditions. Symbiosis process was compared between α- and β-rhizobia inoculated onto soybean varieties. Rhizobial cell numbers was decreased as Al concentration increased. However, induced Al tolerance considerably depended on rhizobia types and their origins. Accordingly, organic acid results were in correlation with growth rate and cell density which suggested that citric acid might be a positive selective force for Al tolerance and plant interaction on rhizobia. Al toxicity delayed and interrupted the plant–rhizobia interaction and the effect was more pronounced under acidic conditions. Burkholderia fungorum VTr35 significantly improved plant growth under acid–Al stress in combination with all soybean varieties. Moreover, plant genotype was an important factor to establish an effective nodulation and nitrogen fixation under Al stress. Additionally, tolerant rhizobia could be applied as an inoculant on stressful agroecosystems. Furthermore, metabolic pathways have still been unknown under Al stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aagroecosystems 3aaluminum 3acitric acid 3agenotype 3amutualism 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3anutrient uptake 3apH 3aplant growth 3asoil fertility 3asoybeans 3atoxicity 0aaluminum stress 0aBradyrhizobium 0aBurkholderia 0acitric acid 0aGlycine max1 aSilva, Jéssica D.1 aOhkama-Ohtsu, Naoko1 aYokoyama, Tadashi0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2018, v. 64, no. 8 p.511-526dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2018-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013200166300001600298520118700314592002801501650001001529650001801539650002001557650002401577650001201601650001201613650001501625650002401640650001201664650001101676650001301687650001301700653001901713653003101732653002901763653003201792653001801824700001401842700002001856700001701876700001601893700002001909700001901929700002101948700001701969700001801986773011802004856008102122852000902203655001202212IND60716372520221122014004.0201104e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071637252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2014.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Soo-Hyun13aAn 8-wk, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for the antidiabetic effects of hydrolyzed ginseng extract  ap. 239-243.  aTo investigate the antidiabetic effects of hydrolyzed ginseng extract (HGE) for Korean participants in an 8-wk, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Impaired fasting glucose participants [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 5.6mM or < 6.9mM] who had not been diagnosed with any disease and met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this study. The 23 participants were randomly divided into either the HGE (n = 12, 960 mg/d) or placebo (n = 11) group. Outcomes included measurements of efficacy (FPG, postprandial glucose, fasting plasma insulin, postprandial insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance, and homeostatic model assessment-β) and safety (adverse events, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and vital signs).After 8 wk of HGE supplementation, FPG and postprandial glucose were significantly decreased in the HGE group compared to the placebo group. No clinically significant changes in any safety parameter were observed. Our study revealed that HGE is a potent antidiabetic agent that does not produce noticeable adverse effects.HGE supplementation may be effective for treating impaired fasting glucose individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3ablood glucose 3aclinical trials 3aelectrocardiography 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ainsulin 3amodels 3aplacebos 3aresearch 0aclinical trial 0ahydrolyzed ginseng extract 0aimpaired fasting glucose 0aoral glucose tolerance test 0aPanax ginseng1 aOh, Mi-Ra1 aChoi, Eun-Kyung1 aKim, Min-Gul1 aHa, Ki-Chan1 aLee, Seung-Kwon1 aKim, Yong-gon,1 aPark, Byung-Hyun1 aKim, Dal-Sik1 aChae, Soo-Wan0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 38, no. 4 p.239-243dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2014.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014800164300001800312520147500330592002801805650000801833650003101841650001301872650001001885650001901895650001401914650001901928650001301947650001301960650001501973650004301988650005202031650002002083653001802103653001402121653001402135653002302149700001402172700001802186773013302204856008702337852000902424655001202433IND60576489520221117030359.0170804e20170804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057648952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b002432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tao10aQuantitative Proteomics Reveals Potential Crosstalk between a Small RNA CoaR and a Two-Component Regulator Slr1037 in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803  ap. 2954-2963.  aBacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) and two-component systems (TCSs) were two vital regulatory mechanisms employed by microorganisms to respond to environmental changes and stresses. As a promising “autotrophic cell factory”, photosynthetic cyanobacteria have attracted a lot of attention these years. Although most studies focused on studying the roles of sRNAs or TCS regulators in stress response in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, limited work has elucidated their potential crosstalk. Our previous work has identified a negative sRNA regulator CoaR and a positive response regulator Slr1037 both related to 1-butanol stress regulation in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. In this work, the potential crosstalk between CoaR and Slr1307 (i.e., the coregulated genes mediated by CoaR and Slr1037) was identified and validated through quantitative proteomics and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. The results showed that the sensitive phenotype to 1-butanol of Δslr1037 could be rescued by suppressing coaR in Δslr1037, probably due to the fact that some target genes of Slr1037 could be reactivated by repression of CoaR. Twenty-eight coregulated proteins mediated by CoaR and Slr1037 were found through quantitative proteomics, and 10 of the annotated proteins were validated via qRT-PCR. This study proved the existence of crosstalk between sRNAs and response regulators and provided new insights into the coregulation of biofuel resistance in cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSynechocystis sp.

Local conservation biologists and an international team of veterinary and husbandry personnel evaluated, treated, and repatriated the majority of turtles (88%) over a 3-mo period. Common pathologic findings included ophthalmic, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal lesions, including keratitis, osteomyelitis of the shell and digits, pododermatitis, and colonic nematodiasis. Hemogram results indicated severe leukocytosis in many individuals. Specimens for genetic analysis and molecular diagnostics were archived, and several intact carcasses were established as museum specimens. International collaboration may be required to ensure the confiscation and survival of illegally traded endangered wildlife, with ongoing efforts toward enhancing the law enforcement, husbandry, and veterinary capacity of range country personnel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3aSiebenrockiella 3adiagnostic techniques 3aforests 3agastrointestinal system 3agenetic analysis 3ahuman resources 3akeratitis 3alaw enforcement 3amusculoskeletal system 3amuseums 3aosteomyelitis 3apododermatitis 3atrade 3awildlife 0aPalawan forest turtle 0aSiebenrockiella leytensis 0aconfiscation 0apoaching 0aveterinary1 aConley, Kenneth1 aGibbons, Paul1 aStacy, Nicole I.1 aWalden, Heather D.S.1 aMartelli, Paolo1 aLuz, Sonja1 aKrishnasamy, Karthiyani1 aHagen, Cris1 aSykes, John1 aAcosta, Diverlie1 aTabug, Kyle1 aO'Connor, Matthew1 aWilson, Vicente Vergara1 aLiu, J.

Additionally, the effect of steaming on CeCs bioaccessibility was also investigated for the first time. Overall, steaming affected differentially contaminants' concentrations, for instance, decreasing PFOS levels in flounder, but increasing both BDE47 and BDE100. CeCs bioaccessibility varied according to seafood species and contaminant group, i.e. in general, lower bioaccessibility values were obtained for PBDEs (<70%, except for mackerel), while PFCs and PPCPs revealed higher bioaccessibility percentages (between 71 and 95%). The lowest bioaccessibility value was obtained for α-HBCD (mussel; 14%), whereas the highest percentage was observed in venlafaxine (mullet; 95%). Our preliminary study reports also, for the first time, the effects of steaming on CeCs bioaccessibility. In most cases, bioaccessibility was not affected by cooking, however, a decrease was observed in PBDEs and venlafaxine bioaccessibility in steamed mussels and mullet, respectively, thus lowering the potential health risks associated with seafood consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethylparaben 3arisk 3amussels 3amullet 3aflame retardants 3aUV filters 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3aflounder 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aseafoods 3amackerel 3atoxicology 3apersonal care products 3aseafood consumption 3asteaming 3acooking 3amarkets 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 0aPFOS 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aPharmaceuticals and personal care products 0aPCBs 0aCeCs 0aSeafood 0aBIO 0aBD 0aBDE47 0aPBDEs 0aPPCPs 0aBDE100 0aPFUnA 0app 0aBFRs 0aPFOA 0aPerfluorinated compounds 0aBDE99 0aSteaming 0aOC 0aKow 0aPFCs 0aNBIO 0areports 0aα-HBCD 0aBioaccessibility1 aMaulvault, Ana L.1 aBarbosa, Vera L.1 aCunha, Sara1 aKwadijk, Christiaan J.A.F.1 aÁlvarez-Muñoz, Diana1 aRodríguez-Mozaz, Sara1 aAznar-Alemany, Òscar1 aEljarrat, Ethel1 aBarceló, Damià,1 aFernandez-Tejedor, Margarita1 aTediosi, Alice1 aMarques, António0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 June, v. 104 p.69-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012800161520221300289592002802502650001202530650002302542650002502565650001602590650002702606650002002633650001002653650002202663650002702685650002102712650001702733650001502750650001502765651001302780700002002793700002502813700002202838700001802860700002202878700001402900700002102914700002002935773012702955856007303082852000903155655001203164IND60652028120221120174533.0190712e20170912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065202812DNAL7 a10.3390/su90916112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaloch, Mazhar H.12aA Research on Electricity Generation from Wind Corridors of Pakistan (Two Provinces): A Technical Proposal for Remote Zones  aThe non-renewable energy resources are limited and depleting gradually. As such, energy security has attained the greatest amount of attention globally than ever before. In the meantime, energy crises are already affecting the developing countries such as Pakistan, even though one-third of the population of the country is not even not connected to the national electricity grid. The population with access to on-grid electricity is enduring load shedding of more than 12 h a day. This situation is alarming and require immediate attention is required so as to add alternative energy resources to the country, which has long been relying on imported fuels. It is, therefore, high time that the abundant potential in the renewable energy resources of Pakistan such as solar, wind, and biomass are harnessed. These renewable energy resources are economical and environmentally friendly, and thus considered as sustainable, and the utilization of these in meeting energy demands can help to conserve conventional resources early diminishing. This paper provides a detailed description of the energy consumption and load-shedding scenario in Pakistan thereby focusing specifically Sindh and Baluchistan provinces. Since, wind energy is considered one of the cost-effective renewable resources, six potential sites in these two provinces are considered in this study. These sites lie within 250 km of the southeastern and 800 km of the southwestern regions of Pakistan. One-year wind speed data have been reported for variable heights of these proposed sites which represent to have an annual average wind speed of 6.63 m/s and 5.33 m/s respectively. The power generation data for these location of two provinces is 7.653 GWh, and 5.456 GWh per annum respectively. This study also elaborates on the advantages and disadvantages of harvesting and installing the wind energy and provides a technical proposal for the generation of electricity from the wind in the selected remote zones which are off the national grid. The findings of this paper will help concerned government departments to devise appropriate policies and attract investment in the wind energy sector to eradicate the on-going electricity crisis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy industry 3afuels 3aissues and policy 3anonrenewable resources 3apower generation 3asolar energy 3awind power 3awind speed 3aPakistan1 aAbro, Safdar A.1 aSarwar Kaloi, Ghulam1 aMirjat, Nayyar H.1 aTahir, Sohaib1 aNadeem, M.

Location Austrian Alps. Methods We used species distribution models to predict environmentally suitable sites for 183 Alpine plants at a fine spatial resolution (100 × 100 m2). We overlaid these predictions with independent mapping data (3′× 5′) and calculated the extent to which species fill their potential ranges at this coarser grain based on several different approaches. Moreover, we correlated range‐filling estimates with the magnitude of improvement of distribution models when using the distance to putative glacial refugia as an additional independent variable. Finally, we compared species‐specific range‐filling estimates with traits related to dispersal capacity and competitive ability of these species as well as with characteristics of their habitats. Results Even under a conservative approach, incomplete range filling appears common, with 46% and 31% of the species studied occurring in less than 75% and 50% of their predicted suitable ranges, respectively. Proximity to glacial refugia generally accounts for a lower percentage of the deviance in species distribution data (0–20%, mean 4%) than environmental variables (9–57%, mean 27%). However, its importance correlates closely and negatively with the calculated range‐filling estimates. Range filling significantly increases with the dispersal capacity of a species' propagules and the breadth of its altitudinal niche. Calcicolous species have lower range filling than silicicolous plants and substrate generalists. Conclusions Our results suggest that the current ranges of many Alpine plants are still shaped by delayed Holocene recolonization of suitable sites. Hence, long‐term migration lags also affect plant distribution in mountainous areas, at least on regional scales. These findings question whether high mountain floras will be able to track the expected rapid, climate change driven shifts in habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine plants 3aenvironmental models 3acorrelation 3ageographical distribution 3arefuge habitats 3ainterspecific variation 3aspecies dispersal 3aniches 3amountains 3aclimate change 3aflora 3aphytogeography 3acalcicoles 3aplant competition 3aaltitude 3aseed dispersal 3aAustria 3aAlps region 0aspecies differences1 aWillner, W.1 aPlutzar, C.1 aEnglisch, T.1 aSchratt‐Ehrendorfer, L.1 aMoser, D.1 aErtl, S.1 aEssl, F.1 aNiklfeld, H.0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2012 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.829-840dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00732.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010200169520183300271592002802104650002502132650002502157650002002182650001702202650001502219650002602234650001002260650003002270650001002300650002502310650002602335650001502361650001102376650001202387650001302399650001302412650001202425650001302437651001602450651000902466651001702475653002702492653002402519653003102543653003102574700005802605700002102663700002802684773013202712856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60659447420221119165611.0191126e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065944742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2019.1257352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Mahshid10aLandscape connectivity for mammalian megafauna along the Iran-Turkmenistan-Afghanistan borderland  aHabitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity, causes population isolation and reduces the availability of resources. When species ranges span geopolitical borders, management of transboundary populations and securing their connectivity can be compromised by different conservation priorities and juridical efforts. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and circuit theory, we modelled suitable habitats for four conservation-dependent mammalian megafauna in northeastern Iran, bordering Turkmenistan and Afghanistan which is part of the larger Kopet Dag Ecoregion in central Asia. Our multispecies approach aimed to identify key habitats and potential national and international corridors for Persian leopard (Panthera pardus), bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus), urial (Ovis orientalis) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) based on environmental variables. Between 18 to 34% of the study area was identified as suitable habitat for each species with a moderate variability in coverage by conservation network, ranging between 14 to 43%). Importantly, we identified three key landscapes which can enhance the connectivity between main populations of the species in northeastern Iran as well as neighboring countries. Most of the suitable landscapes along the Iran-Turkmenistan borderlands are protected on the Iranian side, providing a source for landscape connectivity across the border. In contrast, the main suitable landscapes for megafauna in northeastern Iran are located far from the Afghan border. Our multispecies approach provided an empirical framework for spatial conservation planning for the mammalian megafauna across the Kopet Dag Ecoregion and can direct future survey efforts to identify critical wildlife areas in Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, two countries with scarce data on biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus aegarus 3aGazella subgutturosa 3aPanthera pardus 3abiodiversity 3aecoregions 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3agoats 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amouflon 3aplanning 3apolitics 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aAfghanistan 3aIran 3aTurkmenistan 0aLandscape connectivity 0aKopet Dag Ecoregion 0aTransboundary conservation 0aSpecies distribution model1 aFarashi, Azita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8373-11051 aKhānī, ʻAlī,1 aFarhadinia, Mohammad S.0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2019 Dec., v. 52 p.125735-dElsevier GmbHaElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2019.1257353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011100169520134700280536017701627592002801804596001301832596001601845650001201861650001101873650001401884650002501898650001201923650002901935650002501964650001801989650001402007650000902021650001902030650000902049651001002058653001202068653000902080653002002089653003802109700001502147700001602162700001802178700001302196700001602209773012902225856008602354852000902440655001202449IND60722400120221118022141.0210707e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072240012DNAL7 a10.1080/20964129.2020.17339212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Mingxing10aEcological risk assessment of soil cadmium in China’s coastal economic development zone: a meta-analysis  aThe coastal area of China has faced major strategic planning and environmental pollution, including heavy metals pollution. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of Cd pollution on the ecology in coastal areas of China. A soil Cd pollution database of 300 counties or districts in coastal areas was screened from academic dissertations and academic journal papers. Based on the database, the ecological risk was evaluated using entropy methods and probabilistic ecological risk assessment (PERA), and the advantages and disadvantages of these methods were analyzed. In China’s coastal areas, the soil Cd content in 10.33% of the counties was higher than the minimum of risk control value (1.5 mg/kg), and in 4.00% of the counties was higher than the maximum of risk control value (4.0 mg/kg). The ecological risks were highly compatible with national strategic planning areas. Guangxi Province, Zhejiang Province, and Guangdong Province ranked among the top three coastal areas for soil Cd contamination, and the ecological risks were 18.80%, 17.89%, and 15.77% at the maximum no-effect concentration/lowest effect concentration (NOEC/LOEC) level. This study can provide insights to policymakers regarding the protection of ecosystems threatened by heavy metals in the process of regional strategic planning.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41901255]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Science [XDA20010303].  aPublisher supplied data  a41901255  aXDA20010303 3acadmium 3acoasts 3adatabases 3aeconomic development 3aentropy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental health 3ameta-analysis 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asoil 3aChina 0aCadmium 0asoil 0aecological risk 0acoastal economic development zone1 aWang, Ting1 aXu, Xiangbo1 aZhang, Linxiu1 aLi, Jing1 aShi, Yajuan0 tEcosystem health and sustainability.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 6, no. 1 p.1733921-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23063x2332-88787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2020.17339213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245010000166300001600266520142600282592002801708650002001736650002701756650001701783650002801800650001101828650002001839650001001859650002101869650001801890650001301908650001401921650001401935650001701949650001601966650002001982650001602002650001002018650001402028650001402042650002402056653002002080653002102100653002702121653001502148653001002163700001802173700002202191773012402213856007702337852000902414655001202423IND60644006420221119093807.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064400642DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2018-00402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Tristan T.10aPseudomonads contribute to regulation of Pratylenchus penetrans (Nematoda) populations on apple  ap. 775-785.  aInoculation with antagonistic soil microorganisms has shown potential to suppress replant disease of apple in orchard soils. Pseudomonas spp. may have the potential to reduce Pratylenchus penetrans populations on apple. Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet cherry and screened for antagonistic characteristics. Two highly antagonistic Pseudomonas isolates, P10-32 and P10-42, were evaluated for growth promotion of apple seedlings, suppression of P. penetrans populations, and root colonization in soil from three orchards. During the isolate screening, Pseudomonas fluorescens P10-32 reduced in vitro growth of fungal pathogens, had protease activity, had capacity to produce pyrrolnitrin, suppressed P. penetrans populations, and increased plant biomass. Pseudomonas fluorescens P10-42 reduced in vitro growth of fungal pathogens, had protease activity, suppressed P. penetrans populations, and increased plant biomass. In potted orchard soil, inoculating apple with P. fluorescens P10-32 suppressed P. penetrans populations in one of the three soils examined. Inoculation with P. fluorescens P10-42 improved plant growth in two of the soils and suppressed P. penetrans abundance in one soil. In one of the soils, P. fluorescens P10-42 was detected on the roots 56 days postinoculation. Overall, we conclude that Pseudomonas spp. play a role in suppressing P. penetrans on apple in orchard soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aPratylenchus penetrans 3aPrunus avium 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aapples 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agrowth promotion 3aorchard soils 3aorchards 3apathogens 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aproteinases 3areplant disease 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3asoil microorganisms 0areplant disease 0aPseudomonas spp. 0aPratylenchus penetrans 0abiocontrol 0aapple1 aForge, Tom A.1 aNelson, Louise M.0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2018, v. 64, no. 11 p.775-785dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2018-00403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520123100280592002801511650001801539650001301557650001901570650001601589650002801605650002201633650001801655650001301673650001401686650001701700650002001717650002701737650000901764650001301773650001701786653000901803653000701812653001001819653000801829700001901837700001801856700002001874700002101894700001901915700001801934700001901952700001901971773011801990856008102108852000902189655001202198IND60716373020221121175235.0201104e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071637302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2014.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jung-Bum10aRg3-enriched Korean Red Ginseng improves vascular function in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 244-250.  aPanax ginseng has distinct and impressive health benefits, such as improved blood pressure and immune system functioning. Rg3-enriched Korean Red Ginseng (REKRG) isolated from Korean Red Ginseng contains a high percentage of Rg3.In this study, we examined the effects of REKRG on endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and vascular function in rats.REKRG dose-dependently increased eNOS phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cells. In addition, REKRG markedly inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated induction of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expressions in endothelial cells. REKRG improved endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared with controls. Furthermore, REKRG treatment for 6 weeks increased serum NO levels and reduced the mean aortic intima-media thickness compared with controls.Taken together, these results suggest that REKRG increased vascular function and improved immune system functioning. Therefore, REKRG is a very useful food for preventing or improving various cardiovascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3aadhesion 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acell adhesion molecules 3aendothelial cells 3aimmune system 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arats 3aresearch 3avasodilation 0aeNOS 0aNO 0aREKRG 0aSHR1 aKwon, Sun Kwan1 aNagar, Harsha1 aJung, Saet-byel1 aJeon, Byeong Hwa1 aKim, Chang Sup1 aOh, Jin Hwan,1 aSong, Hee-Jung1 aKim, Cuk-Seong0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 38, no. 4 p.244-250dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2014.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03922naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245010300201300001600304500002000320506007600340520151400416592002801930596002901958596007401987596010202061596010202163506003702265650001602302650002302318650000802341650002002349650002002369650002302389650002202412650001802434650001102452650001602463650002002479650001302499650001802512650001602530650002602546650001002572650001702582650001402599650001102613650001402624650001702638700002502655700001802680700001802698700002102716700002102737700001902758700002402777700002302801700006002824700002402884700002002908700006102928773012902989856007303118852000903191655001203200IND60632724620221207143702.0190315e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063272462DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.130142doi7 aPMC64195812pmcid7 a302306952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGinn, Michaela10aMolecular tools enabling pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) as a model plant and oilseed cash cover crop  ap. 776-788.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThlapsi arvense L. (pennycress) is being developed as a profitable oilseed cover crop for the winter fallow period throughout the temperate regions of the world, controlling soil erosion and nutrients run‐off on otherwise barren farmland. We demonstrate that pennycress can serve as a user‐friendly model system akin to Arabidopsis that is well‐suited for both laboratory and field experimentation. We sequenced the diploid genome of the spring‐type Spring 32‐10 inbred line (1C DNA content of 539 Mb; 2n = 14), identifying variation that may explain phenotypic differences with winter‐type pennycress, as well as predominantly a one‐to‐one correspondence with Arabidopsis genes, which makes translational research straightforward. We developed an Agrobacterium‐mediated floral dip transformation method (0.5% transformation efficiency) and introduced CRISPR‐Cas9 constructs to produce indel mutations in the putative FATTY ACID ELONGATION1 (FAE1) gene, thereby abolishing erucic acid production and creating an edible seed oil comparable to that of canola. We also stably transformed pennycress with the Euonymus alatus diacylglycerol acetyltransferase (EaDAcT) gene, producing low‐viscosity acetyl‐triacylglycerol‐containing seed oil suitable as a diesel‐engine drop‐in fuel. Adoption of pennycress as a model system will accelerate oilseed‐crop translational research and facilitate pennycress’ rapid domestication to meet the growing sustainable food and fuel demands.  aPublisher supplied data  cWalton Family Foundation  aDOE BER SC0012459cU.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, OBER  a2014‐67009‐22305cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture,  a2015‐67013‐22815cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture,0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aDNA 3aEuonymus alatus 3aThlaspi arvense 3aacetyltransferases 3aagricultural land 3abiotechnology 3acanola 3acover crops 3adiacylglycerols 3adiploidy 3adomestication 3aerucic acid 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3ainbred lines 3aphenotype 3arunoff 3aseed oils 3asoil erosion1 aPhippen, Winthrop B.1 aChopra, Ratan1 aBansal, Sunil1 aJarvis, Brice A.1 aPhippen, Mary E.1 aDorn, Kevin M.1 aEsfahanian, Maliheh1 aNazarenus, Tara J.1 aCahoon, Edgar B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7277-11761 aDurrett, Timothy P.1 aMarks, M.

Although bursts of transposable elements are common in many plant lineages, how plant DNA methylation is related to transposon bursts remains unclear. Here we explore the landscape of DNA methylation of tea, a species thought to have experienced a recent transposon burst event. This species possesses more transposable elements than any other sequenced asterids (potato, tomato, coffee, pepper and tobacco). The overall average DNA methylation levels were found to differ among the tea, potato and tomato genomes, and methylation at CHG sequence sites was found to be significantly higher in tea than that in potato or tomato. Moreover, the abundant TEs resulting from burst events not only resulted in tea developing a very large genome size, but also affected many genes involved in importantly biological processes, including caffeine, theanine and flavonoid metabolic pathway genes. In addition, recently transposed TEs were more heavily methylated than ancient ones, implying that DNA methylation is proportionate to the degree of TE silencing, especially on recent active ones. Taken together, our results show that DNA methylation regulates transposon silencing and may play a role in genome size expansion.  aPublisher supplied data  a31501031cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cProgram for Excellent Youth Talents  cProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province University  cPre‐eminent Youth Fund  cDistinguished Young Scholars in Fujian Province  a2016GGJS‐13cYouth Backbone Teachers Plant of XYNU  cNanhu Scholars Program for Young Scholars of XYNU0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3abiochemical pathways 3abiotechnology 3acaffeine 3aflavonoids 3agenes 3alandscapes 3apepper 3apotatoes 3atea 3atheanine 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3atransposons1 aShi, Yan1 aChang, Xiaojun1 aJing, Shengli1 aZhang, Qunjie1 aYou, Chenjiang1 aYuan, Hongyu1 aWang, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7213-927X0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2019 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.826-835dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.130183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245011400164300001800278520217200296592002802468650002002496650001302516650002002529650001002549650001502559650001202574650002502586650001902611650001002630650001002640650001702650650002202667650001002689650000902699650001802708650002402726650001802750651001102768700001802779700002702797700002502824700002002849700002202869700002102891773010102912856008503013852000903098655001203107IND4458735520221117231117.0141112e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445873552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrap, Jean10aHumus macro-morphology and soil microbial community changes along a 130-yr-old Fagus sylvatica chronosequence  ap. 1553-1562.  aWe aimed to characterize humus macro-morphology and the associated soil microbial community within the unmodified litter (OL), the fragmented and humified layers (FH) and the organo-mineral (A) layer along a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest chronosequence with four stand age-classes (15-, 65-, 95-, 130-yr-old) in Normandy, France. Humus macro-morphology was described with 36 quantitative and semi-quantitative variables. We measured microbial biomass N (Nₘᵢc), microbial N quotient (Nₘᵢc-to-Nₜ), fungal ergosterol, bacterial and fungal DNA using 16S and 18S rDNA real-time qPCR and evaluated the potential metabolic profile of heterotrophic bacteria within each soil layer and stand age-class. The log-transform ergosterol/fungal DNA ratio (EFR index) was used as an indicator related to active fungal biomass and the fungal/bacterial (F/B) ratio was calculated from qPCR results. There was a shift from mull (mainly dysmull) to moder humus forms along the chronosequence. While the Nₘᵢc did not change significantly, the Nₘᵢc-to-Nₜ decreased along the chronosequence in the OL layer. Ergosterol content increased in FH and A layers and the F/B ratio increased in the FH layer with increasing beech forest age. The EFR index was significantly higher in the OL and A layers of the oldest stands, whereas the highest EFR index in the FH layer occurred in the 15-yr-old stands. The functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria was greater within OL and FH layers of 130-yr-old stands, but highest in the A layer of 15-yr-old stands while the Average Well Color Development remained stable for all soil layers. We found significant correlations between macro-morphology and microbial variables, especially between FH-based morphology and fungal biomass. Our main results are that beech forest maturation is accompanied by (1) an increase in fungal biomass in the FH layers and, (2) an increase in heterotrophic bacteria functional diversity in the organic layers. We have identified key macro-morphology variables that are good predictors of the structural and functional profile of the soil microbial community during beech forest development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3abacteria 3achronosequences 3acolor 3aergosterol 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3afungal anatomy 3afungi 3ahumus 3ametabolomics 3amicrobial biomass 3amoder 3amull 3aribosomal DNA 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil profiles 3aFrance1 aLaval, Karine1 aAkpa-Vinceslas, Marthe1 aGangneux, Christophe1 aBureau, Fabrice1 aDecaëns, Thibaud1 aAubert, Michael,0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.1553-1562dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007900161300001600240520091600256592002801172650002401200650001301224650001101237650001501248650001701263650000901280650000901289650002101298650001101319650003101330650003301361650001101394650000901405653002401414653001501438653000801453653002101461653001901482700002001501700002301521700002101544700002201565773012301587856007701710852000901787655001201796IND60644006820221119093914.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064400682DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2018-00502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBankar, Ashok10aMorphological response of Yarrowia lipolytica under stress of heavy metals  ap. 559-566.  aThe marine dimorphic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has been proposed as a suitable model for the dimorphism study.

Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the morphological features of yeast cells. This study revealed that the normal ellipsoidal shape of yeast cells was changed into oval, rounded, or elongated in response to different heavy-metal stress. Light microscopy was also used to investigate individual properties of yeast cells. The average cell length and radius of both marine strains was increased with increasing concentrations of heavy-metal ions. In addition, the elongation factor was calculated and was increased in the presence of heavy metals like Pb(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Cr(VI), and Zn(II) under the static conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3achromium 3acobalt 3adimorphism 3aheavy metals 3aions 3alead 3alight microscopy 3amodels 3apeptide elongation factors 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ayeasts 3azinc 0aYarrowia lipolytica 0adimorphism 0aSEM 0alight microscopy 0abioremediation1 aZinjarde, Smita1 aTelmore, Aishwarya1 aWalke, Aishwarya1 aRavikumar, Ameeta0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2018, v. 64, no. 8 p.559-566dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44722x1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2018-00503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245011000168300001600278520119200294592002801486650002501514650002301539650002501562650001701587650002301604650001601627650001101643650001701654650001601671650001701687650000901704650001901713650001201732650002401744650002601768650002801794650001001822650001401832650001101846650002101857650001901878650001701897700002101914700001801935700001701953700001601970773008301986856007302069852000902142655001202151IND60132355720221118234704.0150505e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013235572DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.122282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelraheem, Abdelraheem10aGenetic analysis and quantitative trait locus mapping of PEG‐induced osmotic stress tolerance in cotton  ap. 111-120.  aWater stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that adversely affect cotton production. Seedlings of 142 backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from Pima cotton ‘Pima S‐7’ (Gossypium barbadense L.) × Upland cotton ‘Sure‐Grow 747’(G. hirsutum L.) were evaluated in two tests for plant height, fresh shoot weight and root weight under two treatments (5% PEG and water‐control conditions) using a hydroponic system in the greenhouse. The experiment in each test was a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The analysis of variance for the two tests detected significant genotypic variation in PEG‐induced stress tolerance within the BIL population and between the parents. Heritabilities were moderate to high and were higher under the control conditions than under the PEG treatment, and the three traits were also significantly and positively correlated.

In one of the experiments the rats were instilled with Me-NPs intratracheally (i.t.) (for performing a broncho-alveolar lavage in 24h to estimate the cytological and biochemical indices of the response of the lower airways), while in the other, Me-NPs were repeatedly injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) 18 times during 6 weeks (for estimating the accumulation of corresponding metals in the blood and their excretion with urine and feces and for assessing subchronic intoxication by a large number of functional and morphological indices). Mathematical description of the results from both experiments with the help of the Response Surface Methodology has shown that, as well as in the case of any other binary toxic combinations previously investigated by us, the response of the organism to a simultaneous exposure to any two of the Me-NPs under study is characterized by complex interactions between all possible types of combined toxicity (additivity, subadditivity or superadditivity of unidirectional action and different variants of opposite effects) depending on which effect it is estimated for as well as on the levels of the effect and dose. With any third Me-NP species acting in the background, the type of combined toxicity displayed by the other two may change significantly (as in the earlier described case of a triple combination of soluble metal salts). It is shown that various harmful effects produced by CuO-NP+ZnO-NP+PbO-NP combination may be substantially attenuated by giving rats per os a complex of innocuous bioactive substances theoretically expected to provide a protective integral and/or metal-specific effect during one month before i.t. instillation or during the entire period of i.p. injections.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acupric oxide 3aexcretion 3afeces 3alead 3ananoparticles 3apoisoning 3arats 3aresponse surface methodology 3asalts 3atoxicity 3aurine 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aNanotoxicology 0aCombined toxicity 0aCopper oxide 0aZinc oxide 0aLead oxide 0aBioprotectors1 aKatsnelson, Boris A.1 aPanov, Vladimir G.1 aPrivalova, Larisa I.1 aVaraksin, Anatoly N.1 aGurvich, Vladimir B.1 aSutunkova, Marina P.1 aShur, Vladimir Ya.1 aShishkina, Ekaterina V.1 aValamina, Irene E.1 aZubarev, Ilya V.1 aMakeyev, Oleg H.1 aMeshtcheryakova, Ekaterina Y.1 aKlinova, Svetlana V.0 tToxicology.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 380 p.72-93dElsevier B.V.x0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2017.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01338naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009800156300001800254520033100272592002800603650000800631650002700639650002300666650002300689650001700712650001400729650002100743700001500764700001500779773013400794856007500928852000901003655001201012IND60658688520221117181017.0190826e20100817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065868852DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc01392g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaojin10aAptamer based reversible DNA induced hydrogel system for molecular recognition and separation  ap. 6308-6310.  aAn aptamer-based DNA strand, captured with a specific molecule from a multi-species system, was used to initiate crosslinking of the hydrogel.

In particular, GDF/F4, the most effective inhibitor, blocked the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), c-Jun-activated protein kinase (JNK), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1/2 (STAT-1/2) among the signal transcription pathways involved. Further, GDF/F4 also inhibited the glycosaminoglycan release from interleukin-1α-treated rabbit cartilage culture (30.6% inhibition at 30 μg/mL).Some preparations from Korean Red Ginseng and ginseng leaves, particularly GDF/F4, may possess the protective activity against cartilage degradation in joint disorders, and may have potential as new therapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3acartilage 3acollagen 3aethanol 3aginsenosides 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahumans 3aleaves 3amatrix metalloproteinase 13 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3arabbits 3aresearch 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3aKorean Peninsula 0acartilage protection 0aginsenoside 0amatrix metalloproteinase1 aShehzad, Omer1 aKo, Sung Kwon1 aKim, Yeong Shik1 aKim, Hyun Pyo0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2015 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.54-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010600167520136700273536013701640592002801777596004301805650002201848650002101870650002001891650002701911650001501938650002501953650001101978650002001989650002902009650001202038650001702050651001002067653002602077653003502103653003702138653003502175653002302210653004302233700001502276700001302291700001302304773012902317856008602446852000902532655001202541IND60722400720221119212947.0210707e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072240072DNAL7 a10.1080/20964129.2020.17490102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Feifei10aImpacts of land conversion and management measures on net primary productivity in semi-arid grassland  aEcological restoration measures implemented in China have profoundly impacted vegetation NPP. This study aimed to estimate the effects of the land conversion and management measures on the grassland ecosystem in semi-arid regions. Land use data were employed from 2000 to 2015 to compare land conversion and coverage changes in Xilingol grassland. Then, the contributions of land conversion and management policies were quantified by assessing the difference between actual NPP and climate-induced NPP changes. The results indicated that the grassland area had a net loss of 534.42 km², and the net area of increased vegetation coverage was 74,683.05 km². Furthermore, the total NPP increased by 8,010.73 Gg C·yr⁻¹ (1 Gg = 10⁹ g), of which the human activities, including grazing management measures (+6,809.40 Gg C·yr⁻¹) and land conversion (45.72 Gg C·yr⁻¹) contributed to 85.58% of the increase in NPP. Transformation from desert and farmland dominated grassland expansion and NPP increase, while urbanization and desertification caused large grassland reduction and NPP loss. The grazing management increased vegetation NPP in most regions except for some regions in the desert steppe and the farming-pastoral zone. Related policies should be further adjusted to strengthen the management of the desert steppe and farming-pastoral regions.  aThis work was supported primarily by the State Key Research Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0501101), (No. 2016YFC0503603).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 2016YFC0501101aNo. 2016YFC0503603 3aagricultural land 3aclimatic factors 3adesertification 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3ahumans 3aland use change 3anet primary productivity 3asteppes 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aGrassland degradation 0aland use and land cover change 0amanagement measures and policies 0anet primary productivity (NPP) 0aXilingol grassland 0aanthropogenic/human activities affects1 aLi, Jiaxun1 aFu, Xiao1 aWu, Gang0 tEcosystem health and sustainability.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 6, no. 1 p.1749010-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23063x2332-88787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2020.17490103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01317naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245006800170300001600238520038300254592002800637650001400665650001600679650001300695651000900708653001700717653002000734653001600754700001900770773012100789856008400910852000900994655001201003IND60782292520221119010754.0220707e20220628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078229252DNAL7 a10.5252/adansonia2022v44a172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjbar, Massoud10aNomenclatural notes on Solenanthus minimus Brand (Boraginaceae)  ap. 175-181.  aA Boraginaceae species, Solenanthus minimus Brand, described from the territory of Iran is neotypified due to lack of any available original material.

Electrochemical oxidation of phenolic compounds such as phenol or acetaminophen leads to the generation of the reactive intermediates benzoquinone and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which can subsequently react with nucleophilic thiol functions in peptides or proteins. Differential labeling of cysteine residues was successfully demonstrated with native as well as heavy-isotope labeled forms of the corresponding labeling compounds. The specific mass differences on the peptide level were successfully analyzed by mass spectrometry for the tripeptide glutathione. Free cysteines in various proteins such as β-lactoglobulin A, human serum albumin, hemoglobin, and human carbonic anhydrase I were successfully labeled. Tryptic digestion of differentially labeled carbonic anhydrase I and hemoglobin allowed the identification of the binding site in the proteins. The obtained mass difference allowed an easy identification of the cysteine containing peptides. With these experiments, it was successfully demonstrated that the developed method can serve as a tool for counting cysteine moieties in proteins and, thus, be used as an additional technique in protein identification experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3abenzoquinones 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abinding sites 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acysteine 3aelectrochemistry 3aglutathione 3ahemoglobin 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3athiols1 aFaber, Helene1 aWigger, Tina1 aVogel, Martin1 aKarst, Uwe0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Oct. 06, v. 87, no. 19 p.9931-9938dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b024973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011400168300001300282520145000295592002801745653002101773653001901794653001501813653001601828700002001844773009601864856008401960852000902044655001202053IND60128273020221120231632.0151115e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012827302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2009.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoch, Thomas P.10aInfection of Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) with Motile Aeromonas spp. in the Laurentian Great Lakes  ap. 6-12.  aInfections with motile Aeromonas species were detected in lake whitefish collected over a one-year period from four stocks within lakes Michigan and Huron, USA. Sixty-nine isolates were recovered from the kidneys and swim-bladders of sixty-four infected fish. Representative isolates were Gram-negative bacilli that produced cytochrome oxidase, grew in the absence of salt, were facultative anaerobes, and were resistant to the vibriostatic agent 2,4-diamino,6,7-di-isopropylpteridine. Phenotypic characterization placed twenty-two isolates into the A. hydrophila complex, twelve into the A. sobria complex, and one into the A. caviae complex, while six isolates were characterized as A. allosaccharophila, two as A. veronii bv. veronii, and one as A. popoffi. The prevalence of infection by motile aeromonads varied by site and season, with lake whitefish sampled in the summer having a significantly higher prevalence. Clinical signs in lake whitefish infected only with Aeromonas spp. included congestion and hemorrhaging in the fins and musculature; generalized pallor; congestion, hemorrhaging, and multifocal necrotic foci within the liver; moderate to severe splenomegaly; congestion and swelling of the kidneys; ascites within the peritoneal cavity; and hemorrhagic enteritis. This study provides evidence on the wide spread prevalence of motile aeromonad infections in lake whitefish stocks inhabiting northern lakes Michigan and Huron.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMotile Aeromonas 0aLake whitefish 0aSepticemia 0aGreat Lakes1 aFaisal, Mohamed0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2010 July, v. 36, no. 1 p.6-12dElsevierx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jglr.2009.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002100162245007500183300001800258520133600276592002801612650003201640650000801672650001701680650002201697650002801719650001001747650002201757650001601779650001401795650001901809650002201828650001001850650001201860650001201872650001801884650001401902650003601916650009101952650002302043650003302066650002202099650001802121650001402139650004902153650005202202650002702254650001002281700002102291700001902312700001502331773009902346856007702445852000902522655001202531IND50089232420221118040133.0160218e199909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008923242DNAL7 a105420172pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500506222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderhallen, H.10aClassical swine fever virus is genetically stable in vitro and in vivo  ap. 1669-1677.  aPhylogenetic analyses of large numbers of classical swine fever strains have revealed a high degree of sequence conservation in the genomic regions examined, suggesting either a recent common ancestor or a low evolution rate. This low variability is in contrast to findings with other RNA viruses. To investigate the consequence of this apparent genetic stability on phylogenetic examinations, the Belgian field isolate Wingene’93 was passaged in pigs as well as in cell culture by various methods. Sequence analyses of viruses collected after various passages in three target regions proposed for phylogenetic studies (5′ NTR, E2, and NS5B) revealed a complete sequence conservation. Only when the amount of passaged virus was lowered, mimicking a genetic bottleneck, a single point mutation was observed in the E2 gene. Additionally, only four nucleotide substitutions were observed when the genome of a virus obtained after 96 cell passages in persistently infected cells was compared with its parental virus, the recombinant virus derived from an infectious cDNA clone of CSFV strain Alfort/187. This low mutation frequency observed both in vitro and in vivo demonstrates that classical swine fever virus is genetically stable. Hence, even minor mutations can be considered significant in molecular epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aRNA 3acell culture 3acomplementary DNA 3aepidemiological studies 3agenes 3agenetic stability 3ahog cholera 3aphylogeny 3apoint mutation 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aClassical Swine Feverxvirology 2aClassical Swine Fever Virusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Viral 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxbloodxisolation & purification. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSwine1 aMittelholzer, C.1 aHofmann, M.

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of Korean Red Ginseng on dry eye syndrome in patients with glaucoma treated with antiglaucoma eye drops.Forty-nine participants were allocated to the Korean Red Ginseng (3 g/day; n = 24) or placebo (n = 25) groups for 8 weeks. Tear film stability, fluorescein corneal staining, conjunctival hyperemia, tear production, grade of meibomian gland dysfunction, and dry eye questionnaire (Ocular Surface Disease Index) were evaluated at baseline and on completion of the treatment.Almost all patients displayed dry eye symptoms and signs at baseline. After the 8-week intervention, Korean Red Ginseng supplementation significantly improved the tear film stability and total Ocular Surface Disease Index score, as compared to placebo (p < 0.01).Korean Red Ginseng supplementation may provide an additional treatment option for dry eye and patients with glaucoma using antiglaucoma eye drops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3acornea 3adry eye syndrome 3afluorescein 3aglaucoma 3ahyperemia 3aplacebos 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 0aKorean Red Ginseng 0aPanax ginseng1 aKim, Ji-Hyun,1 aKim, Sangah1 aKim, Minkyo1 aLee, Naeun1 aHong, Samin1 aSeong, Gong Je1 aKim, Chan Yun0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2015 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.7-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010100169520068400270592002800954650002300982650002201005650001501027650002501042650001101067650001401078650001801092650001701110650002101127651001001148653003801158653002401196653002301220653001301243653001701256700001601273700001601289700001601305773012901321856008601450852000901536655001201545IND60722400920221119212922.0210707e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072240092DNAL7 a10.1080/20964129.2020.17509732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xinquan14aThe plateau pika has multiple benefits for alpine grassland ecosystem in Qinghai–Tibet Plateau  aThe plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) has been engaged in pest control for many years based on the logic that the plateau pika is responsible for alpine grassland degradation and competes with livestock for forage resources. However, the plateau pika is an important species which has multiple benefits in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, as it (i) makes burrows that are the primary homes for lizards and a variety of small birds; (ii) creates microhabitat disturbance that promotes the increase of plant species richness; (iii) serves as the principal prey for almost all of the plateau predator species; and (iv) contributes positively to the dynamic equilibrium of alpine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchotona curzoniae 3aalpine grasslands 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aforage 3alivestock 3amicrohabitats 3apest control 3aspecies richness 3aChina 0aPlateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) 0agrassland ecosystem 0aplant biodiversity 0apredator 0apest control1 aZhao, Liang1 aXu, Tianwei1 aXu, Shixiao0 tEcosystem health and sustainability.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 6, no. 1 p.1750973-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23063x2332-88787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2020.17509733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245009500167300001600262500001500278520134400293592002801637650000901665650001501674650002101689650002301710650001201733650001501745650002801760650004101788650002601829650001201855650001501867651000901882653000901891653002201900653001201922653001501934653001601949653001801965700001501983700001301998700001502011700001202026700001502038700001302053773011502066856008302181852000902264655001202273IND60535424120221116203756.0190403e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053542412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2014.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakaguchi, A.10aDevelopment and evaluation of a paddy module for improving hydrological simulation in SWAT  ap. 116-122.  a2019-12-06  aThe soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) is becoming a popular tool for modeling watershed-scale hydrological and chemical transport in Asia, where paddy rice is cultivated in typical agricultural management systems. In this study, a paddy module was developed by modifying an algorithm designed for pothole landscapes in SWAT. To simulate the percolation processes in paddy fields, a new parameter, the ‘potential percolation rate of the paddy field,’ was introduced which determines the upper limit of the rate of percolation into the subsoil. The potential percolation rate was calibrated to fit the observed flow rate of a stream. In addition, the ponding-releasing process was varied to simulate a winter paddy field. Moreover, the irrigation process was modified to avoid overflows from paddy fields during irrigation management. Furthermore, the evaporation process was modified in accordance with the evaporation rate observed at a paddy field. The developed paddy module was tested by applying it to a 3km2 watershed in which paddy fields comprise 18% of the total area. It was concluded that the water balance in the irrigated paddy fields was reasonably modeled by the modified SWAT with the developed paddy module and that the modified SWAT is effective for watershed-scale modeling for watersheds containing paddy fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3alandscapes 3aevaporation rate 3amanagement systems 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aagricultural management 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3airrigation management 3apaddies 3aalgorithms 3aAsia 0aSWAT 0aModel development 0aPothole 0aIrrigation 0aPaddy field 0awater balance1 aEguchi, S.1 aKato, T.1 aKasuya, M.1 aOno, K.1 aMiyata, A.1 aTase, N.0 tAgricultural water management.g2014 May 01, v. 137 p.116-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2014.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245011400192300001600306520071300322592002801035650001401063650002001077650002001097650003801117650001401155650002001169650001501189650002001204650001101224650003701235650001201272650004601284650003801330650002501368650003301393650004301426650002301469653000701492653000901499653000701508653001501515653001701530653002301547653002301570700002001593700001701613700001701630700006001647773009901707856008701806852000901893655001201902IND50071417520221121043352.0190402e20140501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007141752DNAL7 a243604612pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoizumi, Daisuke10aDevelopment and validation of a lateral flow assay for the detection of crustacean protein in processed foods  ap. 348-352.  aWe developed and validated a novel lateral flow assay for the detection of crustacean protein in processed foods.

The plant contains the alkaloids swainsonine and calystegines, which inhibit key cellular enzymes and cause systematic cell death. This study evaluated the behavioral effects of prenatal ingestion of this plant on dams and their kids. Twenty-four pregnant goats were randomly allocated into four treatment groups and received the following doses (g/kg BW) of fresh I. carnea: 0 (control group), 1.0 (IC1), 3.0 (IC3), and 5.0 (IC5) from day 27 of gestation until parturition. Dam and kid bonding and behavior were evaluated by several tests, immediately after birth until six weeks of age. Dams from IC3 and IC5 groups spent less time paying attention to the newborn. There was a lack of maternal-infant bonding due to I. carnea intoxication. Kids from treated dams had difficulty in standing, suckling, and in recognizing their mother hours after birth.

We suggest that kids from pregnant goats given I. carnea during gestation have significant behavioral alterations and developmental delays that may compromise their survival.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIpomoea carnea 3aanimal behavior 3aattachment behavior 3acell death 3adams (mothers) 3aenzymes 3aingestion 3akids (goats) 3amemory 3aneonates 3aparturition 3apoisoning 3apregnancy 3asuckling 3aswainsonine 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3aBrazil1 aPfister, James A.1 aRaspantini, Paulo C.

Carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) is a promising approach to reduce emissions and the use of expensive and limited fossil resources. Applying CCU, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be incorporated as raw material during the manufacture of plastic products. While most of the studies address technical feasibilities, hardly any systematic research on public perception and acceptance of those specific products exists so far. This study empirically investigates the acceptance of CCU plastic products (mattress as example). First, interviews with experts and lay people revealed critical acceptance factors (CO2 proportion, saving of fossil resources, disposal conditions, perceived health complaints). Their relative importance was detailed in two consecutive conjoint studies. Study 1 revealed disposal conditions and saving of fossil resources as essential for product selection, while the products’ CO2 proportion was less important. In study 2, potential health complaints were integrated as well as individual levels of domain knowledge and risk perception, which significantly affected acceptance of CCU products. Recommendations concerning communication strategies for policy and industry were derived.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aexperts 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3amineral resources 3apublic opinion 3araw materials 3arisk perception 3asociety 0aCarbon capture & utilization (CCU) 0aCO2 plastics 0aTechnology acceptance 0aConjoint analysis 0aUser diversity 0aRisk perception 0aPerceived knowledge & information about CCU1 aArning, Katrin1 aZiefle, Martina0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 June, v. 105 p.53-66dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01213naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245007800165300001800243520026600261592002800527650001300555650002700568650002300595650001300618650001600631700001900647700002700666773013400693856007500827852000900902655001200911IND60658688920221120033701.0190826e20100714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065868892DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc01400a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, Jennifer M.10aElectrodeposited PEDOT-on-plastic cathodes for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 5367-5369.  aElectrodeposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) onto conducting plastic allows the cheap and facile synthesis of plastic cathodes for dye-sensitised solar cells, having excellent solar cell efficiency (8%), at a fraction of the cost of platinised plastic.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aplastics 3asolar cells1 aArmel, Vanessa1 aMacFarlane, Douglas R.0 tChemical communications.g2010 July 14, v. 46, no. 29 p.5367-5369dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc01400a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245006000163520121600223536017601439592002801615596002501643596001401668650002101682650002501703650001201728650001201740650002401752650001701776650001701793651001001810651001301820651001201833653001801845653001701863653002201880653002001902653002101922653002201943700002001965700001801985700001602003700001402019700001302033700001302046773012902059856008602188852000902274655001202283IND60722401020221119213311.0210707e20201216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072240102DNAL7 a10.1080/20964129.2020.17569252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wen10aEvolution of the global polyethylene waste trade system  aChina’s import bans on solid wastes starting from 2017 have challenged the global trade system of plastic wastes, which remains poorly characterized. This study chooses polyethylene (PE) as a case and aims to map out the global trade networks of PE waste (GPETN) from 1976 to 2017. We find that the size and complexity of the GPETN had been growing until 2016. After the mid-1990s, PE waste basically flowed from developed economies, mainly the EU and the US, to developing economies such as China. Since 2001 when admitted into the WTO, China’s PE waste import surged until 2014 when it absorbed over 60% of global export. Regulations on solid waste import following the Green Fence campaign in 2013 resulted in substantial reductions in China’s import as well as the global export of PE waste after 2014. Several other developing economies, such as Malaysia, Turkey, and Vietnam, had transitioned to net importers, but their imports were insufficient to replace China as new recycling bases for PE waste. The results highlight the urgent need of a joint effort for developed and developing countries to build a stronger global circular economy system with sufficient capacity to treat PE waste locally.  aThis Study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671523,7191101150]; Leading Project of Fujian Science and Technology Department [2017Y0080].  aPublisher supplied data  a41671523a7191101150  a2017Y0080 3acircular economy 3aenvironmental health 3aexports 3aimports 3ainternational trade 3apolyethylene 3asolid wastes 3aChina 3aMalaysia 3aVietnam 0aPlastic waste 0apolyethylene 0asolid waste trade 0acomplex network 0awaste management 0aplastic recycling1 aChen, Wei-Qiang1 aJiang, Daqian1 aZhang, Chao1 aMa, Zijie1 aRen, Yan1 aShi, Lei0 tEcosystem health and sustainability.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 6, no. 1 p.1756925-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23063x2332-88787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20964129.2020.17569253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010800158300001400266500001500280520111600295592002801411650001201439650001601451650002401467650001301491650000901504650002001513651001301533653001901546700001801565700001601583700001401599700001901613700001901632700001601651700001401667773008101681856007301762852000901835655001201844IND60132356320221118234808.0150505e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013235632DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.122222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers, Justin10aAgronomic performance and genetic progress of selected historical soybean varieties in the southern USA  ap. 85-93.  a2019-12-04  aThis study was conducted to compare recently developed and historical soybean varieties and evaluate genetic gain in yield and other agronomic traits in the southern USA. A total of 45 southern varieties from public breeding programs, which were released from 1928 to 2008, were used in this study. Three experiments were conducted in 2007 and 2008 at Keiser, Stuttgart, and Marianna in Arkansas (USA). Varieties with maturity groups (MG) late IV to early V had a yield gain of 21.7 kg/ha/yr from the 1950s to the 2000s, mid to late MG V had a yield gain of 16.4 kg/ha/yr from the 1940s to the 2000s, and MG VIs had a yield gain of 12.4 kg/ha/yr from the 1920s to the 2000s. Yield increased linearly for all combined experiments by 16.8 kg/ha/yr. Plant height remained steady over time for most experiments. No significant changes were observed in maturity. Lodging scores decreased, protein concentration decreased, and oil concentration increased linearly over time for all combined experiments. Hutcheson, Narrow, R97‐1634, and Young were recommended as parent lines in future soybean breeding efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3alodging 3aGlycine max 3agenetic improvement 3asoybeans 3aoils 3amaturity groups 3aArkansas 0aplant breeding1 aChen, Pengyin1 aShi, Ainong1 aZhang, Bo1 aScaboo, Andrew1 aSmith, S.

Certified reference materials (CRM) DOLT-4 (Dogfish Liver) and TORT-2 (Lobster Hepatopancreas), and a commercial herring fish meal were evaluated. All experimental work described here was carried out by the same operator using the same instrumentation, thus eliminating possible differences in results caused by laboratory related factors. Low concentrations of iAs were found in CRM DOLT-4 (0.012±0.003mgkg−1) and the herring fish meal sample (0.007±0.002mgkg−1) for all extraction methods. When comparing the concentration of iAs in CRM TORT-2 found in this study and in the literature dilute acids, HNO3 and HCl, showed the highest extracted iAs wheras dilute NaOH (in 50% ethanol) showed significantly lower extracted iAs.

Retrotransposon-based molecular markers are excellent tools for detecting genetic diversity and genomic changes associated with their activity. The objective of this study was to use IRAP markers to detect integration events of retrotransposon in Opuntia, and to compare IRAP and ISSR polymorphisms. To achieve these aims, five IRAP and five ISSR markers were analyzed on three varieties and their progenies. All IRAP primers showed an increase in the percentage of polymorphism, number of total bands, and polymorphic bands in the seedlings compared to their mother plants; that is, the offspring showed 13, 24 and 27 more bands than the mother plants from Tobarito, Montesa and Copena varieties, respectively. Conversely, sexual reproduction did not proportionally affect the variation in the number of ISSR bands, and neither did polymorphisms between mother plants and their offspring. Cluster and multivariate analyses based on IRAP and ISSR data revealed a clear separation between varieties, and there was no overlapping between seedlings of different varieties. The activation of retrotransposons in seedlings of opuntia with variable frequencies was evidenced.

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of using audio relaxation technique (ART), music intervention (MI), nature video application with music (NVAM), and nature video application without music (NVA) delivered via mobile technologies in a clinical setting. Secondary, the effects of ART, MI, NVAM and NVA on patients’ state anxiety, pain perception, and perceived self-efficacy in healing were determined. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 105 same day surgery (SDS) patients, who were assigned to an ART (n = 25), MI (n = 25), NVAM (n = 15), NVA (n = 16), or a control group (n = 24) were assessed for state anxiety, self-reported pain, and self-efficacy four days prior to surgery, immediately prior and following a surgical intervention, and day five post-operative. RESULTS: ANOVA found no statistically significant differences in anxiety scores; pain, or perceived self-efficacy between the five groups. Matched pairs t-Test revealed all participants had an increase in anxiety from pre-op to day 10 follow-up; a significant change in pain levels from pre-op to day 10 follow-up; and all participants had a significant increase in general self-efficacy from pre-op to day 10 follow-up. Mean pain level scores from day 1 to pre-op showed a significant decrease in pain for the ART group and NVAM group. Matched pairs t-Test for self-efficacy scores indicated the MI group and the NVA group had significant increases in self-efficacy. A significant decrease in anxiety from pre-op to day 10 for participants reporting a prior history of anxiety and for those reporting prior history of taking anti-anxiety medications. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the non-significant findings between the five groups, at any measurement point, there were valuable trends toward significance and confirmed feasibility in a clinical setting. Among the groups there were statistically significant findings for all interventions on anxiety, pain, and self-efficacy. The feasability of the implementation of novel interventions of NVAM and NVAM adds to clinical practice and the CT literature.

It has a patchy distribution in southern Chile and Argentina, inhabiting both freshwater and marine habitats. While most studies of their diet and habitat use have been carried out in freshwater habitats, our study is the first one on these aspects in a predominantly palustrine wetland. In southern Chile, the Boroa wetland may be the only wetland with southern river otters and five different subsystems: palustrine open water, swamp forest, seasonal and permanent marshes, and riverine associated with open farm fields. We studied these five different subsystems during April 2003 - May 2004, and collected and analysed 194 spraints in order to assess the effect of rainfall and subsystems on the diet and sprainting behaviour of southern river otter. The river otter's diet primarily consisted of crustaceans; however, rainfall and wetland subsystems influenced the frequency of fish and especially amphibians in the spraints collected. This is the first study documenting the helmeted water toad Caudiverbera caudiverbera as a prey of southern river otter. Southern river otter visited latrines located within the swamp forest more frequently, as this subsystem may provide refuge for latrines and dens as well as an important supplementary feeding resource. Our study provides insights into the role of coastal wetlands in predation processes, and highlights the importance of ecosystem services derived from wetland for biodiversity conservation. However, it is of concern that these wetlands are increasingly affected by drainage for agriculture and other landscape changes in southern Chile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aLontra 3abiodiversity 3adiet study techniques 3adietary supplements 3adrainage 3aecosystem services 3aendangered species 3afarms 3afish 3aforests 3afreshwater 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amarshes 3apredation 3arain 3aswamps 3atoads 3aArgentina 3aChile 0afish 0ahelmeted water toad 0aLontra provocax 0aotter 0aswamp forest1 aGonzález Lagos, César,0 tWildlife biology.g2008 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.211-220dNordic Board for Wildlife Researchx0909-63967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2981%2F0909-6396%282008%2914%5B211%3AHUADOE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245010600213300001600319520167200335592002802007650001502035650002302050650001402073650001102087650001302098650001102111650001302122650001702135650001602152650002002168650001802188653001702206653002402223653002402247653001702271653002802288700005802316700002902374773009802403856008702501852000902588655001202597IND60591043720221120073422.0190206e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059104372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreto, Germilly1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5454-976910aThree-dimensional modelling and analysis of solar radiation absorption in porous volumetric receivers  ap. 602-614.  aThis work addresses the three-dimensional modelling and analysis of solar radiation absorption in a porous volumetric receiver using the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method. The receiver is composed of a solid matrix of homogeneous porous material and isotropic properties, bounded on its side by a cylindrical wall that is characterized through a diffuse albedo. The Henyey-Greenstein phase function is used to model the radiation scattering inside the porous media. The effect of the angle of incidence, optical thickness (porosity, pores size and height of the receiver), asymmetry factor of the phase function and wall properties on the solar radiation absorption in the porous media is studied in order to obtain the receiver efficiency as a function of these parameters. The model was validated by comparing the results for a simple geometry composed of a long slab of finite thickness with the values available in the literature, and then tested with a cylindrical receiver using a parabolic dish as concentration system with a concentration factor of 500. A peak of absorbed solar radiation of 156 MW m−3 and an absorption efficiency of 90.55% were obtained for a phase function asymmetry factor of 0.4 (forward scattering) and scattering albedo and extinction coefficient of 0.54 and 100 m−1, respectively. The results for the diffuse reflectance, diffuse transmittance and absorption are also presented. The model developed in this work is useful to obtain and understand the energy absorption distribution in porous volumetric receivers coupled to solar concentration systems, when different porous structures and geometric parameters are used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aangle of incidence 3aasymmetry 3aenergy 3ageometry 3amodels 3aporosity 3aporous media 3areflectance 3asolar radiation 3atransmittance 0aSolar energy 0aSolar concentration 0aVolumetric receiver 0aPorous media 0aMonte Carlo ray tracing1 aCanhoto, Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6210-19641 aCollares-Pereira, Manuel0 tApplied energy.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 215 p.602-614dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012300159300001800282520118200300592002801482650002201510650002201532650002301554650002001577650001301597650002101610650002801631650002001659650001401679650002201693650001801715650000701733650003301740650001101773650002101784700002401805700001901829700002201848700002001870700002001890773012701910856007402037852000902111655001202120IND60656545620221123003122.0190814e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065654562DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ay05483j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, Sathish10aSynthesis of MgFe₂O₄ nanoparticles and MgFe₂O₄ nanoparticles/CPE for electrochemical investigation of dopamine  ap. 2792-2796.  aMagnesium ferrite nanoparticles (MgFe₂O₄ NPs) were prepared by a solution based method using magnesium sulphate (MgSO₄), ferrous sulphate (FeSO₄), dl serine and NaOH as a precipitant and the obtained precipitation was calcinated under 500 °C for 4 h. The resulting material was characterized by using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The MgFe₂O₄ NPs were used for preparation of MgFe₂O₄ NPs/carbon paste electrode (MgFe₂O₄ NPs/CPE) and applied for electrochemical investigation of dopamine (DA) which exhibits good electrocatalytic activity for investigation of DA at physiological pH 7.4. The effect of pH range from 5.5 to 8.0 was studied and the result shows that the redox peak current was maxima at pH 7.5 and the redox peak was pH dependent with a slope of 0.061 V/pH. The scan rate effect was found to be an adsorption-controlling electrode process. The electrocatalytic currents increased linearly with an increase in DA concentration in the range 0.1–1.2 μM and the detection limit was found to be 7.7 × 10⁻⁸ M.

Prey species are often faced with a tradeoff between food and safety in situations where food availability and predation risk peak in the same habitat type. Determining the optimal strategy becomes more complex if predators with different hunting mode create contrasting landscapes of risk, but this has rarely been documented in vertebrates. Roe deer in southeastern Norway face predation risk from lynx, as well as hunting by humans. These two predators differ greatly in their hunting methods. The predation risk from lynx, an efficient stalk‐and‐ambush predator is expected to be higher in areas with dense understory vegetation, while predation risk from human hunters is expected to be higher where visual sight lines are longer. Based on field observations and airborne LiDAR data from 71 lynx predation sites, 53 human hunting sites, 132 locations from 15 GPS‐marked roe deer, and 36 roe deer pellet locations from a regional survey, we investigated how predation risk was related to terrain attributes and vegetation classes/structure. As predicted, we found that increasing cover resulted in a contrasting lower predation risk from humans and higher predation risk from lynx. Greater terrain ruggedness increased the predation risk from both predators. Hence, multiple predators may create areas of contrasting risk as well as double risk in the same landscape. Our study highlights the complexity of predator–prey relationship in a multiple predator setting. Synthesis In this study of risk effects in a multi‐predator context, LiDAR data were used to quantify cover in the habitat and relate it to vulnerability to predation in a boreal forest. We found that lynx and human hunters superimpose generally contrasting landscapes of fear on a common prey species, but also identified double‐risk zones. Since the benefit of anti‐predator responses depends on the combined risk from all predators, it is necessary to consider complete predator assemblages to understand the potential for and occurrence of risk effects across study systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aLynx 3aboreal forests 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alidar 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3aspace and time 3asurveys 3aNorway1 aLoe, Leif Egil1 aGobakken, Terje1 aLinnell, John D.

To overcome this difficulty, the spectroscopy technique can provide a useful approach in estimating the TFV as an alternative for time-consuming wind tunnel studies in the field. In this study, we evaluated the potential of Vis-NIR spectroscopy in predicting the TFV and some TFV-related soil properties using Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). We also developed a Point Spectrotransfer Function (PSTF) using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict the TFV based on diagnostic wavelengths and compared it to the derived Pedotransfer Function (PTF). For this purpose, 300 in-situ wind tunnel tests were performed in the Fars Province, Iran and the spectral reflectance of soil samples were analysed using a spectrophotometer apparatus. The 10 best key wavelengths resulting from the correlation analysis between the TFV and the spectral reflectance were 750, 1342, 1446, 1578, 1746, 1939, 2072, 2162, 2217, and 2338 nm which were mostly located in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) area. The derived PSTF performed better than the PTF for the TFV estimation (R² = 0.94, RMSE = 0.71). Results of the predictive models revealed that machine learning using the SVR had a significantly (P < 0.01) higher prediction accuracy for the TFV estimation (R² = 0.85, RMSE = 0.45, RPD = 2.50, and RPIQ = 4.06) than the PLSR (R² = 0.68, RMSE = 1.01, RPD = 1.72, and RPIQ = 2.64). The same results were obtained for the soil moisture, clay and CaCO₃ content. This study proved that reflectance spectroscopy coupled with the machine learning algorithm is a promising technique for large-scale assessment of wind erosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclay 3afriction velocity 3aleast squares 3apedotransfer functions 3aprediction 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asoil water 3aspectrophotometers 3awind erosion 3awind tunnels 3aIran 0aDust 0aSoil erosion 0aSpectral reflectance 0aSupport vector machine 0aWind tunnel1 aRezaei, Mahrooz1 aSameni, Abdolmajid1 aMoosavi, Ali Akbar1 aRitsema, Coen0 tGeoderma.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 401 p.115163-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.1151633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014400169520117100313592002801484650002001512650002101532650002801553650001701581650001501598650000701613650001901620650001601639653002701655653002501682653001401707653003401721653003301755700001801788700001401806700001601820700002201836700002701858773010701885856008701992852000902079655001202088IND60776093920221121145914.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077609392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1290822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiuzhu, Zhou12aA polyrutin/AgNPs coated GCE for simultaneous anodic stripping voltammetric determination of Pb(II) and Cd(II)ions in environmental samples  aHere, we report a simple one-step preparation of polyrutin/silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface using an electrochemical deposition/polymerization technique.

Because understanding the physico-chemical nature of high-pressure effects on probe dyes extends the range over which quantitative sensing is possible and informs the development of more robust probes, we report the high-pressure characterization of indo-1 for potential use in calcium-ion sensing under pressure. We find that indo-1 emission remains consistent with a two-state binding model when pressurized to 510 atm, accompanied by a decrease in calcium-binding affinity and an observation of piezochromic behavior. An estimate of the thermodynamic volume change of the indo-1 calcium dissociation reaction is consistent with values for other metal-ion chelators, and piezochromic shifts appear to be due to a pressure-induced change in solvent polarity versus a change in solvent viscosity. The two-state behavior and the linear response of parameters needed for dye calibration makes indo-1 amenable for use under pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient pressure 3aanalytical methods 3acalcium 3achelating agents 3adissociation 3afluorescent dyes 3amodels 3asolvents 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity1 aUrayama, Paul0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 4, no. 1 p.80-84dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ay05486d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245013300189300001600322520161800338592002801956650002001984650001002004650001502014650001802029650001102047650003002058650000902088650001702097650001002114650001202124651001502136651001902151653001502170653001702185653002702202653003002229653002102259653002002280653001902300700002202319700002102341773011002362856011502472852000902587655001202596IND60130822820221122005839.0151127e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013082282DNAL7 a10.2981/0909-6396(2008)14[228:EFICBF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshal, Jason P.10aEvidence for interspecific competition between feral ass Equus asinus and mountain sheep Ovis canadensis in a desert environment  ap. 228-236.  aDifferent ungulate species that co-occur over evolutionary time have been hypothesized to develop mechanisms to limit the degree to which they directly compete for the same limited resources (i.e. resource partitioning). In situations where an exotic ungulate has been recently introduced to a system, resource partitioning has not likely developed; this appears to be the situation between introduced feral ass Equus asinus and indigenous mountain sheep Ovis canadensis in the Sonoran Desert of southeastern California, USA. We analysed data from aerial surveys conducted during 1993––2003 to look for evidence of an effect of feral ass abundance on mountain sheep demography. After controlling for the influence of forage availability via rainfall, we found no evidence of relationship between an index of feral ass abundance and indices of reproduction or recruitment in mountain sheep (P≥≥0.360). However, we found strong evidence for an effect on indices of sheep abundance and population rate of change. There was an interactive effect of rainfall and feral ass, such that a negative relationship between abundances of mountain sheep and feral ass was strongest during the driest years (P==0.014). There was a negative relationship between rate of change for sheep populations and feral ass abundance (P==0.016), which was not affected by rainfall. These results indicated a competitive effect of feral ass on mountain sheep populations, but the mechanism of competition remains unclear. Further research should use manipulations in feral ass abundance to clarify interactions between these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOvis canadensis 3aasses 3ademography 3aferal animals 3aforage 3ainterspecific competition 3arain 3areproduction 3asheep 3asurveys 3aCalifornia 3aSonoran Desert 0aCalifornia 0aEquus asinus 0aexotic large herbivore 0ainterspecific competition 0ainvasive species 0aOvis canadensis 0aSonoran Desert1 aBleich, Vernon C.1 aAndrew, Nancy G.0 tWildlife biology.g2008 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.228-236dNordic Board for Wildlife Researchx0909-63967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2981%2F0909-6396%282008%2914%5B228%3AEFICBF%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012900169300001600298520140500314592002801719650001101747650001901758650001101777650002201788650001401810650002401824650003401848650001101882650001101893651001501904653001101919653000901930653001801939653001701957653001301974653001501987773009202002856008402094852000902178655001202187IND60547511720221120035811.0160903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054751172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhamed, Mansur10aCommunity based Approach for Reducing Vulnerability to Natural Hazards (Cyclone, Storm Surges) in Coastal Belt of Bangladesh  ap. 361-371.  aThe coastal morphology of Bangladesh influences the impact of natural hazards on the area. Especially, in the south–western area, natural hazards increase the vulnerability of the coastal dwellers and slow down the process of social and economic developments. There is a serious need for an effective disaster management plan to minimize the loss of lives and property. Unfortunately, the present cyclone warning signal is not only highly ineffective, but, sometimes also confusing. There is no comprehensive disaster management strategy. Some of the local NGOs in collaboration with government agencies undertake certain activities, but these too have been limited to mostly relief and rehabilitation. Cyclone preparedness plans are hardly found among these agencies. While it is not possible to prevent natural disasters, protective measures to reduce the vagaries of disasters can be evolved. Due to the unusual climatic behaviour in recent years, people in coastal areas face serious vulnerability, especially in the context of human settlements and consequently move out to the cities to combat the situation. These people need innovative strategies for survival. This paper assert, like many other newly devised coping strategies, that reducing vulnerabilities is important and suggest where innovation & adaptation is necessary to save communities from their vulnerability to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acoping strategies 3adisasters 3agovernment agencies 3anongovernmental organizations 3apeople 3astorms 3aBangladesh 0aHazard 0aRisk 0aVulnerability 0aPreparedness 0aResponse 0aMitigation0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2013, v. 17 p.361-371dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002300135245008000158300001500238520157100253592002801824650001001852650001001862650002401872650002401896650002001920650001401940650001301954650001701967650001901984650002302003650001902026650001502045650001402060650001202074650001302086650001402099650002102113650002302134700002702157700002102184773015202205856006902357856010102426990002302527852000902550655001202559IND60699362020221120113917.0200617e20200616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069936202DNAL7 a10.3791/603002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Jonathan H.10aImaging features of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease  ap. e60300.  aEarly diagnosis of systemic sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is important to enable treatment to be administered with minimal delay. However, diagnosing SSc-ILD is challenging because key symptoms are non-specific. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest is recognized as a sensitive imaging method for diagnosing and assessing SSc-ILD. Exposure of patients to ionizing radiation may be considered as a limitation, although methodological steps may be taken to moderate this. We present practical recommendations for performing HRCT scans and interpreting the results. Key features of SSc-ILD on HRCT include a non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern with peripheral ground-glass opacities and extensive traction bronchiectasis. Despite similarities between SSc-ILD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), HRCT can be used to differentiate between these conditions: in SSc-ILD compared with IPF, there is a greater proportion of ground-glass opacity and fibrosis is less coarse. A dilated, air-filled esophagus with diameter >10 mm, suggestive of esophageal dysmotility is commonly seen in SSc-ILD. Pulmonary artery size greater than the adjacent ascending aorta suggests coexistent pulmonary hypertension. Nodules must be monitored due to the increased risk of lung cancer. A large extent of disease on HRCT (≥20%) or a high fibrosis score suggests an increased risk of mortality. HRCT is central to diagnosing SSc-ILD, and serial assessments can be helpful in monitoring disease progression or treatment response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3achest 3acomputed tomography 3adisease progression 3aearly diagnosis 3aesophagus 3afibrosis 3ahypertension 3aimage analysis 3aionizing radiation 3alung neoplasms 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aopacity 3apatients 3apneumonia 3apulmonary artery 3apulmonary fibrosis1 aWalker, Christopher M.1 aHobbes, Stephen,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 June 16, , no. 160 p.e60300-e60300dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/603003Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60300/imaging-features-systemic-sclerosis-associated-interstitial-lung  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245018400154300001600338520131600354592002801670650001601698650002001714650002001734650002201754650004101776650002301817650001201840650001701852650001501869650002201884650003201906650001601938650003101954700002401985700001602009700002002025700001402045700002502059773012402084856007402208852000902282655001202291IND60656545820221122231819.0190814e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065654582DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ay05490b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yu10aOptimization of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) to determine airborne biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs): An application for measurement of household cleaning products  ap. 277-283.  aBiogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in household cleaning products play key roles in indoor air quality (IAQ) because they are precursors for secondary pollutants formation. An accurate and rapid analytical technique for their measurement is of importance. This paper describes an optimization of a method for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the determination of BVOCs. SPME fibers coated with Carboxen-PDMS are used to collect 12 individual BVOCs under standard conditions with a short exposure time of 5 min. Parameters influencing the extraction processes including sampling time, temperature and relative humidity are also investigated. All of the targeted BVOCs are shown to have limits of detection (LODs) in mixing ratios ranging from 0.31–0.50 ppbv, which are two magnitudes better than the LODs reported. The method precisions are between 1.1% and 6.7%. Comparison studies were carried out on a set of four floor cleaner extracts using the SPME method and traditional liquid injection method. Good agreement of the targeted BVOCs by the two methods was demonstrated. Our results indicated that SPME can serve as a simple and rapid sample collection approach to quantify BVOCs accurately and precisely in the indoor environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3acleaning agents 3adetection limit 3aexposure duration 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahousehold cleaning 3aliquids 3amixing ratio 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 3asolid phase microextraction 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds1 aHang Ho, Steven Sai1 aHo, Kin Fai1 aLee, Shun Cheng1 aGao, Yuan1 aYau Feng, Natale Sin0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 4, no. 1 p.277-283dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ay05490b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04109naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245014100207300001800348506007600366520165800442592002802100506003702128650001902165650001402184650002802198650002902226650001802255650003402273650001102307650001202318650001502330650001102345650002202356650002002378650002402398650001702422650002102439650001502460651001102475653003302486653000802519653001102527653001802538653002002556653002002576653000702596653000702603653000802610653000802618653001002626653001002636653001002646653000702656653000802663653000802671653001002679653000802689653000702697700001602704700001602720700001502736700002202751700001702773700001902790700001802809700001802827700001702845773034802862856008403210852000903294655001203303IND60604817320221207133020.0180718e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060481732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2015.08.0032doi7 aPMC46844672pmcid7 a266077032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyman, T.K.10aAssociations between diet and cardiometabolic risk among Yup'ik Alaska Native people using food frequency questionnaire dietary patterns  ap. 1140-1145.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn previous analyses, we identified three dietary patterns from food frequency questionnaire data among a sample of Yup'ik Alaska Native people living in Southwest Alaska: a “subsistence foods” dietary pattern and two market-based dietary patterns “processed foods” and “fruits and vegetables”. In this analysis, we aimed to characterize the association between the dietary patterns and cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, glucose, adiposity).We used multilevel linear regression to estimate the mean of each CM risk factor, comparing participants in the 4th to the 1st quartile of each dietary pattern (n = 637). Models were adjusted for age, sex, past smoking, current smoking, and physical activity. Mean log triglyceride levels were significantly higher among participants in the 4th compared to the 1st quartile of the processed foods dietary pattern (β = 0.11). Mean HbA1c percent was significantly lower (β = −0.08) and mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) mm Hg was significantly higher (β = 2.87) among participants in the 4th compared to the 1st quartile of the fruits and vegetables dietary pattern. Finally, mean log triglyceride levels and mean DBP mm Hg were significantly lower among participants in the 4th compared to the 1st quartile of the subsistence foods dietary pattern (β = −0.10 and β = −3.99 respectively).We found increased CM risk, as reflected by increased triglycerides, associated with eating a greater frequency of processed foods, and reduced CM risk, as reflected by lower triglycerides and DBP, associated with eating a greater frequency of subsistence foods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlaska Natives 3aadiposity 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiastolic blood pressure 3aeating habits 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruits 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aphysical activity 3aprocessed foods 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetables 3aAlaska 0aFood frequency questionnaire 0aFFQ 0aYup'ik 0aAlaska Native 0aDietary pattern 0aCardiometabolic 0aAN 0aCM 0aCPD 0aFFQ 0aCANHR 0aLDL-C 0aHDL-C 0aTG 0aSBP 0aDBP 0aHbA1c 0aFBG 0aWC1 aBoyer, B.B.1 aHopkins, S.1 aPhilip, J.1 aBeresford, S.A.A.1 aThompson, B.1 aHeagerty, P.J.1 aPomeroy, J.J.1 aThummel, K.E.1 aAustin, M.A.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2015 Dec., v. 25, no. 12 p.1140-1145dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2015.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013300172300001800305520088300323592002801206650002301234650002301257650001001280650001201290650002301302650001201325650001301337650000901350650002001359700005701379700002001436700002401456700002301480773016001503856008301663852000901746655001201755IND60777075120221118235410.0220513e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077707512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-021-02148-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiyadidegan, Samira10aFactors affecting the COVID-19 risk in the US counties: an innovative approach by combining unsupervised and supervised learning  ap. 1469-1484.  aThe COVID-19 disease spreads swiftly, and nearly three months after the first positive case was confirmed in China, Coronavirus started to spread all over the United States.

Environmental subjectivities and invisibility in climate change discourse  ap. 43-62.  aPublic climate conversations are inattentive to how differences in social location and culture shape people’s knowledge of and responses to climate change. Instead, emphases on climate apathy and climate skepticism overrepresent privileged sensibilities, marginalizing those who fall outside of what Black feminist theorist Audre Lorde calls “the mythical norm” (1987). In so doing, predominant approaches obscure forms of climate engagement that do not resemble researcher identified pro-environmental behaviors. In order to illustrate relationships between social location, culture, and response to climate change, we apply the notion of environmental subjectivities in a secondary analysis of climate engagement in two communities, one of which resembles and one of which lies outside the “mythical” norm. Both members of the Karuk Tribe and urban homesteaders frame climate change as symptoms of unsustainable political-economic structures. Yet differences in the structural location of each community result in divergent understandings of and practices in relation to the changing climate. These divergent community understandings and practices cannot be explained by individual preferences or cultural differences alone. Instead, the concept of environmental subjectivities (1) calls attention to the situated knowledges of climate change that emerge in relation to differences of indigeneity, race, and class, (2) relates community environmental practices to interlocking power structures, and (3) illustrates how elite narratives obscure the role of the colonial, settler, capitalist state in the generation of climate emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acultural differences 3aemissions1 aNorgaard, Kari Marie0 tClimatic change.g2020 Nov., v. 163, no. 1 p.43-62dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02632-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01532naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245013200179300001600311520052000327592002800847650002900875650001200904650002300916650002200939650000900961650002700970651000900997700002401006773012401030856005501154852000901209655001201218IND50074160120221118010647.0140321e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007416012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01596.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLE ROUX, JOHANNES J.10aIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite markers from fireweed, Senecio madagascariensis Poir.

In this work, biogas production of laboratory-scale AD of maize silage and sugar beets was optimized to cover the residual load of an electricity self-sufficient community using a simple process model based on first-order kinetics. Experiments show a good agreement between biogas demand, predicted, and measured biogas production. By optimizing biogas conversion schedules based on the measured gas production, a gas storage capacity of 7–8 h was identified for maximum flexibility, which corresponds to typical gas storage sizes at industrial biogas plants in Germany. Various stability indicators were continuously monitored and proved resilient process conditions. These results demonstrate that demand-oriented biogas production using model predictive control is a promising approach to enable existing biogas plants to provide balancing energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acorn silage 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agas production (biological) 3akinetics 3amodels 3asugars 3aGermany 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiogas technology 0aModel-predictive control 0aDemand-oriented power supply1 aWeinrich, Sören,1 aSpan, Roland1 aGerber, Mandy0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Oct., v. 361 p.127664-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245005700209300001600266500001500282506007600297520113400373592002801507506003701535650001101572650001801583650001701601650002401618650001701642650002001659650002901679650001201708650001901720650001001739650001401749653001801763653001701781653002001798653001001818653001701828700001901845700002101864700002001885700002401905700001801929700002401947700002001971700002201991700001802013700002102031700001702052700002002069700002402089773007502113856008302188852000902271655001202280IND60552720720221207060141.0161021e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055272072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.10.0032doi7 aPMC42625952pmcid7 a253116482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Honghuang10aWhole blood gene expression and interleukin-6 levels  ap. 490-495.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCirculating interleukin-6 levels increase with advancing age and are a risk factor for various diseases and mortality. The characterization of gene expression profiles associated with interleukin-6 levels might suggest important molecular events underlying its regulation.We studied the association of transcriptional profiles with interleukin-6 levels in 2422 participants from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array. We identified 4139 genes that were significantly associated with interleukin-6 levels (FDR<0.05) after adjusting for age, sex and blood cell components. We then replicated 807 genes in the InCHIANTI study with 694 participants. Many of the top genes are involved in inflammation-related pathways or erythrocyte function, including JAK/Stat signaling pathway and interleukin-10 signaling pathway.We identified and replicated 807 genes that were associated with circulating interleukin-6 levels. Future characterization of interleukin-6 regulation networks may facilitate the identification of additional potential targets for treating inflammation-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction 3aerythrocytes 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aprogeny 3ainterleukin-10 3aexons 3amortality 0aInterleukin-6 0aInflammation 0aGene expression 0agenes 0aEpidemiology1 aJoehanes, Roby1 aPilling, Luke C.1 aDupuis, Josée,1 aLunetta, Kathryn L.1 aYing, Sai-Xia1 aBenjamin, Emelia J.1 aHernandez, Dena1 aSingleton, Andrew1 aMelzer, David1 aMunson, Peter J.1 aLevy, Daniel1 aFerrucci, Luigi1 aMurabito, Joanne M.0 tGenomics.g2014 Dec., v. 104 p.490-495dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011900212520209000331592002802421650001202449650002302461650002302484650001002507650001902517650002702536650001802563650001902581650001902600650001702619650003302636650001302669650001102682650001402693650002002707650001702727650001102744651001302755653002602768653003802794653002402832653003902856653001602895700002602911700002602937773010502963856008503068852000903153655001203162IND60775439620221120165635.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077543962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1133292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattulga, Batdulam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8908-577010aCharacterization of biofilms formed on polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on the shore of the Tuul River, Mongolia  aMicroplastic (MP) surfaces are common sites for microbial colonization and promote biofilm formation in aquatic environments, resulting in changes to the surface properties of MPs and their interaction with pollutants. Although the diversity of microbial communities adhering to MPs has been well documented in aquatic environments, surface changes in MPs due to microbial colonization are still poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the variations in the chemical structure and components of biofilms on the surface of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) collected from the shore of the Tuul River in Mongolia, using micro-Fourier transform infrared (micro-FTIR) spectroscopy. We applied a spectral subtraction approach, and the differences in spectra between peroxide-treated and untreated PS-MP particles enabled us to obtain the structural features of biofilms that developed on the plastic surface. In addition, the surface photooxidation status of the sampled PS-MPs was calculated from the subtracted spectra of peroxide-treated and pristine PS-MPs. Various functional groups of N-containing organic substances from bacterial and fungal communities were detected in the obtained biofilm spectra. Based on the spectral characteristics, biofilm spectra were classified into four groups by applying principal component analysis (PCA). A wide range of carbonyl indices (CIs: 0.00–1.40) was found in the subtracted spectra between peroxide-treated and pristine PS-MPs, revealing that different levels of surface oxidation progressed by physical influences such as solar radiation and freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, lignocellulose and silicate were found on the PS-MP surface as allochthonous attachments. Considering the variation in residence time of PS-MPs, they attract plant residues and mineral particles through the development of biofilms and travel together in the river environment. Given that the dynamic behavior of MPs can be greatly affected by changes in their surfaces, further studies are needed to emphasize their link to organic matter dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3achemical structure 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afungi 3alignocellulose 3amicrobial colonization 3amicroplastics 3aorganic matter 3aphotooxidation 3apolystyrenes 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3arivers 3asilicates 3asolar radiation 3aspectroscopy 3atravel 3aMongolia 0aInfrared (IR) spectra 0aBiofilm-associated organic matter 0aCarbonyl index (CI) 0aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) 0aUrban river1 aKawahigashi, Masayuki1 aOyuntsetseg, Bolormaa0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept., v. 212 p.113329-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1133293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245017400174300001600348520066100364592002801025650001601053650001901069650001801088650003701106650001101143650001401154650002701168650002201195700001901217700002201236700001801258700002201276700001201298700002501310700001701335700002401352700002401376700002001400700002401420773012401444856008801568852000901656655001201665IND50074160220221118010454.0150206e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007416022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01578.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLING, ALISON E.10aCharacterization of simple sequence repeat markers derived in silico from Brassica rapa bacterial artificial chromosome sequences and their application in Brassica napus  ap. 273-277.  aA collaborative Brassica rapa genome sequencing project is currently in progress to aid the identification of agronomically important traits in Brassica species.

Converting soil P to less soluble forms with applications of materials containing lime or Ca may reduce the release of soil P to runoff. We investigated the effect of several coal combustion by-products on STP (Bray-1 and Mehlich-III), water extractable P, and equilibrium P concentration (EPC₀) of high P soils. Three widely available by-products were used: fluidized bed combustion fly ash (FBC), flue gas desulfurization by-product (FGD), and pulverized coal flyash (PC). In a by-product type and rate experiment, a Berks soil with high STP was incubated for 21 d with each by-product (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 g kg soil⁻¹). The highest rates of FBC and FGD reduced Mehlich-III P (45%), Bray-I P (50%), water extractable P (72%) and EPC₀ (37%). The PC had no effect on soil P solubility due to the addition of P with this by-product. For eight soils ranging in physical and chemical properties, FBC at 10 g kg soil⁻¹ reduced Mehlich-III P 13%, and water-extractable P 71%, while FGD reduced Mehlich-III P 8% and water-extractable P 48%. These reductions resulted from the conversion of readily desorbable soil P to less soluble Ca-bound or Al- and Fe-bound pools. Amending high P soils with FBC or FGD by-products has the potential to reduce P enrichment of runoff by decreasing the solubility of soil P without reducing STP below optimum levels for plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphorus 3abioavailability 3asoil types 3aindustrial wastes 3asolubility 3apollution control1 aSharpley, Andrew N.1 aPionke, Harry B.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1998 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.111-118dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/198593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700010016x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02423naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010800167520121100275592002801486650002101514650001201535650001701547650001701564650001201581650001801593650001901611650001401630650001801644653002001662653002901682653001801711653002801729653003201757700001501789700001901804773010601823856008701929852000902016655001202025IND60783839220221120193656.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078383922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yanan10aCo-fermentation of sewage sludge and lignocellulosic biomass for production of medium-chain fatty acids  aMedium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) production from sewage sludge and lignocellulosic biomass (fallen leaves and grass) was explored. Co-fermentation of sludge and lignocellulosic biomass significantly accelerated the caproate production and promoted the longer-chain MCFAs formation. Co-fermentation of sludge and grass achieved the highest caproate production of 89.50 mmol C/L, which was 18.04 % and 41.73 % higher than the mono-fermentation of grass and sludge, respectively. Co-fermentation of sludge and leaves produced 63.80 mmol C/L caproate, which was 11.09 % and 1.03 % higher than the mono-fermentation of leaves and sludge, respectively. Microbial analysis showed that co-fermentation enriched CE microbes like genus Clostridium_sensu_stricto_13, Caprocipiproducens, Terrisporpbacter and Praraclostridium, and suppressed the competitive microbes like genus norank_f_Caldilineaceae and Desulfomicrobium. Functional enzymes analysis revealed that co-fermentation of sludge and leaves promoted MCFAs production through strengthening reverse β oxidation (RBO) pathway, while co-fermentation of sludge and grass stimulated MCFAs production by strengthening fatty acid biosynthesis (FAB) pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfomicrobium 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3afermentation 3agrasses 3ahexanoic acid 3alignocellulose 3aoxidation 3asewage sludge 0aCo-fermentation 0aMedium-chain fatty acids 0aSewage sludge 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aFunctional enzymes analysis1 aHu, Yuming1 aWang, Jianlong0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Oct., v. 361 p.127665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001500276500001500291520124800306592002801554650001401582650003801596650001101634650001101645650001101656650000901667650000901676650001901685650000901704650001301713650001201726650001101738650001101749650002501760650001301785650002201798650001301820651001001833653003001843653001601873653001001889653001501899653002801914653002001942700002701962700002701989700002302016773010702039856005102146852000902197655001202206IND50088222820221120110429.0140414e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008822282DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2011.5474402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopinath, Anu10aStatistical Significance of BioMonitoring of Marine Algae for Trace Metal Levels in a Coral Environment  ap. 98-105.  a2019-12-05  aSamples of macro algae collected at random distances from the coral and near shore environment of Lakshadweep archipelago were analyzed for their trace metal content (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr, Cd, Pb, and Ni). All the species showed an affinity towards essential elements, and the concentration of Fe seemed to be the highest in all the species, irrespective of their classification. The trace metal content reported in this study was much lower than the limit prescribed by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in seafood for human consumption. None of the species of algae had the tendency to bioconcentrate Pb in their system as the detection level was below 0.1 mg/kg. The metal selectivity index calculated in statistical analysis emphasized the ability of algae to accumulate a particular metal from among the metals studied. To show the similarity between species and metal uptake, a group linkage clustering technique was used and the results were depicted using dendrogram. The marked similarities in the levels of trace metals in algal species have supported the view that all samples originated from a common coastal habitat. This exemplifies the applicability of bio-monitoring studies of marine algae to forensic investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3acobalt 3ahumans 3acopper 3azinc 3alead 3alinkage groups 3airon 3aseafoods 3acadmium 3acorals 3anickel 3astatistical analysis 3achromium 3aforensic sciences 3ahabitats 3aIndia 0aspecies selectivity index 0amacro algae 0aAlgae 0acoral reef 0ametal selectivity index 0aTrellis diagram1 aMuraleedharan, Nair S.1 aChandramohanakumar, N.1 aJayalakshmi, K.

The routes that have been taken for the chemical synthesis of such nucleoside derivatives are described, with special attention to the innovative strategies. The enzymatic synthesis, base-pairing properties, structure, and stability of oligonucleotides containing nucleobase- or 4′-hydroxymethyl-transposed nucleotides are discussed. The use of oligonucleotides containing nucleobase- or 4′-hydroxymethyl-transposed nucleotides as small oligonucleotide (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus integrase) inhibitors, in applications such as antisense therapy, silencing RNA (siRNA), or aptamer selections, is detailed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantineoplastic agents 3abioactive properties 3amoieties 3anucleosides 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphonates 3asmall interfering RNA 3astereoisomers 3asynthesis 3atherapeutics1 aRenders, Marleen1 aGroaz, Elisabetta1 aHerdewijn, Piet1 aVan Calenbergh, Serge0 tChemical Reviews.g2015 Dec. 23, v. 115, no. 24 p.13484-13525dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.5b005453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010100155300001600256500002000272520140500292592002801697650001501725650003401740650002201774650003901796650002401835650002701859650002101886650002701907650002301934650002501957650001001982650001901992650001102011650001802022650001202040650001202052650001402064650002602078650002302104650001102127650002402138650001202162650001602174650001202190650002002202651001002222700001902232700001802251773011202269856007302381852000902454655001202463IND60593905220221119204547.0180508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059390522DNAL7 a10.1111/epp.124472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilardi, G.10aEmerging foliar and soil‐borne pathogens of leafy vegetable crops: a possible threat to Europe  ap. 116-127.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aItaly is one of the leading countries for the production and consumption of ready‐to‐eat salads. This has led to a steady increase in the area used over the last decade for the growth of leafy vegetables under intensive systems. The recent new diseases that affect lettuce, wild and cultivated rocket, lamb's lettuce, spinach and basil are reported here: Plectosphaerella cucumerina on wild rocket, endive and lamb's lettuce, Fusarium equiseti on wild and cultivated rocket and lettuce, Myrothecium verrucaria on spinach and wild rocket, Myrothecium roridum on lamb's lettuce, Allophoma tropica on lettuce and Alternaria sp. on basil and rocket are among the new foliar pathogens in Italy. Among the soil‐borne pathogens, Pythium aphanidermatum, Pythium irregulare and Pythium Cluster B2a have recently been isolated in Italy on spinach and Swiss chard, lamb's lettuce and lettuce, while Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae, which causes lettuce wilt, is gradually spreading to new countries. Some of the new pathogens have been found to be transmitted by seed and typical of tropical climate, and are thus favoured by the increases in temperature linked to climate change. The globalization of markets, climate change and intensive cultivation are among the factors responsible for the proliferation and spread of some of these new pathogens that are ‘alien’ to Italian production systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aFusarium equiseti 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae 3aMyrothecium roridum 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3aPlectosphaerella 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aPythium irregulare 3aValerianella locusta 3abasil 3aclimate change 3aendive 3aglobalization 3alettuce 3amarkets 3apathogens 3aproduction technology 3aready-to-eat foods 3asalads 3asoil-borne diseases 3aspinach 3atemperature 3atropics 3avegetable crops 3aItaly1 aGullino, M.

We have operated continuous aerosol samplings at four locations in Japan from the accident until the end of 2011. The activities of ⁹⁰Sr and ¹³⁷Cs in the aerosol samples were measured using low background liquid scintillation counters and high-purity germanium detectors, respectively. The atmospheric ⁹⁰Sr and ¹³⁷Cs concentrations decreased exponentially during 2011. The time variation of the ⁹⁰Sr/¹³⁷Cs ratio was obtained, and we found that the ratio rose from 1.2 × 10–³ in March to 1.3 × 10–¹ in August 2011. One reason for the increase in the ⁹⁰Sr/¹³⁷Cs ratio could be the change in the primary emission source of activity at the FDNPP, which occurred near June 2011.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aaerosols 3acesium 3acounters 3adetectors 3agermanium 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradionuclides 3astrontium 3atemporal variation 3aJapan1 aNinomiya, Kazuhiko1 aYamaguchi, Yoshiaki1 aKita, Kazuyuki1 aTsuruta, Haruo1 aIgarashi, Yasuhito1 aShinohara, Atsushi0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2018 Aug. 06, v. 52, no. 17 p.9917-9925dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b016973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245013700171300001600308520051800324592002800842650002400870650001200894650000900906650002000915650000900935650002700944700001800971700001700989773012401006856005501130852000901185655001201194IND50074160320221118010524.0140321e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007416032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01589.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHEN, XUEYAN10aDevelopment of 51 genomic microsatellite DNA markers of guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and their application in closely related species  ap. 302-306.  aFifty‐one microsatellite DNA markers of guppy (Poecilia reticulata) were developed.

High expression of active single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) in Escherichia coli has not been successful, as the protein contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds that are difficult to form correctly in the bacterial intracellular environment. To solve this problem, we fused the scFv gene against VEGF165 with a small ubiquitin-related modifier gene (SUMO) by synthesizing an artificial SUMO–scFv fusion gene that was highly expressed in the BL21(DE3) strain. The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion protein, SUMO–scFv, was up to 28.5% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease to obtain the native scFv, which was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The result of the high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the purity of the recombinant cleaved scFv was greater than 98%. The primary structure of the purified scFv was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis. In vitro activity assay demonstrated that the recombinant scFv could dose-dependently inhibit VEGF165-induced human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cell proliferation. The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant scFv with native sequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acids 3acell proliferation 3adesorption 3adisulfide bonds 3aendothelial cells 3agene fusion 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amodifiers (genes) 3anickel 3anitrilotriacetic acid 3aproteinases 3arecombinant antibodies 3atherapeutics 2aAntibodiesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aEndothelial Cellsxdrug effects 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Variable Regionxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSUMO-1 Proteinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Aximmunology1 aLin, Zhihua1 aLei, Huanzong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2008 Nov., v. 81, no. 2 p.311-317dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-008-1655-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010000180520109300280592002801373650001501401650001001416650002501426650001601451650002601467650001501493650002501508653002001533653003401553653002201587653003601609653002101645700001901666700001101685700001201696700002401708700002401732773010601756856008701862852000901949655001201958IND60783839420221120193542.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078383942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberoi, Akashdeep Singh10aAnaerobic membrane bioreactors for pharmaceutical-laden wastewater treatment: A critical review  aPharmaceuticalsare a diverse group of chemical compounds widely used for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in both humans and animals. Pharmaceuticals, either in their original or metabolite form, find way into the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) from different sources. Recently, anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBR) has received significant research attention for the treatment of pharmaceuticals in various wastewater streams. This review critically examines the behaviour and removal of a wide array of pharmaceuticals in AnMBR with primary focus on their removal efficiencies and mechanisms, critical influencing factors, and the microbial community structures. Subsequently, the inhibitory effects of pharmaceuticals on the performance of AnMBR and membrane fouling are critically discussed. Furthermore, the imperative role of membrane biofouling layer and its components in pharmaceuticals removal is highlighted. Finally, recent advancements in AnMBR configurations for membrane fouling control and enhanced pharmaceuticals removal are systemically discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofouling 3adrugs 3amembrane bioreactors 3ametabolites 3amicrobial communities 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPharmaceuticals 0aAnaerobic membrane bioreactor 0aBiotransformation 0aBiological wastewater treatment 0aMembrane fouling1 aSurendra, K.C.1 aWu, Di1 aLu, Hui1 aWong, Jonathan W.C.1 aKumar Khanal, Samir0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Oct., v. 361 p.127667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245009800156300001800254520139200272650001401664650001501678650001501693650003901708650002001747650000901767650001701776650001001793650003001803650002101833650001301854650001501867650001901882650001301901650001501914650001801929650000901947700001501956700001301971700001601984700001302000700001702013700001502030773016102045856004002206852000902246655001202255IND4535038620221120223032.0151214e20140709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453503862DNAL7 a10.1021/jf501382t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Donglei10aMast-Cell-Based Fluorescence Biosensor for Rapid Detection of Major Fish Allergen Parvalbumin  ap. 6473-6480.  aIn this study, we developed a rat basophilic leukemia cell (RBL-2H3) fluorescence sensor to detect and identify the major fish allergen parvalbumin (PV). We constructed and transfected a CD63-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid into RBL cells through a highly efficient, lipid-mediated, DNA-transfection procedure. Stable transfectant RBL cells were then obtained for a cell fluorescence assay with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results show that the cell surface expression of CD63 reflects degranulation, indicating that a fluorescence assay with these cells could efficiently measure the activation of antigen-stimulated transfectant cells and detect antigens with a nanogram level. Therefore, this cell-based fluorescence biosensor technique for detecting fish PV exhibits promise for quantifying fish PV after anti-PV immunoglobulin E (IgE) stimulation. Results show that fluorescence intensities increased with purified PV concentrations from 1 to 100 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.35 ng/mL [relative standard deviation (RSD) of 4.5%], confirmed by Î²-hexosaminidase assays. These rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells transfected with the CD63âEGFP gene and responded to PV only when they were sensitized with the specific IgE antibody. This demonstrates the utility of this highly sensitive biosensor for food allergen detection and prediction. 3aallergens 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adetection limit 3afish 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aleukemia 3amast cells 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3arats1 aJiang, Hui1 aJi, Jian1 aSun, Xiulan1 aQian, He1 aZhang, Genyi1 aTang, Lili0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 July 9, v. 62, no. 27 p.6473-6480dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf501382t  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013500165300001600300520087600316592002801192650001401220650001401234650002201248650001301270650001501283650002701298650002501325650002701350650001501377653002501392653002001417653002501437653002801462700001701490700002001507700001901527773011801546856008201664852000901746655001201755IND60536026220221120151056.0190401e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053602622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2015.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Gui Jing10aPopulation structure and genetic diversity of Ammodytes personatus in the Northwestern Pacific revealed by microsatellites markers  ap. 303-311.  aGenetic diversity and population structure of Ammodytes personatus in the Northwestern Pacific were investigated for 16 collections using eight highly variable microsatellite loci. Microsatellite analyses gave strong support for the presence of two distinct groups of genotypes. Pleistocene glaciations can cause significant geographical differentiation in A. personatus populations. However, microsatellite data cannot confirm completely reproductive isolation between north group and south group. About half of comparison values within the first and second cluster were significant after sequential Bonferroni corrections. Routine oceanic currents associated with strong wind condition may provide an excellent chance for connectivity of among populations within clusters. However, gene flow can be restricted by marine gyres due to complex geographical characteristic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmodytes 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aglaciation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3areproductive isolation 3awind speed 0aAmmodytes personatus 0aMicrosatellites 0aPopulation structure 0aPleistocene glaciations1 aHu, Jing Jie1 aGao, Tian Xiang1 aHan, Zhi Qiang0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2015 Aug., v. 61 p.303-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2015.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014200165300001800307520154200325592002801867596005901895596007001954596010902024596007002133650001002203650000902213650001302222650001502235650002802250650001902278650000802297650001302305650001902318650001402337650002502351700005302376700001902429700001602448700001902464700001702483700001702500773012102517856008302638852000902721655001202730IND60777075820221118235525.0220513e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077707582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07194-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhekun10aBioinspired robust top-perforated micro-conical array of TC4 surface fabricated by pulsed laser ablation for enhanced anti-icing property  ap. 8890-8903.  aThe poor wear performance of passive anti-icing micro/nano-structured TC4 surface restricts its wide applications in engineering field. Interestingly, it was observed that microstructure of sled dog hair exhibits a low-temperature-adaptive property to keep away from ice accumulation by the perforations located in the center of the hair shaft and the cuticle of lobster claw reveals extraordinary mechanical strength with micro-porous structures. In this work, bioinspired top-perforated micro-conical array structure is proposed on TC4 surfaces compatible with anti-icing property and mechanical durability. The microstructured unit is composed of a micro-conical frustum and a perforated micro-hole on the top, which could be fabricated on TC4 via direct nanosecond ultraviolet laser processing. The delayed freezing time of the water droplet on the bioinspired surface can be significantly extended by 18 times, exhibiting excellent superhydrophobicity with WCAs exceeding 164°. Meanwhile, the bioinspired anti-icing surface shows excellent wear resistance by both abrasion and water impinging tests, where the delayed freezing time does not obviously decrease after 30 mins’ continuous water impinging. The top-perforation of the micro-conical could enhance the anti-icing property and durability simultaneously and the results were explained based on finite element analysis. The proposed bioinspired TC4 structure fabricated by pulsed laser ablation has great engineering potentials in extremely cold and humid environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a62175203cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020H0006cFujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology  aRD2020050301cInnovation Laboratory for Sciences and Technologies of Energy Materials of Fujian Province  a2020A1515010519cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 3aclaws 3acold 3adroplets 3adurability 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aice 3alobsters 3amicrostructure 3asled dogs 3astrength (mechanics)1 aZhou, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7111-756X1 aYan, Huangping1 aLin, Yuhang1 aHuang, Weipeng1 aYuan, Gongfa1 aCui, Jingqin0 tJournal of materials science.g2022 May, v. 57, no. 19 p.8890-8903dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-07194-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001600301520134700317592002801664650002201692650002101714650002501735650000901760650001301769650001601782650000901798650002701807650001801834650002601852650001701878650001001895700001701905700002001922700002501942700001901967700001601986773012302002856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60636027120221119094052.0200728e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063602712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-018-9818-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundaria, Naveen10aSeed Priming with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Triggers Iron Acquisition and Biofortification in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Grains  ap. 122-131.  aIron deficiency anaemia is a major challenge among consumers in developing countries. Given the deficiency of iron in the diet, there is an urgent need to devise a strategy for providing the required iron in the daily diet to counter the iron deficiency anaemia. We propose that iron biofortification of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through seed priming would be an innovative strategy to address this issue. This investigation attempts to find the interaction of iron oxide nanoparticles on germination, growth parameters and accumulation of grain iron in two contrasting wheat genotypes WL711 (low-iron genotype) and IITR26 (high-iron genotype). Wheat seeds were primed with different concentrations of iron oxide nanoparticles in the range of 25–600 ppm, resulting in differential accumulation of grain iron contents. We observed a pronounced increase in germination percentage and shoot length at 400 and 200 ppm treatment concentrations in IITR26 and WL711 genotypes, respectively. Intriguingly, the treatment concentration of 25 ppm demonstrated higher accumulation with a significant increase in grain iron contents to 45.7% in IITR26 and 26.8% in WL711 genotypes, respectively. Seed priming represents an innovative and user-friendly approach for wheat biofortification which triggers iron acquisition and accumulation in grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiofortification 3adeveloping countries 3adiet 3agenotype 3agermination 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3ananoparticles 3anutrient deficiencies 3aseed priming 3awheat1 aSingh, Manoj1 aUpreti, Prateek1 aChauhan, Ravendra P.1 aJaiswal, J.

The relationship between the levels of 4-MI and various pyrazines was studied. When glucose and ammonium hydroxide were heated, the amount of 4-MI was 556 Â± 1.3 Î¼g/mL, which increased to 583 Â± 2.6 Î¼g/mL by the addition of 0.1 M of sodium sulfite. When various food additives, such as 0.1 M of iron sulfate, magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate, tryptophan, and cysteine were added, the amount of 4-MI was reduced to 110 Â± 0.7, 483 Â± 2.0, 460 Â± 2.0, 409 Â± 4.4, and 397 Â± 1.7 Î¼g/mL, respectively. The greatest reduction, 80%, occurred with the addition of iron sulfate. Among the 12 pyrazines, 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine with 4-MI showed the highest correlation (r = â0.8239). 3aammonium hydroxide 3acysteine 3afood additives 3aglucose 3amagnesium sulfate 3apyrazines 3asodium sulfite 3atryptophan 3azinc sulfate1 aKa, Mi-Hyun1 aLee, Kwang-Geun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 July 9, v. 62, no. 27 p.6481-6486dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf502008q  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245011300179300001600292520135000308592002801658650002201686650002101708650001701729650001201746650002201758700001801780700002001798700001901818700001401837700001801851700002201869700002001891700001901911700001601930700002001946700002001966773010501986856008502091852000902176655001202185IND60533858320180514000000.0160801e20160113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053385832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b005632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachman, John Christopher10aInorganic Solid-State Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries: Mechanisms and Properties Governing Ion Conduction  ap. 140-162.  aThis Review is focused on ion-transport mechanisms and fundamental properties of solid-state electrolytes to be used in electrochemical energy-storage systems. Properties of the migrating species significantly affecting diffusion, including the valency and ionic radius, are discussed. The natures of the ligand and metal composing the skeleton of the host framework are analyzed and shown to have large impacts on the performance of solid-state electrolytes. A comprehensive identification of the candidate migrating species and structures is carried out. Not only the bulk properties of the conductors are explored, but the concept of tuning the conductivity through interfacial effectsspecifically controlling grain boundaries and strain at the interfacesis introduced. High-frequency dielectric constants and frequencies of low-energy optical phonons are shown as examples of properties that correlate with activation energy across many classes of ionic conductors. Experimental studies and theoretical results are discussed in parallel to give a pathway for further improvement of solid-state electrolytes. Through this discussion, the present Review aims to provide insight into the physical parameters affecting the diffusion process, to allow for more efficient and target-oriented research on improving solid-state ion conductors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aligands 3alithium batteries1 aMuy, Sokseiha1 aGrimaud, Alexis1 aZhang, Haoxun,1 aPour, Nir1 aLux, Simon F.1 aPaschos, Odysseas1 aMaglia, Filippo1 aLupart, Saskia1 aLamp, Peter1 aGiordano, Livia1 aShao-Horn, Yang0 tChemical Reviews.g2016 Jan. 13, v. 116, no. 1 p.140-162dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.5b005633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04048naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245005900211300001600270500001100286520237600297592002802673596005402701596004702755596004102802596010002843650002202943650001502965650002102980650001403001650001003015650000903025650001503034650001303049650001203062650001703074650001803091650001503109650001103124650001803135650001303153650001503166650001303181650002303194650002503217650001603242700005903258773010903317856008303426852000903509655001203518IND60631069220221118050337.0190514e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063106922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-018-02239-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardo, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0722-571510aThermodynamics of adsorption on nanocellulose surfaces  ap. 249-279.  aReview  aUnderstanding the thermodynamic interactions of cellulose nanomaterials with their environment is important to understand the forces behind their self-organization and co-organisation with other compounds, and to be able to use self-assembly to form new functional multicomponent materials. This review analyzes published studies that determined the thermodynamic parameters of the surface interactions of and adsorption of various compounds (proteins, polymers, and small molecules/ions) onto cellulose nanomaterials. We compiled the data reported and performed a meta-analysis for better comparison and to find trends in the published data. We first introduce the methods employed and describe the adsorption isotherm models typically used to describe the adsorption thermodynamics on nanocellulose surfaces. We then discuss and analyze the published results for the interaction of the various compounds with nanocellulose surfaces. The systems that have been reported on most were adsorption of natural binding proteins and various pollutants from water, such as heavy metal ions, dyes, and drugs. Interactions between cellulose surfaces and the cellulose binding module were generally both enthalpy- and entropy-driven, where the negative binding enthalpy indicates the formation of specific interactions between peptides and the carbohydrate backbone. On the other hand, interactions with charged molecules were mostly endothermic and purely entropy-driven, indicating that the adsorption on nanocellulose surfaces can be described as an interaction between opposite charges, where the entropy increase that arises from the release of surface-structured water molecules and counterions from the electronic double layer supplies the major contribution to the free energy of adsorption. We performed a meta-analysis on all published data, and found a linear relationship between ∆H and ∆S with the slope equal to the reference temperature, irrespective of whether the interacting compound is a specific cellulose binding protein, a non-specific binding protein, a polymer, or a small molecule/ion. This indicates that the process of adsorption is the same for all compounds and takes place with a constant change in Gibbs free energy of interaction, ∆G, where a change in interaction enthalpy is offset by change in entropy change upon binding and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data  aG.0C60.13NcFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (BE)  a1501516NcFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek  aOT/14/072cOnderzoeksraad, KU Leuven  aProvince Chair in Advance MaterialscProvinciale Ontwikkelingsmaatschappij West-Vlaanderen (BE) 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3abinding proteins 3acellulose 3adrugs 3adyes 3aendothermy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheavy metals 3ameta-analysis 3ametal ions 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3apeptides 3apollutants 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 3asurface interactions 3atemperature1 aThielemans, Wim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4451-19640 tCellulose.g2019 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.249-279dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-018-02239-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01912naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013600168520081200304592002801116650001201144650002201156650001301178650002001191650001501211653002301226653001401249653001501263653001601278700002001294700001801314700002801332773010601360856008701466852000901553655001201562IND60783839620221120194238.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078383962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1276692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Liuyi10aBiofilm with highly heterogeneous interior structure for pollutant removal: Effects of individual extracellular polymeric substance  aFor the first time, this study reveals the effects of an individual component of extracellular polymeric substances on the substrate consumption rates by the embedded cells based on the highly heterogeneous interior structures of a working biofilm. The flow-across mode in operation established a boundary-layer flow field with high transport resistance, making the uniformly structured model valid. Conversely, the flow field of the flow-through mode is determined by 46% jointly by proteins and β-d-glucopyranose polysaccharides. The substrate consumption rates hindered by β-d-glucopyranose polysaccharide is up to 60% over the 20%−40% biofilm height from the bottom, much lower than expected by the uniformly structured models. The strategies to maximize the biofilm performance have been suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3apollution control 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3atechnology 0aInterior structure 0aDiffusion 0aConvection 0aPerformance1 aWang, Xiaodong,1 aChang, Jo-Shu1 aLee, D.

This study was designed with the objectives of assessing the contribution of forests to annual income of rural households and identifying its determinants using the case of Jelo Afromontane forest in eastern Ethiopia. It also examined the gender dimensions of forest income, and how this income varies with the wealth status of households. Key informant interview, focus group discussion and household-based questionnaire survey were used to collect data. On average, income from crop production accounted for 40.7% of the total annual household income. Forest income was second in importance, contributing 32.6%. Income from livestock, off- and non-farm activities, and woodlots accounted for 13.6%, 11.4%, and 1.7% of the total household income respectively. Firewood was the most used forest product and constituted the largest proportion (79%) of the total forest income. The contribution of forest income to the total household income varied significantly (P<0.05) with wealth category. Forest income was more important for poor households (47.3%) than for medium (30.5%) or rich (20.2%) households. It was also more important for female headed households (58.2%) than for male headed households (29%). The gender dimension of forest income was also apparent within the household. Female members generated about four times more forest income (77% of the household forest income) than male members (23%). The sex of the household head (P<0.01) and distance to the forest (P<0.05) were the two determinant variables that significantly affected forest income out of the eight explanatory variables considered in the regression model. Policy to promote new forest management arrangement such as participatory forest management (PFM) in Jelo forest needs to take into account the major forest users and the types of products they depend on, and be accompanied with other poverty reduction measures so that improved forest conservation outcome will not have negative consequences on local livelihoods, particularly on poor and women, who depend most on the forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3adeveloping countries 3aforest management 3aforest resources 3aforests 3afuelwood 3agender 3ahighlands 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3apoverty 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awomen 3aEthiopia 0aFirewood 0aForest dependence 0aGender 0aHousehold income 0aLivelihoods 0aWealth status1 aLemenih, Mulugeta1 aHabtemariam Kassa,1 aEwnetu, Zeleke0 tForest policy and economics.g2013 Mar., v. 28 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2013.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169300001600281500001500297520196900312592002802281650001402309650001402323650001102337650001402348650002102362650002502383650001802408650001102426650000902437650001202446650001902458650001702477650001502494651001202509653001502521653003402536653003702570653004302607653001402650653001202664653001702676700001902693700002102712773010802733856005102841852000902892655001202901IND50088223320221120115742.0140414e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008822332DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2011.5950482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAloulou, Fatma10aImpact of Oil Field-Produced Water Discharges on Sediments: A Case Study of Sabkhat Boujemal, Sfax, Tunisia  ap. 290-299.  a2019-12-05  aOil companies are considered to be a source of chronic pollution with continual discharge of wastewaters into the environment. Thus, the impact of petroleum contamination from French–Tunisian Oil Company on the endorheic basin Sabkhat Boujemal is assessed. This area is a continental depression that has no relation with the sea; instead this basin is just an evaporative system. The results show that aliphatic n-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentrations, measured on surficial (0–4 cm) sandy sediments, range from 705 to 4560 mg/kg ⁻¹ dry sediment and from 11 to 1124 mg Kg ⁻¹ dry sediment, respectively. The spatial distribution of these concentrations shows high levels in the vicinity of the oiled water discharge. The distribution pattern of n-alkanes with no odd or even dominance, high levels of unresolved complex mixture (UCM) (198.1–1500 μg/g⁻¹ dry sediment), associated to the combination of different evaluation indices enhance this assessment. Indeed, levels close to 1 for both carbon preference index (CPI) and low molecular weight to high molecular weight ratios (≤C24:>C24) as well as values of n-alkanes/C16 <50 and pristane/phytane close to 1 suggests the presence of petroleum hydrocarbon inputs from the effluents rejected by the French Tunisian oil company in the Sabkhat. To elucidate sources of PAHs, three molecular indices (phenanthrene (Phen)/anthracene (Ant), fluranthene (Flu)/pyrene (Pyr), and Σmethyl phenanthrenes/phenanthrene) are used. As Ant, Flu, and alkylated PAH are respectively less thermodynamically stable than Phen, Pyr and unsubstituted PAH homologues, ratios of Phen/Ant <1, Flt/Pyr >10, and ΣMethyl Phen/Phen >2 indicate petrogenic origin of PAH. Conversely, ratios of Phen/Ant >1, Flt/Pyr <10, and ΣMethyl Phen/Phen <2 are characteristics of pyrogenic PAH. The results show intermediate values of PAH indices, which indicate a mixture of pyrogenic and petrogenic origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aeffluents 3abasins 3apetroleum 3amolecular weight 3abusiness enterprises 3aphenanthrenes 3acarbon 3aoils 3aalkanes 3athermodynamics 3acase studies 3awastewater 3aTunisia 0apetrogenic 0acarbon preference index (CPI) 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 0apyrogenic 0aSabkhat 0aphenanthrene1 aKallell, Monem1 aBelayouni, Habib0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 12, no. 3 p.290-299dTaylor & Francis Groupx1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2011.595048  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010800173300001600281520134900297592002801646650002201674650001701696650003801713650002701751650002401778650001901802650002301821650001601844650002801860700002301888700002301911700002101934773012301955856008102078852000902159655001202168IND50088989420221116175743.0150214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008898942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-014-2410-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiotto, Estefania N.10aEffect of Storage Conditions and Antioxidants on the Oxidative Stability of Sunflower–Chia Oil Blends  ap. 767-776.  aThe mixture of different proportions of sunflower with chia oil provides a simple method to prepare edible oils with a wide range of desired fatty acid compositions. Sunflower–chia (90:10 and 80:20 wt/wt) oil blends with the addition of rosemary (ROS), ascorbyl palmitate (AP) and their blends (AP:ROS) were formulated to evaluate the oxidative stability during storage at two temperature levels normally used, cool (4 ± 1 °C) and room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) for a period of 360 days. Peroxide values (PV) of the oil blends with antioxidants stored at 4 ± 1 °C showed levels ≤10.0 mequiv O₂/kg oil; the lowest levels of PV were found for blends with AP:ROS. Values higher than 10.0 mequiv O₂/kg were observed between 120–240 days for oil blends stored at 20 ± 2 °C. Similar trends were observed with p-anisidine and Totox values. The oxidative stability determined by the Rancimat method and differential scanning calorimetry showed a greater susceptibility of the oils to oxidative deterioration with increasing unsaturated fatty acids content. The addition of antioxidants increased the induction time and decreased the Arrhenius rate constant, indicating an improvement in the oxidative stability for all the oil blends. Temperature had a strong influence on the stability of these blends during storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aantioxidants 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afatty acid composition 3aoxidative stability 3aperoxide value 3astorage conditions 3atemperature 3aunsaturated fatty acids1 aIxtaina, Vanesa Y.1 aNolasco, Susana M.1 aTomás, Mabel C.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2014 May, v. 91, no. 5 p.767-776dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-014-2410-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009600207300001600303520173200319592002802051650002102079650001802100650001302118650001402131650001502145650001902160650001502179650002302194650001202217650000902229650001402238650001402252650001102266650001902277700002402296773012302320856008202443852000902525655001202534IND60636027320221119094047.0200728e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063602732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-018-9821-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotov, Andrey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8897-305810aCorrelative Inhibition Between Branches in Two-Branched Pea Seedlings is Cultivar-Dependent  ap. 132-145.  aThe contributions of strigolactones (SLs), cytokinins (CKs), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to the regulation of correlative inhibition (CI) in two-branched 10-day-old (2-B) pea seedlings were studied in different cultivars in comparison with single-shoot seedlings (1-B). The first group of cultivars (Adagumsky and Torsdag) was characterized by a tall phenotype, strong apical dominance, and CI between branches, with IAA export activity (IEA) being almost 1.5–2 times lower in the shoots of 2-B plants than in 1-B plants. Branching IAA-response (rms2-1) and SL response/deficient (rms4-1/rms1) mutants of Torsdag also displayed CI at the level of the shoot IEA. In Torsdag, vascular supply of 6-benzylaminopurine in the hypocotyl, which led to an increase in IEA, equalized IEA differences between the 2-B and 1-B shoots, thus overcoming CI. In 1-B plants of these cultivars, the levels of xylem-CK were three-fold higher than that of 2-B plants, suggesting a key role for xylem-CK in establishing CI. The previously proposed dynamic model, where IAA and CK interact in interlocking feedback loops, can account for the regulation of CI in these cultivars. By contrast, both the growth and IEA of shoots in the second group of cultivars (Térèse and Porta), which displayed a dwarf phenotype and weakened apical dominance, were similar between 2-B and 1-B plants. Porta had an increased shoot IEA, but low xylem-CK levels as compared to Adagumsky, with both cultivars showing a similar response to CK. Therefore, we assume that in the second cultivar group, the shoot IAA synthesis/export is probably independent from xylem-CK, and further studies are needed to find a factor responsible for loss of CI in these cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapical dominance 3abenzyladenine 3abranches 3acultivars 3acytokinins 3adynamic models 3ahypocotyls 3aindole acetic acid 3amutants 3apeas 3aphenotype 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astrigolactones1 aKotova, Liudmila M.0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2019 Mar., v. 38, no. 1 p.132-145dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-018-9821-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002300137245006500160300001800225500001500243520073100258650001500989650001101004650001201015650001601027650001001043650002201053650002201075650001301097650001001110653000901120700002501129700002801154773016201182856004001344852000901384655001201393IND4535038920221120222945.0151214e20140716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453503892DNAL7 a10.1021/jf501419q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewsome, Andrew G.10aNatureâs Palette: The Search for Natural Blue Colorants  ap. 6498-6511.  a2019-12-06  aThe food and beverage industry is seeking to broaden the palette of naturally derived colorants.

The current work reviews known organic blue compounds from natural plant, animal, fungal, and microbial sources. The scarcity of blue-colored metabolites in the natural world relative to metabolites of other colors is discussed, and structural trends common among natural blue compounds are identified. These compounds are grouped into seven structural classes and evaluated for their potential as new color additives. 3avegetables 3afruits 3aanimals 3ametabolites 3acolor 3aartificial colors 3abeverage industry 3abacteria 3afungi 0adyes1 aCulver, Catherine A.1 aVan Breemen, Richard B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 July 16, v. 62, no. 28 p.6498-6511dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf501419q  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014300168300001600311500001900327520158600346592002801932650001701960650001601977650003001993650001102023650001302034650000902047650002502056650002602081653001102107653001102118653001302129653002102142653001202163653001602175653002502191700002302216700001702239700006302256773012302319856008102442961000902523852000902532655001202541IND60651263020221120164119.0190711s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065126302DNAL7 a10.1017/S02664674190000382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiler, Krzysztof10aLarger leeches attack from higher ground – size-dependent preferences for ambush sites in the Bornean terrestrial leech Haemadipsa picta  ap. 140-143.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rain forests of South-East Asia represent a biodiversity hotspot of terrestrial leeches, but we have only fragmentary and often anecdotal information on this component of tropical communities. To address the foraging tactics of terrestrial leeches, we studied the vertical distribution of Haemadipsa picta on foliage in a Bornean tropical rain forest. We investigated the links between leech body length and the above-ground height of their ambush positions under natural conditions and in a choice experiment performed under semi-natural conditions. We studied 167 leeches, which varied considerably with respect to body length (4–29 mm). On average, the leeches ambushed at lower heights under natural conditions than under experimental conditions (47.7 cm vs. 67.5 cm), though the heights of ambush positions overlapped considerably. Leeches that chose higher ambush positions under natural conditions consistently chose higher ambush positions in the experiment (Pearson r = 0.29). Under both natural and experimental conditions, leech body length was positively correlated with the height of ambush positions (Pearson r = 0.48); on average, a 1-mm increase in body length corresponded to a 2–3 cm higher ambush position. Our findings suggest that H. picta individuals actively choose hunting locations according to their above-ground height, shifting their ambush sites over ontogeny to higher foliage. We hypothesize that growing leeches might target different prey following ontogenetic shifts in the foraging optima, ultimately decreasing intraspecific competition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abody length 3aintraspecific competition 3aleaves 3aontogeny 3arain 3aspatial distribution 3atropical rain forests 0aAmbush 0aBorneo 0aforaging 0aHaemadipsa picta 0aleeches 0apreferences 0atropical rain forest1 aGurgul, Aleksandra1 aPeryga, Maja1 aCzarnoleski, Marcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2645-03600 tJournal of tropical ecology.g2019, v. 35, no. 3 p.140-143dCambridge University PresswJournal:21387x1469-78317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S02664674190000383Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245008300177300001600260520101300276592002801289650001601317650001801333650000901351650001601360650001101376650001301387650001601400650003901416650006901455650002101524650003801545650004101583650004701624650004201671650004301713650004201756650003401798700001601832700001501848700001401863700001401877700001801891700002001909773009801929856004802027852000902075655001202084IND4493687820221122165028.0150219e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449368782DNAL7 a221871682pmid7 a10.1007/s12033-011-9483-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu10aFunctional Characterization of a Chrysanthemum dichrum Stress-Related Promoter  ap. 161-169.  aA 1,474-bp stress-inducible CdDREBa promoter was identified from Chrysanthemum dichrum, revealing several candidate stress-related cis-acting elements (MYC-box, MYB site, GT-1, and W-box) within it. In Arabidopsis leaf tissues transformed with a CdDREBa promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion, serially 5′-deleted CdDREBa promoters were differentially activated by cold and salinity. Histochemical and quantitative assays of GUS expression allowed us to localize a critical part of the promoter located between upstream 430 and 351 nt. This 80-bp fragment enhanced GUS expression under salinity stress when fused to −90/+8 CaMV 35S minimal promoter. Further promoter internal-deletion assays indicated that a low temperature-responsive element was located between positions −430 and −390, and a salinity inducible one between −385 and −351. Our results showed that there was a novel stress-related critical region except for the known cis-acting element (MYC-box, GT-1) in CdDREBa promoter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aChrysanthemum 3acold 3agene fusion 3aleaves 3asalinity 3asalt stress 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChrysanthemumxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCold Temperature 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlucuronidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHeat-Shock Responsexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxphysiology 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology1 aChen, Sumei1 aChen, Fadi1 aLi, Pirui1 aChen, Lin1 aGuan, Zhiyong1 aChang, Qingshan0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2012 Oct., v. 52, no. 2 p.161-169dSpringer-Verlagx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-011-9483-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007100171300001600242520109500258592002801353650002301381650001801404650001601422650001101438650002201449650002201471650000901493650002801502653003201530653002501562653002801587653003901615653003201654653002801686653003301714653003401747700002301781773010801804856005101912852000901963655001201972IND50088223620221120115930.0140414e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008822362DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2011.5950512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatyal, Ashok K.10aFlood Management Strategies for a Holistic Sustainable Development  ap. 206-218.  aLiving with floods and managing rather than controlling them is becoming the norm. Integrated flood management (IFM) strategies are needed for holistic sustainable developments in the floodplains. A combination of structural and nonstructural measures (IFM) is the key to manage flooding risks to life and property, reduce susceptibility, and preserve ecological diversity and integrity, natural resources and values of the floodplains. Forensic applications can further help identify sources of contaminations, synthesize missing historic data, determine equitable cost/benefit distributions and motivate IFM adaptation, as well as evaluating the migration/passage of flood transported contamination. This article reviews flood-associated issues and solutions to date, while proposing integrated flood management (IFM) approaches that take advantage of cutting-edge and sustainable scientific techniques (including forensic fingerprinting) and materials. Moreover, the integration within the legal policies and cost-benefits analysis are discussed along with other aspects of proposed IFM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aflood control 3afloodplains 3afloods 3aforensic sciences 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3asustainable development 0aflood management strategies 0afloodplain diversity 0asustainable development 0aenvironmental/ecological integrity 0afingerprinting applications 0aenvironmental forensics 0anatural resources allocation 0aand river corridor protection1 aPetrisor, Ioana G.0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 12, no. 3 p.206-218dTaylor & Francis Groupx1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2011.595051  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014900172300001800321520151500339592002801854650001701882650001501899650001901914650002001933650001301953650001201966650001901978650001801997650001402015650001902029650001202048650001602060650001402076650001402090650001502104700002202119700002702141700006202168773012102230856008302351852000902434655001202443IND60777076420221118235645.0220513e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077707642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-07196-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar Kuila, Saikat10aPhoton and vibration synergism on planar defects induced 2D-graphitic carbon nitride for ultrafast remediation of dyes and antibiotic ampicillin  ap. 8658-8675.  aHybrid oxidation methodologies (HOMs) and active site enrichment of 2D nanocatalyst through defects induction are ubiquitously used for generating adequate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in synergistic decontamination of nano hazards. In this study, 2D graphitic carbon nitride (2D-gCN), synthesized through a single-step liquid exfoliation methodology, depicts a tensile strain-induced planar defect intensified structure, as comprehended from microscopic, spectroscopic, diffraction, and photo-electrochemical (PEC) studies. Also, the piezo-photocatalytic capability of degrader 2D-gCN is revealed through a rapid removal of several noxious organic pollutants, i.e., methylene blue (MB, 97% in 16 min), bromophenol blue (BB, 88% in 16 min), and ampicillin (AMP, 75%, in 120 min) in a controlled catalytic condition. Rates for MB, BB, and AMP piezo-photo-dismissals are respectively ~ 16.4, 9.4, and 3.4 times higher than sole photocatalysis. The dismissal pathway consists of band bending through photon-aided piezo-cavitation, which leads to maximum ROS production and recombination suppression. Furthermore, LC–MS analysis confirms AMP remediation. In radicals trapping, OH, h⁺, and O₂.⁻ are predominantly accountable for the AMP, BB, and MB dismissal, respectively. The piezo-photocatalytic stability has been assured through the morphological and bond characteristics of reusable 2D-gCN. So, using the HOM approach, 2D-gCN can be projected as a proficient remediator in wastewater treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aampicillin 3acarbon nitride 3adecontamination 3agraphene 3aliquids 3amethylene blue 3ananocatalysts 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotons 3aremediation 3asynergism 3avibration 3awastewater1 aKumbhakar, Partha1 aSekhar Tiwary, Chandra1 aKumar Kundu, Tarun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3853-40780 tJournal of materials science.g2022 May, v. 57, no. 19 p.8658-8675dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-07196-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02851naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007200165300001600237520146000253592002801713650001901741650001301760650001801773650001001791650001901801650002501820650002801845650002801873650001301901650002001914650001601934653002101950653002101971653001701992653001802009653002002027700002102047700001602068700001502084700002202099700001302121700002102134773012202155856008302277852000902360655001202369IND60767051420221120203048.0220606e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076705142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Andong10aOrganic foams stabilized by Biphenyl-bridged organosilica particles  ap. 171-181.  aCan surface-active particles be designed à la carte just by incorporating functional groups mimicking the structure of the solvent and gas? This is based on the idea that, to achieve good foamability, the particle wettability needs to be finely tuned to adjust the liquid-particle and gas-particle surface tensions. In practice, could particles containing phenyl rings and alkyl chains assemble at the air–liquid interface and stabilize foams based on aromatic solvents? A library of organosilica particles was prepared by sol–gel synthesis using aromatic organosilane precursors. The particles were characterized by TGA, FTIR and ¹³C/²⁹Si MAS NMR. The foaming properties were studied after hand shaking and high-speed homogenization. The influence of particle wettability and solvent properties on foam formation was systematically investigated. A comparison was carried out between biphenyl-bridged particles and various stabilizers on foamability in benzyl alcohol. Biphenyl-bridged particles could stabilize foams in aromatic solvents with a high foam volume fraction up to 96% using Ultra-Turrax. The presence of biphenyl rings and short alkyl chains was crucial for foamability. Organic foams were prepared for aromatic solvents with intermediate surface tension (35–44 mN m⁻¹) and contact angle in the range 32–53°. Biphenyl-bridged particles outperformed polytetrafluoroethylene and fluorinated surfactants in benzyl alcohol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzyl alcohol 3abiphenyl 3acontact angle 3afoams 3ahomogenization 3aliquid-air interface 3aorganosilicon compounds 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3asolvents 3asurface tension 3awettability 0aNon-aqueous Foam 0aBiphenyl-bridged 0aOrganosilica 0aContact Angle 0aSurface Tension1 aDedovets, Dmytro1 aGu, Yunjiao1 aZhang, Shi1 aSargent, William,1 aHan, Xia1 aPera-Titus, Marc0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 July, v. 617 p.171-181dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010900207520158700316592002801903650002401931650001501955650001601970650002501986650001502011650001702026650000902043650001502052650001702067650001802084650001602102650000902118650001102127650001002138653000802148653000902156653002002165653002302185700001402208700001902222700001502241700001802256700001602274773010202290856008302392852000902475655001202484IND60680060320221116153835.0200128e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068006032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.1054232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheemaeker, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1480-505610aUrinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin as an early biomarker for acute kidney injury in dogs  aNeutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is used as an early biomarker of renal injury in people. In dogs, increases in urinary NGAL (uNGAL) precede increases in serum creatinine (sCr) in experimental and clinical evaluations of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease. This study compared uNGAL in two subsets of dogs with AKI and their respective controls. One set included dogs with snake-envenomation at risk for or presenting with International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) grade I AKI; the other group included dogs with AKI, where renal injury was the result of various causes, and IRIS grade was ≥II. Additionally, this study evaluated haemoglobin (Hb) interference during NGAL analysis in Hb spiked urine and plasma from healthy dogs.In both AKI groups, uNGAL was significantly higher than in matched healthy control dogs (P<0.01). Moreover, uNGAL was significantly higher in dogs with IRIS grade ≥II AKI than in dogs at risk of IRIS grade I AKI (P=0.04). In dogs at risk of IRIS grade I AKI, there were no significant differences in uNGAL and uNGAL/uCr between dogs bitten by cytotoxic or neurotoxic snakes (P=0.44). Additionally, Hb did not interfere with the canine NGAL immunoassay. In conclusion, this study confirms the value of uNGAL as a biomarker for early renal damage: uNGAL was significantly increased in dogs with snake-envenomation at risk for or presenting with IRIS grade I AKI, which could be left undiagnosed if evaluated with the traditional renal biomarker sCr. In addition, Hb did not interfere with NGAL measurement in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute kidney injury 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aclinical examination 3acreatinine 3acytotoxicity 3adogs 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunoassays 3aneurotoxicity 3aneutrophils 3arisk 3asnakes 3aurine 0aDog 0aNGAL 0aRenal biomarker 0aSnake envenomation1 aMeyer, E.1 aSchoeman, J.P.1 aDefauw, P.1 aDuchateau, L.1 aDaminet, S.0 tveterinary journal.g2020 Jan., v. 255 p.105423-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2019.1054233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245009100127300001300218500001400231520103800245592002801283650001801311650001301329650001101342650002601353650001601379650001601395650002801411650001701439650000901456650001001465650001701475650001001492650001401502650001401516650001101530653001401541653001201555653002001567653002901587700002301616700001601639773014301655852000901798655001201807IND60716832120221120141348.0201107e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071683212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, TN10aSeed priming improves crop growth and yield performance of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L)  ap. 9-12.  aNAL-light  aField experiments a were conducted with four levels of seed priming including control and two varieties of pigeonpea at ICAR-Indian Institute of Seed Science, Mau during three consecutive years (2011–12 to 2013–14).

To support Victorian forest biosecurity operations, Agriculture Victoria has developed a landscape-scale, spatially explicit, spatio-temporal population growth and dispersal model of a generic pest pine beetle. The model can be used to simulate the incursion of a forestry pest from a nominated location(s), such as an importation business site (approved arrangement, AA), into the surrounding environment. The model provides both illustrative and quantitative data on population dynamics and spread of a forestry pest species. Flexibility built into the model design enables a range of spatial extents to be modelled, from user-defined study areas to the Victoria-wide area. The spatial resolution of the model (size of grid cells) can be altered from 100 m to greater than 1 km. The model allows core parameters to be altered by the user, enabling the spread of a variety of windborne insect species and pathogens to be investigated. We verified the model and its parameters by simulating and comparing the outputs with the 1999/2000 Melbourne incursion, but no establishment of a forestry pest beetle was believed to be Monochamus alternatus Hope (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). The model accurately predicts the distance and direction of the historic incursion, and the subsequent failure to establish is due to low overall population density of the pest species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aMonochamus alternatus 3abiosecurity 3acase studies 3aforestry 3aforests 3ainsects 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apests 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3arisk1 aSheffield, Kathryn 1 aWeeks, Anna 1 aSmith, David 0 tForests.g2019 Feb. 22, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100201983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013800172300001600310520226500326592002802591650001502619650002002634650001002654650001402664650001602678653001402694653001802708653001402726653001702740773012302757856008402880852000902964655001202973IND60543478420221119230041.0190411e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054347842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2014.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoloboff, Pablo A.10aHide and vanish: Data sets where the most parsimonious tree is known but hard to find, and their implications for tree search methods  ap. 118-131.  aThree different types of data sets, for which the uniquely most parsimonious tree can be known exactly but is hard to find with heuristic tree search methods, are studied. Tree searches are complicated more by the shape of the tree landscape (i.e. the distribution of homoplasy on different trees) than by the sheer abundance of homoplasy or character conflict. Data sets of Type 1 are those constructed by Radel et al. (2013). Data sets of Type 2 present a very rugged landscape, with narrow peaks and valleys, but relatively low amounts of homoplasy. For such a tree landscape, subjecting the trees to TBR and saving suboptimal trees produces much better results when the sequence of clipping for the tree branches is randomized instead of fixed. An unexpected finding for data sets of Types 1 and 2 is that starting a search from a random tree instead of a random addition sequence Wagner tree may increase the probability that the search finds the most parsimonious tree; a small artificial example where these probabilities can be calculated exactly is presented. Data sets of Type 3, the most difficult data sets studied here, comprise only congruent characters, and a single island with only one most parsimonious tree. Even if there is a single island, missing entries create a very flat landscape which is difficult to traverse with tree search algorithms because the number of equally parsimonious trees that need to be saved and swapped to effectively move around the plateaus is too large. Minor modifications of the parameters of tree drifting, ratchet, and sectorial searches allow travelling around these plateaus much more efficiently than saving and swapping large numbers of equally parsimonious trees with TBR. For these data sets, two new related criteria for selecting taxon addition sequences in Wagner trees (the “selected” and “informative” addition sequences) produce much better results than the standard random or closest addition sequences. These new methods for Wagner trees and for moving around plateaus can be useful when analyzing phylogenomic data sets formed by concatenation of genes with uneven taxon representation (“sparse” supermatrices), which are likely to present a tree landscape with extensive plateaus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aprobability 0aParsimony 0aTree searches 0aHomoplasy 0aTree islands0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2014 Oct., v. 79 p.118-131dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2014.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013500164520152100299592002801820650002201848650002501870650001301895650000901908650001601917650002001933650001701953650001801970650003701988650003902025650001802064650001502082650005302097650001702150653001802167653002302185653001302208700001902221700001302240700001902253700001902272700001702291700001702308773012102325856008302446852000902529655001202538IND60680060420221116153951.0200128e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068006042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2019.1103952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Haocan10aEffect of long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on hypothalamic fatty acid sensing in Chinese perch (Siniperca chuatsi)  aIn order to evaluate fatty acid (FA) sensing systems based on binding to FAT/CD36 in hypothalamus of Chinese perch (Siniperca chuatsi) and its sensitivity to FAs with the same chain length and different unsaturation levels. The effects of Stearate (SA; C18:0), oleate (OA; C18:1 n-9), linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n-6), and α-linolenic acid (ALA; C18:3 n-3) on hypothalamic FA sensing were evaluated by intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration. Food intake was assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h. Gene expression associated with FA sensing mechanism such as cd36, pparα and srebp1c, and neuropeptides controlling appetite such as pomca, cart, agrp2 and npy were assessed after 6 h. The ICV treatment of OA, LA and ALA activated FAT/CD36 and PPARα, rather than SA, and modulated gene expression levels of hypothalamic neuropeptides associated with appetite. And then, OA, LA and ALA inhibited food intake, which was consistent with the activation of hypothalamus FA sensing. Our data indicated some mechanisms of the hypothalamic FA sensing systems also existed in Chinese perch. It's worth noting that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could also activate hypothalamic FA sensing mechanisms in Chinese perch. The unsaturation of FA appears to be extremely important for FA sensing mechanisms, since no major influences in Chinese perch after SA treatment. Our findings will contribute to the study of long-chain FAs sensing mechanisms in fish hypothalamus and highlight the importance of PUFAs in fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aappetite 3afish 3afood intake 3agene expression 3ahypothalamus 3alinoleic acid 3along chain saturated fatty acids 3along chain unsaturated fatty acids 3aneuropeptides 3aoleic acid 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3astearic acid 0aICV treatment 0aFatty acid sensing 0aFAT/CD361 aLiang, Xu-Fang1 aLi, Jiao1 aZhang, Yanpeng1 aXiao, Qianqian1 aPeng, Binbin1 aZhang, Zhilu0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 Mar., v. 241 p.110395-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2019.1103953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245005200163300001600215520138800231592002801619650000801647650002801655650001401683650000901697650002101706653002301727653001701750653002201767653003201789700001701821700001301838700003801851700001601889700001901905773012501924856008302049852000902132655001202141IND60767051820221120213424.0220517e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076705182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10a2D DNA lattices assembled from DX-coupled tiles  ap. 499-508.  aFormation of coupled double crossovers (DXs) in a circular 106-mer oligonucleotide (c106nt) could generate stable tiles with the tile core span of 10 half turns. The large-span tiles with complicated curvatures and mechanics could assemble 2D lattices under different environments. Hence, 2D DNA lattice structures based on tile types and sequences, tile packing modes of corrugation and non-corrugation, and assembly media of solution and the substrate-solution interface are yet to be explored. Two c106nt scaffold strands with different sequences were synthesized. Four types of tiles, two rectilinear and two triangular tiles, were designed and their 2D assemblies were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The DX-coupled tiles provided fair strength and rigidity to assemble 2D lattices. Due to the complicated curvature and mechanics of tiles, the two-tile assemblies in solution displayed a few ripe lattices of ribbons, tubes, or polycrystalline aggregates as the minor products and tile oligomers as the major products; whereas the one-tile assemblies via substrate mediation exhibited well-organized monolayer lattices covering the whole mica disk. The herringbone packing patterns were first observed in DNA nanostructures. Based on the lattice constants and the surface coverages of lattices, we estimated the lattice yields for the substrate-mediated assemblies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aatomic force microscopy 3amechanics 3amica 3aoligonucleotides 0aDNA nanotechnology 0aCircular DNA 0aSolution assembly 0aSubstrate-mediated assembly1 aJiang, Chuan1 aGuo, Xin1 aMuhammad Faran Ashraf Baig, Mirza1 aNi, Caihong1 aXiao, Shou-Jun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June 15, v. 616 p.499-508dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009600176300001600272520136300288592002801651650001601679650001801695650002101713650001101734650001301745650000901758650001101767650001401778650002101792650002201813650003001835650002901865653001201894653002901906653001401935653001401949700001901963700002701982700002202009773010902031856008602140852000902226655001202235IND60533444720221120094652.0190319e20150716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053344472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnandhan, Sivalingam10aRetrotransposon based TRAP marker displays diversity among onion (Allium cepa L.) genotypes  ap. 123-127.  aTy1-copia like elements are distributed throughout the onion (Allium cepa) genome, and are actively transcribed. Sequence analysis by LTR finder identified that the copia element in onion is bound by long terminal repeats (LTR) of length 121bp. Primer binding site and poly purine tract are located on copia element at 193–211bp and 4593–4607bp respectively. To exploit the variation at the insertional locus and to explore its further use as a marker, a method using a primer located on the LTR and an arbitrary primer was developed for detecting variation in onion genotypes. This method resulted in the detection of polymorphism in 22 onion genotypes. Thirty-three polymorphic amplicons were detected in these genotypes. The genetic distance between the varieties varied from 0.83 to 0.99. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Indian short day onion clustered separately from the exotic varieties indicating that the origin of Indian varieties is distinct. Further, variation observed among Indian varieties was less than that of exotic varieties. The marker was detected across eight species of genus Allium and the genetic distance between the species varied from 0.34 to 0.88. Polymorphism detection was better across the species than within A. cepa. This retrotransposon based method is likely to supplement the marker resources for Allium spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3abinding sites 3agenetic distance 3agenome 3agenotype 3aloci 3aonions 3aphylogeny 3aretrotransposons 3asequence analysis 3aterminal repeat sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 0aRepeats 0aInsertional polymorphism 0aDiversity 0aTy1 copia1 aNair, Abhilash1 aKumkar, Dipali Santosh1 aGopal, J.q(Jai),0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 July 16, v. 190 p.123-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03894naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245012600208300001800334506007600352520186400428592002802292596004702320596008002367596002202447596009602469506003702565650001502602650001302617650001602630650000902646650001202655650001602667650001402683650001102697650000902708650002202717650001102739650001602750650001602766650001602782653002002798653001402818653001202832653003402844653002502878653001802903700002502921700002202946700002302968700001702991700003303008700002103041773012303062856007403185852000903259655001203268IND60672541020221207103734.0191016e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067254102DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcy1662doi7 aPMC62661052pmcid7 a301841612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScaccabarozzi, Daniela10aMasquerading as pea plants: behavioural and morphological evidence for mimicry of multiple models in an Australian orchid  ap. 1061-1073.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile there is increasing recognition of Batesian floral mimicry in plants, there are few confirmed cases where mimicry involves more than one model species. Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae). Observations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model species. Diuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering Faboideae from the genus Daviesia. On Di. brumalis, Trichocolletes exhibited the same stereotyped food-foraging and mate-patrolling behaviour that they exhibit on Daviesia. Diuris and pea plants showed strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers. Diuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric Faboideae species. Evidence for mimicry of multiple models, all of which share pollinator species, suggests that this may represent a guild mimicry system. Interestingly, Di. brumalis belongs to a complex of species with similar floral traits, suggesting that this represents a useful system for investigating speciation in lineages that employ mimicry of food plants.  aPublisher supplied data  aID 5117_2016cEndeavour Fellowship Program  a308.16cAustralian Orchid Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001033  cCurtin University  a976_2017cUniversità degli Studi di Napoli Federico IIdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000071950 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aColletidae 3aDaviesia 3aOrchidaceae 3abees 3aflowers 3afood plants 3afruit set 3amodels 3apeas 3aplant communities 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3areflectance 0aDiuris brumalis 0aFaboideae 0amimicry 0afood deception specialization 0apollinator behaviour 0aplant fitness1 aCozzolino, Salvatore1 aGuzzetti, Lorenzo1 aGalimberti, Andrea1 aMilne, Lynne1 aDixon, K.

However, small waterbodies are sensitive to external influences; stormwater runoff carrying nutrients and oxygen, flows into waterbodies resulting in a disruption of geochemical and microbial processes. Nonetheless, little is known about how these short-term external inputs affect the microbial processes of nitrogen removal in small waterbodies. To investigate the effects of NO₃⁻, NH₄⁺, dissolved oxygen (DO) and organic C on microbial nitrogen removal in pond sediments, regulation experiments have been conducted using slurry incubation experiments and ¹⁵N tracer techniques in this study. It was demonstrated the addition of NO₃⁻ (50 to 800 μmol L⁻¹) significantly promoted denitrification rates, as expected by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Ponds with higher NO₃⁻ concentrations in the overlying water responded more greatly to NO₃⁻ additions. Moreover, N₂O production was also promoted by such an addition of NO₃⁻. Denitrification was significantly inhibited by the elevation of DO concentration from 0 to 2 mg L⁻¹, after which no significant increase in inhibition was observed. Denitrification rates increased when organic C was introduced. Due to the abundant NH₄⁺ in pond sediments, the addition demonstrated little influence on nitrogen removal. Moreover, anammox rates showed no significant changes to any amendment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3aenzyme kinetics 3afreshwater 3amicrobial nitrogen 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3apollution control 3asediments 3aslurries 3astormwater 3asurface water1 aHong, Yiguo 1 aWu, Jiapeng 1 aMoore, Selina Sterup1 aVamerali, Teofilo 1 aYe, Fei 1 aWang, Yu 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 15, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100714293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010700173520184400280592002802124650002302152650005202175650001602227650001902243650002102262650001302283650001502296650001402311650001802325650001302343650001702356650001302373650001702386650001502403650001202418700003302430700002702463700002502490700002402515700002902539700003302568773012802601856008702729852000902816655001202825IND60784126120221119020721.0220726e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078412612DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100714302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVassilaki, Niki 10aSARS-CoV-2 Amino Acid Mutations Detection in Greek Patients Infected in the First Wave of the Pandemic  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that belongs to the Coronoviridae family, emerged in December 2019, causing the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Unlike previous SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, this virus has a higher transmissibility rate, albeit a lower case fatality rate, which results in accumulation of a significant number of mutations and a faster evolution rate. Genomic studies on the mutation rate of the virus, as well as the identification of mutations that prevail and their impact on disease severity, are of great importance for pandemic surveillance and vaccine and drug development. Here, we aim to identify mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and their effect on the proteins they are located in, in Greek patients infected in the first wave of the pandemic. To this end, we perform SARS-CoV-2 amplicon-based NGS sequencing on nasopharyngeal swab samples from Greek patients and bioinformatic analysis of the results. Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered genetically stable, we discover a variety of mutations on the viral genome. In detail, 18 mutations are detected in total on 10 SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The mutations are located on ORF1ab, S protein, M protein, ORF3a and ORF7a. Sixteen are also detected in patients from other regions around the world, and two are identified for the first time in the present study. Most of them result in amino acid substitutions. These substitutions are analyzed using computational tools, and the results indicate minor or major impact on the proteins’ structural stability, which could probably affect viral transmissibility and pathogenesis. The correlation of these variations with the viral load levels is examined, and their implication for disease severity and the biology of the virus are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3adrug development 3agenomics 3amonitoring 3amortality 3amutation rate 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3avaccines 3aviral genome 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aPapadimitriou, Konstantinos 1 aIoannidis, Anastasios 1 aPapandreou, Nikos C.1 aMilona, Raphaela S.1 aIconomidou, Vassiliki A.1 aChatzipanagiotou, Stylianos 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 15, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100714303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245010800181300001800289500000900307520142000316592002801736650001201764650001201776650001801788650000901806650001401815650001401829650001001843650000901853650002601862650003101888650001401919650001101933650001101944650000901955650001801964650001801982650001602000650001502016650001402031651000902045700001902054700001602073700002002089773015002109856009602259852000902355655001202364IND60668058720221118175308.0191125e197511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066805872DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900060032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutledge, E.

Elemental and Mineralogical Composition  ap. 1133-1139.  aepub  aThis study presents the elemental and mineralogical composition of thin loessial deposits eastward of three rivers in Ohio. In general, elemental contents (Ca, Fe, K, Ti, and Zr) of medium and coarse silts of the Late Wisconsin-age loesses were of the same magnitude in each area. These elements showed remarkably slight weathering profiles which were essentially comparable among areas. Weathering profiles of Fe were more strongly expressed than those of K and Ca; depth-distributions of Zr and Ti were most uniform. Contents of Ca within a Loveland loess paleosol were remarkably constant with depth and notably low, especially in the coarse silt fraction (mean of 0.06%). Mineralogy did not reflect bedrock lithologies among the different assumed loess source areas. Clay fractions from the parent loess in the first two transects were dominated by mica followed by vermiculite and quartz with less expandables and kaolinite. Clay fractions of surface and subsurface horizons in these transects contained about equal amounts of mica, vermiculite, and quartz with less expandables and kaolinite. In the third transect, weathered loessial materials generally contained less mica and more interstratified 10–14Å components. Clay-free particle-size distribution was the most sensitive parameter of parent material uniformity; total Zr and Ti in silt fractions, and Ti/Zr ratios were less sensitive in that order.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3acalcium 3aclay fraction 3airon 3akaolinite 3alithology 3aloess 3amica 3apaleosolic soil types 3aparticle size distribution 3apotassium 3aquartz 3arivers 3asilt 3asilt fraction 3asoil horizons 3avermiculite 3aweathering 3azirconium 3aOhio1 aWilding, L.

Seen against that background, this paper examines the evolution of the Olympic movement’s sustainability agenda. It first considers how the environment emerged as an issue within the Winter Games through concerns over environmental protection, discusses measures introduced to embed sustainability into official Olympic practice, and explores the evolution of the dynamic relationship between sustainability and the overlapping but, to some extent, rival concept of “legacy”. The latter part of the paper illustrates these ideas with regard to the London 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games. It analyses the “One Planet Games” concept, how this was developed for the bid, and how it was subsequently put into practice, commenting particularly on the carbon footprint, creation of the Olympic Park (as sustainable legacy) and the promotion of sustainable living. The conclusion comments on the continuing challenges encountered in implementing sustainability plans and addressing long-term legacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3acities 3adesign for environment 3aenvironmental protection 3agames 3asports1 aGold, Margaret M.0 tSustainability.g2013 Aug. 16, v. 5, no. 8 p.3526-3542dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su50835263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001800285500001500303520162700318592002801945650002101973650001301994650002002007650001402027650001402041650001302055650002302068650001102091650001502102650002002117650001302137650001302150650001002163651001402173653001702187700001702204773010502221856008102326852000902407655001202416IND60129955520221120123003.0150503e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012995552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-014-0850-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeit, Benjamin10aSpecies level traits determine positive and negative population impacts of invasive cane toads on native squamates  ap. 1017-1029.  a2019-12-04  aThe novel interactions posed by invasive species can have complex effects on ecosystems owing to both their direct and indirect effects on other species. Consequently, the effects of invasive species can be hard to forecast owing to the diversity of interaction-pathways and number of species they can potentially affect. Ultimately, the strength and direction of an invader’s inter-specific effects will be determined by both the traits of the invader and the species they interact with. The cane toad (Rhinella marina) is a highly successful invasive species that poses a serious threat to ecosystem integrity in tropical Australia. Reptilian predators have been particularly affected by the invasion of cane toads because toads possess toxins that are novel to native Australian predators. We used a meta-regression approach to explore how cane toads’ impacts on Australian squamates are modulated by their phylogenetic, behavioural and morphological traits. Species primarily foraging in riparian and terrestrial habitats tended to decline in abundance while population sizes of arboreal squamates might have increased following toad arrival. The negative impact of cane toads on anurophagous squamates scaled with gape size and body mass. Squamate species with smaller heads or body mass tended to increase in abundance while species with larger heads or body mass tended to decline. Our study provides insight into the complexity of impacts that invasive species can have on native species assemblages and highlights how morphological and behavioural factors can mediate the impact of invasive on native species.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainvasive species 3areptiles 3aRhinella marina 3aphylogeny 3apredators 3aSquamata 3aindigenous species 3atoxins 3aecosystems 3apopulation size 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3atoads 3aAustralia 0aBufo marinus1 aLetnic, Mike0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2015 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.1017-1029dSpringer-Verlagx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-014-0850-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245014300164520095300307592002801260650001601288650001301304650001701317650002001334650001601354650001401370650001401384650001901398650001601417650001701433650001901450650002501469650001701494650001101511650001501522650003401537653002901571653001301600653001501613653002001628653001701648700001901665700001701684700001801701700001501719700001301734700001601747700001301763700001501776773009601791856008701887852000901974655001201983IND60781884320221120150713.0220824e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078188432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.1092112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Qu10aImprovement in the storage quality of fresh salmon (Salmo salar) using a powerful composite film of rice protein hydrolysates and chitosan  aTo extend the shelf life of fresh salmon fillets, this study evaluated the effects of rice protein hydrolysate/chitosan (RPH/CS) composite films on the storage quality of fresh salmon. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and RPH/CS composite films were used to pack the fresh salmons. The effects of packaging materials on the oxidation index and total viable count of fresh salmon were investigated. After 7 days of cold storage, the peroxide value, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), myoglobin content, and total viable count of the salmons packed with RPH/CS composite films were lower than those of the salmons packed with PE and PP films. The sensory properties of salmons packaged by RPH/CS composite films were still acceptable.

Conidia of the fungus were hyaline, straight to sub-straight or slightly curved, obclavate-cylindric, 40.2–180.3 × 2.5–3.4 μm with an average of 102.8 × 3 μm having 1–14 septa. The diagnostic symptoms comprised of roughly circular to irregular, white centered reddish brown to brown leaf spots measuring 2–12 mm in diameter. Under natural epiphytotic conditions minimum disease (2–5%) was recorded during 1ˢᵗ week of august which picked up later and reached 42–44 per cent by 1ˢᵗ week of october. Higher values of periodic disease (6–9%) coincided with average maximum temperature 27–30°C, minimum temperature 10–16°C, RH 82–84 per cent and periodic rain of 2–34 mm. While maximum temperature, RH and rain persay masked their statistical significance by fluctuating around respective optima, the influence of minimum temperature on disease was, however, statistically significant for the period between 4ᵗʰ week of July and 2ⁿᵈ week of September.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercospora 3aconidia 3adiameter 3aetiology 3afields 3afungi 3aleaf area 3aleaf spot 3amung beans 3arain 3asea level 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aCercospora canescens 0aEpidemiology 0aGreen gram0 tJournal of food legumes.g2019 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.36-41dIndian Society of Pulses Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2075x0976-24347nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010300171300001600274500001900290520086200309592002801171650001101199650002201210650001601232650001501248650001601263650002501279650001201304651001001316700001701326700001501343700001601358773010201374856008501476852000901561655001201570IND60695608320221118063819.0200517e19981101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069560832DNAL7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-37-6-405.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGargiulo, G.

Agardh from marine and freshwater habitats in Italy. All the populations studied had a constant somatic chromosome number of n = 3. A statistical analysis of chromosomal dimensions allowed the recognition of a consistent difference in the size of chromosome 3. Neither marine nor freshwater populations showed significant interpopulation variation in chromosome size and shape; however, comparison of karyotypes between marine and freshwater thalli revealed significant differences. Chromosome 3 of freshwater specimens is significantly shorter than the same chromosome from marine populations, and is possibly metacentric. The results of this study suggest that the proposed con specificity of marine and freshwater populations of Bangia is questionable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBangia 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3afreshwater 3akaryotyping 3astatistical analysis 3athallus 3aItaly1 aGenovese, G.1 aCuloso, F.1 aMasi, F.

Human infection ranges from asymptomatic to severe disease that can present with pancytopenia, multiorgan failure, and death. The aim of this systematic review is to analyze case reports and case series reported over the last two decades in peer-reviewed journals indexed in the Medline/PubMed database according to the PRISMA guidelines. We found 110 unique patients from 88 case reports and series. The most common mode of transmission was tick bite (60.9%), followed by blood transfusion (8.2%). Infection was acquired by blood transfusion in nearly half (42%) of the immunocompromised patients. Most patients reported fever (90%), followed by constitutional (59%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (56%). Rash was present in 17% of patients, much higher than in previous studies. Thrombocytopenia was the most common laboratory abnormality (76%) followed by elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (46%). The diagnosis was most commonly established using whole-blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 76% of patients. Coinfection rate was 9.1% and Borrelia burgdorferi was most commonly isolated in seven patients (6.4%). Doxycycline was used to treat 70% of patients but was only used as an empiric treatment in one-third of patients (33.6%). The overall mortality rate was 5.7%, and one patient died from trauma unrelated to HGA. The mortality rates among immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were 4.2% (n = 4/95) and 18.2% (n = 2/11), respectively. Four of the six patients who died (66.6%) received appropriate antibiotic therapy. Among these, doxycycline was delayed by more than 48 h in two patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood transfusion 3adatabases 3adeath 3adisease severity 3adoxycycline 3afever 3agastrointestinal system 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apathogens 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asystematic review 3athrombocytopenia 3aticks1 aJevtic, Dorde 1 aVeselinovic, Mladjen 1 aNordstrom, Charles W.1 aJovanović, Milan,1 aMogulla, Vanajakshi 1 aVeselinovic, Elmira Mofid1 aHudson, Ann 1 aSimeunovic, Gordana 1 aPetcu, Emilia 1 aRamanan, Poornima 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 15, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100714333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011700174300001400291520168800305592002801993650001002021650001202031650001702043650002102060650001402081650001402095650001102109650000902120650002702129650001302156650001202169650001402181651001002195653002202205653000802227653002202235653002202257653002302279653001702302700002002319700002502339700001902364773010702383856008602490852000902576655001202585IND60533445220221120094606.0190319e20150806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053344522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2015.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrrestarazu, Jorge10aRecovery and identification of grapevine varieties cultivated in old vineyards from Navarre (Northeastern Spain)  ap. 65-73.  aThe reconstitution of European vineyards after the phylloxera outbreak was performed with few high-aptitude varieties. In Navarre (Spain), the variety used was mainly ‘Garnacha’, though the inclusion of a small number of plants of different varieties traditionally grown in this area within each vineyard was relatively frequent. In this context, in 2008 and 2009, a systematic survey was performed on the oldest vineyards (>50 years) from Navarre in order to gather the intravarietal diversity that could be found within ‘Garnacha’ in the region, but subsequent field observation showed 197 plants to be different from ‘Garnacha’. The aim of this study was to identify the varieties corresponding to those plants. Molecular profiles were determined using 25 SSR markers, and 33 varieties were identified: 28 of them after comparisons with national and international databases and the remaining five through other sources. Slight differences in SSR allele length were found in some of the plants identified as ‘Mazuelo’, ‘Rojal’, ‘Miguel de Arco’ and ‘Tortozona Tinta’. In addition, polymorphisms involving the appearance of a third allele were found in some plants identified as ‘Viura’, ‘Mandón’, Mazuelo’ and ‘Morate’. This study shows that an important biodiversity reservoir still remains within old vineyards and, therefore, systematic surveys on them could allow gathering the varietal richness that still can be found in the region. Additionally, somatic variation at SSR loci has been shown to occur in several grape varieties, especially in the ancient ones where the likelihood that mutations are accumulated and fixed is higher.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3aalleles 3abiodiversity 3aclonal variation 3acultivars 3adatabases 3agrapes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutation 3asurveys 3avineyards 3aSpain 0aVitis vinifera L. 0aSSR 0aVarietal identity 0aSomatic variation 0aChimeric structure 0aBiodiversity1 aMiranda, Carlos1 aSantesteban, Luis G.1 aRoyo, José B.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2015 Aug. 06, v. 191 p.65-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2015.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245010500163300001600268500001500284520128900299592002801588650002101616650000901637650001101646650001301657650002301670650001601693650001101709650000901720650001701729650001601746650002101762650001001783650002201793650001101815650002701826650001601853650002301869651001501892653001401907700002201921700002201943773010501965856003802070852000902108655001202117IND4463720120221122070129.0120302e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446372012DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.5972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullick, Md.

This paper develops the total and marginal benefit functions of the key off‐stream water use, irrigation, as a function of flow in the Teesta River of Bangladesh. The field water balance approach and CROPWAT modelling are used to calculate irrigation water requirements for rice and other crops respectively. The residual imputation method is employed to estimate the value of irrigation water. In the cases of insufficient flow in the river, several scenarios based on (i) conjunctive uses of groundwater, (ii) reduction in irrigated land area and (iii) yield loss due to water stress, form the basis for establishing the total and marginal benefit functions for river water use in irrigation in the study area. Estimated marginal benefits as a function of river discharge are found to be linear with zero slopes for the first two scenarios and sloping downward for the third. Results of the study will assist water planners and managers with equitable and efficient allocation and sustainable management of the river water.  aPublisher supplied data 3airrigation water 3arice 3arivers 3amanagers 3asoil water balance 3astream flow 3amodels 3aflow 3awater stress 3ariver water 3awater allocation 3acrops 3airrigated farming 3ayields 3airrigation requirement 3agroundwater 3aeconomic valuation 3aBangladesh 0awater use1 aBabel, Mukand S.,1 aPerret, Sylvain R0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2011 Oct., v. 60, no. 4 p.481-492dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1531-03537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.597  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245007400180300001600254500000900270520079600279592002801075650001401103650001501117650001901132650001001151650002001161650001201181650001201193650002201205650001801227650004401245650001301289650001501302650001901317651001401336700002001350700001401370773014701384856009601531852000901627655001201636IND60668059020221118175251.0191125e197105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066805902DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500030037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, E.

Extraction of the pigment was carried out by shaking the soil (> 2 mm) in CHCl₃ (1:2) and decanting the supernatant liquid from which the pigment was purified by column chromatography and crystallization from ethanol. Eight kilograms of soil yielded 69 mg of the pigment. Identification of the pigment was determined using a combination of techniques including solubility tests, elemental analyses, melting point, ultraviolet, infrared, NMR, and mass spectroscopy. To the authors' knowledge, the isolation described herein is the first for a nonchlorophyllic pigment occurring in a chemically uncombined form in a tropical soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVertisols 3achloroform 3achromatography 3acolor 3acrystallization 3aethanol 3aliquids 3amass spectrometry 3amelting point 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquinones 3asolubility 3atropical soils 3aCaribbean1 aSeaforth, C.

The most frequent clinical presentation is benign pulmonary leiomyomatosis, characterized by the presence of metastatic lung nodes with no systemic involvement. Diagnosis is histological, defined by a low grade of mitosis and positive estrogen and progesterone receptors. This entity is typically benign and hormone-dependent. The aim of treatment is to decrease hormone levels through pharmacological inhibition and bilateral oophorectomy. We present a case of benign metastasizing leiomyomatosis in a 47-year-old woman who was diagnosed with endometrial stromal sarcoma.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLeiomiomatosis benigna metastatizante 0aSarcoma del estroma endometrial 0aNeoplasia hormonodependiente 0aBenign metastasizing leiomyomatosis 0aEndometrial stromal sarcoma 0aHormone-dependent neoplasm1 aCouso Cambeiro, B.1 aArias Santos, M.D.0 tClinica e Investigacion en Ginecologia y Obstetricia.g2014 Jan.,  Mar., v. 41 p.38-41dElsevier Espanax0210-573X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gine.2012.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018300165300001600348520179300364592002802157650002202185650002102207650001402228650002502242650001702267650001802284650001302302650002102315650002002336650002002356650002002376650003102396650001202427650001102439650002602450650004302476650005202519650002602571650002202597650002402619650000802643650002602651650002002677650001302697650001702710651001002727700001402737700001302751700001502764700001402779700001902793773011902812856008102931852000903012655001203021IND60537362020221116195526.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053736202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-016-0491-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ya'nan,10aDifferential transcriptome analysis of leaves of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) provides comprehensive insights into the defense responses to Ectropis oblique attack using RNA-Seq  ap. 383-398.  aTea is a very popular and healthy nonalcoholic beverage worldwide. As an evergreen woody plant, the cultivation of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) is challenged by biotic stresses, and one of which is feeding of Ectropis oblique. In China, E. oblique infestation causes serious damages in many tea cultivation areas. Tea plants have evolved sophisticated strategies to cope with attack by E. oblique. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the response to E. oblique in tea plants, the differential gene expression profiles between the E. oblique damage-induced tea plants and undamaged control using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) were obtained. A total of 1859 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 949 upregulated and 910 downregulated genes. Overall, 90 signal transduction genes, 100 anti-insect responsive transcription factors, 50 genes related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, 41 unigenes related to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) biosynthesis, and 8 caffeine biosynthesis genes were found to be differentially regulated. Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that plant secondary metabolites and the signaling pathways may play an important role in defense against insects, and a closer examination at the expression of some crucial genes revealed differential expression patterns after feeding by E. oblique. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis further confirmed the results of RNA-Seq. Our dataset provides the most comprehensive sequence resource available for studying the resistance to E. oblique in tea, which will benefit our understanding of the overall mechanisms underlying inducible defenses responses, and may be useful to create novel prevention measures against insects to reduce pesticide usage in eco-friendly tea farming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aEctropis obliqua 3abeverages 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic stress 3acaffeine 3acultivation area 3adata collection 3afarming systems 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ainsects 3aleaves 3apesticide application 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atea 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3awoody plants 3aChina1 aTang, Lei1 aHou, Yan1 aWang, Ping1 aYang, Hua1 aWei, Chao-Ling0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2016 July, v. 16, no. 4 p.383-398dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1438-793X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-016-0491-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245011500217300001900332506007600351520119200427592002801619506003701647650001901684650002301703650002001726650001001746650002701756650001601783650003101799650002101830650001301851650001501864650001901879650001401898650001401912650002601926650002801952650002601980653000902006653000902015653002802024653002402052653002602076653002902102700002002131700001802151700003302169700001802202700001902220700002002239700001902259700002402278700001802302700002402320700001902344700001902363700003102382700002102413700002102434773010802455856008402563852000902647655001202656IND60680061520221207084405.0200103e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068006152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2019.10.0142doi7 aPMC71375072pmcid7 a317339932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVivas-García, Yurena10aLineage-Restricted Regulation of SCD and Fatty Acid Saturation by MITF Controls Melanoma Phenotypic Plasticity  ap. 120-137.e9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhenotypic and metabolic heterogeneity within tumors is a major barrier to effective cancer therapy. How metabolism is implicated in specific phenotypes and whether lineage-restricted mechanisms control key metabolic vulnerabilities remain poorly understood. In melanoma, downregulation of the lineage addiction oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a hallmark of the proliferative-to-invasive phenotype switch, although how MITF promotes proliferation and suppresses invasion is poorly defined. Here, we show that MITF is a lineage-restricted activator of the key lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and that SCD is required for MITFᴴⁱᵍʰ melanoma cell proliferation. By contrast MITFᴸᵒʷ cells are insensitive to SCD inhibition. Significantly, the MITF-SCD axis suppresses metastasis, inflammatory signaling, and an ATF4-mediated feedback loop that maintains de-differentiation. Our results reveal that MITF is a lineage-specific regulator of metabolic reprogramming, whereby fatty acid composition is a driver of melanoma phenotype switching, and highlight that cell phenotype dictates the response to drugs targeting lipid metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acancer therapy 3acell proliferation 3acell structures 3adrugs 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3alipid metabolism 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atranscription factors 0aMITF 0aATF4 0astearoyl CoA desaturase 0aphenotype switching 0afatty acid saturation 0ametastatic dissemination1 aFalletta, Paola1 aLiebing, Jana1 aLouphrasitthiphol, Pakavarin1 aFeng, Yongmei1 aChauhan, Jagat1 aScott, David A.1 aGlodde, Nicole1 aChocarro-Calvo, Ana1 aBonham, Sarah1 aOsterman, Andrei L.1 aFischer, Roman1 aRonai, Ze’ev1 aGarcía-Jiménez, Custodia1 aHölzel, Michael1 aGoding, Colin R.0 tMolecular cell.g2020 Jan. 02, v. 77, no. 1 p.120-137.e9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013700160500002000297520149200317592002801809596016001837650002201997650001202019650001102031650001102042650000902053650002602062650002502088650002202113650002402135650001002159650001402169650001202183650001202195650001102207650002302218650001302241651001102254700006902265700002102334700006902355700006602424773012402490856007502614852000902689655001202698IND60789422720221119012644.0220820e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078942272DNAL7 a10.1002/mcf2.101932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourdain, Linda10aSpatiotemporal Variations in Trace Element Compositions in Pollock Populations under the Influence of Coastal Norwegian Salmon Farms  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPollock Pollachius virens (also known as Saithe) modify their feeding habits when including in their diet uneaten feed pellets from salmon aquaculture sea cages. To determine the influence of salmon farms on Pollock, multivariate and univariate analyses were conducted on the trace element signatures from muscle and liver tissues. Sample fish were caught in the vicinity of salmon farms and in control areas (>3‐km distance from the farms) on the coast of Hitra Island (western Norway) over two consecutive years (2012 and 2013). The hepatosomatic index was calculated as a proxy of fish body condition and was higher in Pollock captured near the salmon farms in both years. Variations in specific trace element profiles revealed the influence of farming on the Pollock assemblages (i.e., arsenic, manganese, and copper in muscle; vanadium and manganese in liver). Differences in element composition between sampling years were notable and may, in addition to influence from salmon feed, reflect temporal variation in Pollock migrations or natural food availability. Multivariate analyses of each sampling year showed significant differences in trace element composition of both tissue types among the Pollock groups. Therefore, trace element assessment is a potential tool for determining the influence of aquaculture on Pollock populations, although other natural sources of variation must be taken into account when considering future aquaculture and fishery management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  aEvaluation of actions to promote sustainable coexistence between salmon culture and coastal fisheries – ProCoExcNorwegian Sea‐Food Research Fund (FHF) 3aPollachius virens 3aarsenic 3acoasts 3acopper 3adiet 3aelemental composition 3afisheries management 3afood availability 3ahepatosomatic index 3aliver 3amanganese 3amuscles 3apollock 3asalmon 3atemporal variation 3avanadium 3aNorway1 aArechavala‐Lopez, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6816-85421 aUglem, Ingebrigt1 aSæther, Bjørn‐Steinar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5675-15571 aSanchez‐Jerez, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4047-238X0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2022 Feb., v. 14, no. 1 p.e10193-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2254x1942-51207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.101933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001200161245011500173300001600288500000900304520136900313592002801682650000901710650001501719650002401734650002201758650001801780650000901798650000901807650002101816650003401837650000901871650001601880650001801896650001801914700001401932700001801946700001401964773014801978856009602126852000902222655001202231IND60668059220221118175329.0191125e198407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066805922DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800040035x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGal, M.10aEffect of Exchangeable Sodium and Phosphogypsum on Crust Structure—Scanning Electron Microscope Observations  ap. 872-878.  aepub  aThe effect of soil sodicity and phosphogypsum treatment on the structure of the crust of two soils (sandy loam and clay soil) was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The crust of the sandy loam with ESP 1.0, and the two soils at all levels of sodicity when treated with phosphogypsum, consisted of a compacted skin seal attributed to the mechanical impact of raindrops. Little clay movement or development of a “washed in” layer was observed under these conditions. Conversely, when the ESP > 1.6 (in the two soils) the crust consisted of naked sand and silt grains over a dense “washed in” layer. The compacted layer of disintegrated aggregates is not stable when soil and water conditions are favorable for clay dispersion (sodic soils and low electrolyte soil solutions). In soils with no exchangeable sodium, aggregate breakdown and surface compaction by raindrops are the dominant mechanisms for crust formation. In soils with ESP values above 1.5, chemical dispersion of the soil clays (enhanced by the sodicity of the soil, the low electrolyte concentration in the rain, and the stirring effect of the raindrops) and the downward movement of the clays into the “washed in” layer clogging the pores in this layer were the dominant mechanisms in crust formation. Soils with a “washed in” layer had a very low infiltration rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay soils 3aexchangeable sodium 3ainfiltration rate 3aphosphogypsum 3arain 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilt 3asodic soils 3asoil sodicity 3asoil solution1 aArcan, L.1 aShainberg, I.1 aKeren, R.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1984 July, v. 48, no. 4 p.872-878dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800040035x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245024200207300001800449506007600467520054200543592002801085506003701113650001001150650001301160650002101173650001401194700003301208773008801241856008101329852000901410655001201419IND60120700020221207061209.0150209e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012070002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-013-1567-02doi7 aPMC38004862pmcid7 a239074382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Wen-Jian10aDesign and synthesis of a reagent for solid-phase incorporation of the phosphothreonine mimetic (2S,3R)-2-amino-3-methyl-4-phosphonobutyric acid (Pmab) into peptides in a bio-reversible phosphonyl-bis-pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) prodrug form  ap. 1143-1148.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReported herein are the synthesis and solid-phase peptide incorporation of N-Fmoc-(2S,3R)-2-amino-3-methyl-4-phosphonobutyric acid bis-pivaloyloxymethyl phosphoryl ester [Fmoc-Pmab(POM)₂-OH, 2] as a phosphatase-stable phosphothreonine (pThr) mimetic bearing orthogonal protection suitable for the synthesis of Pmab-containing peptides having bio-reversible protection of the phosphonic acid moiety.

Renal rehabilitation is a comprehensive multidisciplinary program for CKD patients that is led by doctors, rehabilitation therapists, diet nutritionists, nursing specialists, social workers, pharmacists, and therapists. Many observational studies have observed better outcomes in CKD patients with more physical activity. Furthermore, recent systematic reviews have shown the beneficial effects of exercise intervention on exercise tolerance, physical ability, and quality of life in dialysis patients, though the beneficial effect on overall mortality remains unclear. Nutritional support is also fundamental to renal rehabilitation. There are various causes of skeletal muscle loss in CKD patients. To prevent muscle protein catabolism, in addition to exercise, a sufficient supply of energy, including carbohydrates, protein, iron, and vitamins, is needed. Because of decreased digestive function and energy loss due to dialysis treatment, dialysis patients are recommended to ingest 1.2-fold more protein than the regular population. Motivating patients to join in activities is also an important part of renal rehabilitation. It is essential for us to recognize the importance of renal rehabilitation to maximize patient satisfaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adialysis 3adiet 3aenergy 3aexercise 3airon 3akidney diseases 3amortality 3amuscle protein 3anutritional support 3apatients 3aprotein metabolism 3aquality of life 3askeletal muscle0 tNutrients.g2021 Apr. 24, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130514443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245012100205300001600326520165300342592002801995650000802023650001802031650001502049650001002064650001002074650002002084650002202104650001502126650001802141650000902159650001702168650001402185650002502199650001402224650002302238651001002261653002002271653003102291653001802322653002902340700002102369773012302390856008402513852000902597655001202606IND60543479520221119225814.0190411e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054347952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2014.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEto, Koshiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8742-731910aCytonuclear discordance and historical demography of two brown frogs, Rana tagoi and R. sakuraii (Amphibia: Ranidae)  ap. 231-239.  aPrior studies of mitochondrial genomic variation reveal that the Japanese brown frog Rana tagoi comprises a complex of cryptic species lineages, and that R. sakuraii arose from within this complex. Neither species forms a monophyletic group on the mitochondrial haplotype tree, precluding a simple explanation for the evolutionary origins of R. sakuraii. We present a more complete sampling of mitochondrial haplotypic variation (from the ND1 and 16S genes) plus DNA sequence variation for five nuclear loci (from the genes encoding NCX1, NFIA, POMC, SLC8A3, and TYR) to resolve the evolutionary histories of these species. We test hypotheses of population assignment (STRUCTURE) and isolation-with-migration (IM) using the more slowly evolving nuclear markers. These demographic analyses of nuclear genetic variation confirm species-level distinctness and integrity of R. sakuraii despite its apparent polyphyly on the mitochondrial haplotype tree. Divergence-time estimates from both the mitochondrial haplotypes and nuclear genomic markers suggest that R. sakuraii originated approximately one million years ago, and that incomplete sorting of mitochondrial haplotype lineages best explains non-monophyly of R. sakuraii mitochondrial haplotypes. Cytonuclear discordance elsewhere in R. tagoi reveals a case of mitochondrial introgression between two species lineages on Honshu. The earliest phylogenetic divergence within this species group occurred approximately four million years ago, followed by cladogenetic events in the Pliocene and early Pleistocene yielding 10–13 extant species lineages, including R. sakuraii as one of the youngest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRana japonica 3ademography 3afrogs 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amitochondria 3amonophyly 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyphyly 3asequence diversity 3aJapan 0aSpecies complex 0aIncomplete lineage sorting 0aIntrogression 0aIsolation with migration1 aMatsui, Masafumi0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2014 Oct., v. 79 p.231-239dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2014.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011200172300001700284520104800301592002801349650001501377650001801392650001401410650001001424650001101434650001701445653001601462653001001478653001101488653000901499653002501508653002401533653001301557653001901570700001701589700001501606700002401621700002401645700001901669700002101688700001601709700001901725700001901744773010601763856008401869852000901953655001201962IND60680061720221116153902.0200103e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068006172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2019.10.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGozalo, Alejandro10aCore Components of the Nuclear Pore Bind Distinct States of Chromatin and Contribute to Polycomb Repression  ap. 67-81.e7.  aInteractions between the genome and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) have been implicated in multiple gene regulatory processes, but the underlying logic of these interactions remains poorly defined. Here, we report high-resolution chromatin binding maps of two core components of the NPC, Nup107 and Nup93, in Drosophila cells. Our investigation uncovered differential binding of these NPC subunits, where Nup107 preferentially targets active genes while Nup93 associates primarily with Polycomb-silenced regions. Comparison to Lamin-associated domains (LADs) revealed that NPC binding sites can be found within LADs, demonstrating a linear binding of the genome along the nuclear envelope. Importantly, we identified a functional role of Nup93 in silencing of Polycomb target genes and in spatial folding of Polycomb domains. Our findings lend to a model where different nuclear pores bind different types of chromatin via interactions with specific NPC sub-complexes, and a subset of Polycomb domains is stabilized by interactions with Nup93.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3abinding sites 3achromatin 3agenes 3amodels 3anuclear pore 0anucleoporin 0aNup93 0aNup107 0aElys 0anuclear organization 0agenome architecture 0aPolycomb 0agene silencing1 aDuke, Ashley1 aLan, Yemin1 aPascual-Garcia, Pau1 aTalamas, Jessica A.1 aNguyen, Son C.1 aShah, Parisha P.1 aJain, Rajan1 aJoyce, Eric F.1 aCapelson, Maya0 tMolecular cell.g2020 Jan. 02, v. 77, no. 1 p.67-81.e7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01644naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007800172300001600250500001900266520068000285592002800965650001600993650001201009650002101021650001901042650001401061650000901075651001401084700002401098773010201122856008501224852000901309655001201318IND60695608920221118063806.0200517e19981101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069560892DNAL7 a10.2216/i0031-8884-37-6-450.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppenrath, Mona10aRoscoffia capitata (Dinophyceae) refound: notes on morphology and biology  ap. 450-457.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRoscoffia capitata Balech 1956, known only from its original description, was found recently at sand flats in the eastern North Sea.

Estimates of the standard deviation from the mean of physical and chemical properties were derived. There were no significant differences among laboratories in the determination of Ca, Na, base saturation, available P, and CaCO₃ equivalent but there were significant differences in determination of Mg, K, H, cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, and pH in water and in CaCl₂. These differences suggest that uniformity in procedures among laboratories must be emphasized.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase saturation 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium chloride 3acation exchange capacity 3amagnesium 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil surveys 3astandard deviation1 aFenton, T.

Although hundreds of proteins are predicted to be exported through Plasmodium export element (PEXEL)-dependent and -independent mechanisms, the functions of exported proteins are largely uncharacterized. In this study, we used a biochemical screening approach to identify putative exported P. falciparum proteins that bound to inside-out vesicles prepared from erythrocytes. Out of 69 P. falciparum PEXEL-motif proteins tested, 18 bound to inside-out vesicles (IOVs) in two or more independent assays. Using co-affinity purifications followed by mass spectrometry, pairwise co-purification experiments, and the split-luciferase assay, we identified 31 putative protein–protein interactions between erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins and predicted exported P. falciparum proteins. We further showed that PF3D7_1401600 binds to the spectrin-binding domain of erythrocyte ankyrin via its MESA erythrocyte cytoskeleton binding (MEC) motif and to the N-terminal domains of ankyrin and 4.1R through a fragment that required an intact Plasmodium helical interspersed sub-telomeric (PHIST) domain. Introduction of PF3D7_1401600 into erythrocyte ghosts increased retention in the microsphiltration assay, consistent with previous data that reported a reduction of rigidity in red blood cells infected with PF3D7_1401600-deficient parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3acytoskeleton 3aerythrocyte membrane 3aerythrocytes 3aexports 3amass spectrometry 3aparasites1 aKilili, Geoffrey Kimiti1 aWang, Ling 1 aNakayasu, Ernesto S.1 aLaCount, Douglas J.0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 16, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100714383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010900162300001600271500001500287520113300302592002801435650004301463650002601506650002001532650001501552650001001567650001801577650001901595650001401614650002101628653001301649700001501662700001501677700001201692700001601704700001701720700001601737773009801753856008101851852000901932655001201941IND60129956320221122102237.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012995632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-015-0498-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, X.

Although DREB TFs have been well identified and characterized in a few model plants, there is no detailed information available for mulberry. In this study, 110 AP2/ERF family genes were identified based on a genome-wide analysis of the Morus genome database. Among them, 30 Morus notabilis DREB family genes (MnDREBs) were identified. A comparative analysis with DREB gene families from other plants suggests that MnDREBs could be divided into six subgroups (A-1 to A-6) and could have similar functions in response to abiotic stresses since they have similar conserved domains/motifs within each subgroup. The expression patterns of MnDREBs were analyzed using transcriptome data of different organs from M. notabilis and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of most MnDREBs was detected in different organs and induced by various abiotic stresses, which suggest their vital roles in abiotic stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factors 3astress response 3amulberries 3agenes 3atranscriptome 3aabiotic stress 3adatabases 3astress tolerance 0aproteins1 aZhu, J.

We use a simulation model in which production and consumption‐leisure choices are represented along with the rule governing intra‐household resource allocation, to analyze the income and wage responses of each family member. The household is treated as an equilibrium model whose accounts are based on a collective household accounting matrix, with the social dimension being the wife/husband classes. The simulation analysis illustrates the policy relevance of the collective approach to household behavior for inferring the impact of economic policies on individual behavior and welfare. We also propose insightful comparisons with the unitary model to make the behavioral and welfare policy relevance of the collective approach evident.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aincome 3aresource allocation 3asimulation models1 aMenon, Martina1 aPerali, Federico0 tApplied economic perspectives and policy.g2017 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.111-153dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl4430135x2040-57907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aepp/ppw0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245017300164500001900337520268800356592002803044650002403072650001903096650001903115650001703134650001703151650001103168650002403179650002603203650002603229650001603255700001903271700002103290700001903311700002303330700001903353700002803372773012103400856007403521852000903595655001203604IND60738870120221121054548.0210524e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073887012DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130517332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Ellen  S.10aSelf-Reported Nutritional Factors Are Associated with Weight Loss at 18 Months in a Self-Managed Commercial Program with Food Categorization System: Observational Study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLittle is known about nutritional factors during weight loss on digital commercial weight loss programs. We examined how nutritional factors relate to weight loss for individuals after 4 and 18 months on a mobile commercial program with a food categorization system based on energy density (Noom). This is a two-part (retrospective and cross-sectional) cohort study. Two time points were used for analysis: 4 months and 18 months. For 4-month analyses, current Noom users who met inclusion criteria (n = 9880) were split into 5% or more body weight loss and stable weight loss (0 ± 1%) groups. Individuals who fell into one of these groups were analyzed at 4 months (n = 3261). For 18-month analyses, individuals from 4-month analyses who were still on Noom 18 months later were invited to take a one-time survey (n = 803). At 18 months 148 participants were analyzed. Noom has a system categorizing foods as low-, medium-, and high-energy-dense. Measures were self-reported proportions of low-, medium-, and high-energy-dense foods, and self-reported nutritional factors (fruit and vegetable intake, dietary quality, nutrition knowledge, and food choice). Nutritional factors were derived from validated survey measures, and food choice from a novel validated computerized task in which participants chose a food they would want to eat right now. ANOVAs compared participants with 5% or more body weight loss and participants with stable weight (0 ± 1%) at 4 months on energy density proportions. Analyses at 18 months compared nutritional factors across participants with >10% (high weight loss), 5–10% (moderate weight loss), and less than 5% body weight loss (low weight loss), and then assessed associations between nutritional factors and weight loss. Individuals with greater weight loss reported consuming higher proportions of low-energy-dense foods and lower proportions of high-energy-dense foods than individuals with less weight loss at 4 months and 18 months (all ps < 0.02). Individuals with greater weight loss had higher fruit and vegetable intake (p = 0.03), dietary quality (p = 0.02), nutrition knowledge (p < 0.001), and healthier food choice (p = 0.003) at 18 months. Only nutrition knowledge and food choice were associated with weight loss at 18 months (B = −19.44, 95% CI: −33.19 to −5.69, p = 0.006; B = −5.49, 95% CI: −8.87 to −2.11, p = 0.002, respectively). Our results highlight the potential influence of nutrition knowledge and food choice in weight loss on a self-managed commercial program. We also found for the first time that in-the-moment inclination towards food even when just depicted is associated with long-term weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3acohort studies 3aenergy density 3afood choices 3afood quality 3afruits 3anutrition knowledge 3aobservational studies 3avegetable consumption 3aweight loss1 aYang, Qiuchen 1 aHo, Annabell  S.1 aBehr, Heather 1 aMay, Christine  N.1 aDeLuca, Laura 1 aMichaēlidēs, Andreas,0 tNutrients.g2021 May 20, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130517333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151024002200170024001900192040001800211100002600229245009700255300001500352506007600367520112000443592002801563506003701591650001801628650001701646650002501663650002601688650002201714650001101736650001401747650001401761650001401775650001801789650001801807650001301825700002301838700002001861773007901881856008101960852000902041655001202050IND60129952820221207063812.0151024e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012995282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10393-014-0988-x2doi7 aPMC70881612pmcid7 a253618532pmid7 aPMC70881612pmcid7 a253618532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBisson, Isabelle-Anne10aEarly Detection of Emerging Zoonotic Diseases with Animal Morbidity and Mortality Monitoring  ap. 98-103.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiseases transmitted between animals and people have made up more than 50% of emerging infectious diseases in humans over the last 60 years and have continued to arise in recent months. Yet, public health and animal disease surveillance programs continue to operate independently. Here, we assessed whether recent emerging zoonotic pathogens (n = 143) are known to cause morbidity or mortality in their animal host and if so, whether they were first detected with an animal morbidity/mortality event. We show that although sick or dead animals are often associated with these pathogens (52%), only 9% were first detected from an animal morbidity or mortality event prior to or concurrent with signs of illness in humans. We propose that an animal morbidity and mortality reporting program will improve detection and should be an essential component of early warning systems for zoonotic diseases. With the use of widespread low-cost technology, such a program could engage both the public and professionals and be easily tested and further incorporated as part of surveillance efforts by public health officials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal health 3adead animals 3adisease surveillance 3aearly warning systems 3aemerging diseases 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens 3aprofessionals 3apublic health 3azoonoses1 aSsebide, Benard J.1 aMarra, Peter P.0 tEcoHealth.g2015 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.98-103dSpringer USx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-014-0988-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011400173300001600287520178600303592002802089650001402117650001802131650001402149650001402163650001102177650001902188650001302207650001302220650002002233650001802253650001402271651001802285653000902303653000702312653000702319653002802326653001302354653002502367653002302392653003502415653001702450700001902467700002402486773012402510856008402634852000902718655001202727IND60543476520221119225822.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054347652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2014.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshitani, Yoshiyuki10aUncovering sibling species in Radiolaria: Evidence for ecological partitioning in a marine planktonic protist  ap. 215-222.  aPhylogeography of unicellular plankton, as representative pelagic organisms, is fundamental to understanding their evolution in the ocean. Historically, these microplankton were believed to have cosmopolitan distributions achieved through passive transport and little potential for speciation because of a lack of geographic barriers in the oceans. Recent phylogeographic studies of these microplankton, however, have often revealed high diversity and fine-scale geographic distributions. These apparent contradictions may result from poor knowledge of the spatial distributions of pelagic microplankton in the water column. More information about both geographic and vertical distributions of pelagic populations could reveal the dispersal pathways, gene flow, and resulting diversifications in the open ocean. Here we demonstrate that two genetic types of the radiolarian morphospecies Spongotrochus glacialis with morphological differences are vertically segregated into the upper and lower surface waters within the pycnocline of the North Pacific Subtropical Water. This vertically separated distribution of two sister species is associated with distinct ecological partitioning. These two species could survive on different food resources from their respective environments: one in oligotrophic surface waters by using nutrients from symbionts, and the other at greater depths by depending on both heterotrophic and symbiotic nutrition. Moreover, molecular divergence-time estimates suggest that the two species diverged during the period of oligotrophic surface-water development in the Pacific Ocean. Our findings suggest that genetic isolation in the vertical dimension occurs through ecological partitioning even in the absence of physical barriers in the pelagic oceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene flow 3amorphospecies 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aoceans 3aphylogeography 3aplankton 3aprotists 3asibling species 3asurface water 3asymbionts 3aPacific Ocean 0aNPSG 0aSL 0aMR 0aSpongotrochus glacialis 0aITS-rDNA 0aVertical segregation 0aOligotrophic water 0aNorth Pacific Subtropical Gyre 0aSymbiotrophs1 aUjiié, Yurika1 aTakishita, Kiyotaka0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2014 Sept., v. 78 p.215-222dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2014.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245018000164300001800344520096700362592002801329650001501357650001901372650002101391650002001412650002301432650001001455700002001465773012101485856008201606852000901688655001201697IND60562170020170926000000.0170201e20160714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056217002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b050802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bingru10aPattern Formation in a Nematic Liquid Crystal Mixture with Negative Anisotropy of the Electric ConductivityA Long-Known System with “Inverse” Light Scattering Revisited  ap. 6865-6871.  aPattern formation in binary calamitic liquid crystal mixtures with positive dielectric anisotropy and negative conductivity anisotropy, which attracted attention owing to field-induced light scattering under unusual conditions many years ago, is reinvestigated in the conductive regime. Homeotropic cells with these mixtures exhibit a direct transition to isotropic electroconvection, while planar cells show a Fréedericksz transition to the quasi-homeotropic state and subsequent electroconvection at higher voltages. A temperature-induced change from normal and oblique convection rolls to longitudinal rolls reveals a transition from standard electroconvection to nonstandard electroconvection, which can be attributed to a sign inversion of the conductivity anisotropy. In summary, this system shows an unusually large variety of patterns and effects, which were observed and theoretically considered more recently in other systems of quite different types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aelectric power 3alight scattering 3aliquid crystals 3aphysical chemistry 3arolls1 aKitzerow, Heinz0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 July 14, v. 120, no. 27 p.6865-6871dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b050803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007900160300001600239500002000255520182700275592002802102596011302130650002002243650002502263650002402288650001102312650001202323650000902335650002402344650001302368651001902381651001602400700005102416700007002467773012402537856007502661852000902736655001202745IND60789419920221117184737.0220820e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078941992DNAL7 a10.1002/mcf2.101602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeontiou, A.

In this study, we used Bayesian models to determine habitat selection by different sizes and ages of female Red Snapper and to identify whether there was a difference in habitat selection between immature and mature fish. Red Snapper (n = 693) were sampled using vertical longlines from March or April through November of 2016–2018 off the coast of Mississippi at different artificial structure types (platforms, artificial reefs, and rigs‐to‐reef structures [hereafter, “rigs‐to‐reefs”]) and depths (shallow, <20 m; mid‐depth, 20–49 m; and deep, 50–100 m). To adjust for the traditional occurrence of mature fish being larger and older than immature fish, only fish within the intersection of the FL (n = 616) and age (n = 622) ranges of immature and mature classes were used in these analyses. Fork length and age of immature and mature fish increased with increasing depth, but immature fish had a larger increase in FL per unit depth than mature fish. Immature fish on artificial reefs were found to be older than immature fish at platforms, while there was no age difference between the two structures for mature fish. There was no difference in FL or age between rigs‐to‐reefs and platforms or artificial reefs for immature fish, but FL and age of mature fish were greater at rigs‐to‐reefs than at platforms and artificial reefs. However, maturity did not play a role in how age increased with depth or with differences in FL between artificial reefs and platforms for mature fish. These differences in habitat use based on maturity should be considered along with FL and age to inform management regulations for Red Snapper.  aPublisher supplied data  aS‐15‐USM‐NFWF‐MDEQ‐15‐002cNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund 3aBayesian theory 3aLutjanus campechanus 3aartificial habitats 3acoasts 3afemales 3afish 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMississippi1 aWu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7945-98471 aBrown‐Peterson, Nancy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8428-49840 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2021 July, v. 13, no. 4 p.332-344dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2254x1942-51207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.101603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009000159300001800249520131200267592002801579650002101607650001901628650002101647650003201668650001601700650002701716650000901743650001601752650001301768650001101781650002301792650001501815650002901830650001601859651002001875700002301895773013801918856007302056852000902129655001202138IND60651402520221120150405.0190711e20130719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065140252DNAL7 a10.3390/su50731162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLundgren, Karin10aSustainability Challenges from Climate Change and Air Conditioning Use in Urban Areas  ap. 3116-3128.  aGlobal climate change increases heat loads in urban areas causing health and productivity risks for millions of people. Inhabitants in tropical and subtropical urban areas are at especial risk due to high population density, already high temperatures, and temperature increases due to climate change. Air conditioning is growing rapidly, especially in South and South-East Asia due to income growth and the need to protect from high heat exposures. Studies have linked increased total hourly electricity use to outdoor temperatures and humidity; modeled future predictions when facing additional heat due to climate change, related air conditioning with increased street level heat and estimated future air conditioning use in major urban areas. However, global and localized studies linking climate variables with air conditioning alone are lacking. More research and detailed data is needed looking at the effects of increasing air conditioning use, electricity consumption, climate change and interactions with the urban heat island effect. Climate change mitigation, for example using renewable energy sources, particularly photovoltaic electricity generation, to power air conditioning, and other sustainable methods to reduce heat exposure are needed to make future urban areas more climate resilient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aheat 3aheat island 3ahumidity 3aincome 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3aSouth East Asia1 aKjellström, Tord,0 tSustainability.g2013 July 19, v. 5, no. 7 p.3116-3128dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su50731163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245010000214300001400314506007600328520119400404592002801598506003701626650004701663650001801710650001901728650002401747650001001771650000901781650001501790650002301805650001801828700001601846700002601862700001601888773007801904856008101982852000902063655001202072IND60129953020221207072219.0151024e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012995302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10393-014-0990-32doi7 aPMC44161152pmcid7 a253806522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorthcross, Amanda L.10aAssessing Exposures to Household Air Pollution in Public Health Research and Program Evaluation  ap. 57-67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExposure to smoke from the use of solid fuels and inefficient stoves for cooking and heating is responsible for approximately 4 million premature deaths yearly. As increasing investments are made to tackle this important public health issue, there is a need for identifying and providing guidance on best practices for exposure and stove performance monitoring, particularly for public health research and evaluation studies. This paper, which builds upon the discussion at an expert consultation on exposure assessment convened by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and PATH in late 2012, aims to provide general guidance on what to monitor, who and where to monitor, and how to monitor household air pollution exposures. In addition, we summarize information about commercially available monitoring equipment and the technical properties of these monitors most important for household air pollution exposure assessment. The target audience includes epidemiologists conducting health studies and program evaluators aiming to quantify changes in exposures to estimate the potential health benefits of cookstoves intervention projects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aair pollution 3acooking stoves 3aexposure assessment 3afuels 3aheat 3amonitoring 3aprogram evaluation 3apublic health1 aHwang, Nina1 aBalakrishnan, Kalpana1 aMehta, Sumi0 tEcoHealth.g2015 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.57-67dSpringer USx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-014-0990-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007800161300001800239520174400257592002802001650001202029650001102041650001502052650001102067650001602078651001002094700002402104773009502128856008102223852000902304655001202313IND60120697020221120073231.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012069702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-013-1869-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavan, V.10aCalibrated multi-model ensemble summer temperature predictions over Italy  ap. 2115-2132.  aA statistical calibration scheme is applied to multi-model global seasonal ensemble reforecasts in order to predict the interannual variability of summer averaged surface maximum temperature over Italy. In some cases, this technique is shown to be able to improve the skill scores of the seasonal predictions during the last 35 years, with respect to the direct model output (DMO), using seasonal predictions initialised 1 month before the beginning of the season. It is shown that the presence of some skill in the DMO multi-model predictions is mostly due to the correct prediction of the observed secular trends in maximum temperature, and, partly, to the correct prediction of outliers, in particular, of the summer of 2003. At the same time, while the removal of trends produces a small reduction of skill in both the raw and calibrated predictions, the removal of outliers improves the performance of the calibration scheme. Once all trends and outliers are removed, the DMO predictions have no skill, while the calibrated predictions still present a detectable skill. The improvement introduced by the calibration are shown to be statistically significant by applying resampling techniques. It is shown that the reason of this partial success is linked to the fact that although the models present several shortcomings, some models can capture the existence of a weak large-scale signal, possibly linked with the presence of a summer teleconnection between the equatorial Pacific and Europe, with a spatial pattern substantially different from that associated with the temperature secular trend. The teleconnection is associated with a modulation of the quasi-stationary barotropic eddies in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3amodels 3aprediction 3asummer 3atemperature 3aItaly1 aDoblas-Reyes, F.

These procedures do not reverse the state of fetal hypoxia but can help to improve fetal oxygenation during the process of preparing for delivery.Until more data are available, it seems reasonable to err on the side of fetal safety by using these techniques when appropriate, based on the specific fetal heart rate pattern or any other intrapartum fetal surveillance test.  aPublisher supplied data 0aResucitación fetal 0aPatrón de FCF 0aHiperoxigenación 0aTocolisis intraparto 0aAmnioinfusión intraparto 0aFetal resuscitation 0aFetal heart rate pattern 0aOxygen inhalation therapy 0aTocolytic therapy 0aIntrapartum amnioinfusion1 aSánchez-Gila, M.M.1 aPineda, A.1 aMoh-García, D.1 aDurán, M.D.1 aMoreno, E.0 tClinica e Investigacion en Ginecologia y Obstetricia.g2013 Jan.,  Mar., v. 40 p.20-25dElsevier Espanax0210-573X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gine.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014200171300001800313520152600331592002801857650003001885650001601915650002301931650001701954650002101971650001701992650003502009650002402044650001002068650001502078650002102093650001202114650001402126650002502140700001702165700001802182700001802200700002302218700002002241773012802261856008102389852000902470655001202479IND60537359720221121223210.0160909e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053735972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7430-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZedler, Julie A.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a potentially important host species due to the range of genetic tools that have been developed for this unicellular green alga. Transformation of the chloroplast genome offers important advantages over nuclear transformation, and a wide range of recombinant proteins have now been expressed in the chloroplasts of C. reinhardtii strains. This is often done in cell wall-deficient mutants that are easier to transform. However, only a single study has reported growth data for C. reinhardtii grown at pilot scale, and the growth of cell wall-deficient strains has not been reported at all. Here, we report the first pilot-scale growth study for transgenic, cell wall-deficient C. reinhardtii strains. Strains expressing a cytochrome P450 (CYP79A1) or bifunctional diterpene synthase (cis-abienol synthase, TPS4) were grown for 7 days under mixotrophic conditions in a Tris-acetate-phosphate medium. The strains reached dry cell weights of 0.3 g/L within 3–4 days with stable expression levels of the recombinant proteins during the whole upscaling process. The strains proved to be generally robust, despite the cell wall-deficient phenotype, but grew poorly under phototrophic conditions. The data indicate that cell wall-deficient strains may be highly amenable for transformation and suitable for commercial-scale operations under mixotrophic growth regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3acell growth 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3acytochrome P-450 3aditerpenoids 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahigh-value products 3ahosts 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial growth 3amutants 3aphenotype 3arecombinant proteins1 aGangl, Doris1 aGuerra, Tiago1 aSantos, Edgar1 aVerdelho, Vitor V.1 aRobinson, Colin0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 100, no. 16 p.7061-7070dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7430-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003600152245007300188520141000261592002801671650002201699650001901721650002301740650001401763650001501777650001401792650000901806650002401815650002201839651001301861651001101874651001301885651001801898700004901916700004501965700003802010773012802048856008702176852000902263655001202272IND60784124020221119022543.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078412402DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100714112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Reis, Danielle Saraiva Tuma10aCryptococcosis: Identification of Risk Areas in the Brazilian Amazon  aThe Brazilian Amazon has a specific epidemiological profile for cryptococcosis, considering its social and economic inequality, health reality, and low access to health services. Furthermore, Brazil and Colombia have the highest cryptococcosis incidence rates in Latin America. In this study, we identified the areas of risk for cryptococcosis in the state of Pará in the Brazilian Amazon. This was an ecological study of patients admitted to a referral hospital from 2008 to 2018, aged 13 years or older, and of both sexes. The spatial distribution was determined using ArcGis 10.3.1 software. Cryptococcosis was confirmed in 272 cases. The incidence rate was 3.41 cases/100,000 inhabitants. Spatial distribution was concentrated in the Metropolitana de Belém, Nordeste Paraense, and Marajó mesoregions. The sociodemographic profile consisted of 62% men, aged between 24 and 34 years (36%), without completed secondary education (64.7%), and with occupations varying between agricultural activities (13.8%) and household activities (22%). The mean hospitalization time was 39 days; the prevalent clinical form was neurological (89.7%). The mortality rate among patients with cryptococcosis was up to 40%. Knowledge of the real magnitude of the disease in the Brazilian Amazon makes it possible to identify areas with the greatest risks and to propose control and epidemiological surveillance programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acryptococcosis 3aecological studies 3ahospitals 3amonitoring 3amortality 3arisk 3asecondary education 3asocial inequality 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 3aColombia 3aLatin America1 ade Brito, Mioni Thieli Figueiredo Magalhães1 aGuimarães, Ricardo José de Paula Souza1 aQuaresma, Juarez Antônio Simões0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 13, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100714113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01778naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245011000135300001600245500001400261520074200275592002801017650002001045650001901065650001401084650002201098650001601120650001201136650001501148650001501163653001301178653001601191653000801207653002901215700001701244773014601261852000901407655001201416IND60716830320221121134716.0201107e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071683032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhakad, Anuj Kumar10aEffect of phosphorus liquid bio-fertilizer on productivity and economics of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)  ap. 191-193.  aNAL-light  aA field study was carried out during rabi season of 2017–18 at Mahatma Gandhi Chitrakoot Gramodaya Vishwavidyalaya, Chitrakoot, Satna (M.P.) to evaluate the effect of phosphorus liquid bio-fertilizer on yield attributes, yield and economics of chickpea.

Adult beetles feed on milkweed flowers and foliage while larval beetles feed on the rhizomes of milkweed. Strong negative effects of beetle herbivory on milkweed growth, but not sexual reproduction, were found in experiments comparing growth for milkweed patches from which adult beetles were removed to controls with an unmanipulated abundance of beetles. Experiments using potted milkweed revealed a strong negative effect of beetle larvae on the growth of milkweed roots and rhizomes. Under natural field conditions, I could detect no effect of adult beetle density on the growth or sexual reproduction of milkweed. Overall, it appears that below ground herbivory by beetle larvae negatively impacts milkweed growth, but detection of these effects under natural conditions are confounded with a number of factors. 3aCerambycidae 3afeeding behavior 3afood plants 3aAsclepias syriaca 3asexual reproduction 3arhizomes 3aadults 3alarvae 3apopulation density 3amortality 3aVirginia 0agrowth 0asubterranean herbivory0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2001 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.333-338dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-30.2.3333Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle04464naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137110013800155245017500293300001400468520140400482592002801886650003001914650001501944650001301959650002301972650000901995651001602004700001802020700001702038700003102055700001702086700002702103700004002130700002302170700001902193700001902212700002802231700002902259700002602288700001502314700002002329700001802349700001902367700002902386700002002415700003302435700002202468700003302490700001702523700001902540700001602559700001702575700002202592700001902614700002902633700003102662700001702693700002102710700001702731700001802748700002002766700001802786700002202804700001802826700002202844700002002866700001402886700001902900700001902919700002002938700002402958700001702982700001902999700002703018700001903045700001403064700001803078700001603096700002503112700001803137700001603155700002403171700001803195700002403213700002703237700001503264773008803279856009003367852000903457655001203466IND60680058820221116154347.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068005882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2019.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL2 aWHO implementation workshop on guidelines on procedures and data requirements for changes to approved biotherapeutic productseauthor10aWHO implementation workshop on guidelines on procedures and data requirements for changes to approved biotherapeutic products, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 25–26 June 2019  ap. 50-59.  aThe first global workshop on implementation of the WHO guidelines on procedures and data requirements for changes to approved biotherapeutic products adopted by the WHO Expert Committee in 2018 was held in June 2019. The workshop participants recognized that the principles based on sound science and the potential for risk, as described in the WHO Guidelines on post-approval changes, which constitute the global standard for product life-cycle management are providing clarity and helping national regulatory authorities in establishing guidance while improving time-lines for an efficient regulation of products. Consequently, the regulatory situation for post-approval changes and guideline implementation is changing but there is a disparity between different countries. While the guidelines are gradually being implemented in some countries and also being considered in other countries, the need for regional workshops and further training on post-approval changes was a common theme reiterated by many participants. Given the complexities relating to post-approval changes in different regions/countries, there was a clear understanding among all participants that an efficient approach for product life-cycle management at a national level is needed to ensure faster availability of high standard, safe and efficacious medicines to patients as per the World Health Assembly Resolution 67.21.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aguidelines 3apatients 3aproduct life cycle 3arisk 3aSouth Korea1 aWadhwa, Meenu1 aKang, Hye-Na1 aJivapaisarnpong, Teeranart1 aAhmed, Aziza1 aAndalucia, Lucia Rizka1 aBlades, Carolina Damas Rocha Zarate1 aCasas Levano, Mary1 aChang, Weihong1 aChew, Jing Yin1 aChilufya, Mumbi Bernice1 aChirachanakul, Parichard1 aCho, Heeyoun (Gloria)1 aCho, Yi O.1 aChoi, Kyung Min1 aChong, Sannie1 aChua, Hui Ming1 aFarahani, Ali Vasheghani1 aGencoglu, Mumun1 aGhobrial, Mariam Raouf Wefky1 aGuha, Prasunkumar1 aGutierrez Lugo, Maria-Teresa1 aHa, Sung Bae1 aHabahbeh, Suna1 aHamel, Hugo1 aHong, Yeosun1 aIarutkin, Aleksei1 aJang, Hyunsook1 aJayachandran, Ramalingam1 aJivapaisarnpong, Teeranart1 aKang, Hye-Na1 aKim, Dong Young,1 aKim, Gi Hyun1 aKim, Yunjeong1 aKwon, Hyuk-Sang1 aLarsen, Jacob1 aLee, Aileen HyoJu1 aLee, JiYoung,1 aMedvedeva, Ksenia1 aMunkombwe, Zuma1 aOh, IlUng1 aPark, Jooyoung1 aPark, Jooyoung1 aPutri, Desi Eka1 aRodgers, Jacqueline1 aRyu, Sungmun1 aSavkina, Maria1 aSchreitmueller, Thomas1 aSemeniuk, Oleh1 aSeo, Mira1 aShin, Yung In1 aShin, Jinho1 aSrivastava, Shraddha1 aSong, HyeonHo1 aSong, Suwon1 aTavares Neto, João1 aWadhwa, Meenu1 aYamaguchi, Teruhide1 aYoun, Hyun-Jun (David)1 aYun, Minae0 tBiologicals.g2020 May, v. 65 p.50-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2019.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008200168300001600250520093200266592002801198653002001226653004201246653001401288653003201302653001401334653002501348653004901373653001401422653003301436653003601469773012701505856008201632852000901714655001201723IND60552165220221119111900.0161020e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055216522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gine.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez-Olmos, J.10aLesiones vaginales por pesario.

The impacts of live‐release tournaments on freshwater species have been widely studied. However, research on estuarine sport fishes is lacking even though catch‐and‐release tournaments targeting these species are prevalent and popular recreational fisheries exist. Therefore, we estimated the post‐weigh‐in mortality and dispersal of Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus and Spotted Seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus released from the 2016–2018 Alabama Deep Sea Fishing Rodeo live‐weigh‐in categories using acoustic telemetry. To concurrently estimate overall post‐weigh‐in mortality and dispersal, we used a Bayesian multistate model. Overall Red Drum post‐weigh‐in mortality (median = 6.12%; posterior credible interval [CrI] = 5.67–9.24%) was lower than overall Spotted Seatrout mortality (median = 30.63%; CrI = 26.74–40.00%). These estimates were within reported catch‐and‐release mortality ranges; however, they were higher than recent estimates for Spotted Seatrout. Within 1 week postrelease, Spotted Seatrout dispersal estimates (median = 87.03%; CrI = 72.96–95.72%) were higher than Red Drum (median = 55.62%; CrI = 42.75–68.10%) or Micropterus spp. in coastal and inland ecosystems. Long‐term stockpiling at the release site was also not present; at the end of our 8‐week observation period, median dispersal estimates were 94.41% (CrI = 87.15–98.19%) and 98.54% (CrI = 93.68–99.82%) for Red Drum and Spotted Seatrout, respectively. Red Drum fisheries may benefit most from live‐release tournaments given that maximum mortality was <10%, but Spotted Seatrout fisheries may also benefit, especially if considerations are made to further reduce tournament mortality. Although we do not know the ratio of tournament mortality to recreational harvest for these species, live‐release tournaments may be able to relieve some harvest pressure on heavily exploited inshore marine fisheries and research validating their usefulness should continue.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation  cAlabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources 3aBayesian theory 3aCynoscion nebulosus 3aMicropterus 3aSciaenops ocellatus 3aacoustics 3aestuaries 3afish 3afreshwater 3amodels 3amortality 3asports 3atelemetry 3aAlabama1 aHightower, Crystal L.1 aPowers, Sean P.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2021 July, v. 13, no. 4 p.320-331dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2254x1942-51207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.101593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245014300164300001600307520237200323592002802695650001402723650002102737650001802758650001002776650001202786700001702798700002002815700001802835700001702853700001902870700001402889700001702903700001602920773009302936856008403029852000903113655001203122IND4450118220221120205636.0141112e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445011822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2010.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagowan, E.10aEffect of dietary regime and group structure on pig performance and the variation in weight and growth rate from weaning to 20weeks of age  ap. 216-224.  aThis study aimed to improve lifetime pig performance and reduce variation in growth rate between pigs using managerial and nutritional practices. The experiment (2×2×2 factorial) compared uniform and mixed weight grouping (SD of weight in group at weaning 0.7kg and 1.6kg respectively), offering pigs a high (12kg) or low (6kg) allowance of starter diets post weaning and either a special (DE 14.5MJ/kg, total lysine 11g/kg) or normal (DE 13.5MJ/kg, total lysine 9.5g/kg) finishing diet. Over six time replicates, 960 pigs (Landrace×Large White) were randomly allocated at weaning (28±2days of age) into groups of 20 according to weight and sex and these groups were split at 10weeks of age (transfer to finishing accommodation) into two groups of 10. Finishing diet was offered from 11weeks of age. The FCR of pigs (wean–7weeks of age) was significantly (P<0.001) improved when a high allowance of starter diets was offered (1.25) compared with a low allowance (1.34). However, between 7 and 10weeks of age a high allowance of starter diets only improved the FCR of pigs in uniform groups. A special finishing diet improved (P<0.05) the ADG of pigs during finish (11–20weeks of age) (860g/day) compared with a normal finishing diet (827g/day). The coefficient of variation (CV) of weight at 10 and 15weeks of age was significantly lower (both P<0.001) for pigs in uniform weight groups compared with that of pigs in mixed weight groups. A three-way interaction was observed on the CV of ADG (weaning–20weeks of age) (P<0.05) and FCR (11–20weeks of age) (P<0.01). The lowest CV of ADG (weaning—20weeks of age) and lowest FCR (11–20weeks of age) were achieved when uniform grouped pigs were offered a high allowance of starter diets post weaning and a special finishing diet (0.117 and 2.43 respectively) whereas the highest values were observed when mixed weight groups of pigs were offered a low allowance of starter diets post weaning and a normal finishing diet (0.162 and 2.70 respectively). In conclusion, although uniform grouping appears to aid the reduction in slaughter weight variation and improve FCR, its effect is dependent on dietary regime. Overall, from weaning to 20weeks of age, uniformly grouped pigs offered a high allowance of starter diets post weaning and a special finishing diet had a low CV of ADG and the most efficient FCR.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinishing 3aslaughter weight 3astarter diets 3aswine 3aweaning1 aBall, M.E.E.1 aMcCracken, K.J.1 aBeattie, V.E.1 aBradford, R.1 aRobinson, M.J.1 aScott, M.1 aGordon, F.J.1 aMayne, C.S.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Apr., v. 136, no. 2-3 p.216-224dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2010.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245011900183520193700302592002802239650002802267650001502295650001302310650001102323650002202334650002002356650002002376650002002396650002102416650001002437650001302447650001802460700002502478700001802503700002502521700002002546700003002566773012802596856008702724852000902811655001202820IND60784124220221119022710.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078412422DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100714132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanapathy, Swarnaletchumi 10aSequence-Specific Electrochemical Genosensor for Rapid Detection of blaOXA-51-like Gene in Acinetobacter baumannii  aAcinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) are phenotypically indistinguishable from the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus–A. baumannii (ACB) complex members using routine laboratory methods. Early diagnosis plays an important role in controlling A. baumannii infections and this could be assisted by the development of a rapid, yet sensitive diagnostic test. In this study, we developed an enzyme-based electrochemical genosensor for asymmetric PCR (aPCR) amplicon detection of the blaOXA₋₅₁₋ₗᵢₖₑ gene in A. baumannii. A. baumanniiblaOXA₋₅₁₋ₗᵢₖₑ gene PCR primers were designed, having the reverse primer modified at the 5′ end with FAM. A blaOXA₋₅₁₋ₗᵢₖₑ gene sequence-specific biotin labelled capture probe was designed and immobilized using a synthetic oligomer (FAM-labelled) deposited on the working electrode of a streptavidin-modified, screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The zot gene was used as an internal control with biotin and FAM labelled as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The blaOXA₋₅₁₋ₗᵢₖₑ gene was amplified using asymmetric PCR (aPCR) to generate single-stranded amplicons that were detected using the designed SPCE. The amperometric current response was detected with a peroxidase-conjugated, anti-fluorescein antibody. The assay was tested using reference and clinical A. baumannii strains and other nosocomial bacteria. The analytical sensitivity of the assay at the genomic level and bacterial cell level was 0.5 pg/mL (1.443 µA) and 10³ CFU/mL, respectively. The assay was 100% specific and sensitive for A. baumannii. Based on accelerated stability performance, the developed genosensor was stable for 1.6 years when stored at 4 °C and up to 28 days at >25 °C. The developed electrochemical genosensor is specific and sensitive and could be useful for rapid, accurate diagnosis of A. baumannii infections even in temperate regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abiotin 3acarbon electrodes 3across infection 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3agenes 3agenomics 3arapid methods1 aObande, Godwin Attah1 aChuah, Candy 1 aShueb, Rafidah Hanim1 aYean, Chan Yean1 aBanga Singh, Kirnpal Kaur0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 July 13, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100714133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245017300163300001600336500002000352520158500372592002801957596006801985650003402053650001802087650001202105650001702117650002002134650001102154650001402165650001402179650002902193650001802222650001602240650001202256700002202268773012402290856007502414852000902489655001202498IND60789420320221120125418.0220820e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078942032DNAL7 a10.1002/mcf2.101762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiskey, Matthew R.14aThe Relative Influence of Age Structure, Predation, and Temperature on Stock–Recruitment Dynamics: A Case Study of Southern New England/Mid‐Atlantic Winter Flounder  ap. 583-599.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStock size estimates used in stock–recruitment models often assume that reproductive output per individual is equal despite evidence that larger, older spawners contribute diverse spawning behaviors and disproportionately more to reproductive output. This is concerning since depleted population states often coincide with a compromised age structure and increased control of extrinsic forces (environmental conditions or predator–prey dynamics) on stock productivity. In this study, parameterizations of the stock–recruitment relationship for Winter Flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus, which incorporated covariate metrics describing age structure, temperature, and predation, were compared to identify primary drivers across area‐specific data sets that are included in recent regional stock assessments. Four of the six data sets resulted in a top‐ranked model that incorporated an age structure metric; however, the age structure metric model was alone in the pool of top‐ranked models for only two of these scenarios. In addition, one data set resulted in a base Ricker model, and one resulted in a model that incorporated a predator index. Finally, wavelet analysis identified significant coherence between fishing mortality rate (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) for Winter Flounder, which switched from an out‐of‐phase state to an in‐phase state during the 1990s. If the relationship between these model‐derived estimates of F and SSB reflects dynamics of the Winter Flounder population, it would have strong implications for management efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA15NMF4270263cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aPseudopleuronectes americanus 3aage structure 3abiomass 3acase studies 3adata collection 3amodels 3amortality 3apredation 3areproductive performance 3astocking rate 3atemperature 3awavelet1 aFrisk, Michael G.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2021 Aug., v. 13, no. 5 p.583-599dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2254x1942-51207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.101763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100003200158245014500190300001600335520136400351592002801715650002401743650002001767650001301787650001901800650001701819650002401836650001301860650001901873650001201892650001301904650000901917650001201926650001801938650002901956650002901985650002202014650002402036700003302060700001802093700002002111700002602131773009602157856004002253852000902293655001202302IND50089016720221119150754.0140425e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008901672DNAL7 a237106962pmid7 a10.1111/vop.120542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeigue dos Santos, Lucianne10aBacterial microbiota of the ocular surface of captive and free‐ranging microbats: Desmodus rotundus, Diameus youngi and Artibeus lituratus  ap. 157-161.  aOBJECTIVES: To investigate normal aerobic bacterial microbiota of the eye surface in vvcaptive and free‐ranging bats belonging to the suborder Microchiroptera. ANIMALS STUDIED: A total of 36 bats belonging to three different species (Desmodus rotundus, Diameus youngi, and Artibeus lituratus) were used to perform this investigation. Thirteen Diameus youngi and six Desmodus rotundus were trapped in a cave, and 17 captive Artibeus lituratus were obtained from an experimental colony. Both free‐ranging and captive bats were free of apparent ocular or systemic disease. PROCEDURES: Corneal and conjunctival swabs were collected from both eyes to identify the resident bacterial microbiota. RESULTS: Seventeen bats had positive bacterial cultures in one or both eyes. Considering all isolates, Gram‐positive bacteria (82.6%) predominated over those that were Gram‐negative bacteria (17.4%). Coagulase‐negative staphylococci (30.4%) were the most isolated genus, followed by Bacillus spp. (26%) and Corynebacterium spp. (21%). Only four Gram‐negative species were isolated: Shigella spp., Hafnia alvei, Morganella morganii, and Flavobacterium odoratum. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, bacterial microbiota of the ocular surface of bats was described, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated type of microorganism from healthy bat eyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aCorynebacterium 3aDesmodus 3aFlavobacterium 3aHafnia alvei 3aMorganella morganii 3aShigella 3aStaphylococcus 3aanimals 3abacteria 3aeyes 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBacteriaxclassification 2aChiropteraxmicrobiology 2aEyexmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity1 aMontiani‐Ferreira, Fabiano1 aLima, Leandro1 aLange, Rogério1 abarros Filho, Ivan R.0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2014 May, v. 17, no. 3 p.157-161dBlackwell Pubx1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.12054  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245008700182300001600269500000900285520111400294592002801408650001101436650002001447650001801467650000901485650001601494650001401510650001601524650001901540650001601559773014701575856009601722852000901818655001201827IND60668057120221118175201.0191125e198005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066805712DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400030014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEltantawy, I.

Heating to 200°C enhanced the ESR signal (g = 2.0024), indicating an increase in the free radical content. No changes were observed in the g value, suggesting that the thermally generated and the original free radicals had similar structures. IR spectra indicated that structural modifications during heating include partial dehydroxylation and/or decarboxylation, vaporization of low-boiling volatiles, oxidation, and solid state transition. The maximum weight loss was 20% after heating to 200°C. Heating humic acid from 200 to 400°C caused great structural changes and a loss of weight of about 90%. These structural changes slightly increased the free radical content, the increase occurring within the temperature range 25 to 400°C. It was due to structural modification of the heated substance and not due to increase in the percentage of carbon in the humic acid char. Humic acid residue was burnt off at 600°C with a 95% loss of weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adecarboxylation 3afree radicals 3aheat 3ahumic acids 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3avolatilization 3aweight loss0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1980 May, v. 44, no. 3 p.512-514dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400030014x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245011300176300001600289500000900305520139900314592002801713650001501741650000901756650001801765650001401783650001601797650001901813650002201832650001801854650001701872650002501889651001301914700001701927700001701944700002101961773014801982856009602130852000902226655001202235IND60668057220221118175151.0191125e196611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066805722DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1966.03615995003000060008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, T.

Correlation analysis of the data yielded a highly significant coefficient of 0.965. The best-fit line between the clay contents determined by these two procedures was obtained by the reduced major axis method of statistical analysis. In this statistical method, neither one of the two variables is considered as the dependent variable and the reduced major axis is determined by mininizing the sum of the areas of triangles formed by lines drawn from each point to the best-fit line and paralle with the X and Y axes. The relationship between the clay contents is expressed by the equation Y = 0.63 + 1.008 X, in which X and Y represent the pipette and hydrometer clay content, respectively. Clay contents determined by these two methods are quite similar, although there is a tendency for hydrometer analyses to be slightly higher. Relationships between data from Illinois and other states are very similar. The slightly poorer correlation between clay contents of A horizons as compared to other horizons may have been caused by organic matter which was not removed in hydrometer analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aequations 3ahydrometers 3aorganic matter 3asoil conservation 3asoil sampling 3asoil surveys 3astatistical analysis 3aIllinois1 aOdell, R.

In particular, how to understand the interconnectedness of urban and natural systems is a key issue. This paper introduces an urban model that can be used to evaluate city resilience outcomes under different policy scenarios. The model is the Wellington Integrated Land Use-Transport-Environment Model (WILUTE). It considers the city (i.e., Wellington) as a complex system characterized by interactions between a variety of internal urban processes (social, economic and physical) and the natural environment. It is focused on exploring the dynamic relations between human activities (the geographic distribution of housing and employment, infrastructure layout, traffic flows and energy consumption), environmental effects (carbon emissions, influences on local natural and ecological systems) and potential natural disasters (e.g., inundation due to sea level rise and storm events) faced under different policy scenarios. The model gives insights that are potentially useful for policy to enhance the city’s resilience, by modelling outcomes, such as the potential for reduction in transportation energy use, and changes in the vulnerability of the city’s housing stock and transport system to sea level rise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3acities 3aclimate change 3adisasters 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aemployment 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3ageographical distribution 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3asea level 3astorms 3atraffic1 aChapman, Ralph1 aRandal, Edward1 aHowden-Chapman, Philippa0 tSustainability.g2013 July 23, v. 5, no. 7 p.3202-3223dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su50732023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245017100165500002000336520170300356592002802059650001802087650002402105650001402129650001802143650002202161650001402183650001802197650001502215650001302230650002402243650001402267650002002281650002202301650001802323650002102341650001002362650001802372650002302390650001402413650002402427650001302451650001102464650001302475650001102488700003002499700003002529700003002559773011202589856007902701852000902780655001202789IND60593886020180622000000.0180622e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059388602DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2017001822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButala, Megha A.13aAn Ayurvedic Anti‐Diabetic Formulation Made from Curcuma longa L. and Emblica officinalis L. Inhibits α‐Amylase, α‐Glucosidase, and Starch Digestion, In Vitro  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTargeting digestive enzymes and controlling postprandial glycemia is an important approach in diabetes management. Dietary supplements that inhibit digestive enzymes are a promising strategy for managing hyperglycemia in diabetic and borderline patients, particularly those who consume high carbohydrate diets. The Indian traditional Ayurvedic system of medicine has lot to offer in this direction. The emerging trend of opting for complementary and alternative medicines for the management of life style diseases, like diabetes, is encouraging but has limited global acceptance due to inadequate information on their therapeutic efficacy and mode of action. The present work demonstrates Nisha‐Amalaki (CE), an Ayurvedic anti‐diabetic formulation prepared from Curcuma longa and Emblica officinalis, as a potential of digestive enzyme inhibitor using in vitro models. The benefit of using honey as an adjuvant for CE is also studied. A simulated in vitro digestion model adopted in the work facilitates the study of the formulation in total than its individual components. While CE inhibits α‐amylase (65%), α‐glucosidase (93%) and reduces starch digestion (≈60%), addition of honey (CEH) is found to improve α‐amylase inhibition to 107% with a higher inhibition of starch digestion. Bioassay guided fractionation of CE and CEH shows multiple fractions, a curcuminoid rich chloroform fraction and an aqueous fraction, possibly contributing to the observed pharmacological effects. In conclusion, the study reports the herbal formulation, Nisha‐Amalaki, as an inhibitor of starch digestion as well as a potential nutraceutical dietary supplement in the management of hyperglycemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma longa 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3aadjuvants 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abioassays 3ablood glucose 3achloroform 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3adigestion 3adisease control 3aenzyme inhibition 3afractionation 3afunctional foods 3ahoney 3ahyperglycemia 3ain vitro digestion 3alifestyle 3amechanism of action 3amedicine 3amodels 3apatients 3astarch1 aKukkupuni, Subrahmanya K.1 aVenkatasubramanian, Padma1 aVishnuprasad, Chethala N.0 tStärke =.g2018 May, v. 70, no. 5-6 p.e1700182-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2017001823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008100175300001700256500001100273520107600284592002801360650001101388650001501399650001201414650001701426650003101443650001201474650002701486650001101513650002801524650001701552650001301569650002401582650001201606650001301618700002401631700002401655700002601679700001901705700002601724773008801750856008101838852000901919655001201928IND60537360220221120032519.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053736022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-015-0859-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolesnikov, Yaroslav S.10aMolecular mechanisms of gravity perception and signal transduction in plants  ap. 987-1004.  aReview  aGravity is one of the environmental cues that direct plant growth and development. Recent investigations of different gravity signalling pathways have added complexity to how we think gravity is perceived. Particular cells within specific organs or tissues perceive gravity stimulus. Many downstream signalling events transmit the perceived information into subcellular, biochemical, and genomic responses. They are rapid, non-genomic, regulatory, and cell-specific. The chain of events may pass by signalling lipids, the cytoskeleton, intracellular calcium levels, protein phosphorylation-dependent pathways, proteome changes, membrane transport, vacuolar biogenesis mechanisms, or nuclear events. These events culminate in changes in gene expression and auxin lateral redistribution in gravity response sites. The possible integration of these signalling events with amyloplast movements or with other perception mechanisms is discussed. Further investigation is needed to understand how plants coordinate mechanisms and signals to sense this important physical factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauxins 3abiogenesis 3acalcium 3acytoskeleton 3agene expression regulation 3agravity 3agrowth and development 3alipids 3aphysiological transport 3aplant growth 3aproteome 3asignal transduction 3atissues 3avacuoles1 aKretynin, Serhiy V.1 aVolotovsky, Igor D.1 aKordyum, Elizabeth L.1 aRuelland, Eric1 aKravets, Volodymyr S.0 tProtoplasma.g2016 July, v. 253, no. 4 p.987-1004dSpringer Viennax0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-015-0859-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100004300161245008300204300001600287500000900303520123600312592002801548650000901576650001801585650000701603650001501610650001401625650001801639650001101657650001901668650001201687650001901699773014801718856009601866852000901962655001201971IND60668057520221118175202.0191125e195707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066805752DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1957.03615995002100040009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhodes, D.

Solutions containing less than 1 × 10⁻⁹ moles per liter of selected radioisotopes were equilibrated with samples of a calcareous subsoil. The uptake of these radioactive isotopes by the soil was measured as a function of pH. The uptake of Cs¹³⁷ was not affected appreciably by varying the pH between 4 and 10. The maximum uptake of Sr⁹⁰ occurred at about pH 10 and decreased rapidly as the pH was lowered. The radioisotopes Pu²³⁹, Ce¹⁴⁴, Zr⁹⁵, -Nb⁹⁵, Y⁹¹, and Ru¹⁰⁶ exhibited a maximum uptake between approximately pH 4 and pH 8. Above pH 8 a region of reduced uptake occurred and persisted up to at least pH 11 for most of the polyvalent radioisotopes. The addition of high concentrations of sodium salts to the solution inhibited the uptake of both Cs¹³⁷ and Sr⁹⁰ by soil. A relatively small concentration of phosphate (0.01 M) added to the system was found, in effect, to nullify the interference of sodium ion with the uptake of Sr⁹⁰, but the phosphate ions had no apparent influence on the uptake of Cs¹³⁷.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3anuclear power 3apH 3aphosphates 3aplutonium 3aradionuclides 3asodium 3asoil chemistry 3asubsoil 3awaste disposal0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1957 July, v. 21, no. 4 p.389-392dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1957.03615995002100040009x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003000144245016700174500002000341520131700361592002801678650001701706650001901723650001301742650002001755650001601775650001301791650001901804650002101823650002201844650001301866650002201879650001901901650001101920700002801931700003101959773011201990856007902102852000902181655001202190IND60593886120180622000000.0180622e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059388612DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2017002272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakaywatchara, Petcharat10aEffects of Emulsifier Types and Levels in Combination With Glycerol on the Gelatinization and Retrogradation Properties of Gluten‐Free Rice‐Based Wonton Wraps  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA gluten‐free diet is a treatment for celiac disease and gluten‐related disorders. Gluten‐free wontons can be prepared; however, their quality changes during storage. The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of emulsifier types and levels combined with glycerol on the gelatinization and retrogradation properties of rice‐based wonton wraps compared with control samples. Four emulsifiers are used in this study, namely glycerol monostearate (GMS), diacetyl tartaric esters of mono‐ and diglycerides (DATEM), and distilled monoglycerides (DMG). A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) is used to determine the gelatinization and retrogradation properties. The results shows that the addition of glycerol alone (Ctrl 2) or in combination with emulsifier could decrease retrograded enthalpy, and a greater effect on retrogradation reduction is found in the samples incorporating both glycerol and an emulsifier. The highest enthalpy of retrograded samples is presented in Ctrl 1 (no addition of glycerol and/or emulsifier), and the lowest retrograded enthalpy is found in the sample with 1% DMG and glycerol. The formation of the amylose–lipid complex (ALC) is suppressed by glycerol. An efficient emulsifier to inhibit starch retrogradation in gluten‐free wonton wraps was DMG.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3aceliac disease 3adiacetyl 3adiacylglycerols 3aemulsifiers 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3agluten-free diet 3agluten-free foods 3aglycerol 3amonoacylglycerols 3aretrogradation 3astarch1 aWattanapairoj, Chatchai1 aThirathumthavorn, Doungjai0 tStärke =.g2018 May, v. 70, no. 5-6 p.e1700227-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2017002273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010800158520140600266592002801672650001201700650001501712650002201727650001801749650001301767650001201780650003501792650001501827650001501842650001301857650001601870650001101886651001101897651001401908700002301922700001801945700002501963773012001988856007302108852000902181655001202190IND60648963620221122181425.0190702e20190220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064896362DNAL7 a10.3390/f100201912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRijal, Syamsu 10aProfile, Level of Vulnerability and Spatial Pattern of Deforestation in Sulawesi Period of 1990 to 2018  aDeforestation is an event of loss of forest cover to another cover. Sulawesi forests have the potential to be deforested as with Sumatra and Kalimantan. This study aims to provide information on deforestation events in Sulawesi from 1990 to 2018. The data used in this study are (1) land cover in 1990, 2000, 2010; (2) Landsat 8 imagery in 2018; (3) administrative map of BIG in 2018. The methods used are (1) image classification with on-screen digitation techniques following the PPIK land cover classification guidelines, Forestry Planning Agency (2008) using ArcGIS Desktop 10.6 from ESRI; (2) overlapping maps; (3) analysis of deforestation; (4) analysis of deforestation profiles, (5) vulnerability analysis; and (6) analysis of distribution patterns of deforestation. The results showed that the profile of deforestation occurring on Sulawesi Island in the 1990&ndash;2018 observation period was dominated by profile 3-1-1 (the proportion of large forest area, the highest incidence of deforestation early stage at the beginning, at a low rate) in 13 districts. The level of vulnerability to deforestation is a non-vulnerable category (37 districts) which is directed to become a priority in handling deforestation in Sulawesi. Spatial patterns of the deforestation that occurred randomly and were scattered are dominated by shrubs, dryland agricultural activities, and small-scale plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aarid lands 3acomputer software 3adeforestation 3aforestry 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3aguidelines 3aland cover 3aplanning 3aplantations 3ashrubs 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia1 aBarkey, Roland  A.1 aNasri, Nasri 1 aNursaputra, Munajat 0 tForests.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100201913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245008400174300001600258520165400274592002801928650001001956650002001966650001501986650002802001650002202029650002602051650001402077650001002091651002402101653001102125653001602136653001002152653002802162653001802190653001802208700002302226700001802249700003102267773012302298856008402421852000902505655001202514IND60543477520221119230010.0190411e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054347752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2014.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaia-Carvalho, Bruno10aMultilocus assessment of phylogenetic relationships in Alytes (Anura, Alytidae)  ap. 270-278.  aWith the advent of large multilocus datasets, molecular systematics is experiencing very rapid progress, but important challenges remain regarding data analysis and interpretation. Midwife toads (genus Alytes) exemplify two of the most widespread problems for accurate phylogenetic reconstruction: discerning the causes of discordance between gene trees, and resolving short internodes produced during rapid, successive splitting events. The three species in subgenus Baleaphryne (A. maurus, A. dickhilleni and A. muletensis), the sister group to A. obstetricans, have disjunct and highly restricted geographical ranges, which are thought to result from old vicariant events affecting their common ancestor, but their phylogenetic relationships are still unresolved. In this study we re-address the phylogeny of Alytes with a special focus on the relationships in Baleaphryne with a multilocus dataset including >9000 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA and four nuclear markers (3142bp) in all recognized taxa, including all subspecies of A. obstetricans. Both concatenation and species tree analyses suggest that A. muletensis, endemic to the Balearic island of Mallorca, is the sister taxon to a clade comprising the southeastern Iberian endemic A. dickhilleni and the North African A. maurus. This scenario is consistent with palaeogeological evidence associated with the fragmentation of the Betic-Rifean Massif, followed by the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. On the other hand, analyses of intraspecific variation in A. obstetricans are inconclusive regarding relationships between major clades and conflict with current subspecific taxonomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnura 3adata collection 3ainternodes 3aintraspecific variation 3amitochondrial DNA 3amolecular systematics 3aphylogeny 3atoads 3aStrait of Gibraltar 0aAlytes 0aBaleaphryne 0amtDNA 0aMultispecies coalescent 0aSpecies trees 0aConcatenation1 aGonçalves, Helena1 aFerrand, Nuno1 aMartínez-Solano, Íñigo,0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2014 Oct., v. 79 p.270-278dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2014.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016700159520192900326592002802255650002002283650001702303650002202320650001102342650002102353650001702374650002402391650002402415650001802439650002402457650002102481651001002502700001802512700001902530700002002549700001902569700001802588700001902606700001602625700001702641773012002658856007302778852000902851655001202860IND60648963720221122181329.0190702e20190221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064896372DNAL7 a10.3390/f100201922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoling 10aForest Soil Profile Inversion and Mixing Change the Vertical Stratification of Soil CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration without Altering Soil Surface CO<sub>2</sub> Flux  aIn order to gain more detailed knowledge of the CO<inf>2</inf> concentration gradient in forest soil profiles and to better understand the factors that control CO<inf>2</inf> concentration along forest soil profiles, we examined the soil surface CO<inf>2</inf> flux, soil properties and soil profile CO<inf>2</inf> concentration in upright (CK), inverted and mixed soil columns with a depth of 60 cm in two subtropical forests in China from May 2008 to December 2009. The results showed that: (1) The SOC (soil organic carbon), TN (total N) and microbial biomass were higher in the deeper layers in the inverted soil column, which was consistent with an increase in CO<inf>2</inf> concentration in the deeper soil layer. Furthermore, the biogeochemical properties were homogenous among soil layers in the mixed soil column. (2) CO<inf>2</inf> concentration in the soil profile increased with depth in CK while soil column inversion significantly intensified this vertical stratification as the most active layer (surface soil) was now at the bottom. The stratification of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration along the soil profile in the mixed soil column was similar to that in CK but it was not intensified after soil was mixed. (3) The soil surface CO<inf>2</inf> flux did not significantly change after the soil column was inverted. The surface CO<inf>2</inf> flux rate of the mixed soil column was higher compared to that of the inverted soil column but was not significantly different from CK. Our results indicated that the profile soil CO<inf>2</inf> production was jointly controlled by soil properties related to CO<inf>2</inf> production (e.g., SOC content and soil microbial biomass) and those related to gas diffusion (e.g., soil bulk density and gas molecular weight), but the soil surface CO<inf>2</inf> flux was mainly determined by soil surface temperature and may be affected by the intensity of soil disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisturbed soils 3aforest soils 3amicrobial biomass 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3asoil density 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asurface temperature 3atropical forests 3aChina1 aFu, Shenglei 1 aLi, Jianxiong 1 aZou, Xiaoming.,1 aZhang, Weixin 1 aXia, Hanping 1 aLin, Yongbiao 1 aTian, Qian 1 aZhou, Lixia 0 tForests.g2019 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f100201923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010200170300001800272520117300290592002801463650001301491650001301504650001601517650002501533650001301558650003101571650001201602650001101614650002001625650002101645650001901666650001301685650001801698650001901716700002001735773012101755856008201876852000901958655001201967IND60562171120170926000000.0170201e20160721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056217112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b031042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocherbitov, Vitaly10aEffect of Oligomerization of Counterions on Water Activity in Aqueous Cationic Surfactant Systems  ap. 6961-6968.  aA sorption calorimetry study of cationic cetyltrimethyl ammonium surfactants with four different counterions was performed. The counterions were acetate, succinate, citrate, and butyl tetracarboxylate with formal charges ranging from 1 to 4, respectively. The counterions with 2–4 charges can be considered as oligomers. In all the cases, hydration experiments started with dry solid phases that upon water uptake went through solid-state phase transitions and hexagonal to micellar cubic phase transitions. It was found that in liquid-crystalline phases the activity of water increased with the degree of oligomerization or, equivalently, the formal charge of the counterions. The results are discussed in terms of the forces acting between the colloidal aggregates. It is argued that under the conditions investigated, the so-called strong-coupling theory can be used to describe the electrostatic forces between the charged colloidal objects. Therefore, we suggest that the observed dependence of water activity on the degree of polymerization is due to the entropy of mixing of the counterions in the water volume, which we describe using Flory–Huggins theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aammonium 3acalorimetry 3acationic surfactants 3acitrates 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aentropy 3amixing 3aoligomerization 3aphase transition 3apolymerization 3asorption 3asuccinic acid 3awater activity1 aSöderman, Olle0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 July 21, v. 120, no. 28 p.6961-6968dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b031043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01749naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005300166300001600219520085200235592002801087650001901115650002001134650001701154650003601171650001401207650001901221773009401240856008101334990002301415852000901438655001201447IND60110739620221122043051.0141109e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011073962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcb.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwai, Kazuhiro10aDiverse ubiquitin signaling in NF-κB activation  ap. 355-364.  aNuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a transcription factor involved in a wide variety of phenomena including inflammation, immune responses, and cell survival. Abnormal activation of NF-κB occurs in many pathological conditions, such as allergic and auto-inflammatory diseases and malignancies. As a result, the signal-induced NF-κB activation pathway has been extensively studied and revealed to be regulated by ubiquitination. Several types of polyubiquitin chains exist and the type of chain seems to impact how ubiquitinated proteins are regulated. Recently, different types of polyubiquitin chains, including linear (M1) and K11 chains, have been implicated in NF-κB activation. This review discusses existing evidence of the differential roles played by various ubiquitin chains, particularly K63, M1, and K11 chains, in NF-κB activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitination0 tTrends in cell biology.g2012 July, v. 22, no. 7 p.355-364dElsevier Ltdx0962-89247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007600169300001600245520200600261592002802267650000802295650001502303650002602318650002102344650001002365650001702375650001902392650001102411650001902422650001102441650001502452650001902467650001402486700002402500700001602524700002702540700002202567700002302589773012102612856008302733990002302816852000902839655001202848IND60103024920221119221432.0141106e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010302492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2011.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeiga, J. Pedro10aUse of the hollow fiber assay for the evaluation of DNA damaging agents  ap. 226-232.  aINTRODUCTION: The preclinical development and clinical progression of potential anticancer agents are highly time and resource-intensive. Traditionally, promising compounds in vitro undergo further screening in xenograft models, a long process that uses large numbers of animals. In order to hasten compound progression, the hollow fiber assay (HFA) was developed by the US National Cancer Institute as an additional filtering step in drug development, bridging the gap between in vitro and xenograft compound screening. The HFA demonstrates a good correlation in terms of clinical predictivity, and has significant reduction and refinement benefits for animal usage. In addition, the assay enables the study of basic pharmacological properties of compounds under investigation. The HFA has been mainly used as a rapid in vivo cytotoxicity screen, but has also been shown to be amenable to study drug/target interactions in vivo. One of the challenges of the HFA is the small sample sizes obtained, which can limit sensitivity. METHODS: Here we specifically focus on the detection of DNA double-strand breaks, monitoring the effects of standard and novel anti-cancer agents on human lung, colon and breast cancer cell lines using immunoblotting and flow cytometry techniques for γ-H2A.X. This presented a further challenge due to the low abundance of the target event. RESULTS: We found a good correlation between techniques in terms of rate of detection and sensitivity confirming the ability to use the HFA for detection of these specific drug–target interactions. DISCUSSION: The results demonstrate good sensitivity and predictability for drug behavior in an assay where cell number is limited. In contrast to conventional xenograft studies, this short-term assay also enables analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints in tumor cells in vivo. Importantly, there is a significant impact on reduction and refinement of the use of animals in incorporating this assay into the drug development process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aantineoplastic agents 3abreast neoplasms 3acolon 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3ascreening1 aCooper, Patricia A.1 aPors, Klaus1 aPatterson, Laurence H.1 aBibby, Michael C.1 aShnyder, Steven D.0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2011 , v. 64, no. 3 p.226-232dElsevier Inc.x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2011.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001900168245006500187300001800252520137600270592002801646650002101674650002301695650001401718650001501732650001301747650001001760650001801770650001701788650002201805650001301827650001501840650001701855650001501872650001901887650001101906650004001917650001101957650003001968650002801998650001102026650003702037650001102074650000902085650002402094650002502118650002402143650003302167700001902200700002302219700001802242700001802260700001802278700001602296700001702312773009802329856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60103177920221119033200.0141106e20120403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010317792DNAL7 a222664852pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2012.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hsien-Yi10aImpact of uremic environment on peritoneum: A proteomic view  ap. 2053-2063.  aPeritoneal morphology and function are abnormal in uremia patients, but the contributing mechanisms are unclear. Here we attempted to characterize the protein targets that may be related to peritoneal change in patients with uremia and have not exposed to peritoneal dialysis fluid. Protein profiles of peritoneal fluids collected from patients with uremia and patients with normal renal function receiving laparoscopic cholecystectomy were displayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Altered protein spots were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Sixteen 2-DE protein spots were altered between two groups. Western blots confirmed that kininogen-1, apoptosis inhibitor 2, cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1, and apolipoprotein A-I had higher expression levels in the uremia samples. In contrast, synaptic vesicle 2-related protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and envelope glycoprotein (C2–V5 region) showed lower levels. The increased expression may result from a change in the permeability of the peritoneal membrane to middle-sized proteins or peritoneal inflammation with proteins sloughing off. All the identified proteins may provide a novel understanding of peritoneal changes caused by uremic toxins and may function as biomarkers or drug targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aapoptosis 3abiomarkers 3adialysis 3adrugs 3aglycoproteins 3ainflammation 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3aperitoneum 3apermeability 3aproteomics 3arenal function 3atoxins 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3auremia 2aAscitic Fluidxmetabolism 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGallstonesxmetabolismxsurgery. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPeritoneal Dialysis 2aProteomexmetabolism 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aUremiaxmetabolismxtherapy.1 aLin, Ching-Yih1 aChien, Chih-Chiang1 aKan, Wei-Chih1 aTian, Yu-Feng1 aLiao, Pao-Chi1 aWu, Hsin-Yi1 aSu, Shih-Bin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2012 Apr. 3, v. 75, no. 7 p.2053-2063dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245020900171300001800380520207300398592002802471650001702499650001602516650002002532650001102552650001602563650001502579650001302594650002602607650004102633650001402674650002902688700001802717700001502735700001902750700002202769700001802791773010402809856008502913852000902998655001203007IND60100355820221119102231.0141105e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010035582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeunissen, S.F.10aDevelopment and validation of a quantitative assay for the determination of tamoxifen and its five main phase I metabolites in human serum using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1677-1685.  aA sensitive bioanalytical assay for the quantitative determination of tamoxifen and five of its phase I metabolites (N-desmethyltamoxifen, N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen, N-desmethyl-4′-hydroxytamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 4′-hydroxytamoxifen) in serum is described. The method has been fully validated at ranges covering steady-state serum concentrations in patients receiving therapeutic dosages of tamoxifen. The bioanalytical assay is based on reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring for drug (-metabolite) quantification. The sample pretreatment consists of protein precipitation with acetonitrile using only 50μL of serum. In the past, numerous assays have been developed by other groups for the quantification of tamoxifen and its phase I metabolites. However, the number of metabolites included in these studies is very limited and only very few of these assays have been fully validated. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay for the quantification of tamoxifen and four phase I metabolites in human serum that was previously developed by our group is now explicitly improved and described herein. Time of analysis has been reduced by 50% and sensitivity was increased by a reduction of the lower limit of quantification from 1.0 to 0.2ng/mL for 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 4′-hydroxytamoxifen. Additionally, two phase I metabolites that have never been quantified in human serum hitherto, namely 4′-hydroxytamoxifen and N-desmethyl-4′-hydroxytamoxifen, were included in this assay. Validation results demonstrate an accurate and precise quantification of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen, N-desmethyl-4′-hydroxytamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 4′-hydroxytamoxifen in human serum. The applicability of the assay was demonstrated and it is now successfully used to support clinical studies in which patient-specific dose optimization is performed based on serum concentrations of tamoxifen metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3ablood serum 3aclinical trials 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3atamoxifen 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aJager, N.G.L.1 aRosing, H.1 aSchinkel, A.H.1 aSchellens, J.H.M.1 aBeijnen, J.H.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 June 1, v. 879, no. 19 p.1677-1685dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012600168300001300294520122000307592002801527650001901555650002601574650001401600650002601614650002201640650001601662650002801678650002001706650001801726650001201744653002001756653001201776653001601788653001801804653001101822653001101833700002101844773009401865856008501959852000902044655001202053IND60100438820221123040512.0161024e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010043882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhiqian12aA fast liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) method for quantification of major polar metabolites in plants  ap. 8-15.  aCurrent liquid chromatography (LC) based methods for the analysis of polar plant metabolites require multiple runs using complex mobile phases and a combination of different columns. Here we describe a fast liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) method for the determination of major polar metabolites in plants that requires only a single run using a single column. The method takes advantage of the ability to acquire both positive and negative data in an ion trap mass spectrometer (MS) and also the accurate mass capability of the orbitrap MS. The separation of polar compounds is achieved with a polar, reversed-phase column (Synergi Hydro-RP). A single analysis with a 25min runtime is able to reliably determine the level of nearly all essential amino acids, several major organic acids and several major sugars in plant materials, as exemplified by analysis of a perennial ryegrass extract. The level of detection on column was below 0.1ng (average 0.03ng) for most amino acids, below 5ng (average 2.3ng) for organics acids and below 1ng (average 0.64ng) for sugars. The levels of quantified metabolites in ryegrass varied from 22μg/g dry weight for histidine to 41mg/g dry weight for sucrose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aessential amino acids 3ahistidine 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aorganic acids and salts 3apolar compounds 3aspectrometers 3asucrose 0aPolar compounds 0aLC–MS 0aAmino acids 0aOrganic acids 0aSugars 0aPlants1 aRochfort, Simone0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 912 p.8-15dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245007400176300001600250500001500266520171800281592002801999650000902027650001302036650001802049650002002067650001302087650002602100650002202126650001002148650001602158650002302174650002002197651001302217653001802230700002302248700001902271700002302290700002002313700002002333700001902353773008102372856008502453852000902538655001202547IND60111145820221118015155.0141109e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011114582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.10.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Margaret S.10aDirect costs of a single case of refugee-imported measles in Kentucky  ap. 317-321.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Refugees are highly vulnerable populations with limited access to health care services. The United States accepts 50,000–75,000 refugees for resettlement annually. Despite residing in camps and other locations where vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, such as measles, occur frequently, refugees are not required to have any vaccinations before they arrive in the United States. PURPOSE: We estimated the medical and public-health response costs of a case of measles imported into Kentucky by a refugee. METHODS: The Kentucky Refugee Health Coordinator recorded the time and labor of local, state, and some federal personnel involved in caring for the refugee and implementing the public health response activities. Secondary sources were used to estimate the labor and medical care costs of the event. RESULTS: The total costs to conduct the response to the disease event were approximately $25,000. All costs were incurred by government, either public health department or federal, because refugee health costs are paid by the federal government and the event response costs are covered by the public health department. CONCLUSION: A potentially preventable case of measles that was imported into the United States cost approximately $25,000 for the public health response. RECOMMENDATION: To maintain the elimination of measles transmission in the United States, U.S.-bound refugees should be vaccinated overseas. A refugee vaccination program administered during the overseas health assessment has the potential to reduce the risk of importation of measles and other vaccine-preventable disease and would eliminate costs associated with public health response to imported cases and outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3arefugees 3apublic health 3ahuman resources 3avaccines 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3adisease outbreaks 3alabor 3avaccination 3afederal government 3ahealth services 3aKentucky 0aMeasles virus1 aGarbat-Welch, Luta1 aBurke, Heather1 aWeinberg, Michelle1 aHumbaugh, Kraig1 aTindall, Alicia1 aCambron, Janie0 tVaccine.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 30, no. 2 p.317-321dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.10.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009500170300001600265520187800281592002802159650001402187650001202201650001002213650001002223650001302233650002402246650003002270650001202300650001502312650001102327650002302338650001802361650001602379650001402395650001902409650002602428650001102454650001602465650002402481650001902505650002402524700002202548700002102570700002102591773007302612856008602685852000902771655001202780IND60105473320221123041454.0141108e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010547332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2013.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeed, Tariq,10aDeciphering intracellular localization and physiological role of nociceptin and nocistatin  ap. 174-183.  aNociceptin and nocistatin are endogenous ligands of G protein coupled receptor family. Numerous techniques have been used to study the diverse parameters including, localization, distribution and ultrastructure of these peptides. The majority of the study parameters are based on their physiological roles in different organ systems. The present study presents an overview of the different methods used for the study of nociceptin, nocistatin and their receptors. Nociceptin has been implicated in many physiological functions including, nociception, locomotion, stressed-induced analgesia, learning and memory, neurotransmitter and hormone release, renal function, neuronal differentiation, sexual and reproductive behavior, uterine contraction, feeding, anxiety, gastrointestinal motility, cardiovascular function, micturition, cough, hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, diuresis and sodium balance, temperature regulation, vestibular function, and mucosal transport. It has been noted that the use of light and electron microscopy was less frequent, though it may be one of the most promising tools to study the intracellular localization of these neuropeptides. In addition, more studies on the level of circulating nociceptin and nocistatin are also necessary for investigating their clinical roles in health and disease. A variety of modern tools including physiological, light and electron microscopy (EM) are needed to decipher the extent of intracellular localization, tissue distribution and function of these peptides. The intracellular localization of nociceptin and nocistatin will require a high resolution transmission EM capable of identifying these peptides and other supporting molecules that co-localize with them. A tracing technique could also elucidate a possible migratory ability of nociceptin and nocistatin from one cellular compartment to the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3aanxiety 3abrain 3acough 3adiuresis 3aelectron microscopy 3agastrointestinal motility 3aligands 3alocomotion 3amemory 3amigratory behavior 3aneuropeptides 3anociception 3areceptors 3arenal function 3areproductive behavior 3asodium 3atemperature 3atissue distribution 3aultrastructure 3auterine contraction1 aNurulain, Syed M.1 aTekes, Kornélia1 aAdeghate, Ernest0 tPeptides.g2013 May, v. 43 p.174-183dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001600287520099400303592002801297650002401325650001901349650002001368650001101388650001001399650001201409650002101421650002101442650002001463650001301483650001101496650001501507650001501522650001601537700002101553773008801574856008101662852000901743655001201752IND60110273520221118082025.0141109e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011027352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2012.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafamirzaei, Mani10aCorrelating and predicting low pressure solubility of gases in [bmim][BF₄] by neural network molecular modeling  ap. 125-130.  aIn this communication a modeling method based on neural network technique and molecular properties has been proposed to model solubility of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, argon, oxygen, nitrogen, methane and ethane in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate. Molecular weight and acentric factor (i.e. sphericity of molecule) are two network inputs which indicate the structure of gas molecule. Absolute temperature and pressure are two other inputs which exhibit macroscopic condition of studied system. Low deviations during training, validating and testing stages confirmed that the model is reliable within the studied range. Also, the proposed method is able to provide reliable gas solubility estimations based on available solubility data of other gases. This unique capability, which confirms superiority of applied method over traditional methods, enables researchers and engineers to provide acceptable gas solubility estimations without performing long time experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aethane 3agases 3amethane 3amolecular models 3amolecular weight 3aneural networks 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aModarress, Hamid0 tThermochimica acta.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 545 p.125-130dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013500164300001600299520084300315592002801158650002201186650001301208650002401221650001101245650000701256650001301263650001001276700001801286700001701304700001801321700001501339773011601354856008201470852000901552655001201561IND60100815920221122053103.0141105e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010081592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qiang10aRemoval of low concentration Cr(VI) from aqueous solution by magnetic-fluids fixed bed using the high gradient magnetic separation  ap. 325-330.  aThe focus of this paper was a novel model of Cr(VI) extraction process. The original so-called “magnetic-fluids fixed bed” (MFFB), which bridged the solvent extraction and the fixed-bed extraction by the theory of the high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS), has been explained. The MFFB integrated the advantages of the two above mentioned classical extraction methods and overcame their drawbacks. The feasibility of this method was studied by extraction experiments of Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. The influences of the design of ferromagnetic steel wires in magnetic separation column, the pH value of feed solution, TBP concentration in magnetic fluids, and flow rate of aqueous solution in column were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed method obtained high extraction efficiency with continuous process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3amagnetic separation 3amodels 3apH 3asolvents 3asteel1 aGuan, Yueping1 aRen, Xiufeng1 aYang, Mingzhu1 aLiu, Xiang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 May 15, v. 374, no. 1 p.325-330dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012600176300001800302520061000320592002800930650001700958650001300975650002300988650001801011650002401029650001401053650001301067650001401080653004401094653005301138653002101191653002201212653002101234700001901255700002001274700003001294773008801324856008401412852000901496655001201505IND60110102120221122212222.0161019e20130529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011010212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.03.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinosha, Beer Mohamed10aFacile domino reactions for the stereoselective assembly of highly functionalized bis-(trans-2,3-dihydrofuranyl) sulfides  ap. 2837-2840.  aA facile stereoselective synthesis of a series of nineteen novel bis-(trans-2,3-dihydrofuranyl) sulfides from the reaction of (Z,Z)-2,2′-thiobis(1,3-diarylprop-2-en-1-ones) with substituted phenacyl bromides and pyridine in the presence of K2CO3 in acetonitrile via domino reactions is described.

Further, on the basis of the measured properties, excess volumes (Vᴱ), isentropic compressibility deviations (Δκₛ) and viscosity deviations (Δη) were obtained for all these systems under the same experimental conditions. The results are correlated by the Redlich–Kister type equation. The results are also analysed on anion dependent phenomena and temperature influence on measured and derived properties of ILs with NMP mixtures. A qualitative analysis of molecular interactions between ILs and NMP is discussed in terms of the ion-dipole, ion-pair interactions, and hydrogen bonding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acompressibility 3aequations 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3aphosphates 3aqualitative analysis 3asulfates 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity1 aAttri, Pankaj1 aVenkatesu, P.1 aRama Devi, R.S.1 aHofman, T.0 tThermochimica acta.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 545 p.131-140dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002400190245009200214300001600306520159800322592002801920650001901948650001301967650001401980650003201994650001902026650001202045650001902057650001102076650001202087650002202099650001802121650002402139650001702163650001602180650001002196650001502206650001002221650001902231650001102250650002002261650001102281650002602292650002602318650001702344650001702361650001602378700002302394700002202417700001902439773009302458856008302551990002302634852000902657655001202666IND60102598920221120172719.0141106e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010259892DNAL7 a225752422pmid7 aPMC36705922pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrownell, Elizabeth10aDelayed Onset Lactogenesis II Predicts the Cessation of Any or Exclusive Breastfeeding  ap. 608-614.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between delayed lactogenesis II (>3 days postpartum; delayed onset lactogenesis II [DLII]) and the cessation of any and exclusive breastfeeding at 4-weeks postpartum. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed multivariable logistic regression models using data from 2491 mothers enrolled in the prospective Infant Feeding Practice Study II cohort. Models included DLII, known risk factors for breastfeeding cessation (age, education, race, parity/previous breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding plan), and potential confounders identified in bivariate analyses (P ≤ .1). Backward selection processes (P ≤ .1) determined risk factor retention in the final model. RESULTS: DLII was associated with cessation of any and exclusive breastfeeding at 4-weeks postpartum (OR 1.62; CI 1.14-2.31; OR 1.62; CI 1.18-2.22, respectively); numerous independent risk factors qualified for inclusion in the multivariable model(s) and were associated with the outcome(s) of interest (eg, supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children enrollment, onset of prenatal care, feeding on-demand, time initiated first breastfeed, hospital rooming-in, obstetric provider preference for exclusive breastfeeding, and maternal tobacco use). CONCLUSIONS: Women experiencing DLII may be less able to sustain any and/or exclusive breastfeeding in the early postpartum period. Routine assessment of DLII in postpartum breastfeeding follow-up is warranted. Women with DLII may benefit from additional early postpartum interventions to support favorable breastfeeding outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3aeducation 3afood and nutrition programs 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3amilk synthesis 3amodels 3amothers 3apostpartum period 3aprenatal care 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3atobacco use 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBreast Feeding 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 2aYoung Adult1 aHoward, Cynthia R.1 aLawrence, Ruth A.1 aDozier, Ann M.0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Oct., v. 161, no. 4 p.608-614dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.03.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245012100177300001400298520057100312592002800883650002100911650002600932650002200958650000900980650002300989650001701012650001101029650001301040700002601053773011601079856008801195990002301283852000901306655001201315IND60107293020221120181508.0141108e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010729302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelkikh, Alexey V.10aMechanisms and models of the active transport of ions and the transformation of energy in intracellular compartments  ap. 33-57.  aVarious transport models and mechanisms for ions from different compartments of the cell are considered.

The aim of this study was to determine whether high phenylalanine is associated with disturbed behavior noticed by the patient and or close environment (parents or partners). 48 early treated PKU patients (median age 8.5, range 0–35years) participated (median phenylalanine concentration in total sample 277 (range 89–1171) μmol/l; and in patients <12years 238 (range 89–521) μmol/l). After sending blood samples, patients or close environment were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire whether they noticed hyperactivity, annoying behavior, mood swings and introvert or extravert behavior. The interviewer as well as the respondents were blinded with regard to the phenylalanine concentration. Results: Patients reported less deviant behavior compared to close environment. Mood swings were positively associated with phenylalanine concentrations in the total group (P=0.039) and patients <12years (P=0.042). The relationships between temporary high phenylalanine concentrations and hyperactivity, annoying behavior, introvert and extravert behavior were not statistically significant.

Since defection yields the highest individual benefits, the outlook for cooperators is gloomy. While network reciprocity promotes collaborative efforts, chances of averting the impending social decline are slim if the temptation to defect is strong. It is, therefore, of interest to identify viable mechanisms that provide additional support for the evolution of cooperation. Inspired by the fact that the environment may be just as important as inheritance for individual development, we introduce a simple switch that allows a player to either keep its original payoff or use the average payoff of all its neighbors. Depending on which payoff is higher, the influence of either option can be tuned by means of a single parameter. We show that, in general, taking into account the environment promotes cooperation. Yet coveting the fitness of one's neighbors too strongly is not optimal. In fact, cooperation thrives best only if the influence of payoffs obtained in the traditional way is equal to that of the average payoff of the neighborhood. We present results for the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game, for different levels of uncertainty governing the strategy adoption process, and for different neighborhood sizes. Our approach outlines a viable route to increased levels of cooperative behavior in structured populations, but one that requires a thoughtful implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3agames 3apersonal development 3asocial problems 3auncertainty 2aComputer Simulation 2aCooperative Behavior 2aGame Theory 2aGenetic Fitness 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aSocial Behavior 2aTime Factors1 aMurks, Aleksandra1 aDu, Wen-Bo1 aRong, Zhi-Hai1 aPerc, Matjaž0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 May 21, v. 277, no. 1 p.19-26dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.02.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011200167300001600279520083300295592002801128650002501156650001501181650002601196650001801222650001301240650001601253650001601269650001501285650002201300650001701322650001801339700001701357700002001374773010301394856008201497852000901579655001201588IND60110650420221117063409.0141109e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011065042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2010.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajslova, Jana10aChallenging applications offered by direct analysis in real time (DART) in food-quality and safety analysis  ap. 204-218.  aDirect analysis in real time (DART) is an ambient ionization technique undergoing rapid development. With minimal sample pre-treatment, ionization of analyte molecules outside the mass spectrometry (MS) instrument in the ordinary atmosphere is feasible. This ionization approach relies upon the fundamental principles of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The current review highlights and critically assesses application of DART (and some related desorption/ionization techniques) coupled to various types of MS analyzers for both target and non-target analysis of complex food matrices. Based on existing studies, DART-MS is presented as a simple, high-throughput tool for: With regard to regulatory requirements, we mention practical aspects of DART-MS use, as well as performance characteristics that can be attained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3adesorption 3aequipment performance 3afood analysis 3afood law 3afood matrix 3afood safety 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apretreatment 3aspectrometers1 aCajka, Tomas1 aVaclavik, Lukas0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2011 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.204-218dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016400166300001800330520087500348592002801223650001501251650001301266650001701279650002301296650001501319650002301334700001601357700001601373700002001389700001501409700001401424773008401438856008501522990002301607852000901630655001201639IND60105696320221120212607.0141108e20120322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010569632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yang10aSynthesis of novel narrow-band-gap copolymers based on [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole and their application in bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices  ap. 1465-1472.  aTwo novel conjugated alternating copolymers with [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole as acceptor and 9,9-dioctylfluorene or N-9’-heptadecanyl-carbazole as donors respectively, were synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation.

The arrangement of the three [4Feâ4S] clusters corresponds to the arrangement of [FeâS] clusters in the [NiFeSe] hydrogenase of Desulfomicrobium baculatum. Many other hydrogenases contain two [4Feâ4S] clusters and one [3Feâ4S] cluster with a relatively high redox potential, which is located in the central position between a proximal and a distal [4Feâ4S] cluster. We have investigated the role of the central [4Feâ4S] cluster in M.âvoltae with regard to its effect on the enzyme activity and its spectroscopic properties. Using siteâdirected mutagenesis, we constructed a strain in which one cysteine ligand of the central [4Feâ4S] cluster was replaced by proline. The mutant protein was purified, and the [4Feâ4S] to [3Feâ4S] cluster conversion was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. The conversion resulted in an increase in the redox potential of the [3Feâ4S] cluster by about 400âmV. The [NiFe] active site was not affected significantly by the mutation as assessed by the unchanged Ni EPR spectrum. The specific activity of the mutated enzyme did not show any significant differences with the artificial electron acceptor benzyl viologen, but its specific activity with the natural electron acceptor F420 decreased tenfold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfomicrobium baculatum 3aMethanococcus 3aactive sites 3acysteine 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenzyme activity 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3amutants 3anickel 3aproline 3aredox potential 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aKlein, Albrecht0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Nov., v. 267, no. 22 p.6612-6618dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01755.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001600289500001500305520174900320592002802069650001702097650001702114650002802131650001502159650002102174650002102195650001502216653001402231700002402245700002102269773009802290856008102388990002302469852000902492655001202501IND60108544420221117034043.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacam, Eric R.10aEffect of La₂CuO₄ electrode area on potentiometric NOₓ sensor response and its implications on sensing mechanism  ap. 304-312.  a2019-12-04  aThe intent of this work is to look at the effects of varying the La₂CuO₄ electrode area and the asymmetry between the sensing and counter electrode in a solid state potentiometric sensor with respect to NOₓ sensitivity. NO₂ sensitivity was observed at 500–600°C with a maximum sensitivity of ∼22mV/decade [NO₂] observed at 500°C for the sensor with a La₂CuO₄ electrode area of ∼30mm². The relationship between NO₂ sensitivity and area is nearly parabolic at 500°C, decreases linearly with increasing electrode area at 600°C, and was a mixture of parabolic and linear behavior 550°C. NO sensitivity varied non-linearly with electrode area with a minima (maximum sensitivity) of ∼−22mV/decade [NO] at 450°C for the sensor with a La₂CuO₄ electrode area of 16mm². The behavior at 400°C was similar to that of 450°C, but with smaller sensitivities due to a saturation effect. At 500°C, NO sensitivity decreases linearly with area. We also used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to investigate the electrochemical processes that are affected when the sensing electrode area is changed. Changes in impedance with exposure to NOₓ were attributed to either changes in La₂CuO₄ conductivity due to gas adsorption (high frequency impedance) or electrocatalysis occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface (total electrode impedance). NO₂ caused a decrease in high frequency impedance while NO caused an increase. In contrast, NO₂ and NO both caused a decrease in the total electrode impedance. The effect of area on both the potentiometric and impedance responses show relationships that can be explained through the mechanistic contributions included in differential electrode equilibria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3anitric oxide 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3anitrogen dioxide 3aadsorption 0aimpedance1 aBlackburn, Bryan M.1 aWachsman, E.

In present paper, by considering the inertial effect and the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, a theoretical model was established for calculating the collision frequency between the nanoparticles and the solid surface in a laminar cylindrical liquid jet impacting normally on the solid surface. The analysis showed that the collision frequency grows as the square root of the impacting speed for low impacting speed regime in which the Brownian motion is predominant, whereas increases as the second power of the impacting speed for high impacting speed regime in which the inertial effect is predominant. Meanwhile, an observation system for nanoparticle–wall collisions in a laminar cylindrical liquid jet has been developed. The adsorption of the nanoparticles on the solid surface after collision has also been observed. Because of their lower attractive energy with the solid surface, these adsorbed nanoparticles are easier to be removed by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. YX2011-9), the Beijing Forestry University Young Scientist Fund (Grant No. 2010BLX08), the hydrodynamic force of the impacting liquid than that deposited on a dry surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aforestry 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ascientists 3auniversities 3aChina1 aLuo, Jianbin1 aGuo, Dan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 July 15, v. 359, no. 2 p.334-338dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019000173300001600363520169700379592002802076650002302104650005602127650003102183650001402214650003802228650001002266650001302276650002102289650001102310650000902321650001002330650001602340650001302356650001202369650001202381651001802393653002302411653001202434653003702446653001002483653001002493653001602503700002102519700002502540700003302565700002902598700002102627700001402648700002002662700001602682700002302698773009602721856008602817852000902903655001202912IND60111258420221119122940.0190319e20130107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpriessnig, Tanja12aA PCV2 vaccine based on genotype 2b is more effective than a 2a-based vaccine to protect against PCV2b or combined PCV2a/2b viremia in pigs with concurrent PCV2, PRRSV and PPV infection  ap. 487-494.  aThe predominant genotype of porcine circovirus (PCV) in the pig population today is PCV2b yet PCV2a-based commercial vaccines are considered effective in protecting against porcine circovirus associated disease. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of PCV2a- and PCV2b-based vaccines to control PCV2b viremia in a challenge model that mimics the U.S. field situation. Sixty-three pigs were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. Sixteen pigs were vaccinated with an experimental live-attenuated chimeric PCV1-2a vaccine based on genotype 2a and another 16 pigs with a chimeric PCV1-2b vaccine based on genotype 2b. Challenge was done 28 days post vaccination (dpv) using PCV2b (or a combination of PCV2a and PCV2b), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine parvovirus (PPV) to mimic what commonly occurs in the field. The experiment was terminated 21 days post challenge (dpc) or 49dpv. Pigs vaccinated with the chimeric PCV1-2b vaccine had significantly higher levels of PCV1-2b viremia and shedding of the PCV1-2b vaccine virus in feces and nasal secretions but also a more robust humoral immune response as evidenced by significantly higher ELISA S/P ratios compared to the PCV1-2a vaccination. Regardless of challenge, the PCV1-2b vaccination significantly reduced the prevalence and amount of PCV2 viremia compared to the PCV1-2a vaccination. Interestingly, in the non-vaccinated pigs concurrent PCV2a infection resulted in clinical disease and increased macroscopic lung lesions compared to pigs challenged with PCV2b alone, further supporting the idea that concurrent PCV2a/PCV2b infection is necessary for optimal PCV2 replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine circovirus 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aUngulate protoparvovirus 1 3achimerism 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3agenotype 3ahumoral immunity 3amodels 3anose 3aswine 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviremia 3aviruses 3aUnited States 0aExperimental model 0aVaccine 0aPorcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) 0aPCV2a 0aPCV2b 0aVaccination1 aO’Neill, Kevin1 aGerber, Priscilla F.1 ade Castro, Alessandra M.M.G.1 aGimenéz-Lirola, Luis G.1 aBeach, Nathan M.1 aZhou, Lei1 aMeng, Xiang-Jin1 aWang, Chong1 aHalbur, Patrick G.0 tVaccine.g2013 Jan. 07, v. 31, no. 3 p.487-494dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01947naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100001400195245006800209300001600277520091800293592002801211650001401239650001201253650003101265650002201296700001801318700002101336700001501357773011701372856008801489990002301577852000901600655001201609IND60107293220221120165533.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010729322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.0042doi7 aPMC39535602pmcid7 a227961692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLongo, G.10aIs information a proper observable for biological organization?  ap. 108-114.  aIn the last century, jointly with the advent of computers, mathematical theories of information were developed. Shortly thereafter, during the ascent of molecular biology, the concept of information was rapidly transferred into biology at large. Several philosophers and biologists have argued against adopting this concept based on epistemological and ontological arguments, and also, because it encouraged genetic determinism. While the theories of elaboration and transmission of information are valid mathematical theories, their own logic and implicit causal structure make them inimical to biology, and because of it, their applications have and are hindering the development of a sound theory of organisms. Our analysis concentrates on the development of information theories in mathematics and on the differences between these theories regarding the relationship among complexity, information and entropy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aentropy 3amathematics and statistics 3amolecular biology1 aMiquel, P.-A.1 aSonnenschein, C.1 aSoto, A.M.0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2012 Aug., v. 109, no. 3 p.108-114dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001800189245009000207300001400297520183000311592002802141650001902169650001802188650001402206650001402220650002802234650001202262650001702274650002402291650001702315650001302332650003902345650001902384650003502403650006502438650001102503650001902514650005902533650002002592650002202612650006602634650002902700650002302729700001702752700002202769700002102791700002202812700002002834700001602854773009602870856008202966990002303048852000903071655001203080IND60107475220221121235438.0141108e20130407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010747522DNAL7 a232283632pmid7 aPMC36460712pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarber, Jared12aA three-dimensional mathematical and computational model of necrotizing enterocolitis  ap. 17-32.  aNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe disease that affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of premature infants. Different areas of NEC research have often been isolated from one another and progress on the role of the inflammatory response in NEC, on the dynamics of epithelial layer healing, and on the positive effects of breast feeding have not been synthesized to produce a more integrated understanding of the pathogenesis of NEC. We seek to synthesize these areas of research by creating a mathematical model that incorporates the current knowledge on these aspects. Unlike previous models that are based on ordinary differential equations, our mathematical model takes into account not only transient effects but also spatial effects. A system of nonlinear transient partial differential equations is solved numerically using cell-centered finite differences and an explicit Euler method. The model is used to track the evolution of a prescribed initial injured area in the intestinal wall. It is able to produce pathophysiologically realistic results; decreasing the initial severity of the injury in the system and introducing breast feeding to the system both lead to healthier overall simulations, and only a small fraction of epithelial injuries lead to full-blown NEC. In addition, in the model, changing the initial shape of the injured area can significantly alter the overall outcome of a simulation. This finding suggests that taking into account spatial effects may be important in assessing the outcome for a given NEC patient. This model can provide a platform with which to test competing hypotheses regarding pathological mechanisms of inflammation in NEC, suggest experimental approaches by which to clarify pathogenic drivers of NEC, and may be used to derive potential intervention strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3aenterocolitis 3aequations 3aevolution 3agastrointestinal system 3ainfants 3ainflammation 3amathematical models 3apathogenesis 3apatients 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aBreast Feeding 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aEnterocolitis, Necrotizingxetiologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aHumans 2aInfant Formula 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Premature 2aInfant, Premature, Diseasesxetiologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aModels, Biological1 aTronzo, Mark1 aHarold Horvat, C.1 aClermont, Gilles1 aUpperman, Jeffrey1 aVodovotz, Yoram1 aYotov, Ivan0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Apr. 7, v. 322 p.17-32dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.11.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012600169300001400295520141300309592002801722650002501750650001501775650001601790650002001806700002101826700002801847700001901875700001601894773010001910856008102010990002302091852000902114655001202123IND60108458920221122160205.0141108e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010845892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2013.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazghaleh, Mohsen12aA novel digital charge-based displacement estimator for sensorless control of a grounded-load piezoelectric tube actuator  ap. 91-98.  aPiezoelectric tube actuators are widely used in nanopositioning applications, especially in scanning probe microscopes to manipulate matter at nanometer scale. Accurate displacement control of these actuators is critical, and in order to avoid the expense and practical limits of highly accurate displacement sensors, sensorless control has recently attracted much attention. As the electrical charge on these actuators is an accurate indicator of their displacement exhibiting almost no hysteresis over a wide range of frequencies, it suggests that charge measurement can replace displacement sensors. However, charge-based methods suffer from poor low frequency response and voltage drop across the sensing capacitor. In this paper, a displacement estimator is presented that complements a digitally implemented charge amplifier with an artificial neural network (ANN) designed and trained to estimate the piezoelectric tube's displacement using the piezoelectric voltage at low frequencies of excitation where the charge methods fail. A complementary filter combines the grounded-load digital charge amplifier (GDCDE) and the ANN to estimate displacement over a wide bandwidth and to overcome drift. The discrepancy between the desired and estimated displacement is fed back to the piezoelectric actuator using proportional control. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical equipment 3ahysteresis 3amicroscopes 3aneural networks1 aGrainger, Steven1 aMohammadzaheri, Morteza1 aCazzolato, Ben1 aLu, Tien-Fu0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

This study reports for the first time that rearrangement of the peptide and/or tunnel occurs in distinct regions of the tunnel and is directed by the unique primary sequence of each nascent peptide. In the tunnel mid-region, the accessibility of an introduced cysteine to a series of novel hydrophilic maleimide reagents increases with increasing volume of the adjacent chain residue, a sensitivity not manifest at the constriction and exit port. This surprising result reveals molecular movements not yet resolvable from structural studies. These findings map solvent-accessible volumes along the tunnel and provide novel insights critical to our understanding of allosteric communication within the ribosomal tunnel, translational arrest, chaperone interaction, folding, and rates of elongation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid sequences 3acysteine 3amolecular chaperones 3apeptides 3aprotein folding 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics) 2aCysteinexmetabolism 2aPeptide Chain Elongation, Translational 2aPeptidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aRibosomal Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRibosomesxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aHua, Zhengmao1 aKobertz, William R.1 aDeutsch, Carol0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 Aug. 12, v. 411, no. 2 p.499-510dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245020200186300001800388520046700406592002800873650002300901650001200924650001800936650001400954650002200968700003300990700002501023773009701048856008401145852000901229655001201238IND60109784320221120042412.0141109e20110713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010978432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLingam, Kandapalam Arun Prasath12aA novel MgI₂ mediated unusual dimerization–spirocyclopropanation of bromo isomerised Morita–Baylis–Hillman adduct of isatin: a facile synthesis of 3-spirocyclopropane-2-oxindole derivatives  ap. 3610-3613.  aA novel magnesium iodide mediated unusual dimerization–spirocyclopropanation of bromo isomerised Morita–Baylis–Hillman adducts of isatin afforded highly functionalized 3-spirocyclopropane-2-oxindole derivatives as regioisomers in good combined yield.

Well designed processing equipment requires an understanding of how a suspension’s rheology changes with increasing solid concentration and shear rate. Current rheological models applied to coal fly ash are insufficient to describe rheology behaviour over a wide range of concentrations. The current paper analyses the flow curves of two types of coal fly ash differing in particle size, shape, and distribution over a range 10–70wt.%. It has been shown that both samples exhibit complex non-Newtonian behaviour including shear thinning and shear thickening. A new generalised modelling procedure has been proposed to predict the viscosity behaviour of solid suspensions. The resulting model was able to predict the relative viscosity as a function of both concentration and shear rate with a high degree of accuracy. It is envisaged that this will be extremely useful for the purpose of processing equipment design involving mixing operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal fly ash 3aequipment design 3amixing 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3aprocessing equipment 3araw materials 3arheology 3aslurries 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aRowson, N.A.0 tFuel.g2013 Sept., v. 111 p.555-563dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012600163300001600289520164100305592002801946650003501974650002102009650001802030650001702048650002002065650001602085650003502101650002602136650000902162650001202171650002102183650001802204650002002222650002202242650005202264650002902316700001502345700001302360700001602373700001502389700001602404773010702420856008302527990002302610852000902633655001202642IND60104803920221116210105.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010480392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Lihua10aMechanisms regulating superoxide generation in experimental models of phenylketonuria: An essential role of NADPH oxidase  ap. 241-248.  aThis study was designed to investigate whether nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, a superoxide-producing enzyme, could be involved in phenylketonuria (PKU)-associated oxidative stress. A Pahᵉⁿᵘ²-BTBR PKU mouse model, and an in vitro cell culture model of PKU mimicking high phenylalanine insults in PKU, were employed for this study. The concentration of phenylalanine in mouse cerebral cortex was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Superoxide production was displayed with dihydroethidium staining. NADPH oxidase expression level was measured by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. NADPH oxidase activity was measured by the colorimetric method. The phenylalanine concentrations in cerebral cortices of PKU mice were significantly higher than those in wild-type control mice. Similar results concerning superoxide production and NADPH oxidase protein expression and activity, were also found in this brain region. In addition, it was found that cerebral cortical neurons subjected to an in vitro high phenylalanine insult, displayed increased superoxide production accompanied by increases of NADPH oxidase protein expression and activity. Pretreatment with the inhibitor of this oxidase (diphenylene iodonium or apocynin) prevented this superoxide-increasing effect. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that NADPH oxidase might be a key enzyme involved in enhanced superoxide production in PKU and suggest that it may be a potential therapeutic target in neuroprotective strategies against phenylalanine-evoked oxidative brain injury in PKU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3acell culture 3acerebral cortex 3acolorimetry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylketonuria 3aprotein synthesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aGu, Xuefan1 aLi, Duan1 aLiang, Lili1 aZhao, Zhen1 aGao, Jialin0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2011 Nov., v. 104, no. 3 p.241-248dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.05.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01591naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013900165300001600304520062800320592002800948650001100976650002100987650001501008650001701023650001501040700002301055773009801078856008101176990002301257852000901280655001201289IND60108544620221117033739.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumaravel, A.10aElectrochemical determination of imidacloprid using nanosilver Nafion®/nanoTiO₂ Nafion® composite modified glassy carbon electrode  ap. 319-326.  aA novel biocompatible environment friendly nanosilver Nafion®/nanoTiO₂ Nafion® modified glassy carbon electrode was prepared by a simple procedure and characterized.

METHODS: In our cross-sectional study, we included women attending health facilities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East that dealt with at least 1000 childbirths per year and had the capacity to provide caesarean section. We obtained data from analysis of hospital records for all women giving birth and all women who had a severe maternal outcome (SMO; ie, maternal death or maternal near miss). We regarded coverage of key maternal health interventions as the proportion of the target population who received an indicated intervention (eg, the proportion of women with eclampsia who received magnesium sulphate). We used areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUROC) with 95% CI to externally validate a previously reported MSI as an indicator of severity. We assessed the overall performance of care (ie, the ability to produce a positive effect on health outcomes) through standardised mortality ratios. RESULTS: From May 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2011, we included 314 623 women attending 357 health facilities in 29 countries (2538 had a maternal near miss and 486 maternal deaths occurred). The mean period of data collection in each health facility was 89 days (SD 21). 23 015 (7·3%) women had potentially life-threatening disorders and 3024 (1·0%) developed an SMO. 808 (26·7%) women with an SMO had post-partum haemorrhage and 784 (25·9%) had pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and coagulation dysfunctions were the most frequent organ dysfunctions in women who had an SMO. Reported mortality in countries with a high or very high maternal mortality ratio was two-to-three-times higher than that expected for the assessed severity despite a high coverage of essential interventions. The MSI had good accuracy for maternal death prediction in women with markers of organ dysfunction (AUROC 0·826 [95% CI 0·802–0·851]). INTERPRETATION: High coverage of essential interventions did not imply reduced maternal mortality in the health-care facilities we studied. If substantial reductions in maternal mortality are to be achieved, universal coverage of life-saving interventions need to be matched with comprehensive emergency care and overall improvements in the quality of maternal health care. The MSI could be used to assess the performance of health facilities providing care to women with complications related to pregnancy.

The use of isotope labelling techniques, feeding ¹⁴NO during the storage period and ¹⁵NO during regeneration allows us to propose three different routes for nitrogen formation based on the different masses detected during regeneration, i.e. ¹⁴N₂ (m/e=28), ¹⁴N¹⁵N (m/e=29) and ¹⁵N₂ (m/e=30). It is proposed that the formation of nitrogen via Route 1 involves the reaction between hydrogen and ¹⁴NOₓ released from the storage component to form ¹⁴NH₃ mainly. Then, ammonia further reacts with ¹⁴NOₓ located downstream to form ¹⁴N₂. In Route 2, it is postulated that the incoming ¹⁵NO reacts with hydrogen to form ¹⁵NH₃ in the reactor zone where the trap has been already regenerated. This isotopically labelled ammonia travels through the catalyst bed until it reaches the regeneration front where it participates in the reduction of stored nitrates (¹⁴NOₓ) to form ¹⁴N¹⁵N. The formation of ¹⁵N₂ via Route 3 is believed to occur by the reaction between incoming ¹⁵NO and H₂. The modification of the hydrogen concentration fed during regeneration affects the relative importance of H₂ or ¹⁵NH₃ as reductants and thus the production of ¹⁴N₂ via Route 1 and ¹⁴N¹⁵N via Route 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3aisotope labeling 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3areducing agents 3astable isotopes 3astorage time1 aGonzález-Velasco, Juan R.1 aBurch, Robbie1 aHardacre, Christopher1 aChansai, Sarayute0 tJournal of catalysis.g2012 Jan., v. 285, no. 1 p.177-186dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01446naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011400174300001800288520038800306592002800694650001100722650002300733650001400756650001800770650001800788700001800806700002300824700002500847700003000872700002800902773008800930856008101018852000901099655001201108IND60109394920221120042249.0141109e20110805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010939492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.05.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheodōrou, Vasilikē,10aSynthesis of β,γ-unsaturated primary amides from α,β-unsaturated acids and investigation of the mechanism  ap. 5630-5634.  aα,β-Unsaturated acids, through their acid chlorides, react with tritylamine in the presence of triethylamine under mild conditions, to afford in high yield and high regioselectivity the corresponding β,γ-unsaturated tritylamides.

The assay principle is based on catalytic hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine into thiocholine by acetylcholinesterase, which induces the aggregation of Au nanoparticles and the color change from claret-red to purple or even grey. The original plasmon absorption of Au nanoparticles at 522nm decreases, and simultaneously, a new absorption band appears at 675nm. The irreversible inhibition of organophosphorus pesticides on acetylcholinesterase prevents aggregation of Au nanoparticles. Under optimum conditions, the absorbance at 522nm of Au nanoparticles is related linearly to the concentration of mathamidophos in the range of 0.02–1.42μg/mL with a detection limit of 1.40ng/mL. This colorimetric method has been successfully utilized to detect mathamidophos in vegetables with satisfactory results. The proposed colorimetric assay exhibits good reproducibility and accuracy, providing a simple and rapid method for the analysis of organophosphorus pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3afood contamination 3agold 3ahydrolysis 3ainsecticide residues 3ananogold 3aorganophosphorus pesticides 3arapid methods 3avegetables1 aGuo, Jiajia1 aPing, Hong1 aLiu, Lurui1 aZhang, Minwei1 aGuan, Fengrui1 aSun, Chunyan1 aZhang, Qian0 tTalanta.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 87 p.93-99dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.09.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001600282520164300298592002801941650001801969650001401987650001902001700001802020700001902038700001802057700002402075700001902099700002202118773009802140856008102238990002302319852000902342655001202351IND60108544820221117033722.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyer, James E.10aAnalyte selective response in solution-deposited tetrabenzoporphyrin thin-film field-effect transistor sensors  ap. 333-339.  aOrganic thin film transistor (OTFT) chemical sensors rely on the specific electronic structure of the organic semiconductor (OSC) film for determining sensor stability and response to analytes. The delocalized electronic structure is influenced not only by the OSC molecular structure, but also the solid state packing and film morphology. Phthalocyanine (H₂Pc) and tetrabenzoporphyrin (H₂TBP) have similar molecular structures but different film microstructures when H₂Pc is vacuum deposited and H₂TBP is solution deposited. The difference in electronic structures is evidenced by the different mobilities of H₂TBP and H₂Pc OTFTs. H₂Pc has a maximum mobility of 8.6×10⁻⁴cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹ when the substrate is held at 250°C during deposition and a mobility of 4.8×10⁻⁵cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹ when the substrate is held at 25°C during deposition. Solution deposited H₂TBP films have a mobility of 5.3×10⁻³cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹, which is consistent with better long-range order and intermolecular coupling within the H₂TBP films compared to the H₂Pc films. Solution deposited H₂TBP also exhibits a textured film morphology with large grains and an RMS roughness 3–5 times larger than H₂Pc films with similar thicknesses. Despite these differences, OTFT sensors fabricated from H₂TBP and H₂Pc exhibit nearly identical analyte sensitivity and analyte response kinetics. The results suggest that while the interactions between molecules in the solid state determine conductivity, localized interactions between the analyte and the molecular binding site dominate analyte binding and determine sensor response.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3aroughness 3asemiconductors1 aLee, Sangyeob1 aChen, Charlene1 aAhn, Byungmin1 aTrogler, William C.1 aKanicki, Jerzy1 aKummel, Andrew C.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 158, no. 1 p.333-339dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008600166300001600252520108100268592002801349650002001377650002201397650001401419650001501433700001801448700001501466700002001481773010301501856008501604990002301689852000901712655001201721IND60101661720221122134643.0141106e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010166172DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60304-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yalin,10aMotion of tracer particles in a centrifugal pump and its tracking characteristics  ap. 785-793.  aThe Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen (BBO) equation can be used for most flows to trace the motion of a particle, but in a centrifugal pump, among the forces that act on the particles, one should also include those due to the impeller rotation, as additional effects. This paper firstly reviews various approximations of the BBO equation for the motion of dispersion particles in a viscous fluid. Then based on the motion equation for particles in low Reynolds number centrifugal pumps, a formula for calculating the tracking characteristics of tracer particles is deduced through the Fourier integral transformation. After that the deviations of the particle motion from the fluid motion, as predicted by the various approximations, are discussed and compared. At last, with an emphasis on the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) results, the tracking characteristics of particles are estimated. Also, advantages and disadvantages of different tracer particles are discussed and suitable tracer particles for application in PIV studies for flow fields in centrifugal pumps are suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3acentrifugal pumps 3aequations 3amonitoring1 aYUAN, Shou-qi1 aTang, Yue,1 aYUAN, Jian-ping0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2012 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.785-793dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60304-13Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016000168300001400328520129600342592002801638650001601666650002501682650002201707650004601729650004401775650001401819700001901833700001901852700002201871700001901893773009901912856008602011990002302097852000902120655001202129IND60102513820221121003650.0141106e20131125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010251382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSethi, Arun10aOne pot synthesis of biologically active pregnane derivatives, their single crystal structures, spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations  ap. 76-84.  aOne pot allylic oxidation of 3β-acetoxypregna-5,16-diene-20-one (2) and nucleophilic addition at C-16 position of 3β-hydroxypregna-5,16-diene-20-one (3) yielded 3β-acetoxypregna-5,16-diene-7,20-dione (4) and 3β-hydroxy-16α-(5′-hydroxypentyloxy)-pregn-5-ene-20-one (5) respectively in high yield.

Cement kiln dust (CKD) is one of such industrial waste or by product which is progressively significant environmental concern related to its emission and disposal. CKD is fine grained, solid, highly alkaline particulate material chiefly composed of oxidized, anhydrous, micron-sized particles collected from electrostatic precipitators during the production of cement clinker. Cement kiln dust so generated is partly reused in cement plants and landfilled. Due to lack of landfilling space and ever increasing disposal cost, utilization of CKD in highway uses, waste treatment, soil stabilization, cement mortar/concrete, CLSM, etc. has become an attractive alternative to its disposal. The leachate obtained from cement kiln dust may contain hazardous compounds and its caustic nature poses harmful effects to the environment. So, it is essential to know the characteristics of leachate obtained from CKD for beneficial utilization towards solid waste management. Several studies have shown that CKD could be used in making cement paste/mortar/concrete. This paper presents the overview of some of the research published on the beneficial use of CKD in construction materials, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and CKD leachate characteristics. Effect of CKD on the cement paste/mortar/concrete properties like compressive strength, tensile strength, durability, hydration, electrical conductivity, etc. and leachate test methods and leachate characteristics of cement kiln dust is also discussed in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3adurability 3aelectrical conductivity 3aemissions 3aglobalization 3aindustrial wastes 3arecycling 3asoil stabilization 3asolid wastes 3atensile strength 3atoxic substances 3awaste treatment1 aSiddique, Rafat1 aRajor, Anita0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2012 Apr., v. 61 p.59-68dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008100166300001200247520092500259592002801184650002101212650001801233650001401251650001001265650001101275650002001286650002201306650000901328650002201337700001601359700001701375700001401392773010401406856008101510990002301591852000901614655001201623IND60107639220221120105059.0141108e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010763922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2012.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhizhong10aConstruction and characterization of bifunctional TIM-3-EGFP fusion proteins  ap. 1-6.  aT cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) is the first surface molecule to be found that specifically identifies Th1 cells in both mice and humans, and it negatively regulates Th1 responses. TIM-3 protein is a type I membrane protein. Overexpression of membrane proteins is a major problem to overcome in studies of membrane protein structure and function. In this study, a fusion between the gene encoding human TIM-3 and EGFP was successfully constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. To our knowledge, this is the first time that human TIM-3 has been overexpressed in E. coli. We showed that the TIM-3-EGFP fusion protein mediates the recognition and binding of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interactions of TIM-3-EGFP with apoptotic cells were blocked by TIM-3-Ig fusion proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that the human TIM-3 protein may act as a receptor for apoptotic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aT-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3amembrane proteins 3amice 3aprotein structure1 aQing, Jilin1 aQin, Guifang1 aHu, Lihua0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 Nov., v. 86, no. 1 p.1-6dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2012.08.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01615naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150242012000166245008300286300001800369520050800387592002800895650002600923650001600949650001300965650001000978650001300988650001301001650003701014700001701051773009301068856008401161990002301245852000901268655001201277IND60105383920221121040617.0141108e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6010538392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2009.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrër, A.10aKlebsiella pneumoniae CTX-M-15 : vers une modification de l’épidémiologie des ß-lactamases à spectre étendu10aCTX-M-15-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae: A change in the epidemiology of ESBL  ap. e133-e135.  aKlebsiella pneumoniae is frequently involved in nosocomial outbreaks worldwide.

The effects of ejection and sweep events on the transport of fluid particles are analyzed separately through a quadrant technique. By analyzing trajectories of the particles released at different wall-normal locations, it is found that the particles from the ejection events mainly move upward while the particles from the sweep events move downward of the flow during short and intermediate diffusion time durations. Numerical results show that the effects of the ejection and sweep events on the mean displacement and the mean square dispersion remain for a long time, one-order of magnitude larger than the streamwise Lagrangian integral scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamic dispersion 3amathematical models 3aturbulent flow 3awater flow 3awaterways1 aLU, Zhi-ming1 aQiu, Xiang,1 aLI, Dong-mei1 aLIU, Yu-lu0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2012 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.794-799dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60305-33Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015800166300001800324520064300342592002800985650001101013650002001024650001301044650001401057700001301071700001701084700001601101700001401117700001501131773008301146856008501229990002301314852000901337655001201346IND60105696820221120095333.0141108e20120403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010569682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yuzhi10aMorphosynthesis of nanostructured polyazomethines and carbon through constitutional dynamic chemistry controlled reaction induced crystallization process  ap. 1611-1616.  aHere, we present a novel constitutional dynamic chemistry controlled reaction induced crystallization strategy for the morphological controlling of aromatic polyazomethines.

We conducted medically supervised fasts in 5 children homozygous for the c.1436C→T variant. Plasma free fatty acids increased normally in these children but their long-chain acylcarnitine and ketone production was significantly blunted.

During recent years, supplier selection process in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. With the growing worldwide awareness of environmental protection and the corresponding increase in legislation and regulations, green purchasing has become an important issue for companies to gain environmental sustainability. Traditionally, companies consider criteria such as price, quality and lead time, when evaluating supplier performance and do not give enough attention to environmental criteria as a means to evaluate suppliers. Now, many companies have begun to implement green supply chain management (GSCM) and to consider environmental issues and the measurement of their suppliers’ environmental performance. This paper examines GSCM to propose a fuzzy multi criteria approach for green suppliers’ evaluation. We apply fuzzy set theory to translate the subjective human perceptions into a solid crisp value. These linguistic preferences are combined through fuzzy TOPSIS to generate an overall performance score for each supplier. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental protection 3aenvironmentally preferable purchasing 3ahumans 3alaws and regulations 3aprices 3arecycling 3asupply chain 0aSupplier selection 0aEnvironmental performance 0aGreen supply chain management 0aFuzzy set theory 0aTOPSIS1 aOlfat, Laya1 aGovindan, Kannan1 aKhodaverdi, Roohollah1 aDiabat, Ali0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 May, v. 74 p.170-179dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2012.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245010500177300001500282520158400297592002801881650002101909650001601930650002701946650001501973650001401988650001102002650002102013700003002034773011602064856008802180990002302268852000902291655001202300IND60107293620221120160121.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010729362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Anthony M.10aPerspectives on the structure–function of ABC transporters: The Switch and Constant Contact Models  ap. 95-107.  aABC transporters constitute one of the largest protein families across the kingdoms of archaea, eubacteria and eukarya. They couple ATP hydrolysis to vectorial translocation of diverse substrates across membranes. The ABC transporter architecture comprises two transmembrane domains and two cytosolic ATP-binding cassettes. During 2002–2012, nine prokaryotic ABC transporter structures and two eukaryotic structures have been solved to medium resolution. Despite a wealth of biochemical, biophysical, and structural data, fundamental questions remain regarding the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to unidirectional substrate translocation, and the mechanistic suite of steps involved. The mechanics of the ATP cassette dimer is defined most popularly by the ‘Switch Model’, which proposes that hydrolysis in each protomer is sequential, and that as the sites are freed of nucleotide, the protomers lose contact across a large solvent-filled gap of 20–30 Å; as captured in several X-ray solved structures. Our ‘Constant Contact’ model for the operational mechanics of ATP binding and hydrolysis in the ATP-binding cassettes is derived from the ‘alternating sites’ model, proposed in 1995, and which requires an intrinsic asymmetry in the ATP sites, but does not require the partner protomers to lose contact. Thus one of the most debated issues regarding the function of ABC transporters is whether the cooperative mechanics of ATP hydrolysis requires the ATP cassettes to separate or remain in constant contact and this dilemma is discussed at length in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aX-radiation 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ahydrolysis 3amechanics 3amodels 3aprotein subunits1 aJones, Peterq(Peter M.),0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2012 Aug., v. 109, no. 3 p.95-107dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009500170300001800265520059100283592002800874650002800902650001100930650002300941650001100964650001200975650001400987650001101001653001401012653001201026653002601038653004801064653003001112653001401142700001501156700001901171700001701190700001801207773008901225856008401314852000901398655001201407IND60110176620221120214915.0161019e20131106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011017662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.08.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao-Bing10aNovel ring A rearranged isomers with γ-lactone from the fruits of Aphanamixis grandifolia  ap. 6023-6028.  aAphagranols A (1) and B (2), a pair of isomers with a novel limonoid carbon skeleton, were isolated from the fruits of Aphanamixis grandifolia.

Because it now seems likely that rural planning policy in England will, in some measure, be reconstructed from the bottom-up, prioritising local control, an analysis of residents' perspectives gives some insight into the shape of future policy intervention. The research reveals a highly nuanced understanding of affordability and the development needs of villages. Sometimes local views â particularly those of commuting or retired households â are dismissed as being motivated by NIMBYism. But this is a partial truth, with rural residents displaying reflective dissatisfaction with official perspectives on rural housing problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3arural housing 3arural planning 3avillages 3aEngland1 aRobinson, Steve0 tJournal of rural studies.g2011 July, v. 27, no. 3 p.297-307dElsevier Ltdx0743-01677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2011.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169300001600264520133100280592002801611650001801639650002401657650001601681650000901697700001901706700001801725773010301743856008501846990002301931852000901954655001201963IND60101661920221122183958.0141106e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010166192DNAL7 a10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60288-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, Wen-hua10aHydrodynamic interaction between FLNG vessel and LNG carrier in side by side configuration  ap. 648-657.  aThe Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) is a new type of floating platform for the exploitation of stranded offshore oil/gas fields. The side by side configuration for the FLNG vessel and the LNG carrier arranged in parallel is one of the possible choices for the LNG offloading. During the offloading operations, the multiple floating bodies would have very complex responses due to their hydrodynamic interactions. In this study, numerical simulations of multiple floating bodies in close proximity in the side by side offloading configuration are carried out with the time domain coupled analysis code SIMO. Hydrodynamic interactions between the floating bodies and the mechanical coupling effects between the floating bodies and their connection systems are included in the coupled analysis model. To clarify the hydrodynamic effects of the two vessels, numerical simulations under the same environmental condition are also conducted without considering the hydrodynamic interactions, for comparison. It is shown that the hydrodynamic interactions play an important role in the low frequency motion responses of the two vessels, but have little effect on the wave frequency motion responses. In addition, the comparison results also show that the hydrodynamic interactions can affect the loads on the connection systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3anatural gas 3aoils1 aYANG, Jian-min1 aHU, Zhi-qiang0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2012 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.648-657dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60288-63Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009100166300001600257520130700273592002801580650004401608650002201652650001501674650001501689650002201704650001401726650001701740650000701757650002301764650001601787650002001803700001201823700001801835700001401853700001201867700001801879700001301897773011701910856008202027852000902109655001202118IND60100699020221119211156.0141105e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010069902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Xiaodong10aAdsorption of benzoic acid from aqueous solution by three kinds of modified bentonites  ap. 499-504.  aBenzoic acid removal is important for the water treatment, and adsorption is an efficient treatment process. Three kinds of modified bentonites, hydroxy-aluminum pillared bentonite (Al(OH)-Bent), octadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride modified bentonite (OTMAC-Bent), and both octadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and hydroxy-aluminum modified bentonite (Al(OH)-OTMAC-Bent) were prepared and characterized by XRD, FTIR, and BET analysis. Experiments were conducted on the adsorption of benzoic acid by the prepared modified bentonites at different temperatures in batch experiments. The results show benzoic acid adsorption capabilities of Na-Bent and Al(OH)-Bent are even low, but high for OTMAC-Bent and Al(OH)-OTMAC-Bent. Optimal conditions for the adsorption of benzoic acid on OTMAC-Bent and Al(OH)-OTMAC-Bent were as follows: pH of 3.5, 0.04g/mL adsorbent, and contact time of 90min. Increased adsorption with temperature indicates that the adsorptions of benzoic acid onto Al(OH)-OTMAC-Bent and OTMAC-Bent are spontaneous and endothermic. The adsorption data could be well interpreted by the Langmuir model and Temkin Equation. The adsorption efficiency was higher than 85%, suggesting that OTMAC-Bent and Al(OH)-OTMAC-Bent are excellent adsorbents for effective benzoic acid removal from water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abentonite 3abenzoic acid 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awater treatment1 aSi, Wei1 aYao, Zhenxing1 aFeng, Rui1 aDu, Bin1 aYan, Liangguo1 aWei, Qin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 July 15, v. 359, no. 2 p.499-504dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245010500208300001600313506007600329520096000405592002801365506003701393650003201430650001201462650002201474650001001496650001001506650001801516650002001534650001001554650001201564650002001576650001501596650001201611650001301623650001401636650001301650700002401663700002401687700002101711700003001732700002601762700002301788773011001811856008301921852000902004655001202013IND60101253120221207065302.0141106e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010125312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2010.11.0122doi7 aPMC71722132pmcid7 a212088172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecaro, Nicola10aCanine parvovirus type 2c infection in a kitten associated with intracranial abscess and convulsions  ap. 231-236.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA case of canine parvovirus type 2c (CPV-2c) infection in a 3-month-old feral kitten with a cerebral abscess and neurological disease is reported. The cat displayed ataxia and convulsions together with signs of gastroenteritis and profound alteration of the total and differential white blood cell counts. A parvovirus strain was detected by a TaqMan assay in the blood and faeces of the affected kitten, which was characterised as CPV by means of molecular assays but did not react with any of the CPV type-specific probes. By sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the VP2-protein gene, the CPV-2c strain displayed a non-coding mutation in the probe-binding region. Although the role of CPV-2c in this particular case is unclear, it is possible that it predisposed the kitten to the clinical signs seen. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor future spreading of this CPV-2c mutant, and any associated clinical signs, in the dog and cat population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aabscess 3aataxia (disorder) 3ablood 3afeces 3aferal animals 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3akittens 3aleukocyte count 3amonitoring 3amutants 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3aseizures1 aDesario, Costantina1 aAmorisco, Francesca1 aLosurdo, Michele1 aColaianni, Maria Loredana1 aGreco, Maria Fiorella1 aBuonavoglia, Canio0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2011 Apr., v. 13, no. 4 p.231-236dElsevier Ltdx1098-612X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2010.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009500166300001600261520098600277592002801263650001101291650001301302650001801315650001401333650001201347650001001359650001601369650001601385650001201401650001801413700001601431700001701447773007101464856008201535990002301617852000901640655001201649IND60102856520221119003415.0141106e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010285652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.04.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, J.K.10aSusceptibility of aluminum alloys to corrosion in simulated fuel blends containing ethanol  ap. 592-597.  aThe compatibility of aluminum and aluminum alloys with synthetic fuel blends comprised of ethanol and reference fuel C (a 50/50 mix of toluene and iso-octane) was examined as a function of water content and temperature.

Substantial corrosion was observed only at temperatures exceeding 78°C, the boiling point of ethanol. Pretreatments designed to stabilize passive films on aluminum increased the incubation time for onset of corrosion, suggesting film stability is a significant factor in the mechanism of corrosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aboiling point 3acorrosion 3aethanol 3afuels 3aiso-octanes 3atemperature 3atoluene 3awater content1 aPawel, S.J.1 aWilson, D.F.0 tFuel.g2013 Sept., v. 111 p.592-597dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.04.0473Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008500164300001600249520058600265592002800851650001600879650001700895650003000912650000900942650001200951650000900963700001300972700001900985700001901004700001701023773007701040856008501117852000901202655001201211IND60109232020221119021850.0141109e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010923202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.07.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Lei10aSimultaneous determination of Hg(II) and Zn(II) using a GFP inspired chromophore  ap. 401-404.  aA dual-function chemosensor for Hg²⁺ and Zn²⁺ ions, inspired by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore, was designed and synthesized, which could specifically recognize Zn²⁺ through an “OFF–ON” fluorescence mechanism due to the restriction of the free rotation of the aryl–alkene bond, whilst also producing a selective visible colorimetric response from yellow to pink with Hg²⁺ ions.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the respiratory and allergic phenotypes of children followed in the Pollution and Asthma Risk: An Infant Study (PARIS) birth cohort. METHODS: Information on respiratory and allergic disorders, medical visits, and medications was collected during medical examinations of children at 18 months of age; biomarker data were also collected (total and allergen-specific IgE levels and eosinophilia). Phenotypes were determined by using latent class analysis. Associated risk factors were determined based on answers to questionnaires about environmental exposures. RESULTS: Apart from a reference group, which had a low prevalence of respiratory symptoms or allergies (n = 1271 [69.4%]), 3 phenotypes were identified. On the basis of clinical signs of severity and use of health care resources, we identified a mild phenotype (n = 306 [16.7%]) characterized by occasional mild wheeze and 2 severe phenotypes separated by atopic status. The atopic severe phenotype (n = 59 [3.2%]) included 49 (83%) children with wheezing and was characterized by a high prevalence of atopy (61% with allergenic sensitization) and atopic dermatitis (78%). In contrast, atopy was rare among children with the nonatopic severe phenotype (n = 195 [11%]); this group included 88% of the children with recurrent wheezing. Risk factors for respiratory disease included parental history of asthma, male sex, siblings, day care attendance, exposure to tobacco smoke or molds, indoor renovations, and being overweight, although these factors did not have similar affects on risk for all phenotypes. CONCLUSION: Atopy should be taken into account when assessing the risk of severe exacerbations (that require hospital-based care) in wheezing infants; precautions should be taken against respiratory irritants and molds and to prevent children from becoming overweight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aasthma 3aatopic dermatitis 3abiomarkers 3achildhood 3achildren 3aenvironmental exposure 3aeosinophilia 3ahealth services 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainfants 3amales 3aoverweight 3aphenotype 3apollution 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3asiblings 3asmoking (habit)1 aJust, Jocelyne1 aNikasinovic, Lydia1 aFoucault, Christophe1 aLe Marec, Anne-Marie1 aGiordanella, Jean-Pierre1 aMomas, Isabelle0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Aug., v. 130, no. 2 p.389-396.e4dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.05.0543Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012000169300001600289520124900305592002801554650002401582650001601606650001401622650001601636650001401652650002101666650001801687650001501705650001301720650001601733700002701749700002201776773011601798856008201914852000901996655001202005IND60100814520221122013830.0141105e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010081452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLobaz, Volodymyr10aHighly magnetizable superparamagnetic colloidal aggregates with narrowed size distribution from ferrofluid emulsion  ap. 102-110.  aThe formation of spherical superparamagnetic colloidal aggregates of magnetite nanoparticles by emulsification of a ferrofluid and subsequent solvent evaporation has been systematically studied. The colloidal aggregates occur as a dense sphere with magnetite nanoparticles randomly packed and preserved particle–particle separation due to chemisorbed oleic acid. The voids between nanoparticles are filled with solvent and free oleic acid. The latter was found to influence the formation of colloidal aggregates and their surface properties. The choice of surfactant, whether low molecular weight or polymeric, was shown to lead to the colloidal aggregates having tailored interfacial behavior. Magnetization measurements at ambient temperature revealed that the magnetite colloidal aggregates preserve the superparamagnetic properties of the starting nanoparticle units and show high saturation magnetization values up to 57emu/g. The size distribution of magnetite nanoparticle colloidal aggregates produced by such an approach was found to be a function of emulsion droplet breakup – coalescence and stabilization kinetics and therefore is influenced by the emulsification process conditions and concentrations of the emulsion compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aevaporation 3amagnetite 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3asolvents 3asurfactants1 aKlupp Taylor, Robin N.1 aPeukert, Wolfgang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 May 15, v. 374, no. 1 p.102-110dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.01.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008700167300001800254520164800272592002801920650001701948650001301965650001701978650001301995650001002008650001902018650001302037650001102050700001602061700002302077773008402100856008502184990002302269852000902292655001202301IND60105782620221121024117.0141108e20130524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010578262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Dean10aRobust amphiphobic coatings from bi-functional silica particles on flat substrates  ap. 3008-3016.  aRobust oil- and water-repellent or amphiphobic particulate coatings were prepared from epoxy glue and bi-functional silica particles bearing poly(2-perfluorooctylethyl methacrylate) (PFOEMA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) coronal chains. To prepare the particles, silica was first co-grafted in a one-pot process by poly[3-(triisopropyloxysilyl)propyl methacrylate]-block-poly(2-perfluorooctylethyl methacrylate) (PIPSMA-b-PFOEMA or P1) and poly[3-(triisopropyloxysilyl)propyl methacrylate]-block-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PIPSMA-b-PtBA or P2). P1 and P2 grafted onto silica because of the sol–gel reactions between the surface silanol groups of silica and the PIPSMA blocks of the two polymers. The sol–gel reactions also occurred between the different PIPSMA blocks of P1 and P2, resulting in a crosslinked anchoring PIPSMA layer. This layer was topped by the PFOEMA and PtBA chains. Cleavage of the tert-butyl groups of the PtBA chains yielded PAA corona chains. The particles bearing both PAA and PFOEMA could be dispersed in trifluorotoluene and sprayed onto an epoxy film that was partially cured on a glass plate to yield a rough particulate coating. The curing of the particles with the glue at 120 °C for 30 min bonded the AA units and the glycidyl groups of the epoxy glue and exposed the low-surface-tension PFOEMA chains. At P1 mass fraction of f₁ ≥ 80% relative to P1 and P2, the coatings were superhydrophobic and repelled diiodomethane strongly. Furthermore, the coatings resisted trifluorotoluene extraction and abrasion tests if the PAA chains existed in sufficient amounts with P2 weight fraction (f₂) ≥ 5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymers 3asilica1 aLiu, Guojun1 aScott Duncan, E.J.0 tPolymer.g2013 May 24, v. 54, no. 12 p.3008-3016dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.03.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007300175300001400248520195100262592002802213650001102241650001902252650001202271650000802283650001102291650001102302650002502313650001102338650001102349650001302360650002202373650001102395650001802406650002202424650000902446651001802455700002002473700002002493700002202513773009402535856008502629990002302714852000902737655001202746IND60101805120221122231306.0141106e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010180512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWåhlström, Iréne10aModelling the CO₂ dynamics in the Laptev Sea, Arctic Ocean: Part I  ap. 29-38.  aGlobal temperature observations during the last century show that the largest increase over the last decades has been manifested in the Arctic, particularly within the Siberian region. The Arctic Ocean is a harsh region with few field studies, resulting in limited temporal and spatial resolution of hydrographical data. One way to circumvent this deficit is to utilise a model that represents processes which are known to possibly impact climate. This has been done for the carbon system in the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean by utilising a one-dimensional, time dependent coupled physical–biochemical model. This model was validated by observational data of temperature, salinity, phosphate, oxygen and the carbon system. The model simulation reveals that wind pattern is essential for the exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon with the surrounding seas and the carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. The latter is largely driven by the surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is impacted by primary production, water temperature, vertical mixing and river runoff. The model shows that the timing of these factors is critical for the flux of carbon dioxide as is the sea ice coverage. Modelled primary production starts after the disappearance of sea ice and the spring flood has reached the area in June, it peaks in a short time and decreases slowly to negligible levels in mid September. This primary production causes an undersaturation of carbon dioxide with up to 200μatm during the productive season after which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases as the carbon dioxide rich deep water mixes up into the surface layer. However, surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide is undersaturated all through the year, except for some years when there is a short period of outgasing in the beginning of June. This outgasing occurs when the ice breaks up late and river runoff accumulates under the ice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aice 3amixing 3aoxygen 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3arunoff 3asalinity 3asimulation models 3aspring 3asurface water 3awater temperature 3awind 3aArctic region1 aOmstedt, Anders1 aBjörk, Göran,1 aAnderson, Leif G.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2012 Oct., v. 102-104 p.29-38dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003500166245011500201300001600316520191500332592002802247650002902275650002202304650001802326650001302344650002202357650001402379650002102393650002102414650002202435650001102457650001602468650001202484650004402496650002002540650001302560650002402573650006402597650002602661650002902687650002202716650001602738650004402754650002002798650002502818650004702843700002102890773010402911856008103015852000903096655001203105IND60102141620221122062159.0141106e20120413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010214162DNAL7 a223268712pmid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoorthy, Balakrishnan Shenbaga10aMultistate Allostery in Response Regulators: Phosphorylation and Mutagenesis Activate RegA via Alternate Modes  ap. 468-487.  aResponse regulators (RRs) belong to two-component signaling pathways, widely prevalent in bacteria and lower eukaryotes, for sensing and mediating responses to diverse environmental stress stimuli. RRs are modular proteins, and in most instances, a receiver domain is found connected to diverse effector domain(s). All receiver domains contain a conserved aspartate, which is the site of phosphorylation by an associated histidine kinase. RRs function as phosphorylatable signaling switches whereby histidine-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of RRs alters its output function. It is largely unknown how phosphorylation of the receiver domain triggers activation of distally positioned effector domain(s). Although crystal structures have highlighted differences in conformations from comparisons of snapshots of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated receiver domains, how this is translated into altered activity of a distal effector domain has remained a mystery. While allosteric relays have been identified within receiver domains by NMR and X-ray crystallography, phosphorylated states of larger multidomain RRs have not yet been characterized. In this study, we have used amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the conformational dynamics of a multidomain RR, RegA from Dictyostelium discoideum, by comparisons of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states and an activating mutant. Our results reveal allosteric coupling between the site of phosphorylation and the activating mutation. Interestingly, however, the conformations of the effector domains in both instances are distinct. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry indicates that the ‘inactive’ and ‘active’ conformations exist as ensembles of multiple conformations. This is consistent with the ‘conformational selection’ model for describing phosphorylation-dependent regulation of multidomain RRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaspartic acid 3abacteria 3acrystal structure 3adeuterium 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahistidine kinase 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 2a3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAllosteric Regulation 2aDictyosteliumxchemistry 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMutagenesis 2aMutant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aAnand, Ganesh S.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2012 Apr. 13, v. 417, no. 5 p.468-487dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.01.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245008300207300001600290520070800306592002801014650001801042650001601060650002701076650001601103650001301119650002101132650001201153650001101165650001201176650001201188650001201200700001801212773009301230856008101323990002301404852000901427655001201436IND60110738320221122065740.0141109e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011073832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcb.2012.02.0072doi7 aPMC33483312pmcid7 a224805792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumont, Julien10aAcentrosomal spindle assembly and chromosome segregation during oocyte meiosis  ap. 241-249.  aThe ability to reproduce relies in most eukaryotes on specialized cells called gametes. Gametes are formed by the process of meiosis in which, after a single round of replication, two successive cell divisions reduce the ploidy of the genome. Fusion of gametes at fertilization reconstitutes diploidy. In most animal species, chromosome segregation during female meiosis occurs on spindles assembled in the absence of the major microtubule-organizing center, the centrosome. In mammals, oocyte meiosis is error prone and underlies most birth aneuploidies. Here, we review recent work on acentrosomal spindle formation and chromosome alignment/separation during oocyte meiosis in different animal models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acentrosomes 3achromosome segregation 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3aeukaryotic cells 3afemales 3agenome 3amammals 3ameiosis 3aoocytes1 aDesai, Arshad0 tTrends in cell biology.g2012 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.241-249dElsevier Ltdx0962-89247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010600175300001600281520213100297592002802428650002802456650001002484650002102494650001202515650001102527650001902538650002602557650001002583650001502593650001302608650001702621650000902638700002102647700001802668700002302686773012102709856008302830990002302913852000902936655001202945IND60103023620221119221602.0141106e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010302362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2011.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTontodonati, Marcello10aCharacterisation of rodent dobutamine echocardiography for preclinical safety pharmacology assessment  ap. 129-133.  aINTRODUCTION: Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is performed to detect subtle ischemic regions in the myocardium in patients suffering from stenosed coronary artery disease. While in a clinical and veterinary context DSE is performed daily, in the preclinical context, a very limited application has been described in the literature. In the drug development process, the safety of new chemical entities on the cardiovascular system is a primary requirement for the development of new agents/drugs for administration in humans. There are limited tools to evaluate the impairment of myocardial performance and cardiac contractility in preclinical species and particularly in rodents. In this present paper a possible imaging application is presented. METHODS: Anesthetised male Crl:CD(SD) rats (n=14) were given single intravenous doses of vehicle (5% w/v Dextrose solution) and dobutamine hydrochloride at 10μg/kg/min. Echocardiography was performed, starting immediately before the infusion and animals were monitored up to 5min after the end of infusion. Standard and non-standard echocardiography parameters were evaluated to detect test article related changes compared to vehicle infused animals. RESULTS: Thickening of left ventricle walls and interventricular septum and increased velocity of circumferential stress were observed in dobutamine infused animals compared to those receiving vehicle. These changes were considered to be a direct effect on myocardial contractility, as also confirmed by increased functional parameters (i.e., Ejection Fraction, End Diastolic Volume and decrease of the ratio between pre-ejection period and ejection time of the aortic flow). In dobutamine infused rats the “Tei index” increased up to approximately 32% compared to vehicle animals, showing a clear relationship with increased contractility. DISCUSSION: As expected dobutamine infusion in the anaesthetised rat is capable of inducing a positive inotropic effect and echocardiography results are a reliable tool for the determination of changes in contractility induced by pharmacological stress testing in the rat.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoronary artery disease 3adrugs 3aechocardiography 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3amales 3amyocardium 3apatients 3apharmacology 3arats1 aFasdelli, Nicola1 aRepeto, Paolo1 aDorigatti, Roberto0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2011 , v. 64, no. 2 p.129-133dElsevier Inc.x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2011.04.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245006200215300001400277506007600291520058700367592002800954506003700982650001301019650001701032650002301049650001101072650001301083650001701096650003101113700002101144700001701165700002401182700002001206700003301226700001701259773009301276856008501369852000901454655001201463IND60100437620221207131733.0141105e20121212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010043762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.10.0282doi7 aPMC35200102pmcid7 a232173112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuzsanyi, Veronika10aIon mobility spectrometry for detection of skin volatiles  ap. 84-92.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by humans through their skin were investigated in near real time using ion mobility spectrometry after gas chromatographic separation with a short multi-capillary column.

This strain is unique in its ability to convert glycerol simultaneously into 1,3-PD. The influence of glycerol concentration, pH, temperature, nitrogen and mineral sources were first investigated using the Plackett–Burman (P–B) statistical design to screen the variables that significantly affect the production of 1,3-PD. Seven variables were statistically significant at 95% significance and a 2⁷⁻³ fractional factorial design (FFD) was applied to further refine the optimization of culture conditions. Results showed that the ideal medium composition and culture conditions for the syntheses of 1,3-PD are: glycerol 65 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L, peptone 5 g/L, (NH₄)₂SO₄ 7 g/L, K₂HPO₄ 7 g/L, and temperature of 37 °C. Experiments in batch bioreactors under controlled pH produced up to 23.80 g/L of 1,3-PD and 12.30 g/L of ethanol, while in fed-batch cultivations a three-fold increase of 1,3-PD production (36.86 g/L) was obtained compared with the results of the FFD design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3abiodiesel 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3aethanol 3aglycerol 3anitrogen 3apH 3atemperature 3ayeast extract1 ade Souza, Elisangela Aquino1 aFlôres, Simone Hickmann1 aAyub, Marco Antônio Záchia0 tRenewable energy.g2013 July, v. 55 p.404-409dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.12.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014400172300001400316520129200330592002801622650001701650650001301667650001601680650001101696650001201707650001801719650001001737650001001747650002401757650002001781650000901801650001401810650000901824700002501833700002601858773009901884856008401983990002302067852000902090655001202099IND60110581120221116142605.0141109e20110530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011058112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Debadutta10aElemental alteration, iron overloading and metallothionein induction in experimental hepatocarcinogenesis: A free radical-mediated process?  ap. 40-47.  aThe azo-dye p-dimethylaminoazobenzene (p-DAB) is a potential tumor initiator in rodents, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. Following chronic feeding of the carcinogen for 3, 5 and 7 weeks, trace elemental status, free radical generation, oxidative damage, antioxidant profile were measured in male and female swiss albino mice. The feeding resulted in iron accumulation in male mice liver. No increase in iron level was observed in similarly exposed female mice. The results of this study suggest that p-DAB-induced iron accumulation in male mice with concomitant production of oxidative free radicals is an early event in the hepatocarcinogenic initiation. This occurs selectively in male mice and affects either directly or indirectly in development of chemically induced liver neoplasia. Again, that upregulation of metallothionein (MT) expression in association with increased free radical generation was demonstrated in male mice. Alteration of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) levels are described in the light of antioxidant profile in liver tissue. The current results thus provide evidence in support of iron accumulations producing oxidative damage, and enhanced metallothionein expression as possible contributors in the mode of action of p-DAB induced hepatocarcinogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aazo dyes 3acarcinogens 3acopper 3afemales 3afree radicals 3aliver 3amales 3amechanism of action 3ametallothionein 3amice 3aneoplasms 3azinc1 aSudarshan, Mathummal1 aChakraborty, Anindita0 tToxicology letters.g2011 May 30, v. 203, no. 1 p.40-47dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.02.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01236naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006700168300001800235520039900253592002800652650001200680650002300692650002300715700002200738700001900760773008900779856008100868852000900949655001200958IND60109485520221118092254.0141109e20120429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010948552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.07.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelle, Alexandre10aCopper catalyzed tandem conjugated borylation–aldol reaction  ap. 3435-3443.  aWe investigated the tandem conjugated borylation–aldol reaction catalyzed by copper complexes.

This study uses an optimization model for the operation of reservoirs to compare the different environmental flow requirements of river ecosystems. Based on the different environmental flow requirements, four scenarios were established: (1) the no environmental flow case; (2) the minimum environmental flow (MEF) case; (3) the appropriate environmental flow (AEF) case; and (4) the environmental design flow (EDF) case. The EDF case is first proposed in this paper, which considers the reservoir adjustment ability and comprehensively balances the economic, social and ecological benefits. The Range of Variability Approach (RVA) is used to evaluate the potential hydrological alterations of each of the four scenarios. The comparison results of the power production and the degree of hydrological alteration in the four different scenarios, indicate that the system operation under the EDF case imposes the least hydrological alteration while providing adequate power production. The encouraging results demonstrate that this method will be a robust tool for practitioners to better perform reservoir operations in balancing the human and environmental requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adesign for environment 3aeconomics 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3amodels 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aEnvironmental flow 0aReservoir operation 0aPower generation 0aThe Three Gorges Dam 0aGezhouba Dam 0aHydrological alteration1 aZhang, Lili1 aZhu, Xueping1 aZhang, Aijing1 aYin, Junxian1 aWang, Hao0 tEcological informatics.g2013 Nov., v. 18 p.40-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245006200175300002000237520084100257592002801098650001801126650002301144650002301167650002801190700001901218700002101237700002401258700002201282700001801304700002001322700002201342700002101364700002401385700002401409700002801433700002201461700002501483700002001508773009001528856008101618852000901699655001201708IND60109560220221123044256.0141109e20121209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010956022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.09.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlisi, Maria Alessandra10aDPPH radical scavenging activity of paracetamol analogues  ap. 10180-10187.  aBiochemical studies suggest a direct relationship between the radical scavenging activity of paracetamol (I) and its antipyretic and analgesic action. To evaluate the effect of chemical modifications on the radical scavenging activity of compounds of type I, analogues 1–14 were prepared and submitted to a stable free radical (DPPH; 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) assay. All paracetamol derivatives showed a significant higher efficiency than the parent compound. This study showed that radical scavenging activity can be increased by decreasing the phenolic ortho substituents steric hindrance or by introducing substituents on the acyl moiety like an indazole ring or the ionic N-methyl morpholinium group. A significant activating effect was also observed by replacing the 1,4-acylamidophenol with a 1,4-acylamidonaphthol system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afree radical scavengers1 aBrufani, Mario1 aCazzolla, Nicola1 aCeccacci, Francesca1 aDragone, Patrizia1 aFelici, Marco1 aFurlotti, Guido1 aGarofalo, Barbara1 aLa Bella, Angela1 aLanzalunga, Osvaldo1 aLeonelli, Francesca1 aMarini Bettolo, Rinaldo1 aMaugeri, Caterina1 aMigneco, Luisa Maria1 aRusso, Vincenzo0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Dec. 9, v. 68, no. 49 p.10180-10187dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2012.09.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245012000211300001400331506007600345520109100421592002801512506003701540650001901577650001601596650001901612650001901631650001401650650001101664650001101675650001701686650001101703650002001714650002001734653001001754653000801764653000901772653000901781653000801790653000801798653000701806653002401813653002701837653002601864653001601890653001901906700001901925700002001944700002101964773011101985856008102096852000902177655001202186IND60104647020221207070259.0161020e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010464702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.0082doi7 aPMC36566572pmcid7 a231787982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlala, Lawrence O.12aA role for phospholipase D in angiotensin II-induced protein kinase D activation in adrenal glomerulosa cell models  ap. 31-37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mineralocorticoid aldosterone plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, with excess causing hypertension and exacerbating cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have indicated a role for both phospholipase D (PLD) and protein kinase D (PKD) in angiotensin II (AngII)-regulated aldosterone production in adrenal glomerulosa cells. Therefore, the relationship between AngII-activated PLD and PKD was determined in two glomerulosa cell models, primary bovine zona glomerulosa (ZG) and HAC15 human adrenocortical carcinoma cells, using two inhibitors, 1-butanol and the reported PLD inhibitor, fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide (FIPI). FIPI was first confirmed to decrease PLD activation in response to AngII in the two glomerulosa cell models. Subsequently, it was shown that both 1-butanol and FIPI inhibited AngII-elicited PKD activation and aldosterone production. These results indicate that PKD is downstream of PLD and suggest that PKD is one of the mechanisms through which PLD promotes aldosterone production in response to AngII in adrenal glomerulosa cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadrenal cortex 3aaldosterone 3aangiotensin II 3ablood pressure 3acarcinoma 3acattle 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3amodels 3aphospholipase D 3aprotein kinases 0aAngII 0aDAG 0aFIPI 0aKRB+ 0aPKD 0aPLD 0aZG 0aAdrenal glomerulosa 0aProtein kinase D (PKD) 0aPhospholipase D (PLD) 0aAldosterone 0aAngiotensin II1 aSeremwe, Mutsa1 aTsai, Ying-Ying1 aBollag, Wendy B.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 366 p.31-37dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012800173300001600301520153700317592002801854650001301882650001301895650001701908650001201925650002101937650002201958650001101980650001801991650002402009650001802033650003102051650001402082650001902096700001902115700001902134700001802153700001702171700002302188700002102211700002202232700001902254773010502273856008502378852000902463655001202472IND60101073020221119191559.0141105e20130510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010107302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbieri, Stefano10aLecithin/chitosan controlled release nanopreparations of tamoxifen citrate: Loading, enzyme-trigger release and cell uptake  ap. 276-283.  aTamoxifen citrate (TAM), an anticancer drug with amphiphilic properties, was loaded in lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles (LCN) with a view to oral administration. The influence of tamoxifen loading on the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles was studied. Size, surface charge and morphological properties of tamoxifen-loaded nanoparticles (LCN-TAM) were assessed. The increase in the tamoxifen amount in the LCN-TAM preparation up to 60mg/100ml maintained the positive zeta potential value of about +45mV. A statistically significant decrease in particle size was observed for TAM amounts between 5 and 20mg. A strong influence of loaded tamoxifen on the structure of lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles was observed, supported by the quantification of free chitosan and morphological analysis. A loading of tamoxifen in nanoparticles of around 19% was obtained. The release of the drug from the LCN-TAM colloidal dispersion was measured, showing that tamoxifen citrate was released very slowly in simulated gastro-intestinal fluids without enzymes. When enzymes able to dismantle the nanoparticle structure were added to the dissolution medium, drug release was triggered and continued in a prolonged manner. Tamoxifen-loaded nanoparticles showed cytotoxicity towards MCF-7 cells comparable to that obtained with tamoxifen citrate solution, but the rate of this toxic effect was dependent on drug release. Caco-2 cells, used as a model of the intestinal epithelium, were shown to take up the TAM loaded nanoparticles extensively.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acitrates 3acytotoxicity 3aenzymes 3ahuman cell lines 3aintestinal mucosa 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoral administration 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3atamoxifen 3azeta potential1 aSonvico, Fabio1 aComo, Caterina1 aColombo, Gaia1 aZani, Franca1 aButtini, Francesca1 aBettini, Ruggero1 aRossi, Alessandra1 aColombo, Paolo0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 May 10, v. 167, no. 3 p.276-283dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012800167300001400295520103000309592002801339650005701367650002001424650002501444650001401469650003201483650001001515650001101525650001701536650001201553700001901565700002401584773008201608856008301690990002301773852000901796655001201805IND60111349120221121024801.0141109e20110105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011134912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2010.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Yingchao10aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus core gene ac92 (p33) is required for efficient budded virus production  ap. 38-45.  aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) ac92 is a core gene encoding a protein associated with occlusion derived virus (ODV), binds human P53 and also has flavin adenine dinucleotide linked sulfhydryl oxidase activity but its role in the virus life cycle is not known. To determine ac92 function a deletion virus (vAc⁹²ᴷᴼ) was generated and transfected Sf9 cells revealed that vAc⁹²ᴷᴼ infection was restricted primarily to single cells and budded virus (BV) titer was reduced over 99.99%. However, viral DNA replication was unaffected and development of occlusion bodies in vAc⁹²ᴷᴼ-transfected cells evidenced progression to very late phases of viral infection. AC92 localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and was also associated with BV as well as ODV. In BV AC92 was detected in BV envelope and nucleocapsid fractions.

Hydrogen sorption increased by a factor of approximately 2.6 between the polyimide precursor and the most highly converted TR polymer. This relative increase in sorption was similar to that observed for other non-polar light gases such as N₂, O₂, and CH₄, but less than that observed for CO₂. Additionally, H₂ sorption was measured for other polymers commonly studied in the membrane literature, including AF 2400, Matrimid®, polysulfone, and poly(dimethylsiloxane). Among the glassy polymers tested, polysulfone had the lowest H₂ sorption, and the HAB-6FDA TR polymer had the highest H₂ sorption. A slight dual-mode curvature was observed for H₂ sorption in several of the glassy materials, and it was most pronounced at low temperatures and for the TR polymers. Enthalpies of sorption were also determined. The most exothermic enthalpy of sorption occurred in Matrimid®, and a slightly endothermic enthalpy of sorption was observed in rubbery poly(dimethylsiloxane). Comparisons between gravimetric and volumetric sorption showed similar results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenthalpy 3agases 3aheat production 3ahydrogen 3apolymers 3asorption 3atemperature1 aTiwari, Rajkiran R.1 aMurphy, Thomas M.1 aSanders, David F.1 aGleason, Kristofer L.1 aPaul, Donald R.1 aFreeman, B.

Existing methods for estimating mortality from survey data include assumptions that are not always evident, meaning practitioners may be unaware of errors or whether a particular method is appropriate for their data. Here, a quantitative analysis of three vertical (single time point) methods is conducted to help improve confidence in mortality estimates. The underlying theory is reviewed to clarify assumptions and sources of error. The Basic method propagates errors, the Ratio method smoothes stage-to-stage variation, and the Alternative method is unrealistic when rates are constant. Contrary to perception, all three methods neglect the influence of advection. Application to field data for Calanus finmarchicus in the Northwest Atlantic illustrates dependence of estimates on input variables and choice of method. Variation among methods was generally smaller than that caused by uncertainty in physiological rates, and frequent violations of assumptions common to all methods seriously limited their utility. Simulations with an individual-based model reveal unacceptable sensitivity for the Basic method, whereas Ratio and Alternative methods are relatively robust except for dynamic or advective environments. Recommendations are given regarding ways to detect whether these methods can be applied to survey data, as well as to assess uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanus finmarchicus 3amodels 3amortality 3aquantitative analysis 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3azooplankton 3aNorthwest Atlantic1 aPepin, P.1 aDoucette, S.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2012 Dec., v. 105-108 p.1-19dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.05.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008500169300001600254520165300270592002801923650001601951650001401967650003101981650001002012650001302022650001602035650001302051650001102064650001802075650001502093650002802108650001402136650002002150650002902170650003202199700002202231700001502253773011202268856008202380990002302462852000902485655001202494IND60110492520221117221645.0141109e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011049252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristen, Verena10aSilver nanoparticles induce endoplasmatic reticulum stress response in zebrafish  ap. 519-528.  aSilver nanoparticles (AgNPs) find increasing applications, and therefore humans and the environment are increasingly exposed to them. However, potential toxicological implications are not sufficiently known. Here we investigate effects of AgNPs (average size 120nm) on zebrafish in vitro and in vivo, and compare them to human hepatoma cells (Huh7). AgNPs are incorporated in zebrafish liver cells (ZFL) and Huh7, and in zebrafish embryos. In ZFL cells AgNPs lead to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress response, and TNF-α. Transcriptional alterations also occur in pro-apoptotic genes p53 and Bax. The transcriptional profile differed in ZFL and Huh7 cells. In ZFL cells, the ER stress marker BiP is induced, concomitant with the ER stress marker ATF-6 and spliced XBP-1 after 6h and 24h exposure to 0.5g/L and 0.05g/L AgNPs, respectively. This indicates the induction of different pathways of the ER stress response. Moreover, AgNPs induce TNF-α. In zebrafish embryos exposed to 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5mg/L AgNPs hatching was affected and morphological defects occurred at high concentrations. ER stress related gene transcripts BiP and Synv are significantly up-regulated after 24h at 0.1 and 5mg/L AgNPs. Furthermore, transcriptional alterations occurred in the pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and p21. The ER stress response was strong in ZFL cells and occurred in zebrafish embryos as well. Our data demonstrate for the first time that AgNPs lead to induction of ER stress in zebrafish. The induction of ER stress can have several consequences including the activation of apoptotic and inflammatory pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aapoptosis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahatching 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3ananosilver 3areactive oxygen species 3areticulum 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aCapelle, Martinus1 aFent, Karl0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 272, no. 2 p.519-528dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013900171300001600310500001500326520152200341592002801863650001601891650002101907650002101928650001301949650002601962650000901988650001401997650001802011650000902029650002102038650002002059650001802079653001702097700001902114700002002133700001802153700001902171700002102190700002202211700002202233700002002255700001502275773010502290856008502395852000902480655001202489IND60101073120221119191711.0141105e20130510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010107312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIchikawa, Kanae10aSuppression of immune response by antigen-modified liposomes encapsulating model agents: A novel strategy for the treatment of allergy  ap. 284-289.  a2019-12-04  aA specific antigen-sensitized animal has antigen-specific immune cells that recognize the antigen. Therefore, an antigen-modified drug carrier would be recognized by the immune cells. When such a carrier encapsulates certain drugs, these drugs should be specifically delivered to the immune cells. To examine this strategy, ovalbumin (OVA) was used as model antigen, and mice were presensitized with 100μg of OVA with Alum. For preparing OVA-modified liposomes (OVA-lipo), OVA was incubated with DSPE-PEG-NHS and resulting DSPE-PEG-OVA was inserted into liposomes. OVA-specific IgG was produced 6-fold higher by intravenous injection of OVA-lipo thrice (10μg as OVA in each injection) in OVA-sensitized mice, than that by the injection of control liposomes, suggesting that OVA-lipo was recognized by the antigen-specific immune cells. Moreover, intra-splenic accumulation of OVA-lipo was observed in OVA-sensitized mice, but not in naive mice. To achieve the delivery of a drug to specific immune cells, OVA-lipo encapsulated low dose of doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug (20μg DOX/mouse, Ca. 1mg/kg) was injected in the sensitized mice. The injection of OVA-lipo encapsulating DOX suppressed the production of IgE against OVA, suggesting that the specific delivery of the drug to immune cells responsible for OVA recognition was achieved and that these immune cells were removed by the drug treatment. This strategy would be useful for the fundamental treatment of allergy by the use of immunosuppressing agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ahypersensitivity 3aantigens 3aintravenous injection 3aalum 3aovalbumin 3aencapsulation 3amice 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmune response 3adrug carriers 0adrug therapy1 aAsai, Tomohiro1 aShimizu, Kosuke1 aYonezawa, Sei1 aUrakami, Takeo1 aMiyauchi, Haruna1 aKawashima, Hiroto1 aIshida, Tatsuhiro1 aKiwada, Hiroshi1 aOku, Naoto0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 May 10, v. 167, no. 3 p.284-289dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002300194245007300217300001600290520157800306592002801884650001201912650001501924650001001939650001401949650001901963650002701982650001302009650001102022650002002033650001102053700002902064773009702093856008702190990002302277852000902300655001202309IND60107576320221120072001.0141108e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010757632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.02.0012doi7 aPMC33740352pmcid7 a223427362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngel, Jerome, Jr.10aHigh-frequency oscillations – Where we are and where we need to go  ap. 316-318.  aHigh-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are EEG field potentials with frequencies higher than 30Hz; commonly the frequency band between 30 and 70Hz is denominated the gamma band, but with the discovery of activities at frequencies higher than 70Hz a variety of terms have been proposed to describe the latter (Gotman and Crone, 2011). In general we may consider that the term HFO encompasses activities from 30 to 600Hz. The best practice is to indicate always explicitly the frequency range of the HFOs in any specific study. There are numerous types of HFOs: those in normal brain appear to facilitate synchronization and information transfer necessary for cognitive processes and memory, while a particular class of HFOs in the brain of animals and people with epilepsy appears to reflect fundamental mechanisms of epileptic phenomena and could serve as biomarkers of epileptogenesis and epileptogenicity in abnormal conditions such as epilepsy. A better understanding of the significance of HFOs depends on a deeper analysis of the mechanisms of generation of different kinds of HFOs, that typically are at the crossroads between intrinsic membrane properties and neuronal interactions, both chemical and electrical. There is still a lack of understanding of how specific information is carried by HFOs and can be operational in normal cognitive processes such as in working and long-term memory and abnormal conditions such as epilepsy. The complexity of these processes makes the development of relevant computational models of dynamical neuronal networks most compelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3acognition 3adynamic models 3aelectroencephalography 3aepilepsy 3amemory 3aneural networks 3apeople1 ada Silva, Fernando Lopes0 tProgress in neurobiology.g2012 Sept., v. 98, no. 3 p.316-318dElsevier Ltdx0301-00827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012700171300001600298500001500314520110300329592002801432650002001460650001101480650002001491650002801511650003301539650001201572650002001584650003201604650002201636650002801658653002401686700001801710700001801728700002101746700001901767700002201786700001901808700002401827773008501851856008301936990002302019852000902042655001202051IND60111377620221120070228.0141109e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011137762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvisi, Gualtiero10aMultiple phosphorylation sites at the C-terminus regulate nuclear import of HCMV DNA polymerase processivity factor ppUL44  ap. 259-267.  a2019-12-04  aThe processivity factor of human cytomegalovirus DNA polymerase, phosphoprotein ppUL44, is essential for viral replication. During viral infection ppUL44 is phosphorylated by the viral kinase pUL97, but neither the target residues on ppUL44 nor the effect of phosphorylation on ppUL44's activity are known. We report here that ppUL44 is phosphorylated when transiently expressed in mammalian cells and coimmunoprecipitates with cellular kinases. Of three potential phosphorylation sites (S413, S415, S418) located upstream of ppUL44's nuclear localization signal (NLS) and one (T427) within the NLS itself, protein kinase CK2 (CK2) specifically phosphorylates S413, to trigger a cascade of phosphorylation of S418 and S415 by CK1 and CK2, respectively. Negative charge at the CK2/CK1 target serine residues facilitates optimal nuclear accumulation of ppUL44, whereas negative charge on T427, a potential cyclin-dependent 1 phosphorylation site, strongly decreases nuclear accumulation. Thus, nuclear transport of ppUL44 is finely tuned during viral infection through complex phosphorylation events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotein kinases 3aserine 3aphosphoproteins 3aphysiological transport 3anuclear localization signals 3amammals 3aphosphorylation 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3avirus replication 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 0aHuman herpesvirus 51 aMarin, Oriano1 aPari, Gregory1 aMancini, Manuela1 aAvanzi, Simone1 aLoregian, Arianna1 aJans, David A.1 aRipalti, Alessandro0 tVirology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 417, no. 2 p.259-267dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016300166300001600329520147200345592002801817650003101845650002601876650001101902650002001913650001401933650000901947650001401956650001101970650002201981650001302003650001502016650001202031650001602043700001402059700002102073700001902094700002002113700001902133700002002152700002302172700001802195700001902213700002402232700001502256773008102271856008502352852000902437655001202446IND60111144920221118015223.0141109e20120105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011114492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.10.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Libo10aCationic liposome–DNA complexes (CLDC) adjuvant enhances the immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of a pre-pandemic influenza A H5N1 vaccine in mice  ap. 254-264.  aThe development of pre-pandemic influenza A H5N1 vaccines that confer both antigen-sparing and cross-clade protection are a high priority given the limited worldwide capacity for influenza vaccine production, and the antigenic and genetic heterogeneity of circulating H5N1 viruses. The inclusion of potent adjuvants in vaccine formulations may achieve both of these aims. Here we show that the addition of JVRS-100, an adjuvant consisting of cationic liposome–DNA complexes (CLDC) to a clade 1-derived H5N1 split vaccine induced significantly higher virus-specific antibody than unadjuvanted formulations, with a >30-fold dose-sparing effect and induction of increased antigen-specific CD4⁺ T-cell responses in mice. All mice that received one dose of adjuvanted vaccine and subsequent H5N1 viral challenges exhibited mild illness, lower lung viral titers, undetectable spleen and brain viral titers, and 100% survival after either homologous clade 1 or heterologous clade 2 H5N1 viral challenges, whereas unadjuvanted vaccine recipients showed significantly increased weight loss, viral titers, and mortality. The protective immunity induced by JVRS-100 adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine was shown to last for over one year without significant waning. Thus, JVRS-100 adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine elicited enhanced humoral and T-cell responses, dose-sparing, and cross-clade protection in mice. CLDC holds promise as an adjuvant for human pre-pandemic inactivated H5N1 vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3agenetic heterogeneity 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3amice 3amortality 3aspleen 3avaccine adjuvants 3avaccines 3aviral load 3aviruses 3aweight loss1 aLiu, Feng1 aFairman, Jeffery1 aHong, David K.1 aLewis, David B.1 aMonath, Thomas1 aWarner, John F.1 aBelser, Jessica A.1 aPatel, Jenish1 aHancock, Kathy1 aKatz, Jacqueline M.1 aLu, Xiuhua0 tVaccine.g2012 Jan. 5, v. 30, no. 2 p.254-264dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.10.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009900174300001600273520083700289592002801126650002001154650003001174650001101204650002001215700001801235700002001253773010501273856008501378852000901463655001201472IND60101073220221119191535.0141105e20130510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010107322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSá, Gonçalo F.F.10aStratum corneum permeabilization with photoacoustic waves generated by piezophotonic materials  ap. 290-300.  aPhotoacoustic (PA) waves generated by short laser pulses absorbed by piezophotonic materials are shown to permeabilize the stratum corneum to large molecules and proteins.

The intraepidermal delivery of Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) in minipigs with this method does not lead to observable adverse effects. The distinctive features of the piezophotonic materials are the high light-to-pressure conversion efficiency and the generation of PA waves with the duration of the laser pulses.

The present study is a performance evaluation and critical analysis of assay results for an array of 292 high-throughput cell-free assays aimed at preliminary toxicity evaluation of 320 environmental chemicals in EPA's ToxCast™ project (Phase I). The chemicals (309 unique, 11 replicates) were mainly precursors or the active agent of commercial pesticides, for which a wealth of in vivo toxicity data is available. Biochemical HTS (high-throughput screening) profiled cell and tissue extracts using semi-automated biochemical and pharmacological methodologies to evaluate a subset of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), CYP450 enzymes (CYPs), kinases, phosphatases, proteases, HDACs, nuclear receptors, ion channels, and transporters. The primary screen tested all chemicals at a relatively high concentration 25μM concentration (or 10μM for CYP assays), and a secondary screen re-tested 9132 chemical-assay pairs in 8-point concentration series from 0.023 to 50μM (or 0.009–20μM for CYPs).

The exposure of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) to different amounts of C-NAs or OSPW-OF, did not affect cell viability in vitro. We examined whether exposure of BMDM to C-NAs or OSPW-OF affected various antimicrobial responses of these cells. A dose-dependent decrease in nitric oxide response was observed after treatment of BMDM with OSPW-OF, but not with C-NAs. Although OSPW-OF and C-NAs both down-regulated the respiratory burst response of BMDM, the suppression of the production of reactive oxygen intermediates was more pronounced in cells treated with OSPW-OF. Treatment with OSPW-OF or C-NAs reduced BMDM phagocytosis of zymosan and latex beads. The decrease of BMDM antimicrobial response after exposure to OSPW-OF or C-NAs, was accompanied by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Oral exposure of mice to OSPW-OF caused down-regulation in the expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-1β and CSF-1. Our findings indicated that OSPW causes immunotoxic effects that may impair the ability of an exposed host to defend against infectious disease. Furthermore, given the differences between the effects of OSPW-OF and C-NAs, C-NAs should not be assumed to be a direct surrogate for the immunotoxic chemical species in OSPW.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell viability 3achemical speciation 3adose response 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aimmunotoxicity 3ainfectious diseases 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alatex 3amacrophages 3amice 3anaphthenates 3anitric oxide 3aoil sands 3aoral exposure 3aphagocytosis 3areactive oxygen species 3azymosan1 aPun, Jonathan1 aPerez-Estrada, Leonidas A.1 aDin, Mohamed Gamal-El1 aSmith, D.

However, our current understanding of these processes is limited to platform reefs exhibiting a high degree of ecosystem closure compared to the globally most common fringing reef type. This study carried out in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) presents the first quantitative budget for coral-derived organic carbon (COC) in a fringing reef and highlights the importance of local hydrodynamics. Diel reef-wide COC release amounted to 1.1±0.2 kmol total organic carbon (TOC) representing 1–3% of gross benthic primary production. Most COC (73%) was released as particulate organic C (POC), the bulk of which (34–63%) rapidly settled as mucus string aggregates accounting for approximately 28% of total POC sedimentation. Sedimentation of mucus strings, but also dilution of suspended and dissolved COC in reef waters retained 82% of diel COC release in the fringing reef, providing a potentially important organic source for a COC-based food web. Pelagic COC degradation represented 0.1–1.6% of pelagic microbial respiration recycling 32% of diel retained COC. Benthic COC degradation contributed substantially (29–47%) to reef-wide microbial respiration in reef sands, including 20–38% by mucus string POC, and consumed approximately 52% of all retained COC. These findings point out the importance of COC as a C carrier for different reef types. COC may further represent a source of organic carbon for faunal communities colonising reef framework cavities complementing the efficient retention and recycling of COC within fringing reef environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3afood webs 3ahydrodynamics 3amucus 3aprimary productivity 3arecycling 3aRed Sea1 aRichter, Claudio1 aMott, Claudius1 ael-Zibdah, Mohammad1 aManasrah, Riyad1 aWild, Christian0 tJournal of marine systems.g2012 Dec., v. 105-108 p.20-29dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.05.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03466naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011700168300001900285500001500304520177400319592002802093650001902121650002002140650001602160650002402176650000802200650001202208650001302220650001702233650001502250650002602265650001202291650001102303650001302314650001402327650002702341650001202368650001202380651002102392653002102413700001702434700001602451700002102467700001402488700002002502700001702522700001702539700001902556700001702575700001802592700001902610773012102629856008202750990002302832852000902855655001202864IND60100194820221121123147.0141105e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010019482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Woo-Kyung,10aInteraction between IL13 genotype and environmental factors in the risk for allergic rhinitis in Korean children  ap. 421-426.e5.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) is increasing worldwide. Allergic diseases develop in susceptible subjects when they are exposed to specific environmental factors. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed changes in the prevalence of AR and identified genetic and environmental factors in early childhood that affect risk. METHODS: We used the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire to collect data on AR, allergies, and environmental exposures from 4554 elementary school students from 5 areas of Seoul, Korea, in 2008. We also obtained DNA from 1050 subjects from 1 area of Seoul for genotype analysis of IL13. RESULTS: We identified genetic and environmental factors during infancy and early childhood that increased the risk for current AR (resulting in a diagnosis of AR and AR symptoms in the past 12 months) in elementary school–aged children. These included allergic disease in parents and antibiotic use in infants, allergic disease in parents and exposure of infants to mold, and allergic disease in parents and moving an infant to a newly built house. The risk of current AR also increased in subjects with GA or AA at nucleotide 2044 in IL13 who had been exposed to mold in the home during infancy (adjusted odds ratio, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.75-6.11) compared with subjects who had GG at this position and had not been exposed to mold (adjusted odds ratio, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.75-6.11). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of AR is increasing in Korean children. Children with a family history of allergic disease and exposure to specific environmental risk factors during infancy are more likely to have AR. Children with GA or AA at IL13(+2044) are at increased risk for AR when exposed to mold in the home during the first year of life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquestionnaires 3aschool children 3aantibiotics 3aelementary students 3aDNA 3aparents 3arhinitis 3arisk factors 3aodds ratio 3aenvironmental factors 3ainfancy 3aasthma 3agenotype 3achildhood 3aenvironmental exposure 3aKoreans 3ainfants 3aKorean Peninsula 0ahypersensitivity1 aKwon, Ji-Won1 aSeo, Ju-Hee1 aKim, Hyung Young1 aYu, Jinho1 aKim, Byoung Ju,1 aKim, Hyo-Bin1 aYi, So-yŏn,1 aKim, Kyung Won1 aKang, Mi-Jin1 aShin, Yee-Jin1 aHong, Soo-Jong0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Aug., v. 130, no. 2 p.421-426.e5dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.04.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012000171300001400291520089500305592002801200650002901228650001801257650002001275650001201295650001801307650002101325650001401346650001201360700001701372700001701389700002101406700002101427700002101448700001901469700002001488700002301508773008201531856008301613990002301696852000901719655001201728IND60111349420221121024857.0141109e20110105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011134942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2010.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahnke, Stefanie10aIntrinsic phospholipase A2 activity of adeno-associated virus is involved in endosomal escape of incoming particles  ap. 77-83.  aThe unique region of the VP1 capsid protein of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) in common with autonomously replicating parvoviruses comprises a secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) homology domain. While the sPLA2 domain of Minute Virus of Mice has recently been shown to mediate endosomal escape by lipolytic pore formation, experimental evidence for a similar function in AAV infection is still lacking. Here, we explored the function of the sPLA2 domain of AAV by making use of the serotype 2 mutant ⁷⁶HD/AN. The sPLA2 defect in ⁷⁶HD/AN, which severely impairs AAV's infectivity, could be complemented in trans by co-infection with wild-type AAV2. Furthermore, co-infection with endosomolytically active, but not with inactive adenoviral variants partially rescued ⁷⁶HD/AN, providing the first evidence for a function of this domain in endosomal escape of incoming AAV particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRodent protoparvovirus 1 3acoat proteins 3amixed infection 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3aphospholipase A2 3aserotypes 3aviruses1 aLux, Kerstin1 aUhrig, Silke1 aKreppel, Florian1 aHösel, Marianna1 aCoutelle, Oliver1 aOgris, Manfred1 aHallek, Michael1 aBüning, Hildegard0 tVirology.g2011 Jan. 5, v. 409, no. 1 p.77-83dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.09.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002000190245009100210300001600301520106800317592002801385650001401413650001301427650002201440650002401462650003101486650001201517650002301529650001801552650000901570650002701579650003701606650002201643650002001665650001201685700002101697700001801718700002301736773008501759856008301844990002301927852000901950655001201959IND60111377920221121020825.0141109e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011137792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.0102doi7 aPMC31638222pmcid7 a217423632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosebeck, Shaun10aInvolvement of Noxa in mediating cellular ER stress responses to lytic virus infection  ap. 293-303.  aNoxa is a Bcl-2 homology domain-containing pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein. Noxa mRNA and protein expression are upregulated by dsRNA or virus, and ectopic Noxa expression enhances cellular sensitivity to virus or dsRNA-induced apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that Noxa null baby mouse kidney (BMK) cells are deficient in normal cytopathic response to lytic viruses, and that reconstitution of the knockout cells with wild-type Noxa restored normal cytopathic responses. Noxa regulation by virus mirrored its regulation by proteasome inhibitors or ER stress inducers and the ER stress response inhibitor salubrinal protected cells against viral cytopathic effects. Noxa mRNA and protein were synergistically upregulated by IFN or dsRNA when combined with ER stress inducers, leading to Noxa/Mcl-1 interaction, activation of Bax and pro-apoptotic caspases, degradation of Mcl-1, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and initiation of apoptosis. These data highlight the importance of ER stress in augmenting the expression of Noxa following viral infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acytopathogenicity 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agene expression regulation 3akidneys 3amembrane potential 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein synthesis 3astress response 3aviruses1 aSudini, Kuladeep1 aChen, Tiannan1 aLeaman, Douglas W.0 tVirology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 417, no. 2 p.293-303dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015900166300001600325520172400341592002802065650001802093650000802111650001502119650000802134650001402142650001502156650001602171650002302187650002702210650001302237650001702250650002302267650002902290650001102319650001902330650002402349650001402373650001902387650002202406650001702428650001302445700001902458700002102477700001702498700001602515700001702531773011302548856008202661990002302743852000902766655001202775IND60110423820221119102154.0141109e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011042382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2011.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Jen-Chung10aCurcumin enhances the mitomycin C-induced cytotoxicity via downregulation of MKK1/2–ERK1/2-mediated Rad51 expression in non-small cell lung cancer cells  ap. 327-338.  aCurcumin (diferuloylmethane), a major active component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), has been reported to suppress the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells. Rad51 is a key protein in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway of DNA double-strand break repair, and HR represents a novel target for cancer therapy. A high expression of Rad51 has been reported in chemo- or radio-resistant carcinomas. Therefore, in the current study, we will examine whether curcumin could enhance the effects of mitomycin C (MMC), a DNA interstrand cross-linking agent, to induce cytotoxicity by decreasing Rad51 expression. Exposure of two human non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549 and H1975) to curcumin could suppress MMC-induced MKK1/2–ERK1/2 signal activation and Rad51 protein expression. Enhancement of ERK1/2 activation by constitutively active MKK1/2 (MKK1/2-CA) increased Rad51 protein levels in curcumin and MMC co-treated human lung cells. Moreover, the synergistic cytotoxic effect induced by curcumin combined with MMC was decreased by MKK1-CA-mediated enhancement of ERK1/2 activation by a significant degree. In contrast, MKK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 was shown to augment the cytotoxicity of curcumin and MMC through downregulation of ERK1/2 activation and Rad51 expression. Depletion of endogenous Rad51 expression by siRad51 RNA transfection significantly enhanced MMC and/or curcumin induced cell death and cell growth inhibition. In contrast, an overexpression of Rad51 protected lung cancer cells from synergistic cytotoxic effects induced by curcumin and MMC. We concluded that Rad51 inhibition may be an additional action mechanism for enhancing the chemosensitization of MMC by curcumin in NSCLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma longa 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aRNA 3acarcinoma 3acell death 3acell growth 3achemosensitization 3across-linking reagents 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3agrowth retardation 3ahomologous recombination 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amechanism of action 3amitomycin 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotein synthesis 3atransfection 3aturmeric1 aTsai, Min-Shao1 aWeng, Shao-Hsing1 aKuo, Ya-Hsun1 aQiu, Yufan,1 aLin, Yun-Wei0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 255, no. 3 p.327-338dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.07.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245012100213300001600334520171600350592002802066650002102094650001802115650001402133650002102147650001202168650002302180650001102203650001402214650002502228650001802253650002302271650001002294650001002304650000902314650001402323650001602337650002102353650003102374650004002405700001702445700001602462700002502478700003202503700002502535773011202560856008202672990002302754852000902777655001202786IND60110492820221117221713.0141109e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011049282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.0072doi7 aPMC42015822pmcid7 a237924232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLingappan, Krithika10aSex-specific differences in hyperoxic lung injury in mice: Implications for acute and chronic lung disease in humans  ap. 281-290.  aSex-specific differences in pulmonary morbidity in humans are well documented. Hyperoxia contributes to lung injury in experimental animals and humans. The mechanisms responsible for sex differences in the susceptibility towards hyperoxic lung injury remain largely unknown. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that mice will display sex-specific differences in hyperoxic lung injury. Eight week-old male and female mice (C57BL/6J) were exposed to 72h of hyperoxia (FiO₂>0.95). After exposure to hyperoxia, lung injury, levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F₂ alpha (8-iso-PGF 2α) (LC–MS/MS), apoptosis (TUNEL) and inflammatory markers (suspension bead array) were determined. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A expression in the lung was assessed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. After exposure to hyperoxia, males showed greater lung injury, neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis, compared to air-breathing controls than females. Pulmonary 8-iso-PGF 2α levels were higher in males than females after hyperoxia exposure. Sexually dimorphic increases in levels of IL-6 (F>M) and VEGF (M>F) in the lungs were also observed. CYP1A1 expression in the lung was higher in female mice compared to males under hyperoxic conditions. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that male mice are more susceptible than females to hyperoxic lung injury and that differences in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers contribute to these sex-specific dimorphic effects. In conclusion, this paper describes the establishment of an animal model that shows sex differences in hyperoxic lung injury in a temporal manner and thus has important implications for lung diseases mediated by hyperoxia in humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acytochrome P-450 3afemales 3agender differences 3ahumans 3ahyperoxia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterleukin-6 3alaboratory animals 3alungs 3amales 3amice 3amorbidity 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative stress 3arespiratory tract diseases 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aJiang, Weiwu1 aWang, Lihua1 aCouroucli, Xanthi I.1 aAngelelli, Roberto Barrios,1 aMoorthy, Bhagavatula0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 272, no. 2 p.281-290dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007600167300001600243520077300259592002801032650001301060650001901073650001601092650001901108650001301127650001101140650001301151700002001164700002001184700002601204773009501230856008101325852000901406655001201415IND60110818220221121152932.0141109e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011081822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnston, Calum10aPostreplication targeting of transformants by bacterial immune systems?  ap. 516-521.  aBacteria are constantly challenged by foreign genetic elements such as bacteriophages and plasmids. Several defense systems provide immunity against such attackers, including restriction–modification (R–M) systems and clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These systems target attacking DNA and thus antagonize natural transformation, which relies on uptake of exogenous DNA to promote acquisition of new genetic traits. It is unclear how this antagonization occurs, because transforming DNA is single stranded, and thus resistant to these immune systems. Here, we propose a simple model whereby these systems limit transformation by attack of transformed chromosomes once double strandedness is restored by chromosomal replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3achromosomes 3agenetic traits 3aimmunity 3amodels 3aplasmids1 aMartin, Bernard1 aPolard, Patrice1 aClaverys, Jean-Pierre0 tTrends in microbiology.g2013 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.516-521dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011200173300001800285520181000303592002802113650002102141650001902162650002502181650001602206650001102222650001702233650001302250650002102263650001902284650002602303650001202329650000902341650001502350651002402365651000902389651001002398700002202408700002502430700002702455773011202482856008202594990002302676852000902699655001202708IND60107911120221119110936.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010791112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlattery, Michael C.14aThe predominance of economic development in the support for large-scale wind farms in the U.S. Great Plains  ap. 3690-3701.  aWind energy is one of the fastest growing sources of power generation in the world. While general public and political support for wind energy is often high, siting wind farms frequently raises concerns in local communities, and individual projects often fail because of effective public opposition. This paper presents the results of a postal and online survey questionnaire that explores public perceptions of wind energy in two of the most important states for wind development, Texas and Iowa. The goal is a better understanding of public reactions to large-scale wind developments as a prerequisite of more widespread use of renewable energy resources. We found a high level of public support for wind energy, with more than two-thirds of respondents being in favor of building more wind farms either in their community or within the U.S. as a whole. Given that the majority of respondents had a very high level of concern for the general environment, we also found that almost two-thirds of respondents counter-intuitively indicated that producing electricity using fossil fuels is not detrimental to the environment, and that they had little concern for global climate change. Our results suggest that arguing for more renewable sources of energy based on reducing our carbon footprint is less persuasive in these communities than simply approaching it from the perspective of wind being a clean and safe source of energy. More than two-thirds of respondents felt their county had benefited economically from the wind farms and that they were a source of job creation in the county. Support for wind power in these communities is associated far more with socioeconomic factors than foundational aesthetic or moral values, with wind farms perceived as the vehicle that will reverse economic decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3apolitics 3apower generation 3aquestionnaires 3asocioeconomic factors 3asurveys 3awind 3awind power 3aGreat Plains region 3aIowa 3aTexas1 aJohnson, Becky L.1 aSwofford, Jeffrey A.1 aPasqualetti, Martin J.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 Aug., v. 16, no. 6 p.3690-3701dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006900164300001600233520104800249592002801297650001601325650002201341650001101363650001101374650001101385650003301396650001501429650001701444700001801461700001701479700001201496700001801508773008801526856008101614852000901695655001201704IND60110272720221118081947.0141109e20121010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011027272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2012.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Manxiu10aPhase equilibria of the Co–Ni–Zn system at 450°C and 600°C  ap. 103-111.  aThe isothermal sections of the Co–Ni–Zn ternary system at 450°C and 600°C have been determined experimentally using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Three tri-phase regions have been confirmed at 450°C and 600°C, respectively. Three continuous solid solutions regions, i.e. α-Co/α-Ni, γ-Co₅Zn₂₁/γ-Ni₄Zn₂₂ and γ₂-CoZn₁₃/δ-NiZn₈, exist in the sections. The solubility of Co in β₁-NiZn is up to 15.0at.% at 600°C, and 16.5at.% at 450°C. The maximum solubility of Ni in β₁-CoZn and γ₁-CoZn₇.₈ is 10.5at.% and 8.1at.% at 600°C, and 11.8at.% and 5.5at.% at 450°C, respectively. No true ternary compound was found. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the Co–Zn intermediate phases β₁ and γ have been obtained experimentally. The results obtained by cell refinement revealed that both Co–Zn compounds β₁ and γ belong to the cell type of cubic, and their lattice parameters are 0.63360 and 0.89412nm, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3acobalt 3aenergy 3anickel 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aspectroscopy1 aWang, Zhanhui1 aYin, Fucheng1 aLi, Zhi1 aLong, Zhaohui0 tThermochimica acta.g2012 Oct. 10, v. 545 p.103-111dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016600165300001600331520162500347592002801972650003102000650001402031650002102045650001702066650002302083650001202106650002702118650001402145650002102159650001302180700001602193700002002209700001702229773011202246856008202358990002302440852000902463655001202472IND60110492920221117221715.0141109e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011049292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Dayong14aThe underlying toxicological mechanism of chemical mixtures: A case study on mixture toxicity of cyanogenic toxicants and aldehydes to Photobacterium phosphoreum  ap. 551-558.  aIntracellular chemical reaction of chemical mixtures is one of the main reasons that cause synergistic or antagonistic effects. However, it still remains unclear what the influencing factors on the intracellular chemical reaction are, and how they influence on the toxicological mechanism of chemical mixtures. To reveal this underlying toxicological mechanism of chemical mixtures, a case study on mixture toxicity of cyanogenic toxicants and aldehydes to Photobacterium phosphoreum was employed, and both their joint effects and mixture toxicity were observed. Then series of two-step linear regressions were performed to describe the relationships between joint effects, the expected additive toxicities and descriptors of individual chemicals (including concentrations, binding affinity to receptors, octanol/water partition coefficients). Based on the quantitative relationships, the underlying joint toxicological mechanisms were revealed. The result shows that, for mixtures with their joint effects resulting from intracellular chemical reaction, their underlying toxicological mechanism depends on not only their interaction with target proteins, but also their transmembrane actions and their concentrations. In addition, two generic points of toxicological mechanism were proposed including the influencing factors on intracellular chemical reaction and the difference of the toxicological mechanism between single reactive chemicals and their mixtures. This study provided an insight into the understanding of the underlying toxicological mechanism for chemical mixtures with intracellular chemical reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhotobacterium phosphoreum 3aaldehydes 3abinding capacity 3acase studies 3achemical reactions 3aoctanol 3apartition coefficients 3areceptors 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aLin, Zhifen1 aZhou, Xianghong1 aYin, Daqiang0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 272, no. 2 p.551-558dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2013.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165300001800257520099200275592002801267650001201295650001201307650001101319650001301330700001601343700001601359700001401375773011101389856008101500990002301581852000901604655001201613IND60104175620221119225919.0141107e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010417562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.11.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachiller, C.10aHybrid mode matching method for the efficient analysis of rods in waveguided structures  ap. 1832-1839.  aTraditionally metallic waveguide filters have been used commercially for microwave applications. These filters have very reduced insertion losses within their operating frequency band and their construction is considerably economic. On the other hand, metallic filters have significant drawbacks, especially when they are designed for satellite and other spatial applications, since their weight and size may very often be too high and due to the lack of atmosphere, the Multipactor effect limits considerably the power that the filters can handle. This problems can be reduced by using new topologies of H-plane waveguide filters loaded with dielectric resonators. Nevertheless the analysis and design of these filters is far more complex than the one of all metallic filters, due to their special topology. Efficient mathematical tools are required for this analysis and this paper presents a new hybrid mode matching method for the efficient analysis of rods in waveguided structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilters 3ahybrids 3amodels 3atopology1 aEsteban, H.1 aMorro, J.V.1 aBoria, V.0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 Apr., v. 57, no. 7-8 p.1832-1839dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.11.0763Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007000171300001600241500001500257520064400272592002800916650002200944650001100966650002200977650002600999650002401025650002501049650001101074650002101085650001601106650001001122650000701132650001501139653002001154700002801174700002201202700002301224773010801247856008101355990002301436852000901459655001201468IND60107637920221120084934.0141108e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010763792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pep.2012.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFliedrová, Barbora10aProduction of Aspergillus niger β-mannosidase in Pichia pastoris  ap. 159-164.  a2019-12-04  aβ-Mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25) is an exoglycosidase specific for the hydrolysis of terminal β-linked mannoside in various sugar chains. cDNA corresponding to the β-mannosidase gene was cloned from Aspergillus niger, sequenced, and expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris.

It has been suggested that PU foam may contain trace amounts of residual toluene diisocyanate (TDI) monomers and present a health risk. To address this concern, the exposure scenario and health risks posed by sleeping on a PU foam mattress were evaluated. Toxicity benchmarks for key non-cancer endpoints (i.e., irritation, sensitization, respiratory tract effects) were determined by dividing points of departure by uncertainty factors. The cancer benchmark was derived using the USEPA Benchmark Dose Software. Results of previous migration and emission data of TDI from PU foam were combined with conservative exposure factors to calculate upper-bound dermal and inhalation exposures to TDI as well as a lifetime average daily dose to TDI from dermal exposure. For each non-cancer endpoint, the toxicity benchmark was divided by the calculated exposure to determine the margin of safety (MOS), which ranged from 200 (respiratory tract) to 3×10⁶ (irritation). Although available data indicate TDI is not carcinogenic, a theoretical excess cancer risk (1×10⁻⁷) was calculated. We conclude from this assessment that sleeping on a PU foam mattress does not pose TDI-related health risks to consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily intake 3acarcinogenicity 3adermal exposure 3aexposure scenario 3afoams 3ainhalation exposure 3amargin of safety 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3arespiratory system 3arisk 3atoluene 3auncertainty analysis1 aCollins, Michael A.1 aGraham, Cynthia1 aJolly, Athena T.1 aParod, Ralph J.1 aPoole, Alan1 aSchupp, Thomas1 aShiotsuka, Ronald N.1 aWoolhiser, Michael R.0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g2012 Dec., v. 64, no. 3 p.504-515dElsevier Inc.x0273-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2012.07.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001600262520071900278592002800997650002201025650001901047650001301066650002201079650001001101650001101111650001201122650001201134650002401146650003401170650003301204700001701237700002101254700002101275700002001296700001601316700002201332773009801354856008101452990002301533852000901556655001201565IND60108543320221117033734.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiang, Ho Truong10aHydrocarbon gas sensing of nano-crystalline perovskite oxides LnFeO₃ (Ln=La, Nd and Sm)  ap. 246-251.  aIn this paper, we report the properties of the nano-crystalline oxides LnFeO₃ (Ln=La, Nd and Sm) synthesized by sol–gel citrate technique.

They are widespread in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. In bacteria, the best characterized co-chaperone is the Escherichia coli DnaJ protein. Many γ-proteobacteria encode a functional homologue of DnaJ, known as CbpA, which is expressed in response to starvation and environmental stress. The activity of CbpA is regulated by the “modulator” protein CbpM. Here, we have used a combination of genetics and biochemistry to identify the co-chaperone contact determinant of CbpM. We show that the nature of the interaction is conserved in enterobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3aenzymes 3agenetics 3aheat-shock protein 70 2aAmino Acids, Acidicxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aConserved Sequence 2aEnterobacteriaceaexenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHSP40 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aGrainger, David C.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 Aug. 12, v. 411, no. 2 p.313-320dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013700170300001600307520094800323592002801271650001501299650001301314650001501327650001501342650000901357650000701366700001401373700001601387700001801403700001201421700001701433773010001450856008501550852000901635655001201644IND60101413620221117222201.0141106e20111230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010141362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaporale, A.G.10aEffect of inorganic and organic ligands on the sorption/desorption of arsenate on/from Al–Mg and Fe–Mg layered double hydroxides  ap. 291-298.  aThis paper describes the sorption of arsenate on Al–Mg and Fe–Mg layered double hydroxides as affected by pH and varying concentrations of inorganic and organic ligands, and the effect of residence time on the desorption of arsenate by ligands. The capacity of ligands to inhibit the fixation of arsenate followed the sequence: nitrate<nitrite<sulphate<selenite<tartrate<oxalate≪phosphate on Al–Mg-LDH and nitrate<sulphate≈nitrite<tartrate<oxalate<selenite≪ phosphate on Fe–Mg-LDH. The inhibition of arsenate sorption increased by increasing the initial ligand concentration and was greater on Al–Mg-LDH than on Fe–Mg-LDH. The longer the arsenate residence time on the LDH surfaces the less effective the competing ligands were in desorbing arsenate from sorbents. A greater percentage of arsenate was removed by phosphate from Al–Mg-LDH than from Fe–Mg-LDH, due to the higher affinity of arsenate for iron than aluminum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aaluminum 3adesorption 3ahydroxides 3airon 3apH1 aPigna, M.1 aDynes, J.J.1 aCozzolino, V.1 aZhu, J.1 aViolante, A.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Dec. 30, v. 198 p.291-298dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008000171300001400251520187800265592002802143650002702171650001302198650002702211650002602238650002302264650001102287650001502298650001502313650002202328650001102350650002002361650001402381650002202395650001902417650002202436650002302458650001502481651001002496653002302506653003102529653002002560653002002580700001602600700001402616700002202630700002102652700001402673773009802687856008702785852000902872655001202881IND60108228520221119014840.0161027e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010822852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Liangxin10aWater use patterns and conservation in households of Wei River Basin, China  ap. 45-53.  aFully understanding patterns of water use and water conservation among different consumer groups will help in implementing more effective water conservation programs worldwide. Consequently, we investigated water use patterns, water conservation practices, attitudes, and hindrances to water conservation by randomly surveying 776 households in the Weinan, Yanglin–Wugong, and Baoji districts in the middle of the Wei River Basin. The results of the study reveal that water consumption for domestic use of 70.2L per capita per day (Lpcd), 31.9L of which is allocated for outdoor use. Households with high water consumption consume more water for watering vegetable gardens and cleaning their houses and yards, and employ more appliances and apparatuses that use water. A total of 20 conservation practices were reported by of which 11 were used by the majority of residents. Residents prefer to implement the most convenient and low-cost water conservation practices. The households with low water consumption were likely to conserve water because of economic concerns, but their unwillingness to change traditional habits prevent them from conserving water. For households with high water consumption groups, environmental concerns drive them to conserve water, their unwillingness to devote additional time and energy and the lack of social support are the main hindrances to water conservation. Public education programs on water use and conservation for rural communities need to fully consider these limitations to change traditional views and behaviors toward the use of water appliances and improving quality of life, as well as employing outdoor water conservation, pro-environmental education, and price transparency to promote the judicious use of water. The results obtained can be used as guidelines for establishing policies for community water conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acleaning 3aconservation practices 3aconservation programs 3aeducation programs 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3aprices 3aquality of life 3arecycling 3arural communities 3asocial support 3avegetable gardens 3awater conservation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aWater conservation 0aDomestic water consumption 0aSurvey research 0aWei River Basin1 aLiu, Guobin1 aWang, Fei1 aGeissen, Violette1 aRitsema, Coen J.1 aTong, Yan0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 May, v. 74 p.45-53dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.02.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012100164300001800285520157300303592002801876650001801904650001201922650001201934650002301946650003301969650001702002650001702019650001402036650001702050650001102067650001302078650001802091650001702109700002302126700003202149700002002181700002202201773008402223856008502307990002302392852000902415655001202424IND60105695720221120202738.0141108e20120322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010569572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Wei10aInfluence of processing history on water and salt transport properties of disulfonated polysulfone random copolymers  ap. 1581-1592.  aDisulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s are high glass transition temperature polymers, and their water and salt transport properties depend sensitively on thermal processing history. In this study, films of a 32 mol% disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) random copolymer (BPS-32), polymerized in the potassium counter-ion form, were acidified using solid state and solution routes. The resulting acid counter-ion form materials were then converted to sodium, potassium, and calcium counter-ion forms via ion exchange. Additionally, several films were subjected to various thermal treatments in the solid state. Water uptake as well as water and NaCl permeability of these BPS-32 films were measured. Acidification via immersion of BPS-32 films in boiling sulfuric acid solution increased water uptake, and water and salt permeability increased. Exposure of samples to elevated temperature also influenced transport properties. For example, immersing BPS-32 films in boiling water for 4 h increased water sorption by 50%, water permeability by 2.3 times, and NaCl permeability by 8 times. The counter-ion form of the sulfonated polymer influenced the polymer’s transport properties, but these effects were weaker than the effect of thermal treatment. Generally, the BPS-32 samples prepared with different processing histories followed a trade-off between water/salt permeability selectivity and water permeability. These results suggest that, like many other glassy polymers, thermal processing history influences small molecule transport in these materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aboiling 3acalcium 3acomposite polymers 3aglass transition temperature 3aion exchange 3apermeability 3apotassium 3asaline water 3asodium 3asorption 3asulfuric acid 3awater uptake1 aGeise, Geoffrey M.1 aFreeman, B.

Data were then used to evaluate the impact of the Prestige accident in the Ría de Arousa by applying principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Surface water from Sar River and Ulla River was also analysed for the same elements. Determinations were performed by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) after solid phase extraction (SPE) of element-8-hydroxyquinoline complexes onto commercial C18 cartridges. The highest concentrations were found in sampling stations along Ulla River, while Al, Fe and Sn offered the highest values in surface and deep seawater from the inner part of the estuary, area where the main villages and sport harbours are located. PCA and CA have shown an independent group formed by surface seawater from the East margin of the mouth of the estuary collected after the Prestige oil spill. However, independent groups were not observed when using deep seawater data, and the effect of the Prestige accident appears to be less evident.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acluster analysis 3acopper 3aestuaries 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoil spills 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3aseawater 3asolid phase extraction 3aspectroscopy 3asports 3asurface water 3atankers 3atin 3avillages 3azinc 3aSpain1 aMoreda-Piñeiro, Antonio,1 aBermejo-Barrera, Pilar0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2011 Mar., v. 97, no. 2 p.122-130dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2010.08.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009100155300001600246520119700262592002801459650000801487650001301495650001901508650001001527650001401537650001201551650001501563650001101578650002701589650001401616650001601630700001401646700001501660773013601675856007501811852000901886655001201895IND60765152420221120200541.0220419e20111211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515242DNAL7 a10.17221/4254-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZąbek, T.10aImplications for the use of horse hair roots as a DNA source for microsatellite typing  ap. 499-502.  aHair roots are a very attractive source of DNA for microsatellite-based parentage control of breeding animals. However, unlike blood samples, irregular DNA typing results have been observed in assays utilizing hair follicles. The amount of starting material and DNA preparation method are the crucial factors. In order to improve DNA typing results for horse hair roots, two quick preparation methods and additional purification steps were evaluated. PCR efficiency for each approach was expressed as percentage of samples with complete DNA profiles for 12 horse microsatellites. The lowest percentage (22%) of complete DNA profiles was obtained for samples prepared by the proteinase K digestion method. The best genotyping results (94%) were achieved after phenol-chloroform extraction of DNA from samples prepared by the proteinase K digestion method. Direct cleanup of DNA samples with an ethanol-sodium acetate mixture gave comparably good results of microsatellite genotyping (91%). DNA preparation from hair roots with proteinase K digestion followed by DNA purification with ethanol was chosen as the most efficient approach for horse DNA typing under parentage testing. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aacetates 3aanimal science 3ablood 3adigestion 3aethanol 3agenotyping 3ahorses 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3apeptidase K1 aRadko, A.1 aSłota, E.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 50, no. 11 p.499-502dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4254-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014900162300001600311520198900327592002802316650001102344650002202355650001502377650004502392650001902437650002302456650000902479650001302488650001202501650001602513650001502529650002402544650001302568650001402581650001602595653004402611653000802655653001402663653003102677653004502708700002202753700002202775700002402797700002002821773023002841856007403071852000903145655001203154IND60548430720221123020415.0190412e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054843072DNAL7 a10.1111/vaa.123382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, Amanda E.10aEffects of orally administered enalapril on blood pressure and hemodynamic response to vasopressors during isoflurane anesthesia in healthy dogs  ap. 482-494.  aTo examine whether preanesthetic administration of enalapril, compared with placebo, results in a greater decline in blood pressure (BP) or decreased responsiveness of BP to isotonic fluids or vasopressors in healthy dogs during isoflurane anesthesia.Randomized, experimental, placebo-controlled, blinded, crossover study.Twelve healthy, female, purpose-bred beagles.Dogs underwent the following week-long treatment protocols, each preceded by a 1 week washout period: oral placebo twice daily (PLA); oral enalapril, 0.5 mg kg−1 twice daily, with the 15th dose withheld on the day of anesthesia (ENA-W), and oral enalapril, 0.5 mg kg−1 twice daily, with the 15th dose administered 90 minutes prior to anesthetic induction (ENA). On day 8 of each treatment period, dogs were anesthetized in random order utilizing a standard protocol. Following stabilization at an end-tidal isoflurane concentration (Fe′Iso) of 1.3%, invasively measured systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) arterial blood pressure were continuously recorded via telemetry. Hypotension (SAP < 85 mmHg) was treated with the following sequential interventions: lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) bolus (10 mL kg−1); repeated LRS bolus; dopamine (7 μg kg−1 min−1); and dopamine (10 μg kg−1 min−1) first without and then with vasopressin (1 mU kg−1 hour−1).Compared with the PLA but not the ENA-W group, the ENA group had significantly lower average SAP, DAP and MAP at an Fe′Iso of 1.3%, spent more minutes in hypotension, and required a greater number of interventions to correct moderate-to-severe mean arterial hypotension.In healthy dogs, enalapril administered 90 minutes prior to isoflurane anesthesia increases the degree of intra-anesthetic hypotension and the number of interventions required to correct moderate-to-severe hypotension.Dogs receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on the day of anesthesia may exhibit clinically significant intra-anesthetic hypotension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aadministered dose 3aanesthesia 3aangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 3ablood pressure 3across-over studies 3adogs 3adopamine 3afemales 3ahypotension 3aisoflurane 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3atelemetry 3avasopressin 0aangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 0adog 0aenalapril 0aintraoperative hypotension 0arenin–angiotensin–aldosterone system1 aShepard, Molly K.1 aSchmiedt, Chad W.1 aHofmeister, Erik H.1 aBrown, Scott A.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2016 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.482-494dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.123383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245010200208520153100310592002801841650001701869650001301886650002401899650001701923650002301940650001701963650001901980650001801999650000702017650001902024650001302043650001702056650001502073650001702088650001802105653002002123653002102143653002302164653002102187653001902208653002702227700002002254700002002274773010202294856008602396852000902482655001202491IND60747979020221120215803.0211007e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074797902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1071092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGmach, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2247-590710aFreeze-thaw stability of emulsions made with native and enzymatically modified egg yolk fractions  aFrozen storage of food emulsions can increase their tenability and create possible applications in frozen food products. However, coalescence and phase separation can occur during freezing/thawing. In order to assess options for mitigating freeze/thaw-destabilization, egg yolk's emulsifying functionality in the form of whole egg yolk and its granula and plasma fractions was investigated. The fractions were enzymatically pretreated (phospholipase A₂) and their emulsifying functionalities were assessed in dependence of pH, salinity, freezing velocity and frozen storage time with oil droplet size and phase separation as measures. Mayonnaise-type oil in water emulsions of sunflower oil were prepared at pH 3, 4 and 6.5 with a salt content of 0.15 and 0.55 M NaCl with a colloid mill. The emulsions were frozen to −20 °C with varying freezing rates and stored up to 24 h. Egg yolk and plasma stabilized emulsions showed higher freeze/thaw stabilities than granule stabilized emulsions. Enzymatic treatment increased the stability of emulsions prepared with egg yolk and granula, but decreased the stability for plasma stabilized emulsions. The destabilization increased with longer frozen storage time. Very slow or fast freezing velocity resulted in higher destabilization effects than an intermediate freezing rate at low salt content. Increasing salinity from 0.15 to 0.55 M NaCl as well as increasing pH from 3 to 6.5 resulted in more stable emulsions and highest destabilization at the highest freezing rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplet size 3aegg yolk 3aenzymatic treatment 3afood storage 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afrozen foods 3afrozen storage 3ahydrocolloids 3apH 3aphospholipases 3asalinity 3asalt content 3aseparation 3astorage time 3asunflower oil 0aEgg yolk plasma 0aEgg yolk granula 0aEmulsion stability 0aPhospholipase A2 0aIonic strength 0aEgg yolk fractionation1 aGolda, Johannes1 aKulozik, Ulrich0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Feb., v. 123 p.107109-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1071093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015500175300001600330520095700346592002801303650002501331650001501356650001601371650001401387650001401401650001101415650001901426650002301445650001501468650000901483650002101492653002301513653002101536653002101557653002001578653001701598700003101615700002601646700002301672700002801695700003001723700003001753773010001783856008701883852000901970655001201979IND60617965520221122042950.0190402e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061796552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.10.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchante, Lourdes10aOenological potential of extracts from winery and cooperage by-products in combination with colloidal silver as natural substitutes to sulphur dioxide  ap. 485-493.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the oenological potential of natural extracts from winery and cooperage by-products, either alone or with a colloidal silver complex (CSC), on the quality of red wines, as possible substitutes to SO2. Natural extracts were obtained from grape seeds and American oak wood by accelerated extraction with subcritical water. The prefermentative addition of grape seed or oak wood extracts was an useful tool to control acetic acid bacteria development, without affecting the alcoholic and malolactic fermentations. Both extracts protected the wines against oxidation, without negatively modifying their phenolic and volatile composition. They did not cause organoleptic defects in wines, which presented greater aromatic complexity and were positively evaluated by the tasters. Therefore, the use of grape seed or oak wood extracts in red vinification could be a good alternative to replace or reduce the doses of SO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid bacteria 3abyproducts 3agrape seeds 3aoxidation 3ared wines 3asilver 3asulfur dioxide 3avolatile compounds 3awinemaking 3awood 3awood extractives 0aGrape seed extract 0aOak wood extract 0aColloidal silver 0aSulphur dioxide 0aWine quality1 aIzquierdo-Cañas, Pedro M.1 aGómez-Alonso, Sergio1 aAlañón, M.

Well-structured foreign land leases and investments might offer development benefits to the host countries including opportunities for employment, provision of capital for improvement of infrastructure and stabilization of food prices. However, most foreign land lease deals in Africa are often characterized by secret negotiations and lack of local stakeholder consultations. Consequently, the land deals often result in displacement of land owners and loss of their customary land rights such as grazing and fuel wood access rights. The situation is exacerbated by relatively low monetary compensation offered to the land owners by the foreign investors. In recent years, numerous protests by the excluded stakeholders have resulted to considerable loss of investments and disruption of livelihoods. Against this backdrop, the present study analyzed local community members' preferences for foreign land lease design attributes in coastal Kenya using choice experiment survey data from a random sample of 200 respondents. Results showed that respondents prefer varying payment levels in order to allow design of leases that incorporate the following attributes: short lease duration (up to 15 years); renewable leases after joint negotiations and; provision of formal employment to land owners’ household members. These insights should be incorporated in the design of foreign land leases to promote harmony between land owners and leasers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acapital 3aemployment 3afuelwood 3ainfrastructure 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aKenya 0aAgriculture 0aForeign land lease 0aLocal stakeholder preferences1 aOluoch-Kosura, Willis0 tHeliyon.g2019 Oct., v. 5, no. 10 p.e02730-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e027303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002800192245011500220500001900335506007600354520122700430592002801657506003701685650001201722650001001734651001701744653002101761653001701782653001101799653001101810653001901821653001401840653001401854700002401868700002701892773009401919856008502013852000902098655001202107IND60690124320221207093617.0200508e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069012432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e027312doi7 aPMC68615742pmcid7 a317634692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlabi, Oluwatobi Joseph14aThe lived experiences of postgraduate female students at the University of Kwazulu Natal, Durban, South Africa  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGender and educational equality have been extensively debated by scholars in South Africa, researchers have failed to capitalize on why enthusiastic postgraduate female students have a higher dropout rate than their male counterparts. This study has capitalized on this vacuity, via a phenomenological lens, to examine the challenges experienced by female postgraduate students at University of KwaZulu-Natal. This study presents the lived experiences of ten female postgraduate honours students from University of KwaZulu-Natal in 2017. The study sought to research the learner's impetus to pursue postgraduate studies and the limitations eminent during the process. The ostensive constraints acknowledged by participants have seeped in socio-cultural beliefs rooted in traditional and religious affirmations, financial impediments and balancing their educational pursuit with traditional role expectations within their gendered familial domain. This study advances the requirement to critique the socio-cultural principles that impede females' succession in postgraduate studies while simultaneously engaging in discourse on the concealed practices in higher educational institutions separating students based on gender.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afemales 3amales 3aSouth Africa 0aHigher education 0aPostgraduate 0aGender 0aFemale 0aSocio-cultural 0aEducation 0aSociology1 aSeedat-Khan, Mariam1 aAbdullahi, Ali Arazeem0 tHeliyon.g2019 Nov., v. 5, no. 11 p.e02731-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e027313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245011500161300001800276500002000294520245000314592002802764650002202792650002302814650001202837650002202849650002202871650001402893650001102907650001402918650002102932650001702953700002102970700002302991700002003014700001903034773010303053856007903156852000903235655001203244IND60571314520221121044352.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057131452DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.126482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aHydrologically contrasting environments induce genetic but not phenotypic differentiation in Solanum dulcamara  ap. 1649-1661.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn contrasting habitats, locally adapted populations are expected to evolve through directional selection. Hydrological gradients provide a scenario where strong selection forces have led to species segregation in communities along the hydrological niche axes due to specific adaptations to their ambient environment. However, much less is known about the processes enabling species with wide ecological amplitudes, such as Solanum dulcamara L., to occupy the contrasting niches at the far ends of the gradient. Here, we investigate the question whether local adaptation is indeed the driving mechanism enabling this species to inhabit contrasting wet and dry habitats. Using molecular analyses and performing a common garden experiment, we examined whether genetic and phenotypic differentiation had occurred between populations originating from flooding‐ and drought‐prone habitat pairs from nine different locations. We also tested whether plants were better adapted to their home site stress. We found a significant genetic variation but hardly any phenotypic differentiation between populations from contrasting habitats for plants grown under optimal conditions. Surprisingly, comparison of the genetic differentiation in neutral markers with that in phenotypic traits using the QST‐FST (estimated by ФPT) approach revealed that the QST values were consistently and significantly smaller than the ФPT values. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that directional selection is an important component enabling S. dulcamara to survive under contrasting habitat conditions. In addition, no home site effects were detected for responses to flooding and drought treatments. All plants were characterized by high levels of plasticity for traits associated with flooding and drought tolerance, such as rapid adventitious root formation upon flooding and increased root to shoot ratio in response to drought, irrespective of habitat of origin. Moreover, no trade‐offs in such flooding and drought responses were found. Synthesis. Our results show that S. dulcamara has not evolved locally adapted populations in response to flooding and drought stress, despite genetic differentiation and despite the presumably strong selection gradient. The generally high levels of adaptive plasticity in traits increasing flooding and drought tolerance may be the main mechanism allowing S. dulcamara to occupy hydrologically contrasting habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum dulcamara 3aadventitious roots 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic variation 3ahydrology 3aniches 3aphenotype 3aroot shoot ratio 3awater stress1 aPeters, Janny L.1 aVisser, Eric J.

Loss of 14-3-3γ in HCT116 cells led to defects in desmosome assembly due to a decrease in the transport of Plakoglobin (PG) to the cell border thus disrupting desmosome formation. Desmosome formation in cells lacking 14-3-3γ was restored by artificially localizing PG to the cell border by fusing it to EGFP-f (PG-EGFP-f). These results suggest that a major role of 14-3-3γ in desmosome assembly is to transport PG to the cell border leading to the initiation of desmosome formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3adesmosomes 3agamma catenin 3aresearch 0aDesmosome 0aPlakoglobin 0aCell-cell adhesion 0a14-3-3γ1 aTilwani, Sarika1 aDalal, Sorab N.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 08, v. 495, no. 2 p.1998-2003dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.12.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245008600160300001800246520137500264592002801639650001401667650002101681650002601702650001601728653002401744653003701768653004301805653003301848653002201881700001601903700001801919700001901937700001901956700001701975700001901992700005702011700005602068773013902124856007802263852000902341655001202350IND60683223820221121034426.0200207e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b187722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Jaeho10aFunctionalized Organic Material Platform for Realization of Ternary Logic Circuit  ap. 6119-6126.  aNegative differential resistance/transconductance (NDR/NDT) has been attracting significant attention as a key functionality in the development of multivalued logic (MVL) systems that can overcome the limits of conventional binary logic devices. A high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) and more than double-peak transfer characteristics are required to achieve a stable MVL operation. In this study, an organic NDR (ONDR) device with double-peak transfer characteristics and a high peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR; >10²) is fabricated by utilizing an organic material platform for the development of a key element device for MVL applications. The organic NDT (ONDT) device is fabricated using a series connection of electron-dominant (P(NDI2OD-Se2)) and hole-dominant (P(DPP2DT-T2)) channel ambipolar organic field-effect transistors (AOFETs), and the NDR feature is achieved via correlated biasing of the ONDT device. The PVCR of the ONDT device can reach up to 13,000 via carrier transfer modulation of the AOFETs by varying the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the mixed layer that is used as the top-gate dielectric of each AOFET. Further, ternary latch circuit operation is demonstrated using the developed ONDR device that stores three logic states with three distinct and controllable output states by adjusting the PMMA:P(VDF-TrFE) ratio of the dielectric layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrons 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3atransistors 0aorganic electronics 0anegative differential resistance 0anegative differential transconductance 0apeak-to-valley current ratio 0amultivalued logic1 aKim, Min Je1 aShin, Gicheol1 aLee, Myeongjae1 aKim, Young Jae1 aKim, BongSoo1 aLee, Yoonmyung1 aCho, Jeong Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1030-99201 aLee, Sungjoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1284-35930 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 12, no. 5 p.6119-6126dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b187723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100004500143245012400188300001600312520126800328592002801596650002301624650001401647650001301661650001001674650002301684650002101707650001501728650002001743650002601763650001601789650001601805650001301821650002201834650001501856650001401871650001401885650001701899650001801916650001701934651001701951653003301968653002402001653001402025653002302039653002002062700002402082700002602106700002102132700002102153700001802174700003402192773011202226856007702338852000902415655001202424IND60574355320221116182828.0170726e20170404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057435532DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2016-07842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira-Francesquini, Josiele Polzin10aDifferential colonization by bioprospected rhizobial bacteria associated with common bean in different cropping systems  ap. 682-689.  aIn this study, we evaluated the diversity of rhizobia isolated from root nodules on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) derived from Andean and Mesoamerican centers and grown under field and greenhouse conditions. Genetic characterization of isolates was performed by sequencing analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and 2 housekeeping genes, recA and glnII, and by the amplification of nifH. Symbiotic efficiency was evaluated by examining nodulation, plant biomass production, and plant nitrogen (N) accumulation. The influence of the environment was observed in nodulation capacity, where Rhizobium miluonense was dominant under greenhouse conditions and the Rhizobium acidisoli group prevailed under field conditions. However, strain LGMB41 fit into a separate group from the type strain of R. acidisoli in terms of multilocus phylogeny, implying that it could belong to a new species. Rhizobium miluonense LGMB73 showed the best symbiotic efficiency performance, i.e., with the highest shoot-N content (77.7 mg/plant), superior to the commercial standard strain (56.9 mg/plant). Biodiversity- and bioprospecting-associated studies are important to better understand ecosystems and to develop more effective strategies to improve plant growth using a N-fixation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRhizobium 3abacteria 3abeans 3abiomass production 3acropping systems 3aecosystems 3aessential genes 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3anew species 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aphylogeny 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot nodules 3aAndes region 0abiological nitrogen fixation 0amultilocus analysis 0aRhizobium 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0acropping system1 aHungria, Mariangela1 aSavi, Daiani Cristina1 aGlienke, Chirlei1 aAluizio, Rodrigo1 aKava, Vanessa1 aGalli-Terasawa, Lygia Vitoria0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2017 Apr. 4, v. 63, no. 8 p.682-689dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2016-07843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245008300198300001800281520116100299592002801460650001601488650001101504650003101515650002101546650001501567650001301582650001401595650001701609650002201626653002401648653002801672653001001700653003001710700001601740700001701756700001901773700001601792700001901808700001401827700001201841700001701853773013901870856007802009852000902087655001202096IND60683223920221121034332.0200207e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322392DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b187992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jishi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0605-040X10aSurface Roughness: A Crucial Factor To Robust Electric Double Layer Capacitors  ap. 5786-5792.  aElectric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) usually show high rate performance and long cycling spans but inferior specific capacitance, which are mainly created by restriction of the charge storage mechanism. To improve the capacitive performance, traditional methods include enlarging surface area, optimizing porous structures, and readjusting functional groups through heteroatom doping to electrode materials. Besides that, another promising approach is suggested, which is to enhance surface roughness of the electrode materials for ion storage and transport. To prove this view, two porous carbon materials were fabricated by activation–calcination methods, which allowed the materials to have identical surface area, porous structures, and surface composition but the surface roughness. Further electrochemical measurements exhibited that the optimal sample with higher roughness has remarkable specific capacitance (up to 562 F g–¹), and the increment rate is more than 50% when compared with contrast sample (367 F g–¹). Therefore, optimization of the surface roughness of electrode materials is another efficient route to make robust EDLCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amoieties 3aroughness 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 0achemical activation 0aporous carbon materials 0aEDLCs 0ahigh specific capacitance1 aLi, Yongbin1 aDai, Dongmei1 aZhang, Fengtao1 aZou, Hongli1 aYang, Xiaoxiao1 aJi, Yahui1 aLi, Bao1 aWei, Xianjun0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 12, no. 5 p.5786-5792dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b187993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245011200167300001800279500002000297520155200317592002801869650001401897650001501911650001601926650001301942650001101955650001101966650001401977700002601991700002502017773010302042856007902145852000902224655001202233IND60571314720221121044458.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057131472DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.126322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelsh, Miranda E.14aThe role of habitat filtering in the leaf economics spectrum and plant susceptibility to pathogen infection  ap. 1768-1777.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) describes global covariation in the traits of plant leaves. The LES is thought to arise from biophysical constraints and habitat filtering (ecological selection against unfit trait combinations along environmental gradients). However, the role of habitat filtering in generating the LES has not been tested experimentally. If the process of habitat filtering plays a role in generating the LES, the LES could weaken in communities that have yet to be filtered by the current environment, for example after abiotic environmental change. LES traits are commonly used to predict community and ecosystem processes, and if the LES weakens in unfiltered communities, LES‐based models may no longer apply. In the glasshouse, we experimentally simulated three stages of habitat filtering in response to abiotic change: from unfiltered, to semi‐filtered, to completely filtered communities. In each stage, we quantified the strength of the LES and assessed the accuracy of trait‐based models of an important ecological process, pathogen infection. The strength of the LES increased with the completeness of habitat filtering, as did the accuracy of trait‐based models of plant susceptibility to pathogen infection. Synthesis. Our results suggest that habitat filtering plays a fundamental role in strengthening the trait correlations of the LES and that trait‐based models may be less accurate when communities have not been filtered by the current environment, for example, following rapid environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3aecosystems 3agreenhouses 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3amodels 3apathogens1 aCronin, James Patrick1 aMitchell, Charles E.0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 104, no. 6 p.1768-1777dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165300001800262520135100280592002801631650001701659650003201676650001901708650001701727650001701744650001301761650001001774650001301784650002801797650001001825650002301835650001201858650002101870650002001891650000901911650001401920650002201934650004401956650001202000650000902012651001602021700001802037700002002055773011502075856008102190852000902271655001202280IND60596494320221120043024.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059649432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3772-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBak, Eun-Jung10aDetection and phylogenetic analysis of a new adenoviral polymerase gene in reptiles in Korea  ap. 1663-1669.  aOver a period of 7 years (2004-2011), samples from 34 diseased reptiles provided by local governments, zoos, and pet shops were tested for viral infection. Animals were diagnosed based on clinical signs, including loss of appetite, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, and unexpected sudden death. Most of the exotic animals had gastrointestinal problems, such as mucosal redness and ulcers, while the native animals had no clinical symptoms. Viral sequences were found in seven animals. Retroviral genes were amplified from samples from five Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus), an adenovirus was detected in a panther chameleon (Furcifer pardalis), and an adenovirus and a paramyxovirus were detected in a tropical girdled lizard (Cordylus tropidosternum). Phylogenetic analysis of retroviruses and paramyxoviruses showed the highest sequence identity to both a Python molurus endogenous retrovirus and a Python curtus endogenous retrovirus and to a lizard isolate, respectively. Partial sequencing of an adenoviral DNA polymerase gene from the lizard isolate suggested that the corresponding virus was a novel isolate different from the reference strain (accession no. AY576677.1). The virus was not isolated but was detected, using molecular genetic techniques, in a lizard raised in a pet shop. This animal was also coinfected with a paramyxovirus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aPython molurus 3aRespirovirus 3aRetroviridae 3aanorexia 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3alizards 3alocal government 3amixed infection 3apets 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aviruses 3azoos 3aSouth Korea1 aJho, Yeonsook1 aWoo, Gye-Hyeong0 tArchives of virology.g2018 June, v. 163, no. 6 p.1663-1669dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3772-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245008700215500001900302506007600321520086500397592002801262506003701290650002501327650002101352650001501373650001101388650001301399650001101412650002201423653002201445653002601467653003401493653002201527653002001549653002401569653002301593700002901616700002701645773009401672856008501766852000901851655001201860IND60690124720221207093620.0200508e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069012472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e027352doi7 aPMC68389582pmcid7 a317204732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevitskiy, Oleg A.10aDiarylamine/diarylnitroxide cycle: quantum chemical and electrochemical estimation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPossibility for diarylamine/diarylnitroxide cycling via electrochemical N–O bond formation/bond breaking processes was considered using quantum-chemical and electrochemical methods. It was shown that electrochemically reduced diarylnitroxides undergo fast N–O bond cleavage in the presence of oxophilic Li ions. The possible reaction scheme was suggested. In contrast, in the presence of Na+ salts, aminoxyl anions are stable and can be considered as possible anodic redox active material in energy storage systems utilizing Na+ ions migration. Direct oxygenation of diarylaminyl radicals with dioxygen yielding diarylnitroxide is not feasible; multiple competing routes involving the aromatic moiety are observed instead. The results obtained shed light on possibilities and limitations for functioning of nitroxide-based redox active electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3aquantum mechanics 0aOrganic chemistry 0aTheoretical chemistry 0aElectrochemical bond cleavage 0aDiaryl nitroxides 0aRedox materials 0aElectrode reactions 0aSpecific solvation1 aSentyurin, Vyacheslav V.1 aMagdesieva, Tatiana V.0 tHeliyon.g2019 Oct., v. 5, no. 10 p.e02735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e027353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245009300179300001600272500000900288520180100297592002802098650002302126650001502149650002302164650001702187650002002204650002302224650002502247650001502272650002502287650002202312651001102334700001902345773012002364852000902484856009802493655001202591IND2201764720221117201700.0191122e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176472DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900030027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, C.

Crop-Water Requirements and Response to Irrigation  ap. 775-783.  aepub  aForage legume seed crop reproduction can be modified by regulating soil-water availability. However, responses to water stress differ for each species, so a single optimal water management strategy is not available for all crops. The objectives of this research were to determine the crop-water requirements and the optimal water management conditions for birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) when grown for seed production under humid temperate marine climatic conditions of western Oregon, USA. The experiment was conducted on a Woodburn silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquultic Argixeroll) near Corvallis. Four single-application treatments varying in water depletion percentage (30 and 60% of field capacity) and replenishment amount (50 and 100% of amount depleted) were applied in 1994 and 1995. A low-stress treatment (LS) that received two to three applications per week of the amount depleted since the last application and a non-irrigated control were also investigated in 1994,1995, and 1996. Increasing amounts of applied water resulted in increased seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with plants grown under lowstress having the greatest ETc and non-irrigated control plants the least (r = 0.91). The fraction of available soil water used by nonirrigated plants was greatest and the LS treatment the least of all treatments. For non-irrigated conditions, the crop-water requirement ranged from 240 to 255 mm. Soil-water conditions favorable for high vegetative development were opposite of the conditions for optimal seed yield water-use efficiency. Unlike other forage legume seed crops, birdsfoot trefoil grown under these conditions required minimal or no supplemental irrigation to achieve maximal seed yield. Oregon Agric. Exp. Stn.

Phenolic characterization and antioxidant activity (AA) measurements of wines lees solid-liquid extracts have been undertaken on a dry extract (DE) basis. Solvents with different polarities (water, methanol, ethanol, two hydroalcoholic mixtures and acetone) were used. Total phenolic (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) were determined. The mixture of 75:25(v/v) EtOH:H2O showed the highest values with 254 mgGAE/gDE and 146 mgCATE/gDE respectively. HORAC, HOSC and FRAP were used to determine the AA of the extracts being also highest for the mixture of 75:25(v/v) EtOH:H2O (4690 µmolCAE/gDE, 4527 µmolTE/gDE and 2197 µmolTE/gDE, respectively). For ORAC method, methanol extract showed the best value with 2771 µmolTE/gDE. Correlations between TPC, TFC, phenolic compounds and AA were determined. Most relevant compounds contributing to AA were identified using data from mass spectrometry, being mainly anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abarrels 3abioactive compounds 3aethanol 3alees 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3aphenolic compounds 3asolvents 3awine aging 3awood 0aAging wine lees 0aPhenolic characterization 0aAntioxidant activity 0aLC–MS/MS 0aCorrelation study 0aAnthocyanins1 aRodríguez-Rojo, S.1 aCocero, M.J.1 aDuarte, C.M.M.1 aMatias, A.A.1 aBronze, M.R.0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 259 p.188-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.03.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245014800184520123900332592002801571650002401599650001801623650001501641650002601656650001401682650002101696650002001717653001801737653002901755653002401784653001401808653002201822700002801844700002701872700006701899700003001966700001901996773011902015856008802134852000902222655001202231IND60678286220221120034634.0200503e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067828622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Martínez, Leonardo10aEffect of the length of dark storage following ultraviolet irradiation of Tetraselmis suecica and its implications for ballast water management  aMeeting the recent biological standards established by the Ballast Water Management Convention requires the application of ballast water treatment systems; ultraviolet irradiation is a frequently used option. However, organisms can repair the damage caused by ultraviolet irradiation primarily with photo-repair mechanisms that are dependent on the availability of light. The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of dark storage following ultraviolet irradiation on the viability of the microalgae Tetraselmis suecica. Results showed that one day of dark storage after ultraviolet irradiation enhanced the inactivation rate by 50% with respect to the absence of dark storage and increased up to the 84% with five days of dark storage. These results are consistent with photorepair, mostly in the first two days, prevented in the dark. The dose required to inactivate a determined ratio of organisms was correlated with the length of the dark post-treatment according to an inverse proportional function. This correlation may help to optimize the operation of ultraviolet ballast water treatment systems. Further, the results show that growth assays can detect organisms that are capable of repair after treatment with UV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetraselmis suecica 3aballast water 3amicroalgae 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviability 3awater management 3awater treatment 0aBallast water 0aUltraviolet disinfection 0aTetraselmis suecica 0aViability 0aPhotoreactivation1 aRivas-Zaballos, Ignacio1 aMoreno-Andrés, Javier1 aMoreno-Garrido, Ignacio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2664-87131 aAcevedo-Merino, Asunción1 aNebot, Enrique0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 711 p.134611-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245012200173300001800295520177400313592002802087650002002115650001502135650002302150650001102173650001302184650001802197650002302215650001502238650001802253650001502271650002202286650002102308650001702329650001802346650001302364650002002377650002502397650001402422653001902436653002802455653003302483653002202516653003002538700002202568700002202590700002202612700002402634700003202658700006402690700005702754773013902811856007802950852000903028655001203037IND60683224220200401000000.0200207e20200116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b188682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Merino, Paloma10aNovel WS₂-Based Nanofluids for Concentrating Solar Power: Performance Characterization and Molecular-Level Insights  ap. 5793-5804.  aNano-colloidal suspensions of nanomaterials in a fluid, nanofluids, are appealing because of their interesting properties related to heat transfer processes. While nanomaterials based on transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been widely studied in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage applications, there are few studies of nanofluids based on TMCs for heat transfer applications. In this study, the preparation and analysis of nanofluids based on 2D-WS₂ in a typical heat transfer fluid (HTF) used in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants are reported. Nanofluids prepared using an exfoliation process exhibited well-defined nanosheets and were highly stable. The nanofluids were characterized in terms of properties related to their application in CSP. The presence of WS₂ nanosheets did not modify significantly the surface tension, the viscosity, or the isobaric specific heat, but the thermal conductivity was improved by up to 30%. The Uᵣ factor, which characterizes the thermal efficiency of the fluid in the solar collector, shows an enhancement of up to 22% in the nanofluid, demonstrating great promise for CSP applications. The Reynolds number and friction factor of the fluid were not significantly modified by the addition of the nanomaterial to the HTF, which is also positive for practical applications in CSP plants. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the nanoparticle/fluid interface showed an irreversible dissociative adsorption of diphenyl oxide molecules on the WS₂ edge, with very low kinetic barrier. The resulting “decoration” of the WS₂ edge dramatically affects the nature of the interface interactions and is therefore expected to affect significantly the rheological and transport properties of the nanofluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aadsorption 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3afriction 3aheat transfer 3amolecular dynamics 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3asimulation models 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3aspecific heat 3asulfides 3asurface tension 3athermal conductivity 3aviscosity 0aWS2 nanosheets 0adissociative adsorption 0aab initio molecular dynamics 0asurface chemistry 0aconcentrating solar power1 aMidgley, Scott D.1 aMartín, Elisa I.1 aEstellé, Patrice1 aAlcántara, Rodrigo1 aSánchez-Coronilla, Antonio1 aGrau-Crespo, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8845-17191 aNavas, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7569-08090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 16, v. 12, no. 5 p.5793-5804dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b188683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245012200209300001800331520181200349592002802161650003602189650001502225650004902240650001202289650001302301650001802314650002602332650002202358650001102380650001102391650002102402650002102423650001302444650002002457650003002477650002202507650003702529700005702566700006302623700005902686700006502745773011902810856008302929852000903012655001203021IND60615171920221119184234.0181009e20180918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061517192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobbins, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5730-253110aPhotoirradiation Generates an Ultrastable 8-Formyl FAD Semiquinone Radical with Unusual Properties in Formate Oxidase  ap. 5818-5826.  aFormate oxidase (FOX) was previously shown to contain a noncovalently bound 8-formyl FAD (8-fFAD) cofactor. However, both the absorption spectra and the kinetic parameters previously reported for FOX are inconsistent with more recent reports. The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectrum reported in early studies closely resembles the spectra observed for protein-bound 8-formyl flavin semiquinone species, thus suggesting FOX may be photosensitive. Therefore, the properties of dark and light-exposed FOX were investigated using steady-state kinetics and site-directed mutagenesis analysis along with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Surprisingly, these experimental results demonstrate that FOX is deactivated in the presence of light through generation of an oxygen stable, anionic (red) 8-fFAD semiquinone radical capable of persisting either in an aerobic environment for multiple weeks or in the presence of a strong reducing agent like sodium dithionite. Herein, we study the photoinduced formation of the 8-fFAD semiquinone radical in FOX and report the first EPR spectrum of this radical species. The stability of the 8-fFAD semiquinone radical suggests FOX to be a model enzyme for probing the structural and mechanistic features involved in stabilizing flavin semiquinone radicals. It is likely that the photoinduced formation of a stable 8-fFAD semiquinone radical is a defining characteristic of 8-formyl flavin-dependent enzymes. Additionally, a better understanding of the radical stabilization process may yield a FOX enzyme with more robust activity and broader industrial usefulness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adithionite 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenzymes 3aformates 3afree radicals 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphotoirradiation 3aphotosensitivity 3aquinones 3areducing agents 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aGeng, Jiafeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9488-09741 aBarry, Bridgette A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3421-14071 aGadda, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7508-41951 aBommarius, Andreas S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4658-16750 tBiochemistry.g2018 Sept. 18, v. 57, no. 40 p.5818-5826dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245009100179300001600270500000900286500001500295520155400310592002801864650004501892650001601937650001101953650001801964650003001982650001302012650001902025650002302044650002502067650002302092650002302115650002002138651001302158653001402171653002502185653003702210653002602247653002702273653002502300653001402325700001702339773012002356852000902476856009802485655001202583IND2201765920221117201724.0191122e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176592DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900030031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, G.

Merr.]. Plant introduction (PI) 417479 has demonstrated resistance to PSD in a wide array of environments. This resistance has been interpreted to support models of qualitative inheritance; however, the lack of discrete separation between resistant and susceptible classes indicates that resistance to this disease may be genetically complex or markedly influenced by environmental factors. This study was conducted to identify genomic regions associated with resistance to PSD using random restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. PI 417479 was crossed with each of two susceptible soybean cultivars, Agripro AP 350 and Williams 82. In 1993 and 1994, F₂ and F₂-derived lines for each population were scored for PSD incidence near Columbia, MO. Screening based on 188 RFLP markers in all combinations with five restriction enzymes identified 43 polymorphic markers in the PI 417479 × AP 350 population and 26 polymorphic markers in the PI 417479 × Williams 82 population. Marker A708, which identifies a genomic region in linkage group F, was associated with PSD resistance in both populations and both years. This marker, when used in combination with restriction enzyme DraI, explained from 21.0 to 62.2% of the phenotypic variation in PSD disease response. The use of marker A708 could enhance efforts to incorporate resistance to PSD into improved soybean cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aGlycine max 3agenome 3adeterioration 3afungal diseases of plants 3acrossing 3aseed pathology 3achromosome mapping 3aDiaporthe longicolla 3adisease resistance 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic markers 3aMissouri 0aPhomopsis 0aPhomopsis longicolla 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0abiological resistance 0ainheritance (genetics) 0agenetic polymorphism 0aDiaporthe1 aMinor, H.

Although regulation at the transcriptional level is one of the most prominent mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated, only a few transcription factors have been identified and demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of sugar-regulated gene expression. OsMYBS1, an R1/2-type MYB transcription factor, has been demonstrated to be involved in sugar- and hormone-regulated α-amylase gene expression in rice. Arabidopsis contains two OsMYBS1 homologs. In the present study, we investigate MYBS1 and MYBS2 in sugar signaling in Arabidopsis. Our results indicate that MYBS1 and MYBS2 play opposite roles in regulating glucose and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis during seed germination and early seedling development. MYB proteins have been classified into four subfamilies: R2R3-MYB, R1/2-MYB, 3R-MYB, and 4R-MYB. An R1/2-type MYB transcription factor, OsMYBS1, has been demonstrated to be involved in sugar- and hormone-regulated α-amylase genes expression in rice. In this study, two genes homologous to OsMYBS1, MYBS1 and MYBS2, were investigated in Arabidopsis. Subcellular localization analysis showed that MYBS1 and MYBS2 were localized in the nucleus. Rice embryo transient expression assays indicated that both MYBS1 and MYBS2 could recognize the sugar response element, TA-box, in the promoter and induced promoter activity. mybs1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to glucose, whereas mybs2 seedlings were hyposensitive to it. MYBS1 and MYBS2 are involved in the control of glucose-responsive gene expression, as the mybs1 mutant displayed increased expression of a hexokinase gene (HXK1), chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene (CAB1), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene (APL3), and chalcone synthase gene (CHS), whereas the mybs2 mutant exhibited decreased expression of these genes. mybs1 also showed an enhanced response to abscisic acid (ABA) in the seed germination and seedling growth stages, while mybs2 showed reduced responses. The ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone rescued the mybs1 glucose-hypersensitive phenotype. Moreover, the mRNA levels of three ABA biosynthesis genes, ABA1, NCED9, and AAO3, and three ABA signaling genes, ABI3, ABI4, and ABI5, were increased upon glucose treatment of mybs1 seedlings, but were decreased in mybs2 seedlings. These results indicate that MYBS1 and MYBS2 play opposite roles in regulating glucose and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis during seed germination and early seedling development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabscisic acid 3aalpha-amylase 3abiosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3afluridone 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3ahexokinase 3ahypersensitivity 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aphenotype 3arice 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aChao, Yi-Chi1 aTseng, Tzu-Wei1 aHuang, Chun-Kai1 aLo, Pei-Ching1 aLu, Chung-An0 tPlant molecular biology.g2017 Feb., v. 93, no. 3 p.299-311dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-016-0562-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245010100170520121300271592002801484650001501512650002101527650002801548650002601576650001601602650001401618650002301632650001301655650002301668650001901691650001601710650001301726653002701739653001501766653003201781653002601813653002501839700001701864700001601881700001801897700001801915700001701933700001901950700001901969700001201988700001602000700001902016700001702035773009302052856009102145852000902236655001202245IND60679011020221121152133.0220523e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067901102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1196842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Chao10aOrganic semiconducting polymer amphiphile for near-infrared-II light-triggered phototheranostics  aDevelopment of near-infrared-II (NIR-II) light responsive nano-agents with high photothermal stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), and excellent biocompatibility for photoacoustic (PA) imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) is of tremendous significance. In spite of the superiority of organic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (OSPNs) in PA imaging-guided PTT, the limited absorption in the first NIR (NIR-I) window and metastable nanostructure of OSPNs resulting from commonly used preparation methods based on nanoprecipitation or reprecipitation compromise their in vivo phototheranostic performance. Herein we design and synthesize a novel NIR-II absorbing organic semiconducting polymer amphiphile (OSPA) to enhance the structural stability of OSPNs. With prominent optical properties, low toxicity, and a suitable size, OSPA not only efficiently labels and kills cancer cells under NIR-II irradiation but also accumulates at the tumor of living mice upon intravenous injection, allowing efficient NIR-II light-triggered phototheranostics toward tumor. The developed OSPA has promising potential for fabricating multifunctional nanoplatforms to enable multimodal theranostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3aintravenous injection 3airradiation 3aneoplasms 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolymers 3aprecision medicine 3asemiconductors 3asurfactants 3atoxicity 0aSemiconducting polymer 0aAmphiphile 0aSecond near-infrared window 0aPhotoacoustic imaging 0aPhotothermal therapy1 aLi, Xiaozhen1 aWen, Guohua1 aYang, Boguang1 aZhang, Yachao1 aChen, Xiaoyu1 aZhao, Pengchao1 aLi, Shengliang1 aLi, Rui1 aWang, Lidai1 aLee, Chun-Sing1 aBian, Liming0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Feb., v. 232 p.119684-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1196843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002700183245016000210506007600370520140300446592002801849506003701877650001901914650001001933650002001943650002101963650001601984650002302000650001702023650000902040650002302049650001302072650001202085650003702097650001302134650002902147650001602176700001802192700002602210700001702236700002202253700002202275773011902297856007602416852000902492655001202501IND60648050020221207142405.0190626e20181208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064805002DNAL7 a10.3390/foods71202012doi7 aPMC63069112pmcid7 a305448272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran-Lam, Thanh-Thien 10aSimultaneous Determination of 18 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Daily Foods (Hanoi Metropolitan Area) by Gas Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&mdash;a large group of organic compounds&mdash;are extremely hazardous to human health. In this study, the 198 samples from six groups of daily food products in the Hanoi metropolitan area were collected and prepared by the QuEChERS sample treatment technique. The detection and identification of PAHs were obtained by gas chromatography&ndash;tandem mass spectrometry (GC&ndash;MS/MS) determination. The results demonstrated that the recovery of PAH compounds ranged approximately between 71% and 110% when the solvent evaporation condition was optimized using the nitrogen gas at a low temperature (1 &deg;C). The in-house method was validated in terms of linearity, extractive condition, repeatability, recovery, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). The ranges of average PAH levels were 9.3&ndash;9.6 &micro;g/kg (for instant noodles), 0.22&ndash;2.48 &micro;g/kg (for cakes) 0.91&ndash;4.83 &micro;g/kg (dried vegetables), 5.14&ndash;23.32 &micro;g/kg (teas), 4.82&ndash;24.35 &micro;g/kg (coffees), and 1.43&ndash;25.2 &micro;g/kg (grilled meats). The results indicated that the total concentrations of residual PAHs and benzo(a)pyrene in the instant noodles and grilled meat samples surpassed the maximum limits tolerated by the European Commission (35 &micro;g/kg and 5 &micro;g/kg, respectively) in many investigated samples.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acakes 3adetection limit 3adried vegetables 3aevaporation 3agas chromatography 3ahuman health 3ameat 3ametropolitan areas 3anitrogen 3anoodles 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature1 aHai Dao, Yen 1 aKim Thi Nguyen, Lien 1 aKim Ma, Hoi 1 aNguyen Tran, Hai 1 aTruong Le, Giang 0 tFoods.g2018 Dec. 08, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods71202013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01623naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002200185245004700207300001600254506007600270520063000346592002800976506003701004650002701041650001901068650001701087650001201104773010601116856007801222852000901300655001201309IND60171847820221207140018.0150602e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017184782DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.114.1350612doi7 aPMC45586892pmcid7 a258045392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassel, George W.10aAccuracy in Quantitative 3D Image Analysis  ap. 950-953.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aQuantitative 3D imaging is becoming an increasingly popular and powerful approach to investigate plant growth and development.

The investigation of specific psychrotrophic and mesophilic signatures together with the study of ability to grow at 6 °C and/or at 43 °C on optimal agar medium allowed highlighting twelve profiles, the major one corresponding to the species Bacillus weihenstephanensis (46.2% of the collection). The diversity of the profiles depended on the season and on the origin of the isolates. All the isolates were able to grow at the same level in liquid whole egg and in optimal medium, even at low temperature. Under the same conditions, the cytotoxic activity depended on the isolate, the medium and the temperature. At 10 °C, no isolate was cytotoxic in liquid whole egg and only one, belonging to the Bacillus weihenstephansensis species, in the optimal medium. All the isolates were able to adhere on stainless steel at various levels, from 2.6 ± 0.2 log cfu/cm² to 4.9 ± 0.1 log cfu/cm². A large majority (80.8%) was strongly adhering and could lead to the formation of biofilms in industrial equipments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus weihenstephanensis 3aagar 3aagricultural products 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3acell adhesion 3acytotoxicity 3aegg industry 3aeggs 3aequipment 3afarms 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3arisk 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3awarm season 2aBacillus cereusxclassificationxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aBacterial Adhesionxphysiology 2aBiodiversity 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEggsxmicrobiology 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeasons 2aStainless Steel1 aBrunet, N.1 aTecher, C.1 aLe Maréchal, C.1 aKoné, A.Z.1 aGrosset, N.1 aCochet, M.F.1 aGillard, A.1 aGautier, M.1 aPuterflam, J.1 aBaron, F.0 tFood microbiology.g2011 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.261-265dElsevier Ltdx0740-00207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2010.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05108naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006300144245018700207300001800394506011700412506007600529520258600605592002803191506003703219650001303256650002403269650001203293650001203305650001603317650001503333650000903348650001803357650002203375650002003397650001803417650002203435650002003457650001703477650001703494650002903511650001303540650002403553650002503577650001203602650002303614650000903637650002103646650001503667650002803682650002003710650001403730650001903744650002603763650001303789653001403802653002303816653002003839653003103859700005703890700002503947700002403972700006103996700002104057700002004078700002104098773015504119856007904274852000904353655001204362IND60700237320221207064914.0220830e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070023732DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-179362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Gastelen, Sanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4547-844910a3-Nitrooxypropanol decreases methane emissions and increases hydrogen emissions of early lactation dairy cows, with associated changes in nutrient digestibility and energy metabolism  ap. 8074-8093.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to determine the methane (CH₄) mitigation potential of 3-nitrooxypropanol and the persistency of its effect when fed to dairy cows in early lactation. Sixteen Holstein-Friesian cows (all multiparous; 11 cows in their second parity and 5 cows in their third parity) were blocked in pairs, based on actual calving date, parity, and previous lactation milk yield, and randomly allocated to 1 of 2 dietary treatments: a diet including 51 mg of 3-nitrooxypropanol/kg of dry matter (3-NOP) and a diet including a placebo at the same concentration (CON). Cows were fed a 35% grass silage, 25% corn silage, and 40% concentrate (on dry matter basis) diet from 3 d after calving up to 115 d in milk (DIM). Every 4 weeks, the cows were housed in climate respiration chambers for 5 d to measure lactation performance, feed and nutrient intake, apparent total-tract digestibility of nutrients, energy and N metabolism, and gaseous exchange (4 chamber visits per cow in total, representing 27, 55, 83, and 111 DIM). Feeding 3-NOP did not affect dry matter intake (DMI), milk yield, milk component yield, or feed efficiency. These variables were affected by stage of lactation, following the expected pattern of advanced lactation. Feeding 3-NOP did not affect CH₄ production (g/d) at 27 and 83 DIM, but decreased CH₄ production at 55 and 111 DIM by an average of 18.5%. This response in CH₄ production is most likely due to the differences observed in feed intake across the different stages of lactation because CH₄ yield (g/kg of DMI) was lower (on average 16%) at each stage of lactation upon feeding 3-NOP. On average, feeding 3-NOP increased H₂ production and intensity 12-fold; with the control diet, H₂ yield did not differ between the different stages of lactation, whereas with the 3-NOP treatment H₂ yield decreased from 0.429 g/kg of DMI at 27 DIM to 0.387 g/kg of DMI at 111 DIM. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and gross energy was greater for the 3-NOP treatment. In comparison to the control treatment, 3-NOP did not affect energy and N balance, except for a greater metabolizable energy intake to gross energy intake ratio (65.4 and 63.7%, respectively) and a greater body weight gain (average 0.90 and 0.01% body weight change, respectively). In conclusion, feeding 3-NOP is an effective strategy to decrease CH₄ emissions (while increasing H₂ emission) in early lactation Holstein-Friesian cows with positive effects on apparent total-tract digestibility of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abody weight changes 3acalving 3aclimate 3acorn silage 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3aearly lactation 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3afeed conversion 3agas exchange 3agrass silage 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ametabolizable energy 3amethane 3amethane production 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aparity (reproduction) 3aplacebos 0adairy cow 0a3-nitrooxypropanol 0alactation stage 0aenteric methane production1 aDijkstra, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3728-68851 aBinnendijk, Gisabeth1 aDuval, Stéphane M.1 aHeck, Jeroen M.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6772-24951 aKindermann, Maik1 aZandstra, Tamme1 aBannink, André,0 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Sept., v. 103, no. 9 p.8074-8093dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-179363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001600161245009200177300001600269500000900285500001500294520131000309592002801619650002801647650002101675650001901696650002301715650002201738650002801760650002501788650002001813653002401833653003701857700001601894700001801910700002101928773012001949852000902069856009802078655001202176IND2201767020221117201843.0191122e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176702DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900030034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Guihua10aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis of Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter]  ap. 819-824.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aTef, [Eragrostis tef(Zucc) Trotter, is a major cereal crop in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic relationships among tef accessions by the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. Forty-seven accessions of tef and one accession each of E. pilosa and E. curvula were analyzed. A total of 316 polymorphic DNA fragments across the three Eragrostis species were identified. The level of polymorphism within tef accessions was low (18%). However, with four or more primer pairs and a cluster analyses procedure, all the accessions included in the study were differentiated from each other. The three species studied fell in to three distinct clusters. Within tef, two major groups can be differentiated at 89% similarity. Because AFLP is reliable and enables assessment of potentially unlimited numbers of genetic loci, it permits greater insights into the genetic diversity of tef than had been possible with other available markers. Despite the low polymorphism level in tef, the availability of a large number of primer combinations and the high speed of the assay make AFLP an efficient marker technology for genetic diversity study of tef.

Fortification with different levels of Bi-Ca, over the range of 0–50% of whole wheat flour (w/w) on quality and sensory properties of crackers, were determined. Color, thickness, weight and textural properties of crackers varied with the different levels of Bio-Ca powder added, but it was found that up to 30% could be added without detrimental effect on sensory properties. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that the developed crackers were less porous and had a denser structure, compared to the control. Based on scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (SEM-EDX), the cracker containing Bio-Ca powder had calcium and phosphorous distribution with higher intensity, compared to the control. The fortified crackers were rich in calcium and phosphorous with higher protein content but lower fat, carbohydrate, cholesterol and energy value, compared to the control.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3acolor 3acrackers 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahealth promotion 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3aprotein content 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory properties 3atexture 3atuna 3awhole wheat flour 0aBio-calcium 0aTuna bone 0aWhole wheat cracker 0aCalcium fortification 0aNutritional value1 aKarnjanapratum, Supatra0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 259 p.181-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.03.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001600254520169300270592002801963650003501991650002002026650002202046650001202068650002402080650001902104650001802123650001302141650002002154650001102174650002302185650004302208650005202251650002702303700001902330700001402349700001602363700001502379700002002394700001602414773010302430856008102533852000902614655001202623IND60574356020221116183150.0170726e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057435602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-016-0563-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhiming10aOver-expression of miR158 causes pollen abortion in Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis  ap. 313-326.  aKEY MESSAGE: We identified and cloned the two precursors of miR158 and its target gene in Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis, which both had high relative expression in the inflorescences. Further study revealed that over-expression of miR158 caused reduced pollen varbility, which was caused by the degradation of pollen contents from the binucleate microspore stage. These results first suggest the role of miR158 in pollen development of Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in many important growth and development processes both in plants and animals by regulating the expression of their target genes via mRNA cleavage or translational repression. In this study, miR158, a Brassicaceae specific miRNA, was functionally characterized with regard to its role in pollen development of non-heading Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis). Two family members of miR158 in B. campestris, namely bra-miR158a1 and bra-miR158a2, and their target gene bra027656, which encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) containing protein, were identified. Then, qRT-PCR analysis and GUS-reporter system revealed that both bra-miR158 and its target gene had relatively high expression levels in the inflorescences. Further study revealed that over-expression of miR158 caused reduced pollen varbility and pollen germination ratio, and the degradation of pollen contents from the binucleate microspore stage was also found in those deformed pollen grains, which led to pollen shrinking and collapse in later pollen development stage. These results first shed light on the importance of miR158 in pollen development of Brassica campestris ssp. chinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3aabortion (plants) 3aanimals 3agene overexpression 3ainflorescences 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3aplants (botany) 3apollen 3apollen germination 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranslation (genetics)1 aJiang, Jianxia1 aHu, Ziwei1 aLyu, Tianqi1 aYang, Yang1 aJiang, Jingjing1 aCao, Jiashu0 tPlant molecular biology.g2017 Feb., v. 93, no. 3 p.313-326dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-016-0563-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245010400206520162800310592002801938650001501966650001301981650001101994650002502005650002802030650002702058650001502085651001002100653002702110653002202137653001702159653003302176653001502209700001502224700002002239700001602259700001302275773011302288856008602401852000902487655001202496IND60737773220221121124750.0220426e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073777322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1274392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yunfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1363-643312aA novel approach to dynamically optimize the spatio-temporal distribution of crop water consumption  aThe finite water resources are the main factors limiting agricultural sustainable development in arid and semiarid zones. In these water-scarce areas, optimizing limited water resources is an important way to reduce water consumption, increase crop yields and improve regional economic benefits. In this study, a CA-Jensen optimization model integrating cellular automata method and crop water production function into multi-objective dynamic optimization was developed and applied to the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin in the Northwest China to adjust the spatial distribution of cropland and the spatiotemporal allocation of crop water consumption. The net economic benefits of unit water, the crop water productivity and the value of the terrestrial ecosystem services represented the economic, social and ecological benefits in the objective function of the optimization model respectively. Adaptive cellular genetic algorithm was utilized to search and solve the optimization model. The obtained optimization results of the base year (2015) showed that the net benefits of unit water increased by 4.5% and the crop water productivity increased by 28.6%. In addition, for the target year (2030), although the reduction of agricultural water and cultivated land by 12.95% and 18.63% respectively led to a decrease of total economic benefits by 15.72%, the net benefits of unit water and social benefits got increased by 15.71% and 20.52%, respectively. Therefore, the optimization model can provide decision makers with guidance on the rational allocation of regional agricultural water resources in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acropland 3amodels 3aproduction functions 3asustainable development 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aCrop water consumption 0aCellular automata 0aJensen model 0aSpatio-temporal optimization 0aGrid-scale1 aHe, Liuyue1 aKang, Shaozhong1 aWang, Sufen1 aFang, Yu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 310 p.127439-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1274393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001800268520110900286592002801395650002601423650002201449650002801471650000801499650002201507650002901529650002901558650001801587650001101605650002201616650001301638650001601651650001401667650001301681650001301694650001201707651001901719700002001738773011501758856008101873852000901954655001201963IND60596495020221120060227.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059649502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3751-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonger, Wendy12aA new virus, classifiable in the family Tombusviridae, found infecting Solanum tuberosum in the UK  ap. 1585-1594.  aA novel virus was discovered in a freeze-dried collection held at SASA, UK, originating from potato (Solanum tuberosum) cv. Nadine. The complete sequence of the viral RNA was determined to be 3674 nucleotides in length encoding five predicted proteins. Based on the deduced genome organization and phylogenetic analysis, this virus represents a putative new member of the genus Alphanecrovirus, family Tombusviridae, most closely related to isolates of Olive mild mosaic virus. The virus was easily transmitted to indicator plants with symptoms that were slower to develop and less severe than those of related viruses. To distinguish this virus, the clearest symptom differences occurred with Nicotiana debneyi, Chenopodium amaranticolor and Ch. quinoa. The virus was detected with antisera to the related viruses tobacco necrosis virus A and tobacco necrosis virus D. The close association to the tobacco necrosis viruses would suggest this virus is not a new introduction to potato but in the past has been misidentified as one of these viruses. The virus isolate has been named potato necrosis virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium giganteum 3aNicotiana debneyi 3aOlive mild mosaic virus 3aRNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aTobacco necrosis virus A 3aTobacco necrosis virus D 3afreeze drying 3agenome 3aindicator species 3anecrosis 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3apotatoes 3aproteins 3aviruses 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJeffries, Colin0 tArchives of virology.g2018 June, v. 163, no. 6 p.1585-1594dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3751-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011800165300001600283500001900299520144200318592002801760650001901788650001801807650002801825650001001853650002501863650001101888650002001899650001101919650001601930650002201946650001501968650001501983650001301998650002402011653001002035653000802045653000802053653001702061653001802078653001002096653000802106653000802114653000802122653000902130653000902139653001002148653000802158700001902166700002402185700001702209700002302226700006302249773014602312856008302458852000902541655001202550IND60700887720221119230112.0200804e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070088772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuboi, Yumi10aCADM1 suppresses c-Src activation by binding with Cbp on membrane lipid rafts and intervenes colon carcinogenesis  ap. 854-860.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCell adhesion molecules act as tumor suppressors primarily by cell attachment activity, but additional mechanisms modifying signal transduction are suggested in some cases. Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a membrane-spanning immunoglobulin superfamily, mediates intercellular adhesion by trans-homophilic interaction and acts as a tumor suppressor. Here, we investigated CADM1-associated proteins comprehensively using proteomic analysis of immune-precipitates of CADM1 by mass spectrometry and identified a transmembrane adaptor protein, Csk-binding protein (Cbp), known to suppress Src-mediated transformation, as a binding partner of CADM1. CADM1 localizes to detergent-resistant membrane fractions and co-immunoprecipitated with Cbp and c-Src. Suppression of CADM1 expression using siRNA reduces the amount of co-immunoprecipitated c-Src with Cbp and activates c-Src in colon cancer cells expressing both CADM1 and Cbp. On the other hand, co-replacement of CADM1 and Cbp in colon cancer cells lacking CADM1 and Cbp expression suppresses c-Src activation, wound healing and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Furthermore, expression of Cbp and CADM1 was lost in 55% and 83% of human colon cancer, respectively, preferentially in tumors with larger size and/or lymph node metastasis. CADM1 would act as a colon tumor suppressor by intervening oncogenic c-Src signaling through binding with Cbp besides its authentic cell adhesion activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3acell adhesion 3acell adhesion molecules 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3alipids 3alymph nodes 3amass spectrometry 3ametastasis 3aproteomics 3aresearch 3asignal transduction 0aCADM1 0aSrc 0aCbp 0aColon cancer 0aTumorigenesis 0aCADM1 0aCbp 0aCsk 0aSH2 0aBMMC 0aTfnR 0aFlot1 0aDRM1 aOyama, Masaaki1 aKozuka-Hata, Hiroko1 aIto, Akihiko1 aMatsubara, Daisuke1 aMurakami, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2826-43960 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 529, no. 3 p.854-860dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.05.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245016300175300001800338520189700356592002802253650001602281650001702297650001702314650001602331650002302347650002102370650002202391650001402413650001202427650001102439650001302450650001202463650000702475650002402482650001802506650002002524650000902544700002202553700006102575773011902636856008302755852000902838655001202847IND60615172420221120165020.0181009e20180912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061517242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b007132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogancamp, Tessily N.10aStructure and Reaction Mechanism of the LigJ Hydratase: An Enzyme Critical for the Bacterial Degradation of Lignin in the Protocatechuate 4,5-Cleavage Pathway  ap. 5841-5850.  aLigJ from the soil bacterium Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 catalyzes the reversible hydration of (3Z)-2-keto-4-carboxy-3-hexenedioate (KCH) to 4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (CHA) in the degradation of lignin in the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway. LigJ is a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily and an enzyme in cog2159. The three-dimensional crystal structure of wild-type LigJ was determined in the presence [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 6DXQ] and absence of the product CHA (PDB entry 6DWV). The protein folds as a distorted (β/α)₈-barrel, and a single zinc ion is bound in the active site at the C-terminal end of the central β-barrel. The product CHA is ligated to the zinc ion in the active site via the displacement of a single water molecule from the coordination shell of the metal center in LigJ. The product-bound structure reveals that the enzyme catalyzes the hydration of KCH with the formation of a chiral center at C4 with S stereochemistry. The E284Q mutant was unable to catalyze the hydration of KCH to CHA, and the structure of this mutant was determined in the presence of the substrate KCH (PDB entry 6DXS). On the basis of the structure of LigJ in the presence of KCH and CHA, it is proposed that the side chain carboxylate of Glu-284 functions as a general base in the abstraction of a proton from a bound water molecule for nucleophilic attack at C4 of the substrate. The reaction is facilitated by the delocalization of the negative charge to the metal center via the carbonyl group at C2 of the substrate. C3 of the substrate is subsequently protonated by Glu-284 functioning as a general acid. The overall reaction occurs by the syn addition of water to the double bond between C4 and C3 of the substrate KCH. The kinetic constants for the hydration of KCH to CHA by LigJ at pH 8.0 are 25 s–¹ (kcₐₜ) and 2.6 × 10⁶ M–¹ s–¹ (kcₐₜ/Kₘ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aSphingomonas 3aactive sites 3abound water 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3adatabases 3aenzymes 3alignin 3amoieties 3amutants 3apH 3areaction mechanisms 3asoil bacteria 3astereochemistry 3azinc1 aMabanglo, Mark F.1 aRaushel, Frank M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5918-30890 tBiochemistry.g2018 Sept. 12, v. 57, no. 40 p.5841-5850dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b007133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245007100161300001800232520140900250592002801659650001501687650001501702650001401717650001301731650001501744650001701759650001801776650001201794650001601806650001801822650001201840650001901852650001901871650001701890650001901907650001901926650001101945650001501956650001801971650002601989653001802015653004102033653003102074653002102105700005702126700005602183773013902239856007802378852000902456655001202465IND60683224820221121044952.0200207e20200110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068322482DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b189962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yuchun12aA Versatile Sunscreen with Minimal ROS Damage and Low Permeability  ap. 6217-6225.  aOrganic and inorganic ultraviolet (UV) filters possess themselves advantages, while they suffer from different limitations including photostability, penetration, and cytotoxicity. Integrating organic and inorganic UV filters in a single unit holds great potential for enhanced UV protection. Herein, the dendritic silicon dioxide microspheres (DSMs) are encapsulated with Bi₂Ti₂O₇ nanocomposites (BTO-DSMs), an inorganic filter, and decorated with organic filters including sinapoyl malate (SM) and baicalin (BS/BTO-DSM) to enhance UV protection while significantly reducing ROS and skin permeability under UV exposure. The inorganic BTO-DSM component presents an expanded UV shield range and suppressed photocatalytic properties while preventing the organic filter SM direct contact with the epidermis and penetration behaviors. The baicalin efficiently scavenges the generated ROS from SM and reduces the transmittance of blue light. Notably, the results show that the proposed combined system significantly broadens the UV absorption region. Thus, the BS/BTO-DSM presents advanced in vitro anti-UV performance and in vivo UV protection against keratinocyte apoptosis and epidermal hyperplasia without long-term toxicity. The excellent anti-UV properties coupling with the suppressed photocatalytic capability and minimal epidermal penetration of BS/BTO-DSM make it promising for skin protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3aabsorption 3aapoptosis 3abaicalin 3ablue light 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3afilters 3ahyperplasia 3akeratinocytes 3amalates 3amicroparticles 3ananocomposites 3apermeability 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotostability 3asilica 3asunscreens 3atransmittance 3aultraviolet radiation 0aUV protection 0asuppressed photocatalytic capability 0aROS scavenging performance 0alow permeability1 aDong, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6907-65781 aZhang, Xueji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0035-38210 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 10, v. 12, no. 5 p.6217-6225dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b189963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04908naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006800144245015700212300001800369506007600387520257900463592002803042506003703070650001903107650001803126650002003144650001703164650002003181650002603201650001603227650002403243650001603267650001503283650000903298650001403307650001003321650001703331650001103348650001203359650002203371650001403393650000903407650002003416650001403436650002303450650000703473650001803480650001903498650001803517650000903535650001003544650002203554650002803576650002303604653002503627653003103652653001503683653001903698700006203717700005903779700005803838700005903896773015503955856007904110852000904189655001204198IND60700237620221207051924.0220830e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070023762DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2019-180362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo-Lopez, Ezequias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9304-235110aEvaluation of fecal fermentation profile and bacterial community in organically fed dairy cows consuming forage-rich diets with different particle sizes  ap. 8020-8033.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOrganic cattle farming encourages the use of forage-rich diets, and the reduction of particle size has been suggested as an approach to improve forage utilization and enhance nutrient intake of cows. However, reducing forage particle size increases passage rate, as well as the flow of potentially fermentable nutrients out of the rumen, and the consequences for hindgut fermentation have not been evaluated yet. This study evaluated the effects of decreasing dietary forage particle size on the fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile and the bacterial community structure of dairy cows fed forage-based rations. Twenty-one organically fed lactating Holstein cows (4 primiparous and 17 multiparous; mean and standard deviation 703 ± 65 kg body weight, 135 ± 104 days in milk) were divided into 2 groups and fed 1 of 2 diets for 34 d. Diets contained 20% concentrate and 80% forage (dry matter basis), and were fed either as a control with a forage geometric mean particle size of 52 mm (CON; 11 cows) or as a diet with the forage particle size reduced to a geometric mean size of 7 mm (RED; 10 cows). Fecal samples were collected at the end of the experiment, and samples were immediately frozen at −20°C. Samples were analyzed for SCFA, and the fecal bacterial community was evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Data showed that the concentration of total SCFA was not affected by treatment, but the proportion of propionate, a key glucogenic precursor in cattle, tended to be greater for RED (13.3 and 13.8 ± 0.1%, respectively). The predominant bacterial phyla, including Firmicutes (58.0 ± 0.7%), Bacteroidetes (26.9 ± 0.4%), and Verrucomicrobia (4.0 ± 0.4%), were not affected by forage particle size. Family Lachnospiraceae increased in relative abundance when the RED diet was fed (12.1 and 13.9 ± 0.5% for CON and RED, respectively), and genera Acetitomaculum (1.1 and 1.8 ± 0.2%), Turicibacter (0.7 and 0.9 ± 0.1%), and Ruminobacter (0.1 and 0.4 ± 0.1%) increased in relative abundance when RED was fed. In addition, relative abundance of some fecal bacterial taxa was correlated with major fecal SCFA and pH. Reducing the particle size of forages, from 52 to 7 mm geometric mean particle size, maintained fecal concentration of total SCFA and tended to enhance propionate concentration, without risk of dysbiosis. Thus, results suggest that reduction of forage particle size represents an effective approach to optimizing forage utilization while maintaining hindgut fermentation and fecal bacterial diversity in dairy cows fed forage-rich diets.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcetitomaculum 3aBacteroidetes 3aLachnospiraceae 3aRuminobacter 3aVerrucomicrobia 3abacterial communities 3abody weight 3acommunity structure 3acow feeding 3adairy cows 3adiet 3adysbiosis 3afeces 3afermentation 3aforage 3ahindgut 3alactating females 3alactation 3amilk 3anutrient intake 3anutrients 3aorganic production 3apH 3aparticle size 3apropionic acid 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3arumen 3asequence analysis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3astandard deviation 0aforage particle size 0afecal fermentation profile 0amicrobiota 0aDNA sequencing1 aHaselmann, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2575-52961 aPetri, Renee M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8209-82611 aKnaus, Wilhelm1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9909-54221 aZebeli, Qendrim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5188-90040 tJournal of dairy science.g2020 Sept., v. 103, no. 9 p.8020-8033dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-180363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245016200201506007600363520139400439592002801833506003701861650002101898650001501919650003001934650002201964650001801986650001202004650002102016650001102037650001202048650001902060650001402079650002602093650001002119650002202129650001202151650002002163650001802183651001702201700002302218700002002241700001902261700002302280773011902303856007602422852000902498655001202507IND60648050520221207142407.0190626e20181216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064805052DNAL7 a10.3390/foods71202062doi7 aPMC63069152pmcid7 a305583512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDao, Juliane 10aEffects of Water Quality and Post-Harvest Handling on Microbiological Contamination of Lettuce at Urban and Peri-Urban Locations of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVegetable production in urban gardens of Ouagadougou contributes to food security, but water for irrigation is often of low quality. This is particularly acute if irrigation water is taken from wastewater polluted channels. This study aimed at (i) verifying to what degree irrigation water quality is correlated with contamination of lettuce with Escherichia coli, total coliforms, and Salmonella spp., and (ii) assessing effects of post-harvest handling on pathogen development during the trade chain. We tested pathogen removal efficiency on lettuce by applying post-harvest washing. Irrigation water of production areas in Ouagadougou (n = 10) showed a mean E. coli load of 2.1 &times; 105 CFU 100 mL&minus;1. In 60% of the cases, irrigation water did not meet the standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) for safe irrigation water, and in 30% of the cases, irrigation water was contaminated with Salmonella spp. Loads of total coliforms on lettuce leaves ranged from 2.9 &times; 103 CFU g&minus;1 to 1.3 &times; 106 CFU g&minus;1, while E. coli averaged 1.1 &times; 102 CFU g&minus;1. Results on post-harvest handling revealed that microbial loads increased along the trade chain. Overall, half of all lettuce samples (n = 60) were tested positively for Salmonella spp. The experiment showed that appropriate post-harvest handling could prevent the increase of total coliforms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aWorld Health Organization 3acoliform bacteria 3afood security 3agardens 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amicrobial load 3apathogens 3apostharvest treatment 3atrade 3avegetable growing 3awashing 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aBurkina Faso1 aStenchly, Kathrin 1 aTraoré, Oumar 1 aAmoah, Philip 1 aBuerkert, Andreas 0 tFoods.g2018 Dec. 16, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods71202063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006500176300001600241520142700257592002801684650001601712650002201728650001801750650001101768650002401779650005201803650001101855650001501866653001801881653001501899653001601914653001101930653001201941700002101953700001901974700001901993700002002012700005802032773011202090856008602202852000902288655001202297IND60601224220221119133926.0180706e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060122422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrāhīm, Wafāʼ,10aDirect typing of human enteroviruses from wastewater samples  ap. 215-219.  aA RT-PCR approach for the direct detection and typing of human enteroviruses in the environment is described in this study. A semi-nested RT-PCR using COnsensus-DEgenerated Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primers (CODEHOP) designed from the VP2 genome region has been developed for the direct typing of enteroviruses in clinical samples (Ibrahim et al., 2013). This CODEHOP/VP2 PCR strategy as well as the CODEHOP/VP1 technique described by Nix et al. (2006), were tested for the detection and typing of enteroviruses in wastewater samples. Virus particles were first extracted and concentrated from wastewater samples by using respectively beef extract and polyethylene glycol 6000, and the presence of enteroviruses was screened by a RT-PCR method using primers from the 5′-end non-coding region (5′NCR). Fifty-two of 172 samples (30.2%) were revealed positive by the 5′NCR method. From these 52 samples, only 19 samples (36.5%) were found positive by at least one of the two CODEHOP techniques, with the following distribution: VP1(+)/VP2(+)=4 (7.7%), VP1(−)/VP2(+)=13 (25%) and VP1(+)/VP2(−)=2 (3.8%). These results illustrate that the direct typing of enteroviruses in environmental samples is insensitive, possibly due to the presence of large amounts of amplification inhibitors; however, the VP2 method was found able to allow the direct detection and typing of c. one-third of the positive environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aHuman enterovirus 3abeef extracts 3agenome 3apolyethylene glycol 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avirion 3awastewater 0aEnteroviruses 0aWastewater 0aEnvironment 0aRT-PCR 0aCODEHOP1 aOuerdani, Imène1 aPillet, Sylvie1 aAouni, Mahjoub1 aPozzetto, Bruno1 aHarrath, Rafik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9071-29700 tJournal of virological methods.g2014 Oct., v. 207 p.215-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245010400209300001800313506007600331520157800407592002801985506003702013650003102050650001502081650001802096650000902114650001802123650001502141650001402156650001902170650000902189650001202198650001202210650001102222650001602233650004402249650000702293650002202300700006702322773011902389856008302508852000902591655001202600IND60615172520221207123243.0181009e20180914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061517252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b007522doi7 aPMC62178172pmcid7 a302131882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNye, Dillon B.10aReplacement of the Distal Histidine Reveals a Noncanonical Heme Binding Site in a 2-on-2 Hemoglobin  ap. 5785-5796.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHeme ligation in hemoglobin is typically assumed by the “proximal” histidine. Hydrophobic contacts, ionic interactions, and the ligation bond secure the heme between two α-helices denoted E and F. Across the hemoglobin superfamily, several proteins also use a “distal” histidine, making the native state a bis-histidine complex. The group 1 truncated hemoglobin from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, GlbN, is one such bis-histidine protein. Ferric GlbN, in which the distal histidine (His46 or E10) has been replaced with a leucine, though expected to bind a water molecule and yield a high-spin iron complex at neutral pH, has low-spin spectral properties. Here, we applied nuclear magnetic resonance and electronic absorption spectroscopic methods to GlbN modified with heme and amino acid replacements to identify the distal ligand in H46L GlbN. We found that His117, a residue located in the C-terminal portion of the protein and on the proximal side of the heme, is responsible for the formation of an alternative bis-histidine complex. Simultaneous coordination by His70 and His117 situates the heme in a binding site different from the canonical site. This new holoprotein form is achieved with only local conformational changes. Heme affinity in the alternative site is weaker than in the normal site, likely because of strained coordination and a reduced number of specific heme–protein interactions. The observation of an unconventional heme binding site has important implications for the interpretation of mutagenesis results and globin homology modeling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSynechocystis sp.

Whereas the halogens do not alter the preferential formation of Watson–Crick geometries, self-associates of the halouracils point to a more favorable engagement of the 2-carbonyl as proton acceptor in the cyclic hydrogen bonds, suggesting increased formation of reverse geometries and wobble base pairs with guanine when compared to the thymine base.

They recognize specific cellular nucleic acid sequences and form stable complexes with complementary DNA or RNA. Here, we designed an oligo-aspartic acid–PNA conjugate and showed its enhanced delivery into cells with high gene correction efficiency using conventional cationic carriers, such as polyethylenimine (PEI) and Lipofectamine 2000. The negatively charged oligo-aspartic acid–PNA (Asp(n)–PNA) formed complexes with PEI and Lipofectamine, and the resulting Asp(n)–PNA/PEI and Asp(n)–PNA/Lipofectamine complexes were introduced into cells. We observed significantly enhanced cellular uptake of Asp(n)–PNA by cationic carriers and detected an active splicing correction effect even at nanomolar concentrations. We found that the splicing correction efficiency of the complex depended on the kind of the cationic carriers and on the number of repeating aspartic acid units. By enhancing the cellular uptake efficiency of PNAs, these results may provide a novel platform technology of PNAs as bioactive substances for their biological and therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aaspartic acid 3abioactive compounds 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3apolyethyleneimine 3atherapeutics 0aPeptide nucleic acid 0aPolyethylenimine 0aLipofectamine 0aSplicing1 aKim, Myung-Hee,1 aYu, Gwang Sig1 aUm, Bong Ho1 aPark, Hee Kyung1 aLee, Hyun-il1 aLee, Kang Taek1 aSuh, Yung Doug1 aChoi, Joon Sig0 tJournal of controlled release.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 175 p.54-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245013900206300001800345500002000363520154500383592002801928596004301956596002901999596002102028596002102049596002402070596003202094596002602126596008802152596006202240596005202302596002802354596005002382596003902432596003202471596005202503650001702555650001702572650001202589650002402601650002402625650001302649650001102662650001402673650001502687650001302702650001502715700002402730700002502754700002202779700002102801700003002822700002202852700001702874773012002891856007303011852000903084655001203093IND60617147420221119121253.0181024e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061714742DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.148352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos‐Maraví, Pável1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2885-491910aTaxon cycle predictions supported by model‐based inference in Indo‐Pacific trap‐jaw ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Odontomachus)  ap. 4090-4107.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNonequilibrium dynamics and non‐neutral processes, such as trait‐dependent dispersal, are often missing from quantitative island biogeography models despite their potential explanatory value. One of the most influential nonequilibrium models is the taxon cycle, but it has been difficult to test its validity as a general biogeographical framework. Here, we test predictions of the taxon cycle model using six expected phylogenetic patterns and a time‐calibrated phylogeny of Indo‐Pacific Odontomachus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ponerinae), one of the ant genera that E.O. Wilson used when first proposing the hypothesis. We used model‐based inference and a newly developed trait‐dependent dispersal model to jointly estimate ancestral biogeography, ecology (habitat preferences for forest interiors, vs. “marginal” habitats, such as savannahs, shorelines, disturbed areas) and the linkage between ecology and dispersal rates. We found strong evidence that habitat shifts from forest interior to open and disturbed habitats increased macroevolutionary dispersal rate. In addition, lineages occupying open and disturbed habitats can give rise to both island endemics re‐occupying only forest interiors and taxa that re‐expand geographical ranges. The phylogenetic predictions outlined in this study can be used in future work to evaluate the relative weights of neutral (e.g., geographical distance and area) and non‐neutral (e.g., trait‐dependent dispersal) processes in historical biogeography and community ecology.  aPublisher supplied data  aP505/12/2467cCzech Science Foundation  cPutnam Expedition Grants  a003/2015/PcGAJU  a152/2016/PcGAJU  cEuropean Commission  a282471cCONACYT DICB‐2016  aIN206818cUNAM PAPIIT  a#EFJ0832858cNational Institute of Mathematical and Biological Synthesis Fellowship  aDE150101773cAustralian Research Council DECRA Fellowship  aDDIG DEB‐1407279cNational Science Foundation  cSmithsonian Institution  cNational Geographic Society's Explorers Grant  cAmerican Museum of Natural History  cUS Army Research Laboratory  aW911NF‐05‐1‐0271cUS Army Research Office 3aOdontomachus 3abiogeography 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3asavannas 3ashorelines1 aMatzke, Nicholas J.1 aLarabee, Fredrick J.1 aClouse, Ronald M.1 aWheeler, Ward C.1 aSorger, Daniela Magdalena1 aSuarez, Andrew V.1 aJanda, Milan0 tMolecular ecology.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 20 p.4090-4107dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.148353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245011800209300001800327520220600345592002802551650002802579650002102607650001602628650001802644650001102662650001902673650002002692650001102712650001302723650001902736650001602755650001302771653002002784653001702804653001902821653002302840700002002863700001602883700005702899700005702956700001803013700001803031700001603049700001803065700002203083773010003105856008603205852000903291655001203300IND60747975820221120230327.0210904e20210907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074797582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster, Helen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3046-705310aPre-existing immunity to cytomegalovirus in macaques influences human CMV vaccine responses in preclinical models  ap. 5358-5367.  aDevelopment of a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) vaccine is a Tier 1 priority by the National Institutes of Medicine, as HCMV is the most common congenital infection globally and most frequent infectious complication in transplant patients. Relevant preclinical non-human primate models used for testing HCMV vaccine immunogenicity are rhesus and cynomolgous monkeys. However, a complication in using these models is that species-specific CMV variants are endemic in non-human primate breeding colonies. We hypothesize that natural immunity to species-specific CMV in rhesus and cynomolgous monkeys impacts HCMV vaccine immunogenicity and may interfere with our ability to fully interpret vaccine immunogenicity. A modified mRNA vaccine encoding HCMV glycoprotein (gB) and the pentameric complex (PC) packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) was delivered intramuscularly to groups of cynomolgous (n = 16, CyCMV-seropositive) and rhesus macaques (n = 24, RhCMV-seropositive). High pre-vaccination IgG binding responses to HCMV gB were present in both species, but pre-vaccination binding responses to PC were mostly present in rhesus macaques. Yet, at least a log increase in both PC and gB-specific plasma IgG levels was detected post-second HCMV mRNA vaccination in both species. Both species responded with high epithelial cell neutralizing antibody responses at 4 weeks post second HCMV mRNA vaccination, but limited fibroblast neutralizing antibodies. HCMV gB + PC mRNA/LNP vaccine also elicited IgG binding responses to cell-associated gB, an identified immune correlate of protection, in both species after the second vaccination, and there was a moderately strong direct correlation between this pre- and post-vaccination response in rhesus macaques. Based on the correlation between pre-existing and post-vaccine gB-specific binding responses in rhesus macaques, we conclude that species-specific CMV variant-specific antibody responses contribute to antibody responses to HCMV vaccination in primate models, indicating that pre-existing immunity must be taken into account in non-human primate preclinical models and will impact immunogenicity of HCMV vaccines seropositive human vaccinees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3aepithelial cells 3afibroblasts 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aimmunogenicity 3ainnate immunity 3alipids 3amedicine 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aCytomegalovirus 0amRNA vaccine 0aglycoprotein B 0aPentameric complex1 aValencia, Sarah1 aKumar, Amit1 aChan, Cliburn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5901-68061 aDennis, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0833-26351 aRoark, Hunter1 aWoods, Angela1 aJohn, Shinu1 aCarfi, Andrea1 aPermar, Sallie R.0 tVaccine.g2021 Sept. 07, v. 39, no. 38 p.5358-5367dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245007600197300001600273500001400289500002000303520168100323592002802004650001302032650002102045650001702066650001702083650002402100650001302124650002202137650002302159700002402182700002602206700002102232700002402253700002102277700006102298773013202359856007302491852000902564655001202573IND60723952920221120093601.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395292DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiebe, Maraike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6177-400510aIn vitro effects of lipopolysaccharides on bovine uterine contractility  ap. 172-182.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMetritis is an important disorder in dairy cows during the early postpartum period. Myometrial contractility is a prerequisite for uterine involution; however, very scanty literature is available about the effect of metritis on this process and endocrine responsiveness. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of inflammation on uterine contractility in vitro, and the inflammation was induced by incubating myometrial strips with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Myometrial samples were collected from 17 healthy Holstein Friesian cows during caesarean section. Eight longitudinal strips from each cow were incubated in organ baths with LPS concentrations of 0 (LPS₀), 0.1 (LPS₀.₁), 1 (LPS₁) and 10 µg/ml (LPS₁₀). Spontaneous contractility and contractility induced by increasing concentrations of oxytocin (10–¹⁰ – 10–⁷ mol/L) were recorded during nine 30‐min intervals (T1 to T9). The minimum amplitude (minA), maximum amplitude (maxA), mean amplitude (meanA) and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each time interval. LPS had an effect (p ≤ .05) on maxA, meanA and AUC. In T1, myometrial strips incubated with LPS₀.₁ and LPS₁ had higher (p ≤ .05) maxA, meanA and AUC than the strips incubated with LPS₀. In T9 without oxytocin, LPS₀ led to higher (p ≤ .05) maxA, meanA and AUC than LPS₀.₁ and LPS₁. In T8 and T9 with oxytocin, LPS₁ had lower (p ≤ .05) maxA, meanA and AUC than the other LPS concentrations. Interestingly, the results show that LPS has a transient positive effect on myometrial contractility in vitro and that this effect is dependent on LPS concentration and duration of incubation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acesarean section 3aendometritis 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aoxytocin 3apostpartum period 3auterine involution1 aPfarrer, Christiane1 aGórriz Martín, Lara1 aSchmicke, Marion1 aHoedemaker, Martina1 aBollwein, Heiner1 aHeppelmann, Maike1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3736-44520 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.172-182dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174300001600295520204600311592002802357650002102385650001102406650002902417650003002446650001902476650001202495650001202507650000902519650001302528650001002541650001002551650001302561650002402574650001702598650001102615650001302626650001602639650001202655650001502667651001502682651001102697700002202708700001902730700001802749773014002767856008502907852000902992655001203001IND60449271120221117212904.0151030e20150903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044927112DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2015.10573502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScoppettone, Gary,10aPopulation Dynamics of the Cui-ui of Pyramid Lake, Nevada: a Potamodromous Catostomid Subject to Failed Reproduction  ap. 853-864.  aFishes of the Truckee River basin (California and Nevada) evolved in an aquatic system that has been episodically diminished by extended drought. For potamodromous species, such as the endangered Cui-ui endemic to Pyramid Lake, Nevada, prehistoric episodic severe drought presumably led to periods of failed reproduction due to restricted access to spawning habitat. The response of the Cui-ui population to more recent failed reproduction caused by anthropogenic activity was studied to learn how to manage this species through periods of spawning disruption. Adult Cui-ui survival averaged 91% and 89% for females and males, respectively, in drought years when spawning migrations were either precluded or few fish migrated because of no or low stream flow. In each of 2 years when stream access was precluded, the adult survival was nearly 100% suggesting that Cui-ui survival is extended in the absence of a spawning migration. Survival averaged 62% and 60% for females and males, respectively, in years of spawning migrations. Strong predominant year-classes developed in the year immediately following a period of failed reproduction, indicating the species' capacity for population rebound. Year-class predominance persisted for 6–10 years and through years of low survival associated with migration years, and this predominance is probably due, in part, to a diverse age at maturity. Contemporary water diversions from the Truckee River provided the opportunity to study the response of the Cui-ui population to years of failed reproduction. A projected drier Truckee River basin associated with global climate change will test the Cui-ui's adaptive capacity to endure periods of reproductive failure. This study is aimed at assisting Cui-ui managers in conserving the species in this highly regulated and changing system. The study also adds insight into the prehistoric population dynamics of a potamodromous species in the arid western United States subject to wide fluctuations in annual precipitation and water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChasmistes cujus 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afemales 3afish 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amales 3amanagers 3apopulation dynamics 3areproduction 3arivers 3aspawning 3astream flow 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aCalifornia 3aNevada1 aRissler, Peter H.1 aFabes, Mark C.1 aShea, Sean P.0 tNorth American Journal of Fisheries Management.g2015 Sept. 3, v. 35, no. 5 p.853-864dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19701x1548-86757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.10573503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300002000283520166400303592002801967650002201995650001902017650002002036650002402056650003702080650001602117650001302133650001102146650002102157650001902178650001202197650002902209650003302238650001902271650001702290650002102307650003702328650001602365650002502381700001502406700001302421700001502434700001402449700001702463773016902480856008102649852000902730655001202739IND60602046420221117185206.0180709e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060204642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2201-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peifang12aA weak-light-responsive TiO2/g-C3N4 composite film: photocatalytic activity under low-intensity light irradiation  ap. 20206-20216.  aA TiO₂/g-C₃N₄ composite photocatalytic film was prepared by in situ synthesis method and its photocatalytic capability under weak-visible-light condition was studied. The co-precursor with different ratio of melamine and TiO₂ sol-gel precursor were treated using ultrasonic mixing, physical deposition, and co-sintering method to form the smooth, white-yellow, and compact TiO₂/g-C₃N₄ composite films. The prepared TiO₂/g-C₃N₄ materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, BET, VBXPS, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The results of composite showed that TiO₂ and g-C₃N₄ have close interfacial connections which are favorable to charge transfer between these two semiconductors with suitable band structure, g-C₃N₄ retard the anatase-to-rutile phase transition of TiO₂ significantly, the specific surface area were increased with g-C₃N₄ ratio raised. Under weak-light irradiation, composite films photocatalytic experiments exhibited RhB removal efficiency approaching 90% after three recycles. Powders suspension degradation experiments revealed the removal efficiency of TiO₂/g-C₃N₄ (90.8%) was higher than pure TiO₂ (52.1%) and slightly lower than pure g-C₃N₄ (96.6%). By control experiment, the enhanced photocatalysis is ascribed to the combination of TiO₂ and g-C₃N₄, which not only produced thin films with greater stability but also formed heterojunctions that can be favorable to charge transfer between these two semiconductors with suitable band structure. This study presents the potential application of photocatalytic film in the wastewater treatment under weak-light situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon nitride 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airradiation 3amelamine 3amixing 3aphase transition 3aphotocatalysis 3apowders 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonics 3awastewater treatment1 aGuo, Xiang1 aRao, Lei1 aWang, Chao1 aGuo, Yong1 aZhang, Lixin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 20 p.20206-20216dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2201-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010100165300001800266500002000284520167500304592002801979650002702007650001802034650001102052650001202063650001502075650002002090650002502110650001702135650001902152650001802171650001102189650001402200650001302214650002602227650001402253650001502267650002102282650001902303650001002322650001402332700002202346700002202368700003002390773010402420856007902524852000902603655001202612IND60548427720221120162555.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054842772DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.126182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvila, José M.10aQuercus suber dieback alters soil respiration and nutrient availability in Mediterranean forests  ap. 1441-1452.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn increase in tree mortality rates has been recently detected in forests world‐wide. However, few works have focused on the potential consequences of forest dieback for ecosystem functioning. Here we assessed the effect of Quercus suber dieback on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in two types of Mediterranean forests (woodlands and closed forests) affected by the aggressive pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. We used a spatially explicit neighbourhood approach to analyse the direct effects of Q. suber dieback on soil variables, comparing the impact of Q. suber trees with different health status, as well as its potential long‐term indirect effects, comparing the impact of non‐declining coexistent species. Quercus suber dieback translated into lower soil respiration rates and phosphorus availability, whereas its effects on nitrogen varied depending on forest type. Coexistent species differed strongly from Q. suber in their effects on nutrient availability, but not on soil respiration rates. Our models showed low interannual but high intra‐annual variation in the ecosystem impacts of tree dieback. Synthesis. Our results support that tree dieback might have important short‐ and long‐term impacts on ecosystem processes in Mediterranean forests. With this work, we provide valuable insights to fill the existent gap in knowledge on the ecosystem‐level impacts of forest dieback in general and P. cinnamomi‐driven mortality in particular. Because the activity and range of this pathogen is predicted to increase due to climate warming, these impacts could also increase in the near future altering ecosystem functioning world‐wide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora cinnamomi 3aQuercus suber 3acarbon 3adieback 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest types 3aglobal warming 3ahealth status 3amodels 3amortality 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3apathogens 3aphosphorus 3asoil respiration 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awoodlands1 aGallardo, Antonio1 aIbáñez, Beatriz1 aGómez‐Aparicio, Lorena0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 Sept., v. 104, no. 5 p.1441-1452dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01842naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007700165300001800242520086800260592002801128650002001156650001201176650002401188653000901212653002001221653001201241653001701253653002701270773013601297856008601433852000901519655001201528IND60720867520221119163209.0220122e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072086752DNAL7 a10.1080/16583655.2020.18041572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMert, Ali10aShannon entropy-based approach for calculating values of WABL parameters  ap. 1100-1109.  aIn the application phase of the fuzzy theory, it is an obvious advantage to have a valuable defuzzification. The defuzzification method that we deal with in this work is a flexible, adaptable and multi-purpose method. In this study, we will introduce a new concept to obtain the parameter values of the defuzzification method called WABL. The new concept is based on maximizing the entropy of the level sets weights of the method. We develop two versions for the concept. In the first one, we suppose that we have one decision-maker to supervise a fuzzy process. In the second version, we assume that we have a group of decision-makers to collectively administrate a fuzzy process. For each version, we construct a constrained optimization problem and we solve each problem analytically. The working results of the versions are demonstrated by numerical examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aentropy 3asystem optimization 0aWABL 0adefuzzification 0aentropy 0afuzzy number 0anonlinear optimization0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 14, no. 1 p.1100-1109dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16583655.2020.18041573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013900195300001600334500001400350500002000364520212400384592002802508650001102536650002102547650001302568650000902581650001002590650001402600650001002614650001402624650001902638650002902657650002002686650002102706700002402727700002002751700001702771700002602788700002402814700002302838700002702861700001602888773013202904856007303036852000903109655001203118IND60723953120221120084254.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395312DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoigt, Katja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8085-336910aFactors associated with ewe and lamb survival, and subsequent reproductive performance of sheep undergoing emergency caesarean section  ap. 120-129.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClinical records of all 212 ewes undergoing emergency caesarean surgery at a veterinary teaching hospital between January 2008 and December 2019 were evaluated retrospectively. Their age ranged from 1 to 10 years (median = 4 years), with German merino the predominant breed (48.1% of cases). The most frequently diagnosed indications were insufficient cervical dilatation (n = 94, 44.3%), uterine torsion (n = 50, 23.6%), foetopelvic disproportion (n = 31, 14.6%) and vaginal prolapse intra partum (n = 11, 5.2%). Fifty‐four (25.5%) of the 212 ewes additionally suffered from one or more concurrent, pre‐existing conditions. Overall ewe mortality until hospital discharge was 10.8% (23/212), and 3.8% (n = 6) for the 158 ewes without a history of concurrent disorders. Mortality during hospitalization increased to 31.5% (17/54) for those with pre‐existing conditions. Total lamb mortality was 49.1% (173/352) until hospital discharge. Pre‐existing conditions (p = .001) and the presence of post‐surgical complications (p = .025) were identified as significant factors influencing dam mortality, while delayed presentation for veterinary attention with an observed duration of labour of >12 hr was identified as the most influential factor on total lamb mortality (p = .010). The presence of dead or emphysematous foetuses was not significant for ewe mortality. Follow‐up information on further outcomes was available for 156 (82.5%) of the 189 discharged ewes. Eighty‐nine animals (57.1%) were re‐bred in the following season and achieved a 93.3% (83/89) pregnancy rate, while the remainder had either been slaughtered (n = 56, 35.9%), sold (n = 5, 3.2%) or had died of unknown causes (n = 3, 1.9%). The subsequent incidence of dystocia was 15.6% (n = 12) in the 77 ewes with available information on lambing ease. Adequate management of underlying conditions and timely intervention are important factors for best possible short‐term outcomes. In the long term, the subsequent pregnancy rate was good and the incidence of subsequent dystocia was within the normal range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3acesarean section 3adystocia 3aewes 3afetus 3ahospitals 3alabor 3amortality 3apregnancy rate 3areproductive performance 3auterine torsion 3avaginal prolapse1 aNajm, Nour‐Addeen1 aZablotski, Yury1 aRieger, Anna1 aVassiliadis, Panajota1 aSteckeler, Patricia1 aSchabmeyer, Simone1 aBalasopoulou, Viktoria1 aZerbe, Holm0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.120-129dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007700157300001400234500002000248520122000268592002801488596000801516596003501524596002201559596000901581596001301590596001401603650002601617650001601643650002001659650002201679650001001701650001101711650001301722700002101735700001901756773011501775856007401890852000901964655001201973IND60788324420221121063817.0220813e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078832442DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.k53702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovatt, Fiona10aResponsible use of antibiotics on sheep farms: application at farm level  ap. 23-33.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere is currently global concern over rising levels of antibiotic resistance among commensal and pathogenic bacteria in human and animal populations. Unless urgent action is taken by the medical and veterinary professions, it is thought that we will enter a postantibiotic era in which bacterial diseases that were readily treatable with antibiotics will kill once again. Consequently, antibiotic use in both the human and animal health industries has come under intense scrutiny. Long‐held ideas and accepted behavioural norms have rightly been challenged. Progress in the agricultural industries has developed apace with the establishment of the Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance Targets Task Force in December 2016 and Defra's call for the implementation of sector‐specific targets on the use of antibiotics. This article describes how veterinary surgeons and sheep farmers can work together to plan, prevent and protect against three specific disease management issues – infectious lameness, enzootic abortion of ewes and neonatal bacterial infections – by replacing, refining and reducing the use of antibiotics on farm, based on guidelines drawn up by the Sheep Veterinary Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cSVS  cSheep Health and Welfare Group  cMSD Animal Health  cCeva  cNorbrook  cZoetis UK 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3adisease control 3aenzootic diseases 3afarms 3ahumans 3alameness1 aDuncan, Jennifer1 aHinde, Davinia0 tIn practice.g2019 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.23-33dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl42967x0263-841X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/inp.k53703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245012100196300001400317500001400331500002000345520165700365592002802022596011302050596007302163596006202236650001502298650002502313650001902338650001702357650001402374650001802388650002702406650002002433650001302453650002102466650002202487650001002509650002102519650002002540700001802560700001402578700001702592700001502609700001802624700001902642700001602661773013002677856007302807852000902880655001202889IND60723953220221120084233.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395322DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Pengyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9981-764810aIntegrated analysis of miRNA–mRNA interaction in ovaries of Turpan Black Sheep during follicular and luteal phases  ap. 46-57.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo investigate the regulatory mechanism of the follicular–luteal phase transition in Turpan black sheep (Ovis aries), the genome‐wide expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes were investigated in ovaries of six sheep (3 years and single lamb with 3 consecutive births) during follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. Bioinformatic analysis was used to screen potential miRNAs and genes related to Turpan black sheep ovarian function. RT‐qPCR was used to validate the sequencing results. In total, we identified 139 known and 71 novel miRNAs in the two phases with miRNA‐seq, and a total of 19 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, of which 7 were up‐regulated and 12 were down‐regulated in the follicular phase compared with luteal phase. A total of 150 genes were significantly differentially expressed, including 63 up‐regulated and 87 down‐regulated in the follicular phase compared with the luteal phase by RNA‐seq data analysis. Those DEGs were significantly enriched in 103 GO terms and several KEGG pathways, including metabolic pathway, ovarian steroidogenesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis and oestrogen signalling pathway. In addition, we created a miRNA–mRNA regulatory network to further elucidate the mechanism of follicular–luteal transition. Finally, we identified key miRNAs and genes including miR‐143, miR‐99a, miR‐150, miR‐27a, miR‐125b, STAR, STAT1, which might play crucial roles in reproductive hormone biosynthesis and follicular development. The miRNA–mRNA interactive network clearly illustrates molecular basis involving in follicular–luteal transition.  aPublisher supplied data  a1090064cPrecision Animal Husbandry Discipline Group Construction Project of Hebei Agricultural University  aCXZZBS2019092cGraduate Innovation Funding Project of Hebei Province  aC2019204039cNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province 3aOvis aries 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3aestrogens 3aestrous cycle 3afollicular development 3amenstrual cycle 3amicroRNA 3aphase transition 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3asteroid hormones 3asteroidogenesis1 aYue, Qiaoxian1 aFu, Qiang1 aLi, Xiangyun1 aLi, Xujing1 aZhou, Rongyan1 aChen, Xiaoyong1 aTao, Chenyu0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.46-57dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245010700190300001800297520161100315592002801926650001601954650001201970650001301982650001501995650001302010650001502023650001802038650001502056650001202071650001202083650003202095650001602127650003802143650001102181650001202192651001302204651001302217700002702230700001602257700002702273700001702300773014002317856008202457852000902539655001202548IND50067480720221118111031.0210324e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006748072DNAL7 a232087602pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-012-3020-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerronha, Ana Marta10aTowards effective culvert design: monitoring seasonal use and behavior by Mediterranean mesocarnivores  ap. 6235-6246.  aDrainage culverts are known to be used by a diverse number of species. To date, most studies looking at culvert usage have been restricted to the dry season. This seasonal bias has limited our understanding of how different species respond to culverts and, consequently, our ability to find effective ways to promote the use of culverts as aids to species movement. The main goal of this study was to examine the role of highway culverts for mesocarnivores throughout the year. We addressed (1) the seasonality of culvert use, (2) the relative importance of culvert structure, highway features, and surrounding landscape on culvert use, (3) the influence of the water depth and cover on culvert use, and (4) the effect of culvert structure on individual behavior. Fifteen culverts were monitored along 2 highways in southern Portugal using video-surveillance cameras and marble dust for 10 consecutive days per season. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine which factors most affected the culvert use and behavior by mesocarnivores. Our results highlight the effect of seasonality and water on culvert use. Culvert use was positively related with species activity throughout the year. All species (except otters (Lutra lutra)) were less likely to use culverts that contained water more than 3 cm deep or covering more than 70 % of the culvert base. Based on our results, future surveys and culvert retrofit design should address (1) the importance of seasonality in the interpretation of results and (2) the complementarity of culvert-specific features (water, ledges, and naturalization).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLutra lutra 3acameras 3adrainage 3adry season 3ahighways 3alandscapes 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aDrainage, Sanitaryxmethods 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aOtters 2aSeasons 3aPortugal 0aPortugal1 aMateus, Ana Rita Amaro1 aEaton, Finn1 aSantos-Reis, Margarida1 aGrilo, Clara0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Aug., v. 185, no. 8 p.6235-6246dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-3020-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008200172300001600254520142200270592002801692650001301720650001601733650001901749650002001768650000901788650002301797650001801820650000901838650001801847650001901865650001901884650001401903651001201917700002301929773012501952856008502077852000902162655001202171IND60449271820221117212935.0151030e20150903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044927182DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2015.10648352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Jeffrey E.10aRisk Screening of Arapaima, a New Species Proposed for Aquaculture in Florida  ap. 885-894.  aAgencies have a growing range of options for risk assessment of nonnative species varying from comprehensive assessments to rapid risk screens. Risk screens identify high-risk and low-risk species and those where more evaluation is warranted. Despite development and testing of risk-screening methods, there is little information in the literature regarding their implementation in management decisions. We used a screening tool, the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK), coupled with a detailed literature review to evaluate the risks of the genus Arapaima across Florida, where there is growing interest in its culture as a food fish. We found a medium risk of invasiveness overall, the greatest risk being to subtropical south Florida due to the low cold tolerance of Arapaima that it would experience further north. Ultimately the agency determined that a combination of literature review and the risk screen was sufficient to inform their decision making and that current conditional species regulations provided adequate risk mitigation to allow culture. The agency saved time and money by developing background information and a preliminary estimate of risk prior to engaging in comprehensive assessment. Flexibility allows agencies to tailor their risk assessment and management processes to different risk environments and to better inform decision making.

Until recently, pedigrees were the gold standard to infer kinship, but the advent of next‐generation sequencing and the availability of dense genetic markers in many species make it a good time to (re)evaluate the usefulness of genetic markers in this context. Using three published data sets where both pedigrees and markers are available, we evaluate two common and a new genetic estimator of kinship. We show discrepancies between pedigree values and marker estimates of kinship and explore via simulations the possible reasons for these. We find these discrepancies are attributable to two main sources: pedigree errors and heterogeneity in the origin of founders. We also show that our new marker‐based kinship estimator has very good statistical properties and behaviour and is particularly well suited for situations where the source population is of small size, as will often be the case in conservation biology, and where high levels of kinship are expected, as is typical in social evolution studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a31003A‐138180cSwiss National Science Foundation  aIZK023‐157867cSwiss National Science Foundation  aGM075091cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3agenetic markers 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahuman genetics 3akinship 3apedigree 3apermeates 3awildlife management1 aKay, Tomas1 aWeir, Bruce S.0 tMolecular ecology.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 20 p.4121-4135dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.148333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245016400203300001600367500001400383500002000397520146900417592002801886650001301914650001001927650004301937650002001980650000902000650002002009650001902029700006402048700002202112700003202134773013202166856007302298852000902371655001202380IND60723953320221120084317.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072395332DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.138592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel Aziz, Rabie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2582-356710aTranscript abundance of anti‐Mullérian hormone and follicle‐stimulating hormone receptor predicted superstimulatory response in embryo donor Holstein cows  ap. 153-160.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe goal was to investigate the relationship among mRNA expressions of anti‐Mullérian hormone (AMH), follicle‐stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and responses to superovulation (SO) in embryo donor dairy cows. Holstein cows (n = 19) were submitted to a standard SO protocol, with twice daily FSH treatments, and artificially inseminated. Prior to SO (Day 0), relative mRNA expressions of AMH and FSHR in blood were determined for all cows. Day 7 embryos were collected and were graded to determine superovulatory response for each donor. Results showed that relative mRNA expressions of AMH and FSHR were positively correlated (R² = 0.94). Relative mRNA expressions of both AMH and FSHR were positively correlated with total embryos (R² = 0.68 and 0.69, respectively), total transferable embryos (R² = 0.92 and 0.97, respectively) and total grade 1 embryos (R² = 0.54 and 0.59, respectively). Further, transcript abundances of AMH and FSHR positively associated with milk production of donor cows, and meanwhile, they were negatively associated with days in milk (DIM) at submission of cows to SO (p < .05) protocol. The relative mRNA expression of AMH was higher (p < .05) in donor cows <5 years of age. However, age of donor at superovulation did not influence mRNA expression of FSHR. Collectively, we infer that the mRNA expressions of AMH and FSHR prior to superovulation can predict donor cows’ positive response to superovulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3ablood 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3agene expression 3amilk 3amilk production 3asuperovulation1 aAbdel‐Wahab, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4255-89531 aIbrahim, Marwa A.1 aKasimanickam, Ramanathan K.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.153-160dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.138593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013300162520156300295592002801858650001801886650001501904650001901919650002001938650002001958650001301978650001301991650001202004651001202016700002402028700002102052700002602073700002902099700002502128773012202153856007402275852000902349655001202358IND60748652620221119125021.0210827e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074865262DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130824842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Bridget 10aKeto-on-the-Clock: A Survey of Dietetic Care Contact Time Taken to Provide Ketogenic Diets for Drug-Resistant Epilepsy in the UK  aMedical ketogenic diets (KDs) are effective yet resource-intensive treatment options for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). We investigated dietetic care contact time, as no recent data exist. An online survey was circulated to ketogenic dietitians in the UK and Ireland. Data were collected considering feeding route, KD variant and type of ketogenic enteral feed (KEF), and the estimated number of hours spent on patient-related activities during the patient journey. Fifteen dietitians representing nine KD centres responded. Of 335 patients, 267 (80%) were 18 years old or under. Dietitians spent a median of 162 h (IQR 54) of care contact time per patient of which a median of 48% (IQR 6) was direct contact. Most time was required for the classical KD taken orally (median 193 h; IQR 213) as a combined tube and oral intake (median 211 h; IQR 172) or a blended food KEF (median 189 h; IQR 148). Care contact time per month was higher for all KDs during the three-month initial trial compared to the two-year follow-up stage. Patients and caregivers with characteristics such as learning or language difficulties were identified as taking longer. Twelve out of fifteen (80%) respondents managed patients following the KD for more than two years, requiring an estimated median contact care time of 2 h (IQR 2) per patient per month. Ten out of fifteen (67%) reported insufficient official hours for dietetic activities. Our small survey gives insight into estimated dietetic care contact time, with potential application for KD provision and service delivery  aPublisher supplied data 3ablended foods 3acaregivers 3adirect contact 3adrug resistance 3aenteral feeding 3aepilepsy 3apatients 3asurveys 3aIreland1 aLightfoot, Kathryn 1 aMeskell, Rachel 1 aWhiteley, Victoria J.1 aMartin-McGill, Kirsty J.1 aSchoeler, Natasha E.0 tNutrients.g2021 July 21, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130824843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245014000177300001800317520105800335536010001393592002801493650002201521650002001543650002101563650002401584650003001608650001101638650001301649650001301662650001601675650002401691650002401715650002101739650001501760650002201775653002901797653002301826653001601849653000801865653002201873653001001895700001901905700001501924700001701939700002801956773013601984856008602120852000902206655001202215IND60720867820221119163243.0220122e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072086782DNAL7 a10.1080/16583655.2020.18051862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUddin, Mohammad Nasir10aStress degradation, structural optimization, molecular docking, ADMET analysis of tiemonium methylsulphate and its degradation products  ap. 1134-1146.  aAttempts have been taken to study stress degradation of tiemonium methylsulphate (TMS). Quantum mechanical approach was applied to investigate the structural information, protein binding affinity and pharmacokinetic properties of the TMS and degradation products. Forced degradation study revealed that TMS degraded significantly under acid hydrolysis and photolytic degradation conditions than basic, thermal or oxidative conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP/6-31G+ (d, p) has been employed to optimize the structures. Frontier molecular orbital features (HOMO–LUMO) gap, hardness, softness), dipole moment, atomic partial charge, electrostatic potential and thermodynamic properties (electronic energy, enthalpy, Gibb's free energy) are investigated for optimization of degradation products. Molecular docking has been performed against muscarinic acetylcholine receptor protein 5DSG to search the binding affinity and mode(s).

However, in the recent era, the introduction of large quantities of anthropogenic noise into the ocean has significantly altered the ocean’s acoustic environment. The anthropogenic noises travel very long distances, blanketing enormous areas. This can affect cetaceans, either by direct killing or compromising hearing, navigation, communication, predation, as well as normal behaviors. It has been suggested that acoustic pollution could possibly negatively affect cetacean reproduction, which is harmful for endangered and threatened species. However, it is still unknown how acoustic pollution can suppress cetacean reproduction. This is the first comprehensive review article, which focuses on the possible consequences affecting the reproduction of marine mammals resulting from acoustic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCetacea 3aacoustics 3aextinction 3aforaging 3ahearing 3alearning 3amarine mammals 3apollution 3apredation 3apredators 3areproduction 3athreatened species1 aMcLaughlin, Richard William1 aHao, Yujiang1 aWang, Kexiong1 aZeng, Xianyuan1 aKhan, Suliman1 aWang, Ding0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 July, v. 25, no. 20 p.19338-19345dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2208-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008400156300001600240520108900256592002801345650001801373650000901391650001801400650002901418650001101447700002501458773013501483856007501618852000901693655001201702IND60765150020221120184851.0220509e20111211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515002DNAL7 a10.17221/4222-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZelenka, J.10aEffect of age on digestibility of starch in chickens with different growth rate  ap. 411-415.  aDigestibility of starch was examined in slow-growing cockerels of laying type (SG) and in fast-growing male chickens (FG) of broiler type fed ad libitum on a&nbsp;maize-type diet until Day 22 of age in one-day periods and from Day 22 to Day 100 in three-day periods. Digestibility was estimated using the chromic oxide indicator method. In SG chicks, starch digestibility rapidly increased within the first days of their lives and reached the value of 0.986 already on Day 4 of life. It was maintained on this level till the end of the experiment, which was finished at the age of 100 days. In FG chicks, which in comparison with SG birds consumed more than a double quantity of feed, high starch digestibility was observed as late as on Day 8. From Day 8 to Day 100 of age, starch digestibility slightly but highly significantly (P &lt; 0.01) decreased. The average value of digestibility was lower by 0.008 in broiler type chickens than in SG chickens at this time; nevertheless, digestibility was never below 0.96.

Serum VD concentrations are determined by both distal (DF) and proximal factors (PF). Objective: To identify if DF and PF can predict VD insufficiency (VDI) and VD deficiency (VDD) in women of childbearing age; and to test whether maternal exposure to DF and PF during pregnancy and a child’s exposure during the first 11.9 months postpartum are associated with sporadic retinoblastoma (SRb) in children. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from the Epidemiology of SRb in Mexico (EpiRbMx) study and the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018–2019 (ENSANUT 2018–2019, for its acronym in Spanish). The association of DF and PF with VDD or VDI was estimated using ENSANUT 2018–2019, and the association of DF and PF with SRb using EpiRbMx. All were estimated using logistic regression, with comparable samples selected from ENSANUT 2018–2019 and EpiRbMx. Results: Altitude, latitude and obesity predicted VDI and VDD in ENSANUT women. In EpiRbMx, residence in a rural location during pregnancy increased the risk of SRb. For children, rural residence and latitude increased the risk of SRb, while the number of days exposed to the spring–summer season during months 6 to 11.9 of life was protective. Conclusions: risk of VDI and VDD in women (ENSANUT 2018–2019) increased with altitude, urban dwelling, overweight and obesity. The child and mother’s place of residence, including altitude, latitude and rural classification were important predictors of SRb in EpiRbMx.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3achildren 3alatitude 3amaternal exposure 3anutrition surveys 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arural areas 3aMexico1 aFlores-Aldana, Mario E.1 aQuezada-Sánchez, Amado D.1 aShamah Levy, Teresa,1 aVillalpando, Salvador 1 aContreras-Manzano, Alejandra 1 aBhatt-Carreño, Silvia 1 aOrjuela-Grimm, Manuela 0 tNutrients.g2021 July 23, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130825103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001800271520136000289592002801649650002101677650001501698650002101713650002101734650000701755650001701762700002201779700002101801700002001822700002301842700006001865773014801925856008202073852000902155655001202164IND60612728120221119041431.0190213e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061272812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1248-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerdes, Benjamin10aQuantification of Hv1-induced proton translocation by a lipid-coupled Oregon Green 488-based assay  ap. 6497-6505.  aPassive proton translocation across membranes through proton channels is generally measured with assays that allow a qualitative detection of the H⁺-transfer. However, if a quantitative and time-resolved analysis is required, new methods have to be developed. Here, we report on the quantification of pH changes induced by the voltage-dependent proton channel Hv1 using the commercially available pH-sensitive fluorophore Oregon Green 488-DHPE (OG488-DHPE). We successfully expressed and isolated Hv1 from Escherichia coli and reconstituted the protein in large unilamellar vesicles. Reconstitution was verified by surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and proton activity was measured by a standard 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine assay. The quantitative OG488-DHPE assay demonstrated that the proton translocation rate of reconstituted Hv1 is much smaller than those reported in cellular systems. The OG488-DHPE assay further enabled us to quantify the KD-value of the Hv1-inhibitor 2-guanidinobenzimidazole, which matches well with that found in cellular experiments. Our results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the developed in vitro assay to measure proton translocation in a quantitative fashion; the assay allows to screen for new inhibitors and to determine their characteristic parameters.

They included: (1) an online survey to identify immunization implementation barriers and desired vaccine attributes in three use settings, (2) an online survey to identify and evaluate the most important immunization challenges for ten exemplar vaccines, and (3) in-depth interviews to better understand the perceived programmatic benefits and challenges that could be addressed by nine innovations and to rank the innovations that could best address current challenges.The first consultation included responses from 442 participants in 61 countries, representing 89% of the 496 respondents who correctly completed at least one section of the online survey. For facility-based settings, missed opportunities for vaccination due to reluctance to open multidose vaccine vials was the barrier most frequently selected by respondents. In community-based (outreach) and campaign settings, limited access to immunization services due to geographic barriers was most frequently selected. Multidose presentations with preservative or single-dose presentations were most frequently selected as desired vaccine attributes for facility-based settings while improved thermostability was most frequently selected for outreach and campaign settings. The second online survey was completed by 220 respondents in 54 countries. For the exemplar vaccines, vaccine ineffectiveness or wastage due to heat or freeze exposure and missed opportunities due to multidose vial presentations were identified as the greatest vaccine-specific challenges. In-depth interviews with 84 respondents in six countries ranked microarray patches, dual-chamber delivery devices, and heat-stable/controlled temperature chain qualified liquid vaccines as the three innovations that could have the greatest impact in helping address current immunization program challenges.These findings informed the VIPS prioritization and provided broader application to designing immunization interventions to better meet country needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquids 3amicroarray technology 3aoutreach 3aprioritization 3asurveys 3atemperature 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVaccine product innovation 0aImmunization 0aVaccine 0aLow- and middle-income countries 0aDelivery technologies 0aProduct development 0aCoverage and equity 0aCHAI 0aCPADs 0aCTC 0aEPI 0aHPV 0aIPV 0aMAPs 0aSIP 0aSDI 0aVIPS 0aWHO 0aUNICEF 0aVVM-TIs1 aFrivold, Collrane1 aJanik Osborne, Anna1 aSoni, Priyanka1 aRobertson, Joanie1 aKumar, Sandeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8024-18291 aAnena, Jacqueline1 aGueye, Abdoulaye1 aMenozzi-Arnaud, Marion1 aGiersing, Birgitte1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2555-77561 aKahn, Anna-Lea1 aScarna, Tiziana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4410-10601 aKristensen, Debra0 tVaccine.g2021 Dec. 03, v. 39, no. 49 p.7195-7207dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015200170300001600322520229700338592002802635653002702663653002102690653002302711653002202734700001802756700001902774700001802793700001802811700002002829700002202849773009202871856008402963852000903047655001203056IND60594258520221121065229.0180510e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059425852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lithos.2016.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedele, Lorenzo10aPost-collisional magmatism in the Late Miocene Rodna-Bârgău district (East Carpathians, Romania): Geochemical constraints and petrogenetic models  ap. 367-382.  aPost-collisional magmatism in the Late Miocene Rodna-Bârgău subvolcanic district (East Carpathians) gave rise to a wide variety of rock compositions, allowing recognition of four groups of calcalkaline rocks with distinctive petrography, mineral chemistry, whole-rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope features. New U-Pb zircon datings, together with literature data, indicate that the emplacement of the four rock groups was basically contemporaneous in the 11.5–8Ma time span. The low potassium group (LKG) includes the most abundant lithotypes of the area, ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite, characterized by K-poor tschermakitic amphibole, weak enrichment in LILE and LREE, relatively low ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr, coupled with relatively high ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd and ¹⁷⁶Hf/¹⁷⁷Hf. The high potassium group (HKG) includes amphibole-bearing microgabbro, amphibole andesite and amphibole- and biotite dacite, with K-richer magnesio-hastingsite to hastingsite amphibole, more marked enrichments in incompatible elements, higher ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr and lower ¹⁴³Nd/¹⁴⁴Nd and ¹⁷⁶Hf/¹⁷⁷Hf. These two main rock groups seem to have originated from similar juxtaposed mantle sources, with the HKG possibly related to slightly more enriched domains (with higher H2O reflected by the higher modal amphibole) with respect to LKG (with higher plagioclase/amphibole ratios). The evolution of the two rock series involved also open-system processes, taking place mainly in the upper crust for the HKG, in the lower crust for LKG magmas. In addition, limited occurrences of generally younger strongly evolved peraluminous rhyolites and microgranites (Acid group) and sialic-dominated “leucocratic” andesites and dacites (LAD group) were also recognized to the opposite outermost areas of the district. These two latter rock groups were generated by the melting of a basic metamorphic crustal source (respectively in hydrous and anhydrous conditions), favored by the heat released by mantle melts from the adjoining central area. The peculiar distribution of the products of the four rock groups in well defined sectors argues for a strong control of the local crustal tectonic regime on magmatism, influenced by the change from a transpressional to trastensional stage.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCalcalkaline magmatism 0aEast Carpathians 0aZircon U-Pb dating 0aSr-Nd-Hf isotopes1 aSeghedi, Ioan1 aChung, Sun-Lin1 aLaiena, Fabio1 aLin, Te-Hsien1 aMorra, Vincenzo1 aLustrino, Michele0 tLithos.g2016 Dec., v. 266-267 p.367-382dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26740x0024-49377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2016.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010300207520095600310592002801266650003101294650002401325650002801349650003001377650002701407650002501434650001501459650002301474650002601497650001701523650001501540650001501555650001801570653001801588653002401606700005501630773012201685856008101807852000901888655001201897IND60741996820221120152248.0211029e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074199682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeong, Hui-Yeong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2738-332310aEnhanced protein quality and antioxidant activity of fermented Brown rice with Gryllus bimaculatus  aWe fermented samples of only brown rice and samples of brown rice added with the cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) with probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Leuconostoc mesenteroides MKSR, Lb. plantarum MKHA11, or Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MKSK J1, and evaluated their protein quality and antioxidant activity. When the cricket was added to brown rice, the protein and the total amino acid content, and the antioxidant activity increased significantly. In all samples, the degree of hydrolysis significantly increased with the fermentation time, and in vitro protein digestibility increased by 10%–20% after fermentation. The brown rice with cricket fermented with B. amyloliquefaciens MKSK J1 exhibited the highest amino acid quality based on the essential amino acid index and branched-chain amino acids content.

They occupy remarkably diverse ecological niches as free‐living organisms or in association with lichen‐forming fungi and were recently shown to form two distinct lineages within Trebouxiophyceae. We used a polyphasic approach to revise the taxonomy of the genus. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene, and detailed morphological investigation using comparative conventional light and confocal microscopy, we have assigned these lineages to two genera, Dictyochloropsis and Symbiochloris gen. nov. We have reconsidered the diagnostic generic features as follows: Dictyochloropsis comprises only free‐living algae with a reticulate chloroplast, forming lobes in a parallel arrangement at some ontogenetic stages, and which reproduce only by means of autospores. This agrees with Geitler's original diagnosis of Dictyochloropsis, but not with the later emendation by Tschermak‐Woess. Consequently, the species of Dictyochloropsis sensu Tschermak‐Woess are assigned to Symbiochloris, with new combinations proposed. Symbiochloris encompasses free‐living and/or lichenized algae with lobed chloroplasts and that reproduce by forming zoospores characterized by two subapical isokont flagella that emerge symmetrically near the flattened apex. In addition, using coalescent‐based approaches, morphological characters and secondary structure of ITS transcripts, we inferred species boundaries and taxonomic relationships within the newly proposed genera. Two species of Dictyochloropsis and nine species of Symbiochloris are delimited, including the newly described species D. asterochloroides, S. handae, S. tropica, and S. tschermakiae. Our results further support the non‐monophyly of autosporine taxa within Trebouxiophyceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrebouxiophyceae 3aalgae 3achloroplasts 3aconfocal microscopy 3aflagellum 3afungi 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alichens 3anew combination 3anew genus 3anew species 3aniches 3aontogeny 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomic revisions 3azoospores1 aFriedl, Thomas1 aHallmann, Christine1 aBeck, Andreas,d1948-1 aDal Grande, Francesco0 tJournal of phycology.g2016 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.599-617dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.124223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245005700156300001400213500002000227520076500247592002801012650001101040650001201051650001001063650000901073650002301082773011501105856007301220852000901293655001201302IND60788324820221121090417.0220813e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078832482DNAL7 a10.1136/inp.l4282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeates, James10aApplying veterinary ethics to a case of tail docking  ap. 88-91.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article, the second in a series of three, uses the general principles of veterinary ethics that were discussed in the last issue of In Practice (January/February 2019, volume 41, pp 42‐44) to decide whether tail docking should be authorised on a farm on which there is a high prevalence of tail biting. It does not suggest an outcome but tries neutrally to highlight how each pathway might be defended or challenged to improve reflection and discussion with the farmer and colleagues.

These phenotypes are not based on heritable genetic differences. Instead, they arise during ontogeny, which should lead to differences in brain structure or physiology, a currently untested prediction. We compared brain gene expression profiles of cleaners and noncleaners in two experimental conditions, a helping opportunity and a control condition. We aimed to identify (a) expression differences between cleaners and noncleaners in the control, (b) changes in gene expression induced by the opportunity and (c) differences in plasticity of gene expression between cleaners and noncleaners. Control cleaners and noncleaners differed in the expression of a single gene, irx2, which regulates neural differentiation. During the opportunity, cleaners and noncleaners had three upregulated genes in common, which were implicated in neuroplasticity, hormonal signalling and cell proliferation. Thus, the stimulus in the opportunity was sufficiently salient. Cleaners also showed higher expression of seven additional genes that were unique to the opportunity. One of these cleaner‐specific genes is implicated in neuropeptide metabolism, indicating that this process is associated with cleaning performance. This suggests that the two types employed different pathways to integrate social information, preparing them for accelerated reaction to future opportunities. Interestingly, three developmental genes were downregulated between the control and the opportunity in cleaners only. Our results indicate that the two behavioural types responded differently to the helping opportunity and that only cleaners responded by downregulating developmental genes.  aPublisher supplied data  a31003A_156881cSwiss National Science Foundation  aPDFMP3_137196cSwiss National Science Foundation  cUniversity of Bern and an international travel internship award from Ressources Aquatiques Québec  cVanier Canada Graduate Scholarship  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)  cDiscovery program grant from NSERC 3aNeolamprologus pulcher 3aalloparental behavior 3abrain 3acell proliferation 3acleaning 3aeggs 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ajuveniles 3ametabolism 3aneuropeptides 3aneuroplasticity 3aontogeny 3aphenotype 3aplasticity 3aprediction1 aHebert, Francois Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8111-04841 aAubin‐Horth, Nadia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9030-634X1 aTaborsky, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1690-81550 tMolecular ecology.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 20 p.4136-4151dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.148373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012700162520134600289592002801635650003301663650001801696650004901714650001701763650003301780650002601813650001801839650001101857650001401868650002401882650001801906650001401924650004301938650005201981700002902033700001802062700002102080773012202101856007302223852000902296655001202305IND60719066820221120195515.0201126e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071906682DNAL7 a10.3390/v121112272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalecker, Sabrina 10a“FastCheckFLI PPR-like”—A Molecular Tool for the Fast Genome Detection of PPRV and Differential Diagnostic Pathogens  aTo assist the global eradication of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), a molecular test for the rapid and reliable detection of PPRV was developed which additionally enables the detection of pathogens relevant for differential diagnostics. For this purpose, the necessary time frame of a magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction protocol was markedly shortened to 7 min and 13 s. The optimized extraction was run on a BioSprint 15 platform. Furthermore, a high-speed multi-well RT-qPCR for the genome detection of PPRV and additional important pathogens such as Foot-and-mouth disease virus, Parapoxvirus ovis, Goatpox virus, and Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae was established and combined with suitable internal control assays. The here-described qPCR is based on a lyophilized master mix and takes only around 30 to 40 min. Several qPCR cyclers were evaluated regarding their suitability for fast-cycling approaches and for their diagnostic performance in a high-speed RT-qPCR. The final evaluation was conducted on the BioRad CFX96 and also on a portable Liberty16 qPCR cycler. The new molecular test designated as “FastCheckFᴸᴵ PPR-like”, which is based on rapid nucleic acid extraction and high-speed RT-qPCR, delivered reliable results in less than one hour, allowing its use also in a pen-side scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aGoatpox virus 3aMycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae 3aParapoxvirus 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3adiagnostic techniques 3afreeze drying 3agenome 3amagnetism 3amicrobial detection 3anucleic acids 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aMettenleiter, Thomas C.,1 aBeer, Martin 1 aHoffmann, Bernd 0 tViruses.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121112273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006700159300001600226520204100242592002802283650001002311650001402321650000802335650001302343650000802356650001402364650002502378650002502403650000902428650001502437650002302452650001602475650002002491650001402511650001402525700001702539700002402556700001902580700002302599773013502622856007502757852000902832655001202841IND60765150220221120184833.0220419e20111211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515022DNAL7 a10.17221/4226-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSJ, Rosochacki10aCathepsin involvement in muscle proteolysis in meat-type bulls  ap. 422-429.  aMeasurements were done of some lysosomal proteolytic enzyme activities involved in skeletal muscle proteolysis of the masculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis muscle (MLLT) of bulls. Samples from the same region between the 11th and 13th vertebra were taken after slaughter from Limousin (n = 10), Hereford (n = 10), Charolais (n = 10), Angus (n = 11) and Simmental (n = 11) bulls about 15 months old fed complete diet ad libitum. The activity of cathepsin D was determined as pepstatin (cathepsin D inhibitor) sensitive activity (PSCatD) towards 1% haemoglobin. Pepstatin-insensitive acid (PIA) and leupeptin-insensitive (thiol proteinases inhibitor) acid (LIA) autolytic activities were measured in the presence of 1mM Mg<sup>++</sup>. MLLT was also analysed for RNA, DNA and protein variables. The data were processed by analysis of variance. The highest activities in PSCatD (P &le; 0.05), AAA (P &le; 0.01) and LIA (P &le; 0.05) as well as percentage of inhibition by pepstatin in cathepsin D (P &le; 0.01) were estimated in Angus bulls, and the lowest in Limousin ones. These breeds differed in the above-mentioned activities by 20.3, 21.1, 31.1 and 13.1%, respectively. RNA/g of tissue was highest in Hereford and lowest in Limousin bulls (by about 15.3%, P&nbsp;&le; 0.01). Similar differences (14.3%) were between Charolais and Limousin (P &le; 0.01). CPS (10<sup>3 </sup>RNA/protein) was higher by 18.3% (P &le; 0.01) in Charolais compared to the value in Simmental bulls; similar differences were between Hereford and Simmental (16.4%, P &le; 0.01). The DNA concentration was highest in Hereford (by about 30%) compared to Charolais bulls. Protein/10<sup>3</sup>DNA ratio (mg/mg) &ndash; FCS &ndash; was higher by 33.4% in Charolais compared toHereford; RNA/DNA ratio was higher by 40.2% in Charolais compared toLimousin bulls. These results indicate the fast turnover of proteins in the groups of examined bulls and it can be concluded that in hypertrophic MLLT of bulls an anabolic decrease in degradation occurred. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aCharolais 3aDNA 3aHereford 3aRNA 3aSimmental 3aanalysis of variance 3acysteine proteinases 3adiet 3ahemoglobin 3alongissimus muscle 3aproteolysis 3askeletal muscle 3aslaughter 3avertebrae1 aSakowski, T.1 aJuszczuk-Kubiak, E.1 aButarewicz, A.1 aPołoszynowicz, J.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 50, no. 9 p.422-429dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4226-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03367naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245013800181300001600319520149900335592002801834650001801862650000801880650002401888650001301912650002301925650001401948650001001962650002001972650001501992650001302007650000902020650002702029650001402056650003502070650001502105650003902120650002302159650003302182650001702215650002002232650001702252650002002269650001802289650001302307650005202320650004602372650004202418700002102460700002002481700001902501700002102520700001502541773010702556856008102663852000902744655001202753IND50074214520221118045639.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007421452DNAL7 a243265282pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-013-0798-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Hee10aConstruction of a genetic map based on high-throughput SNP genotyping and genetic mapping of a TuMV resistance locus in Brassica rapa  ap. 149-160.  aBrassica rapa is a member of the Brassicaceae family and includes vegetables and oil crops that are cultivated worldwide. The introduction of durable resistance against turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) into agronomically important cultivars has been a significant challenge for genetic and horticultural breeding studies of B. rapa. Based on our previous genome-wide analysis of DNA polymorphisms between the TuMV-resistant doubled haploid (DH) line VC40 and the TuMV-susceptible DH line SR5, we constructed a core genetic map of the VCS-13M DH population, which is composed of 83 individuals derived from microspore cultures of a F₁cross between VC40 and SR5, by analyzing the segregation of 314 sequence-characterized genetic markers. The genetic markers correspond to 221 SNPs and 31 InDels of genes as well as 62 SSRs, covering 1,115.9 cM with an average distance of 3.6 cM between the adjacent marker loci. The alignment and orientation of the constructed map showed good agreement with the draft genome sequence of Chiifu, thus providing an efficient strategy to map genic sequences. Using the genetic map, a novel dominant TuMV resistance locus (TuMV-R) in the VCS-13M DH population was identified as a 0.34 Mb region in the short arm of chromosome A6 in which four CC–NBS–LRR resistance genes and two pathogenesis-related-1 genes reside. The genetic map developed in this study can play an important role in the genetic study of TuMV resistance and the molecular breeding of B. rapa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa 3aDNA 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3ahaploidy 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoil crops 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avegetables 2aBrassica rapaxgeneticsxvirology. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Loci 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxvirology. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aPotyvirusximmunologyxpathogenicity.1 aJeong, Young-Min1 aMun, Jeong-Hwan1 aLee, Soo-Seong1 aChung, Won-Hyong1 aYu, Hee-Ju0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2014 Apr., v. 289, no. 2 p.149-160dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-013-0798-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014400165300001600309520097200325592002801297650001901325650001301344650003001357650001701387650002301404650001201427650002101439650003601460650002301496650001101519650001401530650004101544650002301585650001701608650001301625650001401638650001401652650001001666650001101676651001001687653002001697653001001717653002501727653001801752700002101770700001801791773012701809856008401936852000902020655001202029IND60122579720221120094933.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012257972DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2014.9397152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoumya, V.10aGC-MS Characterization, in vitro Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Activity of Newly Isolated Oil from Edible Wild Bamboo Rice (Bambusa bambos)  ap. 209-215.  aBamboo has the peculiarity of flowering and seeding only once after a long vegetative phase.

The profiles of peptides and tea proteins in pickled tea during anaerobic fermentation were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that water-soluble proteins are the main target of hydrolysis in the fermentation, and the degradation of tea protein clusters at different fermentation time triggers the continuous release of peptides. ILW, WLR, WY, YV, ELW, FY, and PYV are considered to be the key peptides related to the antioxidant activity of pickled tea, and enzyme proteins especially rubisco and tubulin family proteins may be responsible for the release of these potential antioxidant peptides. Peptides derived from tea proteins are suggested to be one of the key antioxidants in pickled tea. The findings can promote to targeted degradation of tea protein to increase the active peptides and function in microbial fermented tea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3aliquid chromatography 3apeptides 3aprotein degradation 3aproteomics 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atea 3atubulin 3awater solubility 0aTea protein 0aPeptide 0aAmino acid 0aAntioxidant 0aPickled tea1 aChen, Yijie1 aGuo, Yafei1 aXu, Wencan1 aWang, Wenfeng1 aWu, Shuang1 aChen, Wenjun1 aHuang, Youyi0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Oct., v. 150 p.111950-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012900163520126000292592002801552650002401580650001201604650001501616650002201631650001301653650002301666650001501689650002001704650001401724650001501738650001201753650001001765651001101775700002601786700002401812773012201836856007301958852000902031655001202040IND60719067120221120195706.0201126e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071906712DNAL7 a10.3390/v121112292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrettell, Laura  E.10aRNAseq of Deformed Wing Virus and Other Honey Bee-Associated Viruses in Eight Insect Taxa with or without Varroa Infestation  aThe global spread of a parasitic mite (Varroa destructor) has resulted in Deformed wing virus (DWV), a previously rare pathogen, now dominating the viromes in honey bees and contributing to large-scale honey bee colony losses. DWV can be found in diverse insect taxa and has been implicated in spilling over from honey bees into associated (“apiary”) and other (“non-apiary”) insects. Here we generated next generation sequence data from 127 insect samples belonging to diverse taxa collected from Hawaiian islands with and without Varroa to identify whether the mite has indirectly affected the viral landscapes of key insect taxa across bees, wasps, flies and ants. Our data showed that, while Varroa was associated with a dramatic increase in abundance of (predominantly recombinant) DWV in honey bees (and no other honey bee-associated RNA virus), this change was not seen in any other taxa sampled. Honey bees share their environment with other insect populations and exist as a homogenous group, frequently sharing common viruses, albeit at low levels. Our data suggest that the threat of Varroa to increase viral load in an apiary does not automatically translate to an increase in virus load in other insects living in the wider community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDeformed wing virus 3aDiptera 3aFormicidae 3aVarroa destructor 3aapiaries 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3aparasitic mites 3apathogens 3aviral load 3aviruses 3awasps 3aHawaii1 aSchroeder, Declan  C.1 aMartin, Stephen J.,0 tViruses.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121112293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014500157300001600302520152800318592002801846650002001874650002601894650001101920650001401931650001601945650002301961650001401984650000901998650001402007650001902021650001202040650002002052650000902072651001002081651001002091700001802101773013102119856007402250852000902324655001202333IND60765150420221120184857.0220419e20111211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515042DNAL7 a10.17221/4229-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzembor, J.H.10aSelections from barley landrace collected in Libya as new sources of effective resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei)  ap. 217-223.  aPowdery mildew on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) caused by the pathogen Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei occurs worldwide and can result in severe yield loss. Because agronomical methods to control the disease are not completely effective, cultivars with genetic resistance are needed. Therefore, there is a&nbsp;need to describe new sources of genes that confer resistance to barley powdery mildew. This study was conducted to determine the genetic basis of resistance to powdery mildew in three selections 995-1-1, 995-1-2, 995-1-3 from barley landrace 995 (ICB 112840) collected in Al Aziziyah district, Tripolitania, Libya. Landrace originated from InternationalCenter for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas &ndash; ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria. To determine the number of genes, the types of genes action and the gene loci in tested lines two types of crosses were made: (1) the lines were crossed to the susceptible cultivar Pallas, (2) the lines were crossed with Pallas isoline P22 carrying gene mlo5. The parents and progeny F2&nbsp;were evaluated with isolate R303.1 for the powdery mildew resistance. Based on segregation ratios we found that resistance in these three selections was determined by a&nbsp;single recessive gene allelic to the Mlo locus occurring in Pallas isoline P22. In addition tested lines showed resistance reaction type 0(4) characteristic only for genes mlo. The value of new identified sources of highly effective powdery mildew resistance to breeding programs and barley production is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aagricultural research 3abarley 3acultivars 3aenvironment 3agenetic resistance 3alandraces 3aloci 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aprogeny 3arecessive genes 3asoil 3aLibya 3aSyria1 aCzembor, H.J.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 48, no. 5 p.217-223dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4229-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008700172300001600259520080800275592002801083650002501111650001501136650002001151650001301171650002001184650001101204650001201215700002601227773014001253856008501393852000901478655001201487IND60449273020221117212937.0151030e20150903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044927302DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2015.10694262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcre, Matthew R.10aDeployment of Paired Push Nets from Jet-Propelled Kayaks to Sample Ichthyoplankton  ap. 925-929.  aAccessing and effectively sampling the off-channel habitats that are considered crucial for early life stages of freshwater fishes constitute a difficult challenge when common ichthyoplankton survey methods, such as push nets, are used. We describe a new method of deploying push nets from jet-propelled kayaks to enable the sampling of previously inaccessible off-channel habitats. The described rig is also functional in more open and accessible habitats, such as the main channel of rivers or reservoirs.

The objective of this study was to quantify water stress effects on various plant growth and reproductive traits using two soybean cultivars with distinct growth habits, indeterminate type, Asgrow AG5332 and determinate type, Progeny P5333RY. Plants grown in pots outdoors were moved into sunlit controlled environment at flowering stage. Five water stress treatments, 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20% of daily evapotranspiration of the control, were imposed at flowering and continued until maturity. Plant height and node numbers were recorded at 7-day intervals. Plant component dry weights, pod distribution patterns, and pod and seed yield were measured at the final harvest. A quadratic function best described the relationship between soil moisture content and midday leaf water potential and − 1.0 MPa leaf water potential was achieved at optimum soil moisture content of 0.15 m³ m⁻ ³ soil. The middle region of the canopy in both cultivars accounted for about 60% of final yield compared to top and bottom regions. Branch pod yield was about threefold as high as mainstem yield, and it was more sensitive to moisture stress than mainstem yield. Harvest index declined linearly with decreasing soil moisture levels in the cultivars, and rate of decline in Asgrow AG5332 was lower (slope = 1.68) than the decline of Progeny P5333RY (slope = 2.42) m³ m⁻ ³. The functional relationships between soil moisture stress and yield components will be useful to aid farm managers in scheduling irrigation and to improve the functionality of soybean crop models under varying soil moisture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-34263-24070, G-14901-1cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3acrop models 3acultivars 3aevapotranspiration 3afarms 3aflowering 3aharvest index 3airrigation scheduling 3aleaf water potential 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aprogeny 3areproductive traits 3aseed yield 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water deficit 3asoybeans 3awater content 3awater stress1 aReddy, K.

To explore the physiological basis of such shifts, we measured juvenile light interception, carbon gain and growth of four subtropical Australian rainforest trees differing in shade tolerance, comparing individuals ranging from 13 to 238 cm in height, across a wide range of understory environments. We hypothesized that even in a standardized light environment, increasing sapling size would lead to declines in net daily carbon gain of foliage and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species, with declines more pronounced in light-demanding species. Crown architecture of individuals was recorded using a 3-dimensional digitizer, and the YPLANT program was used to estimate the self-shaded fraction of each crown and model net carbon gain. Increased sapling size caused a significant increase in self-shading, and significant declines in net daily carbon gain and RGR of light-demanding species, while such ontogenetic variations were minimal or absent in shade-tolerant species. Additionally, differences in the slope of the relationship between light and RGR led to crossovers in RGR among shade-tolerant and light-demanding species at low light. Our results show that the magnitude of ontogenetic variation in net daily carbon gain and RGR can be substantial and may depend on successional status, making it unsafe to assume that young seedling performance can be used to predict or model responses of larger juvenile trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aevergreen trees 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3amodels 3aontogeny 3arain forests 3aseedlings 3ashade tolerance 3aunderstory1 aReich, Peter B.1 aLusk, Christopher H.0 tOecologia.g2018 July, v. 187, no. 3 p.609-623dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4125-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245014700159300001600306520116600322592002801488650004401516650001501560650001301575650003601588650001701624650003101641650000901672650001401681650004801695700001501743773013401758856007901892852000901971655001201980IND60765150520221120184831.0220419e20161221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076515052DNAL7 a10.17221/423/2015-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, C.L.10aEffects of transglutaminase-induced modification in the presence of oligochitosan of 1 kDa on the structure and gelling properties of caseinat  ap. 564-569.  aCaseinate, transglutaminase (TGase), and an oligochitosan of 1 kDa were used to prepare a glycated and cross-linked caseinate (GC-caseinate), aiming to assess potential changes in both the structure and gelling properties of such caseinate. The results of Fourier transform infrared analysis revealed that only GC-caseinate contained saccharide portions in its molecules, evidencing TGase-induced caseinate glycation. Circular dichroism results showed that GC-caseinate possessed a more ordered secondary structure than caseinate. Other results also demonstrated that TGase-induced modification resulted in a lower gelation temperature of GC-caseinate (59°C vs. 68°C) and increased the final tan δ value (0.30 vs. 0.15) compared to caseinate during the development of acidified gels. In addition, the acidified gels from GC-caseinate were detected to have lower water holding capacity (0.720 vs. 0.781 g/g gels), expanded gel network, and larger pore sizes than those from caseinate. It is thus evidenced that the used TGase-induced modification could confer caseinate with ordered secondary structure, expanded gel network but lower water holding capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acaseinates 3achitosan 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3agelatinization temperature 3agels 3aglycation 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase1 aZhao, X.H.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 34, no. 6 p.564-569dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/423/2015-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017500172300001600347520144800363592002801811650002801839650002501867650002701892650002601919650000901945650002901954650001301983650001101996650002002007650001902027650001002046650003702056650000902093653001802102653001102120653001802131653001002149653001502159653002502174653002302199700002002222700003402242700002202276700001902298773012802317856008402445852000902529655001202538IND60122579920221120104632.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012257992DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2014.9330832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanjewala, Deepak10aAntibacterial Properties of Lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus Steud) Wats Essential Oils in Single form and Combination of Honey Against Drug Resistant Pathogenic Bacteria  ap. 278-285.  aAntibacterial potential of four lemongrass essential oils (EOs) and their major oil constituent, citral in single form and in combination of honey were evaluated against multi drug resistant (MDR) bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Staphylococcus aureus . The antibacterial potentials determined using agar well diffusion method has revealed that Krishna EOs exhibited most potent bactericidal effects than other Eos against all MDR bacteria used. The diameter of zone of inhibition of Krishna EOs ranged from 44-50 mm/50 µL of EOs. However, EOs of Pragati and Suvarna were selectively effective against S. aureus while that of Nima against A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa . Citral expressed better antibacterial potential against all the MDR bacteria with zone of inhibition 38-45 mm/50 µl. The combination of all four different EOs with honey showed pronounced antibacterial activity exclusively against S. aureus . The combination of Suvarna EOs and honey showed 22 % increase in antibacterial activity against A. baumannii than the EOs alone. The combination of citral and honey showed significantly lower antibacterial activity as compared to citral alone against all MDR bacteria used. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of EOs determined were 4.5 µg/ml. Thus, the study revealed enhanced antibacterial potential of lemongrass EO when they are used with honey against drug resistant S. aureus .  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter baumannii 3aCymbopogon flexuosus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acitral 3adrug resistance 3aessential oils 3ahoney 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoils 0aAntibacterial 0acitral 0aessential oil 0ahoney 0alemongrass 0amulti drug resistant 0azone of inhibition1 aMittal, Ruchika1 aGupta, A.

Despite weight restoration after treatment, a significant part of patients experience relapses. In this translational study, we combined clinical and preclinical approaches. We describe preliminary data about the effect of weight gain on the symptomatology of patients suffering from acute AN (n = 225) and partially recovered (n = 41). We measured more precisely physical activity with continuous cardiac monitoring in a sub-group (n = 68). Using a mouse model, we investigated whether a long-term food restriction followed by nutritional recovery associated or not with physical activity may differentially impact peripheral and central homeostatic regulation. We assessed the plasma concentration of acyl ghrelin, desacyl ghrelin and leptin and the mRNA expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides and their receptors. Our data show an effect of undernutrition history on the level of physical activity in AN. The preclinical model supports an important role of physical activity in the recovery process and points out the leptin system as one factor that can drive a reliable restoration of metabolic variables through the hypothalamic regulation of neuropeptides involved in feeding behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia nervosa 3agene expression 3aghrelin 3ahumans 3ahypothalamic regulation 3aleptin 3alow calorie diet 3amalnutrition 3amice 3aneuropeptides 3aphysical activity 3aweight gain1 aNilsson, Ida A.

In this study, we investigated ZIKV susceptibility to transgenic Aedes aegypti engineered to target the virus by means of the antiviral small-interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway. The robustness of antiviral effector expression in transgenic mosquitoes is strongly influenced by the genomic insertion locus and transgene copy number; we therefore used CRISPR/Cas9 to re-target a previously characterized locus (Chr2:321382225) and engineered mosquitoes expressing an inverted repeat (IR) dsRNA against the NS3/4A region of the ZIKV genome. Small RNA analysis revealed that the IR effector triggered the mosquito’s siRNA antiviral pathway in bloodfed females. Nearly complete (90%) inhibition of ZIKV replication was found in vivo in both midguts and carcasses at 7 or 14 days post-infection (dpi). Furthermore, significantly fewer transgenic mosquitoes contained ZIKV in their salivary glands (p = 0.001), which led to a reduction in the number of ZIKV-containing saliva samples as measured by transmission assay. Our work shows that Ae. aegypti innate immunity can be co-opted to engineer mosquitoes resistant to ZIKV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aZika virus 3aarboviruses 3acontrol methods 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afemales 3agene editing 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenomics 3ainnate immunity 3aloci 3amidgut 3asaliva 3asalivary glands 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransgenes 3avector control1 aSanchez-Vargas, Irma 1 aReid, William R.,1 aLin, Jingyi 1 aFranz, Alexander  W.E.1 aOlson, Ken  E.0 tViruses.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v121112313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04560naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010500205300001400310520346800324592002803792653001003820653001503830653001503845653001303860653001103873653000903884700005503893700001803948700005803966700001604024773008904040856008404129852000904213655001204222IND60594259120221121053621.0180510e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059425912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, K.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5144-450710aEffects of geodynamic setting on the redox state of fluids released by subducted mantle lithosphere  ap. 26-42.  aMagnetite breakdown during subduction of serpentinised ultramafic rocks may produce oxidised fluids that oxidise the deep Earth and/or the sub-arc mantle, either via direct transport of ferric iron, or via redox reactions between ferric iron and other elements, such as sulfur. However, so far, there is no consensus on the oxidation state of fluids released during subduction of ultramafic rocks, or the factors that control this oxidation state.Subducted samples from a magma-poor rifted margin and a supra-subduction zone geodynamic setting were compared to examine evidence of changes in opaque phase assemblage and ferric iron content as a consequence of subduction, and as a function of geodynamic setting. Thermodynamic calculations in the system Fe–Ni–O–H–S and Fe–Ni–O–S at the pressures and temperatures of interest were used to constrain oxygen activities and fluid compositions.Samples from New Caledonia, which exemplify supra-subduction zone mantle, contain awaruite (FeNi3) and equilibrated with hydrogen-bearing fluids at oxygen activity less than the FMQ (fayalite–magnetite–quartz) buffer. In contrast, samples from the Zermatt Saas Zone ophiolite, Western Alps, which are thought to represent mantle from a subducted magma-poor rifted margin, contain magnetite plus sulfur-rich phases such as pyrite (FeS2), and are inferred to have equilibrated with hydrogen-poor fluids at oxygen activity greater than FMQ. This major difference is independent of differences in subduction pressure–temperature conditions, variation in peridotite protolith composition, or the nature of adjacent units. We propose that the Zermatt Saas Zone samples would have undergone more complete serpentinisation prior to subduction than the supra-subduction zone (SSZ) New Caledonian samples. This difference explains the different fluid compositions, because incompletely serpentinised rocks containing olivine and brucite retain or evolve awaruite-bearing assemblages that buffer fluid compositions to high hydrogen activity (aH2).Ultramafic rocks are associated with two distinctly different fluid compositions during pre-subduction and subduction serpentinisation. Initially, while olivine is in equilibrium with infiltrating fluid, mineral assemblages that include awaruite in the rocks buffer fluids to H2-bearing, low aO2 compositions. Deserpentinisation of incompletely serpentinised rocks in which awaruite is present also produces H2-bearing fluids. Once awaruite is exhausted, H2-poor, high aO2 fluids co-exist with awaruite-absent assemblages, and deserpentinisation of such rocks would produce H2O-rich fluids.Thus, deserpentinisation of ultramafic rocks could produce either hydrogen-bearing fluids that could infiltrate and reduce the sub-arc mantle, or more oxidised fluids, which could transfer redox budget to other geochemical reservoirs such as the sub-arc mantle. Therefore, the redox contribution of subducted ultramafic rocks to the deep Earth and sub-arc mantle depends on the extent of protolith serpentinisation. Pre-subduction settings that promote extensive serpentinisation by oxidised fluids at high fluid:rock ratios in open systems, such as slow and ultraslow spreading ridges, transform faults, oceanic core complexes, and exhumed mantle at rifted continental margins, may produce more oxidised fluids than those associated with less pervasive serpentinisation and fluids that may be rock-buffered to a reduced state.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRedox 0aSubduction 0aUltramafic 0aAwaruite 0aSulfur 0aIron1 aReddy, S.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4726-57141 aTomkins, A.G.1 aCrossley, R.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8625-37271 aFrost, B.R.0 tLithos.g2017 May, v. 278-281 p.26-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26740x0024-49377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lithos.2016.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245012000183300001600303520090100319592002801220650001401248650002601262650001401288650002901302650001601331650002501347650001701372650001301389650002301402650001501425650002301440650001301463650003701476650001401513650001201527650001701539650002001556650001301576650001201589653002501601653001901626653001601645653001801661653000801679700002001687700002101707773012801728856008401856852000901940655001201949IND60122580020221117172647.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012258002DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2014.9369012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovindappa, Channabasava, M.10aPhytochemical Analysis of Loranthus micranthus Extracts and Their in vitro Antioxidant and Antibacterial Activities  ap. 303-315.  aIn the present study, out of four solvent extracts of Loranthus micranthus , the methanol extract yielded more phytochemicals (carbohydrates, cardiac glycosides, phytosterols, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, gums and mucilages, and reducing sugars) at highest concentration and also exhibited the highest phenolic and flavonoid content.

On examination the left stifle is thickened and you recommend sedation and radiographs to evaluate the joint further. As the dog is due to be neutered you recommend doing both procedures at the same time. The owner says she will save up to pay for them and come back another time. The dog is not insured. A few months later she phones the practice to ask what has been documented about the dog's lameness, and to enquire if her recently taken out policy would cover x‐rays. After being advised that the clinical history contains information about the lameness she becomes upset as she doesn’t want the insurance company to know it is a pre‐existing condition because she was hoping to claim for the radiographs on the new insurance policy. She asks you ‘what shall we do then, do we leave him to suffer’? (IP, January/February 2019, vol 41, pp 46‐47).

Water was supplied from the tips of 4-mm-diameter tubes measuring 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.85 m in the length inserted into the soils. Each tube was set from shallowest to deepest at intervals of 1.5–3.0 m in the field. Control by the irrigation system was evaluated in rice and spring wheat fields under rain-protected shelters, where two cultivars with different root depths were planted. The irrigation tool created a series of different soil water profiles in which wet soil layers decreased with increasing irrigation depth due to the inserted tube lengths in both fields. In fine sandy soils more than sand, continuous decreases in soil water content were well simulated. Leaf conductance, leaf green color (SPAD value), and aboveground plant dry weight in both fields decreased with increasing irrigation depth in shallow root cultivars to a greater extent than that in deep root cultivars. The lower reducing effect of deep irrigation on plant dry weight in wheat compared to that in rice suggested that the irrigation depth based on tube length should be changed depending on the root distribution traits in the tested crops. These results indicated that the irrigation tool can conveniently simulate a diverse and continuous soil water content profile closer to that of an actual water gradient under limited rainfall conditions and contribute to studies on crop responses to different soil water absorption traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acrops 3acultivars 3adrying 3airrigation systems 3aleaf conductance 3aleaves 3arain 3arice 3asand 3asandy soils 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspring wheat 3awater uptake1 aPalta, Jairo A.0 tIrrigation science.g2018 Sept., v. 36, no. 4-5 p.281-288dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl11426x0342-71887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-018-0584-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011000204300001600314520134200330592002801672650001101700650001401711650001401725650001601739650002201755650002001777650001001797650001201807650001401819650001401833650001901847650001501866700001501881700002101896700001601917773011401933856008102047852000902128655001202137IND60597800820221120214222.0180627e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059780082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4159-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChagnon, P.

Network-based analyses can provide mathematical tools to detect non-random patterns of interactions, and potentially help predicting the consequences of such patterns on evolutionary dynamics of symbiotic systems. Here, we characterize the structure of a lichen network at a very fine phylogenetic scale, by identifying the photosynthetic partners (i.e., cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc) of lichenized fungi belonging to a monophyletic section of a single genus (i.e., section Polydactylon of the genus Peltigera), worldwide. Even at such a fine phylogenetic scale, we found that interactions were highly modular and anti-nested, indicating strong preferences in interactions. When considering local Peltigera communities, i.e., datasets at small spatial scales with only a slightly broader phylogenetic range, interactions remained modular but were asymmetric, with generalist Nostoc partners interacting with specialized Peltigera species. This asymmetry was not detected with our global spatial scale dataset. We discuss these results in the light of lichen community assembly, and explore how such interaction patterns may influence coevolution in lichens and the evolutionary stability of the mutualism in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc 3aPeltigera 3aasymmetry 3acoevolution 3acommunity ecology 3adata collection 3afungi 3alichens 3amonophyly 3amutualism 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction1 aMagain, N.1 aMiadlikowska, J.1 aLutzoni, F.0 tOecologia.g2018 July, v. 187, no. 3 p.767-782dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4159-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300001600273500002000289520108600309592002801395650001701423650002001440650001001460650001601470650001401486651001601500651001301516700002001529700001701549700001801566700002401584700002101608773010201629856007301731852000901804655001201813IND60548429020221120172341.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054842902DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.124262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, Gary W.10aMultigene analyses resolve early diverging lineages in the Rhodymeniophycidae (Florideophyceae, Rhodophyta)  ap. 505-522.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMultigene phylogenetic analyses were directed at resolving the earliest divergences in the red algal subclass Rhodymeniophycidae. The inclusion of key taxa (new to science and/or previously lacking molecular data), additional sequence data (SSU, LSU, EF2, rbcL, COI‐5P), and phylogenetic analyses removing the most variable sites (site stripping) have provided resolution for the first time at these deep nodes.

Two homologous SNAREs, SYP121 (=SYR1/PEN1) and SYP122, dominate secretory traffic to the Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane. Although these proteins overlap functionally, differences between SYP121 and SYP122 have surfaced, suggesting that they mark two discrete pathways for vesicular traffic. The SNAREs share primary cognate partners, which has made separating their respective control mechanisms difficult. Here, we show that the regulatory protein SEC11 (=KEULE) binds selectively with SYP121 to affect secretory traffic mediated by this SNARE. SEC11 rescued traffic block by dominant-negative (inhibitory) fragments of both SNAREs, but only in plants expressing the native SYP121. Traffic and its rescue were sensitive to mutations affecting SEC11 interaction with the N terminus of SYP121. Furthermore, the domain of SEC11 that bound the SYP121 N terminus was itself able to block secretory traffic in the wild type and syp122 but not in syp121 mutant Arabidopsis. Thus, SEC11 binds and selectively regulates secretory traffic mediated by SYP121 and is important for recycling of the SNARE and its cognate partners.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aphysiological transport 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3asecretion1 aZhang, Ben1 aWaghmare, Sakharam1 aAderhold, Christin1 aGrefen, Christopher1 aBlatt, Michael R.0 tplant cell.g2015 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.675-694dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.114.1344293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245018000183520207700363592002802440650001502468650001002483650001402493650001202507650001602519650002802535650001402563651001402577651001502591651001002606651001602616651001302632653002702645653001702672653002402689653001802713700006102731700002202792700002302814700006302837700006002900700002402960773009602984856008703080852000903167655001203176IND60737769820221120144633.0220606e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073776982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1082432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDada, Ayokunle Christopher10aMicrobiological hazards associated with food products imported from the Asia-Pacific region based on analysis of the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) notifications  aThe Rapid Alert System for Food and Feeds (RASFF) is a monitoring and notification tool and food safety-related database developed by the European Commission. This study evaluated the microbiological safety of foods originating from the Asia-Pacific region in the past two decades (2000–2020) by analysing incidences and trends of notifications and alerts on the RASFF database. The highest number of notifications were for foods imported from India and Thailand as foods imported from these two countries constituted more than half (54%) of the notifications recorded on the RASFF database for the entire Asia-Pacific region from 2000 to 2020, compared to ANZ (Australia and New Zealand), which had very low notifications (1.2% = 23/1873). Among the 2121 notifications of pathogenic microorganisms, consisting of 14 genera, Salmonella was the most predominant as approximately 7 out of every 10 pathogens isolated from foods imported from the Asia-Pacific Region in the past two decades (74%, 1560/2121) were Salmonella species. More than 95% of pathogen species notifications for fruits and vegetables imported from India and Bangladesh were associated with betel leaves. Among the nuts, nut products and seeds, sesame seeds were the main food item contaminated by Salmonella, and these accounted for 87% of total Salmonella notifications. Across the food categories, there was a statistically significant reduction in the number of notifications associated with seafoods over the years (r = −0.73, p = 0.0001). Although a statistically significant increase in notifications for fruits and vegetables (r = 0.66, p = 0.008) was recorded between 2000 and 2014, more recent years (2015–2020) have been associated with reducing trends in the number of notifications associated with this food type (r = −0.85, p = 0.03). Results indicate that imported foods may be potential vehicles for the transmission of clinically relevant microorganisms. Studies of this nature can potentially encourage countries to implement policies that improve export quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3abetel 3adatabases 3aexports 3afood safety 3amicrobiological quality 3apathogens 3aAustralia 3aBangladesh 3aIndia 3aNew Zealand 3aThailand 0aMicrobiological safety 0aSupply chain 0aFoodborne pathogens 0aFood products1 aSomorin, Yinka M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8437-66941 aAteba, Collins N.1 aOnyeaka, Helen N.,1 aAnyogu, Amarachukwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9652-77281 aKasan, Nor Azman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3041-199X1 aOdeyemi, Olumide A.0 tFood control.g2021 Nov., v. 129 p.108243-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1082433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245010800168300001600276520087700292592002801169650000901197650001001206650001601216650001501232650001601247650001901263650002801282653002401310653004601334653001501380653001401395773010201409856007801511852000901589655001201598IND60615169720221119185952.0181015e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061516972DNAL7 a10.2478/acve-2018-00222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadostina, Simeonov10aQuantitative Morphology as a Prognostic Factor in Feline Spontaneous Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas  ap. 251-256.  aIn a study on cytological specimens from 30 cats with histologically confi rmed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the morphometric variables mean nuclear area (MNA, μm2), mean nuclear perimeter (MNP, μm), mean nuclear diameter (D mean, μm), minimum nuclear diameter (D min, μm) and maximum nuclear diameter (D max, μm) were studied and compared to metastases in regional lymph nodes.

Despite the mustard family (crucifers, Brassicaceae) continuing to be the subject of intensive research, the remaining 16 families are largely under studied. Here I summarize the available data on chromosome number and genome size variation across Brassicales in the context of a robust phylogenetic framework. This analysis has revealed extensive knowledge gaps in karyological data for non-crucifer and species-rich families in particular (i.e., Capparaceae, Cleomaceae, Resedaceae and Tropaeolaceae). A parsimonious interpretation of the combined chromosomal and phylogenetic data set suggests that the ancestral pre-Brassicales genome had 9 or 14 chromosome pairs, later multiplied by the At-β (beta) whole-genome duplication (WGD) to n = 18 or 28. This WGD was followed by post-polyploid diploidization marked by diversification to 12 or 13 families and independent decreases in chromosome numbers. Family-specific WGDs are proposed to precede the diversification of Capparaceae, Resedaceae and Tropaeolaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aCapparaceae 3aCleomaceae 3aResedaceae 3aTropaeolaceae 3achromosome number 3adata collection 3agenome 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2018 June, v. 304, no. 6 p.757-762dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-018-1507-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245007500184300001600259520151200275592002801787650002901815650001801844650002001862650002301882650001201905650002401917650003401941650001701975650001301992650001602005651001002021653001602031653001802047653001702065653001502082653003002097700001702127773013002144856008502274852000902359655001202368IND60574353620221116183454.0170726e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057435362DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2017.13355702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHockin-Grant, Kenneth Julian14aThe effectiveness of a permaculture education project in Butula, Kenya  ap. 432-444.  aIn the 1980s, agricultural development organizations began promoting permaculture, an agroecological approach that emphasizes local autonomy, through training programmes in the developing world. Few assessments have measured the effectiveness of such projects. Here we surveyed and interviewed small-scale farmers to assess the perceived impacts of a Canadian permaculture non-governmental organization’s (NGO) project in Butula, Western Kenya. Two types of projects are evaluated and compared: community projects (CPs) at six primary schools, and an intensive two-week permaculture design certification (PDC) programme. Our results suggest that both PDC and CP participants felt that they had benefited from the projects. However, PDC participants developed a more comprehensive understanding of permaculture, felt empowered and frequently related permaculture to their own traditional cultural values whereas CP participants often misunderstood permaculture, felt frustrated by the limited immediate economic benefits and frequently contrasted permaculture against traditional cultural values. These differences may have occurred because CP participants had fewer opportunities to interact directly with the permaculture teachers, to ask questions, or to clarify points of uncertainty. This study emphasizes the importance of direct, reciprocal communication between NGOs and project participants for fostering feelings of autonomy and competence, thereby strengthening resilient agroecological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3acertification 3acultural values 3aelementary schools 3afarmers 3afinancial economics 3anongovernmental organizations 3apermaculture 3ateachers 3auncertainty 3aKenya 0aAgroecology 0afood security 0apermaculture 0aresilience 0aself-determination theory1 aYasué, Maï0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2017 July 4, v. 15, no. 4 p.432-444dTaylor & Francisx1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2017.13355703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011100176300001600287520110800303592002801411650001901439650002501458650001501483650001801498650001101516650002201527650001101549650001101560650001701571650001001588650001001598650001001608650001401618650001001632653001601642653001501658653000901673653001101682653002101693653001801714653001801732700002001750700002901770700002101799700002401820773010101844856008701945852000902032655001202041IND60593110320221118025832.0190516e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059311032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.03.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoestheden, Matthew10aDetailed characterization of glycosylated sensory-active volatile phenols in smoke-exposed grapes and wine  ap. 147-156.  aThe exposure of Vitis vinifera L. vines to smoke from wildland fires can alter the chemical composition of the berries, such that the resulting wine can possess a defect known as smoke-taint. This work constitutes a complete method for the analysis of simple volatile phenol glycosides (VP-glycosides) that can be elevated in berries and wine following smoke exposure. We synthesized 16 model VP-glycosides, four of which are not reported previously, to facilitate method development. Fragmentation analysis using high-resolution accurate-mass spectrometry demonstrated that the glycone and aglycone influenced the fragmentation pattern of VP-glycosides. Diagnostic fragmentation patterns for the synthesized VP-glycosides were applied to identify several VP-glycosides in smoke-exposed berries and wine. The fragmentation pattern of VP-disaccharides should facilitate the characterization of modified glycones. Putative non-VP glycosides elevated in smoke-exposed berries are demonstrated for the first time. In tandem with VP-glycosides, such compounds may contribute to the expression of smoke taint.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3achemical composition 3aglycosides 3aglycosylation 3agrapes 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aphenol 3asmall fruits 3asmoke 3ataint 3avines 3awildfires 3awines 0aSmoke-taint 0aGlycosides 0aWine 0aGrapes 0aVolatile phenols 0aFragmentation 0aAccurate mass1 aDennis, Eric G.1 aRomero-Montalvo, Eduardo1 aDiLabio, Gino A.1 aZandberg, Wesley F.0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 259 p.147-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.03.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245006700179300001600246500000900262500001500271520162300286592002801909650001901937650002201956650002301978650002402001650002002025650001302045650002402058650001402082650001802096650003902114653001302153700002302166773012002189852000902309856009802318655001202416IND2201761320221120173524.0191122e199905  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220176132DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1999.0011183X003900020016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackay, I.

In a plant breeding program, although these errors may be rare, they could reduce response to selection by an amount disproportionate to their frequency. We used stochastic computer simulations to assess the effect of such errors on response to selection. Combinations of high (1%) and low (0.1%) error rates were simulated, with between 1 and 10 individuals selected from populations of size 100 or 1000. Four different error types were simulated by adjusting the means and variances of the simulated major errors. Major errors caused large reductions in response to selection, especially when present at an error rate of 1% with a population of size 1000. Under such circumstances response to selection may actually increase if selection intensity is reduced. At the 0.1% error rate, and in populations of size 100, the reduction in response to selection was less marked. Data validation methods, in which the most extreme observations were rejected prior to selection, usually reduced response to selection and therefore should not be used routinely. In addition to their effect on selection programs, major errors will also reduce the effciency of bulked segregant analysis. These results confirm that vigilance and careful experimental technique repay their time and effort. Data on the frequency and distribution of major errors are required to achieve a better understanding of their effect and define the best procedure to handle their presence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant breeding 3asimulation models 3aselection response 3aexperimental design 3adata collection 3avalidity 3aselection intensity 3afrequency 3adata analysis 3aagricultural programs and projects 0abreeding1 aCaligari, P.

A total of 30 mature male rabbits were divided into 3 groups (10 rabbits per group). Group 1 received uncoated sutures, group 2 received sodium acetate-coated sutures, and group 3 received PRP-coated sutures. Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, USA), size 4-0 was used in all groups. Five rabbits of each group were euthanized on day 3 following the surgery while the remaining 5 rabbits were euthanized on day 10. Gross evaluation of the anastomotic site in PRP-coated sutures group demonstrated significantly (P < 0.05) lower adhesion formation scores on both days 3 and 10 of the study while in the control groups, evidence of leakage at the anastomotic site was present along with signs of haemorrhage and local inflammation. On day 10 in the control groups, there were strands of strong adhesions between the ileum, colon and cecum with large amount of fibrin deposited at the site of the anastomosis. Tissues of the anastomotic site revealed a significant level of hydroxyproline on day 10 in PRP-coated sutures group compared with control groups. Histopathological evaluation revealed significantly (P < 0.05) less inflammatory infiltration, and more angiogenesis and collagen deposition on day 10 in PRP-coated sutures group compared to the control groups. Results of this study clearly indicate promising healing enhancing effects of using PRP-coated sutures at intestinal anastomotic site with little to no obvious disadvantages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aangiogenesis 3acecum 3acollagen 3acolon 3afibrin 3ahemorrhage 3ahistopathology 3ahydroxyproline 3aileum 3ainflammation 3amales 3arabbits 3asodium 3asurgery 0aBiochemistry 0aZoology 0aDehiscence 0aGrowth factors 0aIntestinal surgery1 aAlardah, Mira M.1 aIsmail, Zuhair Bani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7267-82700 tHeliyon.g2019 Nov., v. 5, no. 11 p.e02713-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e027133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01319naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012300156300001600279520033900295592002800634650001200662650002300674650002300697650002200720650001400742700001500756700001700771700001700788773011600805856007500921852000900996655001201005IND60549869920221122184157.0160909e20120106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054986992DNAL7 a10.1021/jo202281x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Shuting10aAccess to Quinolines through Gold-Catalyzed Intermolecular Cycloaddition of 2-Aminoaryl Carbonyls and Internal Alkynes  ap. 801-807.  aA facile and general method leading to polyfunctionalized quinolines was developed.

Permafrost thaw increases soil nitrogen (N) availability, but it is unclear whether such changes are due solely to changes in surface soil N mineralization or N mobilization from thawing permafrost soils at depth. We examined plant species composition and N availability along triplicate permafrost thaw gradients in Alaskan peatlands. Each gradient comprised four community types including: (i) a permafrost peatland with intact permafrost, (ii) a drunken forest experiencing active thaw, (iii) a moat representing initial complete thaw and (iv) a collapse scar bog representing several decades of post‐thaw succession. Concentrations of dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic N (DIN) in the upper 60 cm of soil increased along the permafrost thaw gradients. The drunken forest had the greatest mean concentrations of total dissolved N relative to the other community types, primarily due to greater concentrations of large molecular DON. The moat and collapse bog had significantly greater inorganic N concentrations than the permafrost or drunken forest, suggesting that changes in N availability are not a short‐term effect, but can be sustained for decades or centuries. Across all plant community types, DIN and DON concentrations increased with soil depth during maximum seasonal ice thaw (September), suggesting that deeper soil horizons are important reservoirs of N post‐thaw. Vegetation responses to permafrost thaw included changes in plant community composition shifting from upland forest species to hydrophilic vegetation with deeper rooting profiles in the collapse scar bogs and changes in foliar N and δ¹⁵N values. N concentrations in plant foliage and litterfall increased with concentrations of DIN during collapse bog succession, suggesting that plants are utilizing additional mineralized N. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the conversion of forest to wetlands associated with permafrost thaw in boreal lowlands increases N availability, at least in part by increasing turnover of deep soil organic matter. Plants appear to utilize these additional deeper N sources over timescales of years to centuries following permafrost thaw.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3amineralization 3apermafrost 3aplant communities 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3abotanical composition 3asoil organic matter 3aconiferous forests 3ahydrophilicity 3apeatlands 3abogs 3asoil depth 3arooting 3asoil horizons 3aice 3alowlands 3astable isotopes 3athawing 3asoil-plant interactions 0anitrogen1 aTuretsky, Merritt R.1 aKielland, Knut1 aRuess, Roger W.1 aMack, Michelle C.1 aEuskirchen, Eugénie S.0 tjournal of ecology.g2016 Nov., v. 104, no. 6 p.1542-1554dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.126393Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011300169300001200282520186700294592002802161596003502189596003902224596004002263596007402303650001002377650001502387650001402402650001302416650001802429650001202447650001702459650001602476650000902492650002302501650001202524650001202536650001402548650001702562700002002579700002602599700001702625700002402642700002502666700002202691700005702713700005502770773014702825856008302972852000903055655001203064IND60779203220221116144305.0220916e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077920322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-022-04326-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitteveen, J. S.10aHGprt deficiency disrupts dopaminergic circuit development in a genetic mouse model of Lesch–Nyhan disease  ap. 341.  aIn Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGprt) leads to a characteristic neurobehavioral phenotype dominated by dystonia, cognitive deficits and incapacitating self-injurious behavior. It has been known for decades that LND is associated with dysfunction of midbrain dopamine neurons, without overt structural brain abnormalities. Emerging post mortem and in vitro evidence supports the hypothesis that the dopaminergic dysfunction in LND is of developmental origin, but specific pathogenic mechanisms have not been revealed. In the current study, HGprt deficiency causes specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities in mice during embryogenesis, particularly affecting proliferation and migration of developing midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. In mutant embryos at E14.5, proliferation was increased, accompanied by a decrease in cell cycle exit and the distribution and orientation of dividing cells suggested a premature deviation from their migratory route. An abnormally structured radial glia-like scaffold supporting this mDA neuronal migration might lie at the basis of these abnormalities. Consequently, these abnormalities were associated with an increase in area occupied by TH⁺ cells and an abnormal mDA subpopulation organization at E18.5. Finally, dopaminergic innervation was disorganized in prefrontal and decreased in HGprt deficient primary motor and somatosensory cortices. These data provide direct in vivo evidence for a neurodevelopmental nature of the brain disorder in LND. Future studies should not only focus the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the reported neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but also on optimal timing of therapeutic interventions to rescue the DA neuron defects, which may also be relevant for other neurodevelopmental disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  aNWA.1160.18.320cNWO - NWA-ORC  a916.12.167cDutch Research Council  aF2014(1)-16cDutch Brain Foundation  aR01 NS119758cNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 3abrain 3acell cycle 3acognition 3adopamine 3aembryogenesis 3aguanine 3ahypoxanthine 3ainnervation 3amice 3amigratory behavior 3amutants 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3atherapeutics1 aLoopstok, S.
