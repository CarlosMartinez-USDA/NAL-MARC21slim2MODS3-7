This is especially true in Australasia, where monophyly of Gekko proper has been questioned with respect to phenotypically ornate flap-legged geckos of the genus Luperosaurus, the Philippine false geckos of the genus Pseudogekko, and even the elaborately “derived” parachute geckos of the genus Ptychozoon. Here we employ sequence capture targeting 5060 ultraconserved elements (UCEs) to infer phylogenomic relationships among 42 representative ingroup gekkonine lizard taxa. We analyze multiple datasets of varying degrees of completeness (10, 50, 75, 95, and 100 percent complete with 4715, 4051, 3376, 2366, and 772 UCEs, respectively) using concatenated maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent methods. Our sampling scheme addresses four persistent systematic questions in this group: (1) Are Luperosaurus and Ptychozoon monophyletic, and are any of these named species truly nested within Gekko? (2) Are prior phylogenetic estimates of Sulawesi’s L. iskandari as the sister taxon to Melanesian G. vittatus supported by our genome-scale dataset? (3) Is the high-elevation L. gulat of Palawan Island correctly placed within Gekko? (4) And, finally, where do the enigmatic taxa P. rhacophorus and L. browni fall in a higher-level gekkonid phylogeny? We resolve these issues; confirm with strong support some previously inferred findings (placement of Ptychozoon taxa within Gekko; the sister taxon relationship between L. iskandari and G. vittatus); resolve the systematic position of unplaced taxa (L. gulat, and L. browni); and transfer L. iskandari, L. gulat, L. browni, and all members of the genus Ptychozoon to the genus Gekko. Our unexpected and novel systematic inference of the placement of Ptychozoon rhacophorus suggests that this species is not grouped with Ptychozoon or even Luperosaurus (as previously expected) but may, in fact, be most closely related to several Indochinese species of Gekko. With our resolved and strongly supported phylogeny, we present a new classification emphasizing the most inclusive, original generic name (Gekko) for these ~60 taxa, arranged into seven subgenera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGekko 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3alizards 3amonophyly 3anesting 3aparaphyly 3apolyphyly 3astatistical analysis 3aAustralasian region 3aIndonesia 3aPhilippines 0aLuperosaurus 0aPtychozoon 0aPhylogenomics 0aSpecies tree 0aSubgenera 0aTaxonomic vandalism 0aUltraconserved elements1 aGuo, Xianguang1 aTravers, Scott L.1 aSu, Yong-Chao1 aOlson, Karen V.1 aBauer, Aaron M.1 aGrismer, L.

The eroded genetic base of the cultivated Cicer gene pool is becoming a significant bottleneck in developing stress-resilient chickpea cultivars. In this scenario, the crop wild relatives (CWR) of chickpea, with the useful genomic wealth of their wild adaptation, give a ray of hope to improve the genetic background of the cultivated Cicer gene pool. To extrapolate these unearthed genomic diversities of wild, we require a thorough understanding of the pre-historic domestication episodes that are changing their shape with the expansion of the available scientific evidence. Keeping aforesaid in view, the current review article provides a glimpsed overview on several efforts done so far to reveal the mysterious origin and evolution of the Cicer gene pool, along with the constraints in their utilization for chickpea crop improvement. It encapsulates various stress-resilient CWR of chickpea and their use in several pre-breeding programs to develop numerous breeding populations for crop genetic enhancement. Further, this review will recapitulate the significant contributions of structural, functional and comparative genomics, pan-genomics and diverse genomics-assisted breeding strategy in dissecting the untapped trait-specific allelic/gene diversity and domestication pattern behind the CWR of chickpea, along with their potential and promises. We expect the newly explored genetic variations may be used in the breeding programs for re-wilding the cultigens’ genomic background to open a new avenue for genetic gain and crop improvement capacity of chickpea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aallelic variation 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3adomestication 3aevolution 3agene pool 3agenetic background 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3amolecular biology1 aJha, Uday Chand1 aDixit, G.

While Van Cleave's original description is adequate to identify N. tenellus, his description of proboscis armature, lemnisci, reproductive system in both sexes, and eggs was either not complete or in error. We studied the original type material and found their present state to be of little use for elucidating characters that were not already illustrated and described by Van Cleave. For that reason we studied newly collected, conspecific specimens to better document key morphological features of this species. Our description of the Michigan material from the same 2 fish species was compared with the original description and with Van Cleave's cotypes (designated syntypes). Our revised description includes the following: (1) trunk of males and females is widest in anterior third tapering gradually at both ends. (2) Lateral anterior hooks are markedly larger than and set more posterior to the other 4 hooks of the same circle. Middle hooks not in perfect circle but alternate. (3) Middle and posterior hooks with discoidal bases. (4) Lemnisci are subequal. (5) Eggs have distinct polar prolongation of fertilization membrane, which places the species in the subgenus Hebesoma Van Cleave, 1928. New observations address sexual dimorphism, the larger size of specimens from S. vitreus than from E. lucius, the apical organ, giant nuclei, sensory pits on the proboscis, and details of the reproductive system in both sexes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNeoechinorhynchus tenellus (Acanthocephala) 0aredescription 0aEsox lucius 0aSander vitreus 0aMichigan 0adistribution1 aMuzzall, Patrick M.0 tComparative parasitology.g2009 Jan., v. 76, no. 1 p.44-50dHelminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4373.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013500172300001600307520179600323592002802119650002102147650001102168650002402179650001802203650002002221650002302241650001402264650001802278650001102296650001402307653001902321653002902340653002502369653003302394653000802427700002602435700002302461700001702484700001502501700001802516700001902534773009802553856008702651852000902738655001202747IND60581717120221119100829.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058171712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTipole, Pralhad10aApplying a magnetic field on liquid line of vapour compression system is a novel technique to increase a performance of the system  ap. 376-382.  aThis paper presents experimental investigations carried out to study the effect of magnetic field on energy savings in vapour compression system. Application of magnetic field to fluid flow breaks the molecule resulting in a decrease in the viscosity of the fluid. This drop in the viscosity reduces the pumping power required by the compressor as well as enhances the heat transfer rates in the condenser and evaporator due to increased mass flow rates. The net impact is improvement in the COP of the system. Considering the number of refrigerator and air conditioning systems sold globally every year any improvement in the COP could considerably save the energy bills as well as the energy requirement. The main benefit of this investigation is improvement in the system performance improvement in Evaporator capacity or drops in compressor power or increased COP at no cost i.e. no additional input energy. Only cost involved is the initial cost of magnets to be procured for applying suitable magnetic field. The present work was focused on first establishing the effect of magnetic field on the performance of the vapour compression system and then investigating the impact of magnetic-field strength on COP. The magnetic field strength was varied by increasing the number of magnet pairs applied to the liquid line (from condenser outlet to entry of expansion valve). The COP was initially measured without application of magnetic field, and then magnetic field applied to liquid refrigerant was increased by increasing the number of the magnetic pair from 1 to 5. The strength of each magnetic pair was 3000gauss. The result obtained showed improvement in COP of the system under investigation. The COP of the system increased up to13.13% for R134a and 21.87% for R600a refrigerant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aheat transfer 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3amass flow 3arefrigerators 3avapors 3aviscosity 0aMagnetic field 0aHydrocarbon refrigerants 0aRefrigeration effect 0aCompressor power consumption 0aCOP1 aKārttikēyan̲, Ā.,1 aBhojwani, Virendra1 aPatil, Abhay1 aOak, Ninad1 aPonatil, Amal1 aNagori, Palash0 tApplied energy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 182 p.376-382dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014900162300001800311520102200329592002801351653001901379653001601398653001401414653001901428653002201447653001101469700001801480700001601498700001601514773016901530856008201699852000901781655001201790IND60517070520221122213246.0190728e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707052DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140005632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicael, J.10aPhylogeography and genetic diversity of Ophidiaster ophidianus (Echinodermata: Asteroidea)—evidence for a recent range expansion in the Azores  ap. 1475-1484.  aThe seastar Ophidiaster ophidianus is a vulnerable and protected species in the Mediterranean Sea but is common on North Atlantic islands such as the Azores and Madeira archipelagos. This work presents new insights into the phylogeography and genetic diversity of O. ophidianus from the Azores, based on 67 sequences of the 16S mitochondrial gene and 46 sequences of the nuclear ATP intron 5 gene. Twenty-six samples from the Mediterranean and seven samples from Madeira were used as out-groups. The results revealed that there is a lack of genetic differentiation between O. ophidianus from the Azores and the out-groups. All, therefore, belong to the same lineage and argue for a fast and recent range expansion of this species into the Azores. Our results also suggest the existence of distinctive periods of strong gene flow followed by periods of either low or non-existent gene flow between the Mediterranean Sea and this archipelago, which could explain the presence of private haplotypes in all studied areas.  aPublisher supplied data 0apurple seastar 0aechinoderms 0aexpansion 0aphylogeography 0agenetic structure 0aAzores1 aRodrigues, P.1 aCosta, A.C.1 aAlves, M.J.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 Nov., v. 94, no. 7 p.1475-1484dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140005633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002400192245006900216300001600285506007600301520141900377536039401796592002802190596007802218596010602296596011102402506003702513650001202550650001202562650001002574650001602584650003302600650001702633651002202650651001002672653002202682653001602704653001702720653001702737653001702754653001602771700001802787700001902805773012202824856008602946852000903032655001203041IND60636174320221207083627.0190722e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063617432DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2019.15828152doi7 aPMC66437772pmcid7 a313916552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReverter-Gil, Oscar10aNew species and new records of bryozoans from Galicia (NW Spain)  ap. 221-251.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough the bryozoological fauna of Galicia (NW Spain) is probably the best known of the whole Iberian Peninsula, and perhaps one of the better known in Europe, new studies continue to provide new knowledge.

Moreover, the range of geographical distribution of some species is expanded: the record of S. divisa is the southernmost to date, while the records of S. mamillata, F. barrosoi and D. saldanhai are the most northerly to date. The presence of other four species in Galician waters is confirmed and we document the permanence and range extension of two species recently introduced into our waters (Tricellaria inopinata and A. galaica). urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:F8D0ABEF-026E-4FC8-A947-6484249519FA  aThe work of Javier Souto was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, project number AP28954-B29).

The data were analysed according to sex, size and season. At total of 1280 stomachs was examined, from specimens ranging from 14 to 110 cm total length (TL), of which 1076 (83.98%) contained food. Thornback ray feed mainly on teleosts, crustaceans and cephalopods, whereas gastropods and polychaetes are occasionally consumed. Significant differences were found between the diets of males and females; however, ontogenetic changes were also detected, with crustaceans constituting the greatest proportion of the diet of smaller rays. Both teleosts and cephalopods increased in importance with growth of the skates. Prey diversity increased with size; large and mobile prey species were more commonly found in the diet of larger skates. Diet composition showed seasonal variations. Quantitative analyses and graphical methods indicate that the thornback ray is a generalist feeder.  aPublisher supplied data 0askates 0aRaja clavata 0adiet 0aGulf of Gabes 0aCentral Mediterranean Sea1 aMarouani, Sondes1 aBradai, Mohamed Nejmeddine1 aBouaïn, Abderrahmen0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 Nov., v. 94, no. 7 p.1509-1516dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140005873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245022100164300001600385520125900401592002801660650002401688650003501712650001301747650001201760650001401772650001301786650000901799650002801808650004501836650001901881650001301900650001901913650001501932650001101947650001401958650001401972650002501986650001502011650003102026650004002057650001202097653001202109653001202121653002402133653001902157653002202176653001902198700002102217700001902238700002502257700002102282773009202303856008502395852000902480655001202489IND60599435220221119182358.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ming10aDevelopment of a non-denaturing 2D gel electrophoresis protocol for screening in vivo uranium-protein targets in Procambarus clarkii with laser ablation ICP MS followed by protein identification by HPLC–Orbitrap MS  ap. 187-195.  aLimited knowledge about in vivo non-covalent uranium (U)-protein complexes is largely due to the lack of appropriate analytical methodology. Here, a method for screening and identifying the molecular targets of U was developed. The approach was based on non-denaturing 1D and 2D gel electrophoresis (ND-PAGE and ND-2D-PAGE (using ND-IEF as first dimension previously described)) in conjunction with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP MS) for the detection of U-containing proteins. The proteins were then identified by µbore HPLC–Orbitrap MS/MS. The method was applied to the analysis of cytosol of hepatopancreas (HP) of a model U-bioaccumulating organism (Procambarus clarkii). The imaging of uranium in 2D gels revealed the presence of 11 U-containing protein spots. Six protein candidates (i.e. ferritin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, cytosolic manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), glutathione S transferase D1 and H3 histone family protein) were then identified by matching with the data base of crustacea Decapoda species (e.g. crayfish). Among them, ferritin was the most important one. This strategy is expected to provide an insight into U toxicology and metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acrayfish 3acytosol 3adatabases 3aferritin 3agels 3aglutathione transferase 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistones 3aimage analysis 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aprotocols 3ascreening 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3auranium 0aUranium 0aProtein 0aGel electrophoresis 0aLaser ablation 0aMass spectrometry 0aIdentification1 aFrelon, Sandrine1 aSimon, Olivier1 aŁobiński, Ryszard,1 aMounicou, Sandra0 tTalanta.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 128 p.187-195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015400173300001600327520132800343592002801671650001401699650001501713650002301728650001701751650001401768650002301782650002301805650001401828653002701842653001601869653001401885653001501899653002201914653002001936700002201956700002201978700001702000773011402017856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60557531320221121025709.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2016.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugihara, Yukitaka10aTransplantation of Cardicola opisthorchis (Trematoda: Aporocotylidae) sporocysts into the intermediate host, Terebella sp.

It is known that the intermediate host of C. opisthorchis is a terebellid polychaete Terebella sp. In order to study the intrapolychaete larval development of C. opisthorchis, we transplanted sporocysts, which contained a large number of cercariae, of C. opisthorchis obtained from Terebella sp. into sporocyst-free Terebella sp., which had been maintained at 20°C. The transplanted sporocysts switched from cercarial to sporocystal production by 17days after transplantation (d.a.t.) and daughter sporocysts were released into the polychaete body cavity at 25d.a.t. Subsequently, the released daughter sporocysts produced daughter sporocysts again. Thereafter, daughter sporocysts that contained cercariae appeared at 38d.a.t. and gradually increased. At 51d.a.t., 136 sporocysts that had multiplied from the original two transplanted sporocysts were observed in the body of one polychaete, and cercariae were released from daughter sporocysts inside the polychaete body cavity. Subsequently the cercariae were found to be released outside the polychaete at 57d.a.t. This is the first successful case of in situ observation of the development of a blood fluke within the intermediate host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardicola 3aPolychaeta 3aThunnus orientalis 3ablood flukes 3acercariae 3aintermediate hosts 3alarval development 3apathogens 0aCardicola opisthorchis 0aBlood fluke 0aSporocyst 0aPolychaete 0aIntermediate host 0aTransplantation1 aYamada, Toshiyuki1 aIwanaga, Shunsuke1 aKanai, Kinya0 tParasitology international.g2017 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.839-842dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2016.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245022600202300001800428500001900446500002000465520148700485592002801972596005502000650001502055650001602070650002302086650001502109650003702124650001902161650001102180650002602191650001902217650003302236650001402269650000702283650002602290650001502316650002702331650001302358650001302371650001002384700002302394700002002417700002102437700002502458700001902483773013402502856007802636852000902714655001202723IND60705323520221118033359.0200803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070532352DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2020000552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidi, Shahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2385-701810aQuantitative determination of trace phenazopyridine in human urine samples by hyphenation of dispersive solid‐phase extraction and liquid‐phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis  ap. 2897-2904.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMagnetic dispersive solid‐phase extraction followed by dispersive liquid−liquid microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was applied for the quantitative analysis of phenazopyridine in urinary samples. Magnetic dispersive solid‐phase extraction was carried out using magnetic graphene oxide nanoparticles modified by poly(thiophene‐pyrrole) copolymer. The eluting solvent of this step was used as the disperser solvent for the dispersive liquid−liquid microextraction procedure. To reach the maximum efficiency of the method, effective parameters including sorbent amount, adsorption time, type and volume of disperser and extraction solvents, pH of the sample solution, and ionic strength as well as desorption time, and approach were optimized, separately. Characterization of the synthesized sorbent was studied by utilizing infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy‐dispersive X‐ray analysis. Calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.5−250 ng/mL (R² = 0.9988) with limits of detection and quantification of 0.1 and 0.5 ng/mL, respectively. Intra‐ and interday precisions (RSD%, n = 3) of the method were in the range of 4.6−5.4% and 4.0−5.5%, respectively, at three different concentration levels. Under the optimal condition, this method was successfully applied for the determination of phenazopyridine in human urine samples. The relative recoveries were obtained in the range of 85.0−89.0%.  aPublisher supplied data  cK.N.

The adsorption studies were performed using batch and fixed-bed reactor. Developed adsorbent, achieved adsorption capacity as high as ~34 mg of dye per gram of bead (condition: pH 6 and 45 °C). These beads were re-used for 7 times (many more runs possible) to remove the color from model dye effluent, without much loss in removal efficiency. Batch studies revealed a multi-layer adsorption governed by Harkins Jura model. Whereas the adsorption kinetics followed fractal like pseudo second order model, controlled by intraparticle diffusion phenomena. The fixed bed studies revealed steeper break through curves during adsorption operation when high dye influent rates and low bed height were used. This behaviour by the fixed bed reactor was best explained by the Thomas mathematical model. Studies further demonstrated that an external and internal mass diffusion become no more rate limiting during these experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCongo red 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acolor 3acrosslinking 3adecolorization 3aenvironmental management 3ahydrogels 3aindustrial effluents 3amathematical models 3apH 0aHydrogel 0aDye sorption 0aIsotherm 0aKinetics 0aFixed bed adsorption study 0aBreakthrough curve1 aSahoo, Kedar1 aMahiya, Lenin1 aOjha, Harsh1 aTrivedi, Harshita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1378-24381 aParmar, Avanish Singh1 aKumar, Manoj0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 281 p.111797-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245014800173520148500321592002801806650001201834650001201846650001901858650002401877650001701901650001701918650001301935650002301948650001801971650001701989650002002006650002202026650001302048650001002061650001402071653001502085653001702100653002502117653001802142653001102160653002302171700002102194700001602215700001702231700006002248700006102308773010202369856008402471852000902555655001202564IND60680494820221120235430.0200128e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2019.1035012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHülsmann, Marietta10aHabitat continuity matters: Ancient woodlands tend to have higher biomass and catching rate of dung beetles, mainly driven by one large species  aAncient woodlands differ from recent woodlands by numerous abiotic and biotic factors, including soil properties. Several animal species are more abundant in ancient than in recent woodlands, but this has been only rarely tested for saprophagous taxa and not at all for dung beetles, which are common in temperate woodlands. Beside habitat continuity, tree age can have also an effect on woodland inhabiting animals, especially on saprophagous taxa. To analyze the effects of both habitat continuity and tree age we studied dung beetles in a continuous north-west German woodland with baited pitfall traps on basis of a factorial design. We compared species diversity (Shannon-Wiener-Index and Pielou's Evenness), catching rates, biomass and community composition of dung beetles. With only 18 recorded species from 20 study plots, dung beetle communities were species-poor and dominated by one large tunnelling species. The main result is that catching rate and biomass of dung beetles were higher in ancient woodlands, which was due to the particularly high catching rate of the most dominant tunnelling species and one dweller species. Tree age alone had a minor impact, but affects significantly one rare species. Diverging habitat quality of ancient and recent woodlands likely explains differences in the communities of dung beetles in woodlands of different habitat continuity. Old trees in recent woodlands could not compensate for habitat continuity of ancient woodlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiomass 3abiotic factors 3acommunity structure 3adetritivores 3adung beetles 3ahabitats 3ainsect communities 3apitfall traps 3arare species 3asoil properties 3aspecies diversity 3atree age 3atrees 3awoodlands 0aAphodiidae 0aScarabaeidae 0aCoprophagous beetles 0aDecomposition 0aForest 0aEcosystem engineer1 aBoutaud, Estève1 aBuse, Jörn1 aFrank, Kevin1 aSchuldt, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8761-00251 aAssmann, Thorsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9203-769X0 tActa oecologica.g2020 Jan., v. 102 p.103501-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2019.1035013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004100151245011900192300001600311520056800327592002800895650001100923650001400934650001900948653002200967653001600989653002201005653001801027653002301045700002301068700001801091700002001109700002401129700002601153773009201179856008501271852000901356655001201365IND60599435420221119182302.0180702e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichałowska-Kaczmarczyk, Anna Maria12aA uniform nonlinearity criterion for rational functions applied to calibration curve and standard addition methods  ap. 307-314.  aRational functions of the Padé type are used for the calibration curve (CCM), and standard addition (SAM) methods purposes.

Unplanned and unsustainable poor urban storm water management strategies will aggravate the impact and frequency of flood occurrence. In this study, impacts of urbanization and climate change on generated flood magnitude are analyzed using the urban hydrological model of Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and Low Impact Development (LID) sustainable land use optimization techniques. Three rainfall distribution patterns (TS1, TS2 and TS3) in combination with rainfall duration periods of 10, 30 and 60 min and a pessimistic climate change scenario of RCP 4.5 compared to RCP 8.5 are used for the analysis purpose for selected infiltration and storage LID techniques (Bio-Retention Cell, Infiltration Trench and Rain Barrel). The study results showed that combined LID techniques have a significant impact on urban flood reduction of up to 75%. This significant amount of flood reduction is greater than the amount of excess flood magnitude which occurred as a result of climate change using the most pessimistic climate change scenario. The study results also confirmed that rainfall patterns have a significant impact on peak discharge for shorter rainfall durations. This study highly recommends using cost effective, easy and environmental adaptive and sustainable LID techniques for urban flood management in addition to existing drainage structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adrainage 3aflood control 3ahydrologic models 3aland use 3arain 3arainfall duration 3astormwater management 3asustainable land management 3aurbanization 3awater 3aEthiopia1 aMelesse, Assefa M.0 tWater.g2021 June 22, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015700163520175800320592002802078650002202106650002002128650001702148650001702165650001402182650001302196650002002209650001302229650001902242650002302261650002602284650002102310650002602331650001402357650001202371700002302383700001902406700001902425700002402444773012102468856007902589852000902668655001202677IND60757929020221116164225.0211125e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792902DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101122972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatzak, Josef 14aThe Influence of Hop Latent Viroid (HLVd) Infection on Gene Expression and Secondary Metabolite Contents in Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) Glandular Trichomes  aViroids are small infectious pathogens, composed of a short single-stranded circular RNA. Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) plants are hosts to four viroids from the family Pospiviroidae. Hop latent viroid (HLVd) is spread worldwide in all hop-growing regions without any visible symptoms on infected hop plants. In this study, we evaluated the influence of HLVd infection on the content and the composition of secondary metabolites in maturated hop cones, together with gene expression analyses of involved biosynthesis and regulation genes for Saaz, Sládek, Premiant and Agnus cultivars. We confirmed that the contents of alpha bitter acids were significantly reduced in the range from 8.8% to 34% by viroid infection. New, we found that viroid infection significantly reduced the contents of xanthohumol in the range from 3.9% to 23.5%. In essential oils of Saaz cultivar, the contents of monoterpenes, terpene epoxides and terpene alcohols were increased, but the contents of sesquiterpenes and terpene ketones were decreased. Secondary metabolites changes were supported by gene expression analyses, except essential oils. Last-step biosynthesis enzyme genes, namely humulone synthase 1 (HS1) and 2 (HS2) for alpha bitter acids and O-methytransferase 1 (OMT1) for xanthohumol, were down-regulated by viroid infection. We found that the expression of ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) RPL5 and the splicing of transcription factor IIIA-7ZF were affected by viroid infection and a disbalance in proteosynthesis can influence transcriptions of biosynthesis and regulatory genes involved in of secondary metabolites biosynthesis. We suppose that RPL5/TFIIIA-7ZF regulatory cascade can be involved in HLVd replication as for other viroids of the family Pospiviroidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHop latent viroid 3aHumulus lupulus 3abiosynthesis 3acircular RNA 3acultivars 3aepoxides 3agene expression 3ahumulone 3amonoterpenoids 3aribosomal proteins 3asecondary metabolites 3asesquiterpenoids 3atranscription factors 3atrichomes 3aviroids1 aHenychová, Alena 1 aKrofta, Karel 1 aSvoboda, Petr 1 aMalířová, Ivana 0 tPlants.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101122973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245015700155520153800312592002801850650001901878650002701897650001501924650002301939650002101962650004301983650002402026650002102050650001002071651001002081700001902091700001402110773012002124856007302244852000902317655001202326IND60744118320221120041240.0210709e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411832DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuo 10aContributions of Vegetation Greening and Climate Change to Evapotranspiration Trend after Large-Scale Vegetation Restoration on the Loess Plateau, China  aSince the early 2000s, the vegetation cover of the Loess Plateau (LP) has increased significantly, which has been fully recorded. However, the effects on relevant eco-hydrological processes are still unclear. Here, we made an investigation on the changes of actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ) during 2000–2018 and connected them with vegetation greening and climate change in the LP, based on the remote sensing data with correlation and attribution analysis. Results identified that the average annual ETₐ on the LP exhibited an obvious increasing trend with the value of 9.11 mm yr⁻¹, and the annual ETₐ trend was dominated by the changes of ETₐ in the third quarter (July, August, and September). The future trend of ETₐ was predicted by the Hurst exponent. Partial correlation analysis indicated that annual ETₐ variations in 87.8% regions of the LP were controlled by vegetation greening. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the relative contributions of potential evapotranspiration (ETₚ), precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to the trend of ETₐ were 5.7%, −26.3%, and 61.4%, separately. Vegetation greening has a close relationship with the Grain for Green (GFG) project and acts as an essential driver for the long-term development trend of water consumption on the LP. In this research, the potential conflicts of water demanding between the natural ecosystem and social-economic system in the LP were highlighted, which were caused by the fast vegetation expansion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aregression analysis 3avegetation cover 3awater 3aChina1 aCui, Chenfeng 1 aDai, Qin 0 tWater.g2021 June 25, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245017800188300001600366520087400382592002801256650001701284650001101301650001001312650001401322650001201336650001001348650001001358650001001368650001001378650001601388650001401404650001501418650001201433650001201445650001101457650003101468650000901499650006001508650003201568650002401600651001501624651001501639700001801654700002001672700002001692773010701712856004801819852000901867655001201876IND50066755220221119173916.0130530e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006675522DNAL7 a233254152pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-012-9653-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLareschi, Marcela10aSpecific association between the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi (Acari: Laelapidae) and birds Premnoplex brunnescens in Costa Rica: possible evidence of a recent host switch  ap. 281-287.  aAndrolaelaps fahrenholzi is a common, cosmopolitan mite constituting a species complex. This mite is found in nests or on mammal hosts and occasionally on birds. The specific host association between A. fahrenholzi-like mites and Premnoplex brunnescens in Costa Rica is reported here. Adults (females and males), deutonymphs and protonymphs were found on 14 P. brunnescens examined (prevalence was 100 %) with mean abundance 42 (2–222). The nest environment plays an important role in the evolution of parasites and could explain the evolutionary path of Laelapinae towards parasitism. We hypothesize that the colonization of P. brunnescens took place in this context quite recently, from sympatrically living rodents. Morphology and ecology of A. fahrenholzi from P. brunnescens may constitute at least a new variation of A. fahrenholzi, and possibly a new species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrolaelaps 3aadults 3abirds 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahosts 3amales 3amites 3anests 3anew species 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3arodents 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMale 2aMitesxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxphysiology. 2aPasseriformesxparasitology 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica1 aLiterak, Ivan1 aCapek, Miroslav1 aSychra, Oldrich0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2013 July, v. 60, no. 3 p.281-287dSpringer-Verlagx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-012-9653-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014100160300001800301520159400319592002801913650002201941650002301963650001901986650001602005650001302021650001302034650001602047650001402063650003702077700002302114700001802137700001602155700001502171700001802186773010502204856007502309852000902384655001202393IND60578021620221119180533.0170811e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057802162DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501720k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jian-Ming10aLocation and Number of Selenium Atoms in Two-Dimensional Conjugated Polymers Affect Their Band-Gap Energies and Photovoltaic Performance  ap. 7070-7080.  aWe synthesized and characterized a series of novel two-dimensional Se-atom-substituted donor (D)−π-acceptor (A) conjugated polymersPBDTTTBO, PBDTTTBS, PBDTTSBO, PBDTSTBO, PBDTTSBS, PBDTSTBS, PBDTSSBO, and PBDTSSBSfeaturing benzodithiophene (BDT) as the donor, thiophene (T) as the π-bridge, and 2,1,3-benzooxadiazole (BO) as the acceptor with different number of Se atoms at different π-conjugated locations, including the π-bridge, side chain, and electron-withdrawing units. We then systematically investigated the effect of different locations and the number of Se atoms in these two-dimensional conjugated polymers on the structural, optical, and electronics such as band-gap energies of the resulting polymers, as determined through quantum-chemical calculations, UV–vis absorption spectra, and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction. We found that through the rational structural modification of the 2-D conjugated Se-substituted polymers the resulting PCEs could vary over 3-fold (from 2.4 to 7.6%), highlighting the importance of careful selection of appropriate chemical structures such as the location of Se atoms when designing efficient D−π-A polymers for use in solar cells. Among these tested BO-containing polymers, PBDTSTBO that has moderate band gaps and good open-circuit voltages (up to 0.86 V) when mixed with PC₇₁BM (1:2, w/w) provided the highest power conversion efficiency (7.6%) in a single-junction polymer solar cell, suggesting that these polymers have potential applicability as donor materials in the bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical structure 3aelectric power 3aelectronics 3apolymers 3aselenium 3asolar cells 3athiophene 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aRaghunath, Putikam1 aLin, Hsi-Kuei1 aLin, Yu-Che1 aLin, M.

The different MWCNT dispersions, presenting positive and negative charges, were used to prepare multilayered hybrid thin films through electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly. The MWCNTs are well dispersed and homogeneously distributed on each layer of chitosan and cellulose nanocrystals of the films. The nanotubes are densely packed in each multilayer, forming a random network. The surface of the LBL film exhibited a uniform and relatively smooth surface with a mean roughness value of ∼5.8±0.4nm. Electrochemical characterization revealed a decrease in two orders of magnitude in the film resistance as the number of bilayers increased from 5 to 20, which is a consequence of an increase in the amount of conductive material (MWCNT). The thin films with up to 20 bilayers exhibited transmittance higher than 90% in the visible range. The results presented in this work demonstrate the viability of the LBL technique for the deposition of active materials using the biopolymer pair chitosan/cellulose nanocrystals. The obtained films can be employed for the design of transparent and biocompatible carbon nanostructured based electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3achitosan 3adispersions 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afilms (materials) 3ananocrystals 3aroughness 3atransmittance 3aviability 0aLayer-by-layer assembly 0aMulti-walled carbon nanotubes 0aChitosan 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aHighly stable dispersions 0aMultilayers films1 aSilva, Glaura Goulart1 aPereira, Fabiano Vargas1 aLavall, Rodrigo Lassarote0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 432 p.214-220dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245011800165300001800283500002000301520204700321592002802368650001702396650001002413650002302423650002202446650001102468650002102479650002002500651001002520651002502530700002202555700002102577700002102598700002302619700002402642700001802666700004002684700001902724773012502743856007402868852000902942655001202951IND60754083420221119170852.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408342DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.142532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiarucci, Alessandro10aSpecies–area relationship and small‐island effect of vascular plant diversity in a young volcanic archipelago  ap. 2919-2931.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: Aeolian islands form an active volcanic archipelago. By using updated vascular plant checklists for islands and islets, we tested four hypotheses: (i) Island species–area relationship (ISAR) of alien species has lower c‐ and higher z‐values than native species, (ii) islands with active volcanoes have lower species richness than expected for native and alien species, (iii) ISAR of native species shows lower c‐ and higher z‐values than ISARs of Mediterranean land bridge archipelagos and (iv) species richness of smaller islets is independent of area. LOCATION: Aeolian Archipelago, Mediterranean Basin. TAXON: Vascular plants, identified and named according to the Flora of Italy (Pignatti et al., 2017–2019). METHODS: Checklists of native and alien plant species were obtained for eight islands and 24 islets. ISARs were fitted by the Arrhenius power function (S=c·Az) and used to test the first two hypotheses. The third hypothesis was tested by comparing ISAR of Aeolian Archipelago to those from other central and eastern Mediterranean archipelagos. The fourth hypothesis was tested by fitting models defining the presence and limit of the small‐island effect. RESULTS: The checklists included 894 species—749 native and 145 alien. ISARs fitted well for native and alien species and resulted in typical values of c and z parameters. The first and second hypotheses were supported by model fitting. The third hypothesis was not confirmed by the comparison of the ISAR of the Aeolian Archipelago with other archipelagos. The small‐island effect predicted by the fourth hypothesis was supported using S versus LogA for both native and alien species, while for native species it was supported also using the log transformation of the Arrhenius model. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We reported a first comprehensive analysis of plant species richness in the unique Aeolian Archipelago, verifying typical ISARs, no peculiarity with respect to land bridge archipelagos and a somewhat unclear signal for the small‐island effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aflora 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3amodels 3aspecies richness 3avascular plants 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aGuarino, Riccardo1 aPasta, Salvatore1 aRosa, Alfonso La1 aLo Cascio, Pietro,1 aMédail, Frédéric1 aPavon, Daniel1 aFernández‐Palacios, José María1 aZannini, Piero0 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 Nov., v. 48, no. 11 p.2919-2931dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.142533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009700156300001800253520152600271592002801797650002301825650002101848650001201869650003301881650003701914650003701951700002201988700001702010700002002027700002002047700002302067700001902090773010502109856007502214852000902289655001202298IND60578021720221119180622.0170811e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057802172DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501803g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSano, Masami10aPathways toward Photoinduced Alignment Switching in Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Films  ap. 7178-7186.  aThe pathways toward linearly polarized light (LPL)-induced alignment switching in a diblock copolymer film composed of liquid crystalline (LC) azobenzene (Az) and amorphous poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) blocks were studied in detail using polarized UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, and polarized optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations. The hierarchical structures of microphase-separated cylinders of PBMA in a smectic LC Az layer matrix were prealigned by LPL and then irradiated by orthogonal LPL, which resulted in alignment switching to the orthogonal direction. In this process, the large prealigned domains were divided into substantially smaller domains at the submicrometer level, and then the structures were realigned in the orthogonal direction in a strongly cooperative manner, most likely through the domain rotation mechanism. The alignment change consisted of three stages: (i) fluctuations in the smectic layer of LC Az side chains in the initial state and breaking up of smaller grains to the submicrometer level before the orientation change (induction period), (ii) actual rotation of the divided domains driven by the photoinduced reorientation of Az mesogens (action period), and (iii) slower fusion and growth of smaller domains in the orthogonally realigned direction (postgrowth period). New aspects of dynamic self-assembly behavior in which different hierarchical structures are involved are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3alight microscopy 3aliquids 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aNakamura, Shiyuko1 aHara, Mitsuo1 aNagano, Shusaku1 aShinohara, Yuya1 aAmemiya, Yoshiyuki1 aSeki, Takahiro0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Oct. 28, v. 47, no. 20 p.7178-7186dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501803g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010700174300001600281520188500297592002802182650002502210650002602235650002102261650002702282650002602309650002202335650002702357650002402384650003102408650002602439650002902465650001202494650001802506650003802524650001402562650002102576650001602597650004802613650002402661650003702685650002002722650001302742650001102755653002002766653001302786653001902799653001802818653002102836653002702857700002502884700002902909700002402938700003202962700002302994700002203017700006203039773010203101856008503203852000903288655001203297IND60603709620221118055020.0180716e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060370962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2018.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovais, Juliana S.10aAntibacterial naphthoquinone derivatives targeting resistant strain Gram-negative bacteria in biofilms  ap. 105-114.  aThe aims of this study were the planning, synthesis and in vitro evaluation of 2-hydroxy-3-phenylsulfanylmethyl-[1,4]-naphthoquinones against Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, searching for potential lead compounds against bacterial biofilm formation.A series of 12 new analogs of 2-hydroxy-3-phenylsulfanylmethyl-[1,4]-naphthoquinones were synthesized by adding a thiol and different substituents to a ο-quinone methide using microwave irradiation. The compounds were tested against Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. simulans ATCC 27851, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 and a hospital Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain), as well as Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 15290, Serratia marcescens ATCC 14756, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352 and Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 23355) strains, using the disk diffusion method. Ten compounds showed activity mainly against Gram-negative strains with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC = 4–64 μg/mL) within the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) levels. The biofilm inhibition data showed compounds, 9e, 9f, 9j and 9k, are anti-biofilm molecules when used in sub-MIC concentrations against P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 strain. Compound (9j) inhibited biofilm formation up to 63.4% with a better profile than ciprofloxacin, which is not able to prevent biofilm formation effectively. The reduction of P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 mature biofilms was also observed for 9e and 9k.The structure modification applied in the series resulted in 12 new naphthoquinones with antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria strains (E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and ATCC 15442). Four compounds decreased P. aeruginosa biofilm formation effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aProteus mirabilis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSerratia marcescens 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiofilm 3aciprofloxacin 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3ahospitals 3ain vitro studies 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amicrowave radiation 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anaphthoquinones 3aplanning 3athiols 0aNaphthoquinones 0aBiofilms 0aAntimicrobials 0aGram-negative 0aEscherichia coli 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa1 aMoreira, Caroline S.1 aSilva, Ana Carolina J.A.1 aLoureiro, Raquel S.1 aSá Figueiredo, Agnes Marie1 aFerreira, Vitor F.1 aCastro, Helena C.1 ada Rocha, David R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7928-86460 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 May, v. 118 p.105-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008200175300001200257520108300269592002801352650001201380650001401392650002001406650002501426650002301451650001201474650001501486650001801501650001701519650001501536650001101551650001901562650001001581650001401591653002001605653003001625653002001655653002301675700002701698700002701725700002301752773010901775856008601884852000901970655001201979IND60542840720221120074522.0190408e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Luis R.M.10aCombined process system for the production of bioethanol from sugarcane straw  ap. 1-7.  aThis work evaluated the conversion of sugarcane straw into a glucose-rich hydrolysate using a combined process system (CPS) which consists of pretreatment, delignification and enzymatic hydrolysis.

The enzymatic hydrolysis of CPS-cellulignins achieved over 60% cellulose conversion. Considering the cellulose content present in the raw sugarcane straw, only 50% was converted into glucose, due to degradation during the CPS and the enzymatic inefficiency in the hydrolysis stage.

Their architecture is reminiscent of drug delivery systems, only that reporter molecules instead of drugs are stored in the voids of a porous host particle. In addition, the pores are closed with macromolecular “caps” through a tailored “gatekeeping” recognition chemistry so that the caps are opened when an analyte has reacted with a “gatekeeper”. The subsequent uncapping leads to a release of a large number of indicator molecules, endowing the system with signal amplification features. Particular benefits of such systems are their modularity and adaptability. With the example of the immunochemical detection of type-I pyrethroids by fluorescent dye-releasing gAID systems, the influence of several tuning modes on the optimisation of such hybrid sensory materials is introduced here. In particular, different mesoporous silica supports (from nano- and microparticles to platelets and short fibres), different functionalisation routes and different loading sequences were assessed. The materials’ performances were evaluated by studying their temporal response behaviour and detection sensitivity, including the tightness of pore closure (through the amount of blank release in the absence of analyte) and the release kinetics. Our results indicate that the better the paratope-accommodating Fab region of the antibody “cap” fits into the host material's pore opening, the better the closing/opening mechanism can be controlled. Because such materials are well-suited for LFAs, performance assessment included a test-strip format besides conventional assays in suspension. In combination with dyes as indicators and smartphones for read-out, simple analytical tests for use by untrained personnel directly at a point-of-need such as an aeroplane cabin can be devised, allowing for sensitivities down to the μg kg⁻¹ range in <5 min with case-required selectivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3achemical species 3achemistry 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3ahuman resources 3aimmunochemistry 3amicroparticles 3amobile telephones 3aporous media 3apyrethrins 3asilica1 aCliment, Estela1 aGawlitza, Kornelia1 aWan, Wei1 aWeller, Michael G.1 aRurack, Knut0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 June 10, v. 8, no. 22 p.4950-4961dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00371a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011900170300001600289520156000305592002801865650002501893650001301918650001501931650002001946650001601966650001101982650001101993650003102004650001502035650001302050700002002063700001902083700002102102700001602123700001902139700001802158700001802176700001102194773011702205856008602322990002302408852000902431655001202440IND60093754620221120092032.0141103e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009375462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2013.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuo, Jing-Jie10aPrediction of enantioselectivity of primary alcohols involved in racemic resolutions using chiral substituent code  ap. 118-123.  aAn empirical rule has been approached to predict enantioselectivity of primary alcohols involved in racemic resolutions by transesterifications, or hydrolyses catalyzed by Pseudomonas cepacia lipase, but the rule is not suitable for the primary alcohols that have an oxygen atom attached to the stereocenter. In order to overcome the shortcoming, herein we suggested a chemoinformatics method to predict enantioselectivity of primary alcohols. The primary alcohols were represented by chiral substituent code that was specially designed for the compounds including a specific chiral center bonded directly with two common substituents. In this case, the position information of four substituents of chiral center was predefined. The code was derived from 21 topological and physicochemical properties of the other two variable substituents. The chiral substituent code was applied to the prediction of enantioselectivity of 86 enantiomeric pairs of primary alcohols, that is, to the prediction of the absolute configuration of major product or minor product. The subset of the chiral substituent code selected by genetic algorithm was fed to random forest to construct prediction model, all 15 pairs of enantiomers in the test set were predicted correctly. The result of out of bag cross-validation of the whole data set reached to 91%, which was better than the result obtained by the empirical rule and also better than the result of our previous research. The results of the investigation of structure-enantioselectivity relationship were satisfactory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aalcohols 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aenantiomers 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3atopology1 aZhang, Qing-You1 aZhao, Tan-Feng1 aZheng, Fang-Fang1 aLi, Jing-Ya1 aZhang, Dan-Dan1 aFeng, Xiu-Lin1 aLong, Hai-Lin1 aXu, Lu0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.118-123dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2013.08.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009200166300001600258520134800274592002801622650004401650650003701694650001301731650001501744650001501759650002801774650002101802650002001823650001801843650001801861650001801879650002201897650001301919650001301932650001901945650001401964650001001978650001901988650001302007650001602020653001002036653003202046653000902078653002802087653001402115653003502129700001602164700001602180700001502196700001602211773012502227856008202352852000902434655001202443IND60599314220221120213355.0180702e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Chaoqun10aCarboxybetaine methacrylate oligomer modified nylon for circulating tumor cells capture  ap. 135-143.  aCirculating tumor cells (CTC) capture is one of the most effective approaches in diagnosis and treatment of cancers in the field of personalized cancer medicine. In our study, zwitterionic carboxybetaine methacrylate (CBMA) oligomers were grafted onto nylon via atomic transfer random polymerization (ATRP) which would serve as a novel material for the development of convenient CTC capture interventional medical devices. The chemical, physical and biological properties of pristine and modified nylon surfaces were assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectra, atomic force microscope, water contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, and plasma recalcification time (PRT) determinations, etc. The results, including the significant decrease of proteins adsorption and platelets adhesion, as well as prolonged PRTs demonstrated the extraordinary biocompatibility and blood compatibility of the modified surface. Furthermore, we showed that upon immobilization of anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecular (anti-EpCAM) antibody onto the CBMA moiety, the modified nylon surface can selectively capture EpCAM positive tumor cells from blood with high efficiency, indicating the potential of the modified nylon in the manufacture of convenient interventional CTC capture medical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aantibodies 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatibility 3ablood platelets 3acell adhesion 3acontact angle 3amanufacturing 3amedical equipment 3amedicine 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anylon 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3azwitterions 0aNylon 0aCarboxybetaine methacrylate 0aATRP 0aCirculating tumor cells 0aCapturing 0aInterventional medical devices1 aWang, Huiyu1 aZhang, Zhuo1 aZhang, Tao1 aLiu, Baorui0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 432 p.135-143dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017200165300001600337520115100353592002801504650002801532650001801560650001201578650001301590650001001603650002301613650002201636650001501658650001201673650001201685650001901697650002201716700001801738700001801756700002001774700001901794773015001813856008201963852000902045655001202054IND60592061120221117080729.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059206112DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590180100532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanova, N.V.10aChanges in Vegetation and Earthworm Populations under Free Grazing European Bison (Bison bonasus) in Broad-Leaved Forests of the Kaluzhskie Zaseki State Nature Reserve  ap. 100-109.  aThis paper studies the impact of a free-ranging bison population on the vegetation and soil fauna in spatially adjacent biotopes (meadow-transition zone-surrounding forest) in the Kaluzhskie Zaseki State Nature Reserve. It is noted that bison maintains meadows in the absence of haymaking. Analysis of phytosociological relevés shows that the forest vegetation has been significantly transformed by bison over 10–15 years, as evident from (1) differences in the ecological-coenotic structure of the vegetation in the different biotopes, (2) a larger ecological-coenotic diversity of communities in the transition zones in comparison with surrounding forests, and (3) an increase in the participation of nitrophilous species in the vegetation. A fairly high earthworm species diversity (a total of seven species in the biotopes) is found; Aporrectodea caliginosa dominates in the earthworm density and biomass. The total earthworm density and biomass became lower in the transition zone than in neighboring forests and meadows, and the differences in earthworm density between the transition zone and the meadows were statistically significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAporrectodea caliginosa 3aBison bonasus 3abiomass 3abiotopes 3abison 3aconservation areas 3adeciduous forests 3aearthworms 3agrazing 3ameadows 3aphytosociology 3aspecies diversity1 aSmirnov, V.E.1 aKhanina, L.G.1 aBobrovsky, M.V.1 aShashkov, M.P.0 tBiology bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences.g2018 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.100-109dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl4237766x1062-35907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623590180100533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04557naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245014000199300001800339500002000357520211900377592002802496596004402524596004202568596004502610596005202655596003802707596002902745596004302774596004302817596004302860596006002903596002602963596005302989596004903042650001303091650001703104650003003121650001703151650002203168650002003190650001403210650001403224650001903238650002703257650001303284650001903297700005703316700001803373700002003391700006003411700006203471700006203533700006403595700006403659773012503723856007403848852000903922655001203931IND60754083620221119171052.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408362DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.142562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZizka, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1680-919210aBio‐Dem, a tool to explore the relationship between biodiversity data availability and socio‐political conditions in time and space  ap. 2715-2726.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Geo‐referenced species occurrence records are a prime example of biodiversity data and a cornerstone of biodiversity research. Yet, their availability depends on non‐biological factors, including the political framework in the region of collection. Here we present Bio‐Dem (www.bio‐dem.surge.sh), an open‐source software to explore the relationship between the availability of species occurrence records and the political framework in countries worldwide and through time. LOCATION: Global. TAXON: Any. METHODS: Bio‐Dem accesses the number of occurrence records available from countries worldwide from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (www.gbif.org) and socio‐political information from these countries from the Varieties of Democracy database (www.v‐dem.net) as well as information on colonial history from the Issue Correlates of War Project. RESULTS: Bio‐Dem is available as a free graphical user interface web application at www.bio‐dem.surge.sh. Through three interactive graphs, Bio‐Dem enables users to explore the relationship between species occurrence records and countries’ regime type, freedom of movement, freedom of association, gross domestic product, education length, political corruption, armed conflict and colonial history. We describe possible links of these specific political indicators with the collection and mobilization of biodiversity data. Illustrative examples and video tutorials explaining the use of Bio‐Dem are available at www.bio‐dem.surge.sh. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Bio‐Dem provides a user‐friendly way to explore the link between socio‐political variables and the availability of species occurrence records in user‐selected taxa and geographic regions, and to generate hypotheses on their connection. We envision Bio‐Dem as a useful tool for teachers communicating the caveats of available biodiversity data, for biodiversity scientists exploring potential spatial and temporal bias in their data, and for social scientists exploring the impact of political systems on scientific data collection and biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  aDFG FZT 118cGerman Research Foundation  cCentre for Collective Action Research  aM13‐ 0559:1cRiksbankens Jubileumsfond  a2013.0166cKnut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation  a724191cEuropean Research Council  cUniversity of Gothenburg  a2019‐05191cSwedish Research Council  a2019‐04739cSwedish Research Council  a2016‐00796cSwedish Research Council  aFFL15‐0196cSwedish Foundation for Strategic Research  cRoyal Botanic Gardens  aPCEFP3_187012cSwiss National Science Foundation  aFN‐1749cSwiss National Science Foundation 3aInternet 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiogeography 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aeducation 3ageoreferencing 3agross domestic product 3apolitics 3auser interface1 aRydén, Oskar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8717-35741 aEdler, Daniel1 aKlein, Johannes1 aPerrigo, Allison1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6565-63051 aSilvestro, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0100-09611 aJagers, Sverker C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5491-88191 aLindberg, Staffan I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0386-73901 aAntonelli, Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1842-92970 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 Nov., v. 48, no. 11 p.2715-2726dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.142563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245018500210300001600395520175300411592002802164650001802192650002502210650001702235650001602252650001902268650001102287650001602298650001802314650001202332650002502344650001402369650002402383650001902407650002902426650002502455653002402480653002202504653002702526653002702553653001802580653001502598700002002613700001602633773011702649856008602766852000902852655001202861IND60603788220221122134818.0190705e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060378822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCittan, Mustafa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0377-565610aEvaluation of antioxidant capacities and phenolic profiles in Tilia cordata fruit extracts: A comparative study to determine the efficiency of traditional hot water infusion method  ap. 553-558.  aHerbal infusions are a common practice among people. Making a hot water infusion is the simplest way to extract the medicinal properties of a plant. One of the most frequently used plants for this purpose is linden. Antioxidants (especially phenolic compounds) may also enhance the immune system and reduce the risk of cancer and infections such as colds, a frequent medicinal use for this species. In this work, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) method and infusion extraction (IE) technique using only water as the extractant were carried out comparatively for the extraction of phenolic compounds from Tilia cordata fruits to evaluate the efficiency of the hot water infusion technique. Both extracts obtained with IE and UAE techniques were initially screened for their total phenolic contents (TPCs) and total antioxidant capacities (TACs) via Folin-Ciocalteu and CUPRAC methods, respectively. TPCs of the extracts obtained with IE and UAE were found as 58.86 ± 21.51 and 111.84 ± 13.99 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry sample, respectively. Furthermore, TACs of the extracts obtained with IE and UAE were calculated as 82.99 ± 13.13 and 197.52 ± 12.69 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g dry sample, respectively. Subsequently, 31 phenolic compounds in the same extracts were scanned by liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method. Among phenolics, 24 compounds were quantitatively determined with protocatechuic acid as the dominant one (1723.1–2183.5 μg/g dry sample). Consequently, the traditional hot water infusion which can be easily applied at home was considered to be a comparatively effective method for the extraction of phenolic compounds from Tilia cordata fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTilia cordata 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acommon cold 3afruit extracts 3afruits 3agallic acid 3aimmune system 3aliquids 3amedicinal properties 3aneoplasms 3aprotocatechuic acid 3arisk reduction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultrasonic treatment 0aTilia cordata fruit 0aPhenolic contents 0aAntioxidant capacities 0aFolin-Ciocalteu method 0aCUPRAC method 0aLC–MS/MS1 aAltuntaş, Esra1 aCelik, Ali,0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 122 p.553-558dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245016000205300001400365520149800379592002801877650001201905650002701917650002101944650002501965650001401990650001902004650002402023650001502047650001702062650001202079650001302091650002002104650001102124650004402135651001302179653002002192653002302212653002402235653001902259653002502278700001602303700001802319700002602337700001702363700001902380700001702399773010202416856008602518852000902604655001202613IND60603709820221118054811.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060370982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2018.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, H.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7190-757X10aHistopathology and culturable bacteria associated with “big belly” and “skin nodule” syndromes in ornamental Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens  ap. 46-52.  aThe Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) is one of the popular aquarium ornamental fish in the global trade. Large numbers of ornamental fish farmed in central Thailand suffered from two common syndromes; preliminarily named skin nodule syndrome (SNS) and big belly syndrome (BBS): they showed noticeable clinical signs of abnormal appearances resulting in depressed saleability. Since very few specifics are known about causative agents of these syndromes, this study aimed at investigating histopathological features and culturable bacteria associated with these fish infected in the process of farming. Histopathologically, SNS fish consistently exhibited necrosis and severe melanization in the muscles and multiple internal organs. Whereas BBS fish exhibited either typical granulomas or tissue damage associated with acid-fast stained bacteria and Gram negative bacteria, respectively. Six different Gram negative bacterial species were recovered from BBS fish while 23 bacterial species belonging to 14 genera were recovered from fish suffering from SNS. Most of the culturable bacteria are new to betta fish and some of them are known to be marine bacteria, suggesting possible entry route via a contaminated live feed, commercial Artemia shrimp. The true causative agents of these syndromes remain unclear. However, histopathological changes and existence of a wide range of bacteria associated with the naturally diseased fish suggest involvement of multiple bacterial infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaquatic bacteria 3abacterial infections 3agranuloma 3ahistopathology 3ainternational trade 3alive feeds 3amelanization 3amuscles 3anecrosis 3aornamental fish 3ashrimp 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aThailand 0aBetta splendens 0aBig belly syndrome 0aCulturable bacteria 0aHistopathology 0aSkin nodule syndrome1 aSenapin, S.1 aPhiwsaiya, K.1 aTechatanakitarnan, C.1 aDokladda, K.1 aRuenwongsa, P.1 aPanijpan, B.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 Sept., v. 122 p.46-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245015300196300001800349500002000367520147800387592002801865596004101893650001501934650001101949650001701960650003001977650001502007650001202022650001402034650001302048650001302061651001402074651001202088700006002100773012502160856007402285852000902359655001202368IND60754083720221119171058.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408372DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.142342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Jason R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5214-620X10aColonizing the Caribbean: New geological data and an updated land‐vertebrate colonization record challenge the GAARlandia land‐bridge hypothesis  ap. 2699-2707.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOver the past three decades, the hypothesized mid‐Cenozoic GAARlandia walkway (34 ± 1 Ma) has featured prominently in discussions on Caribbean biogeography. However, a fundamental issue has been a lack of geological and geophysical data from the Aves Ridge with which to evaluate the proposal. Consequently, opinions have been based purely on biological data, mainly from molecular‐clock studies but also from fossils and taxonomic composition. For whatever reasons, a polarization of views has occurred; some champion the land‐bridge to explain the colonizations of the island group, whereas others prefer over‐water dispersal. We examine the hypothesis drawing upon an updated compilation of land‐vertebrate colonizations (35 clades: 6 amphibian, 6 mammal and 23 reptile) plus a newly published geological study of the Aves Ridge and the adjacent Grenada Basin (to the east). The former indicates that the colonizations were heavily filtered and assembled in a piecemeal fashion consistent with over‐water dispersal; a mid‐Cenozoic ecological corridor would likely have led to a richer assemblage with a wider variety of components. The latter, which draws upon drill‐core and seismic data, indicates that the southern and central Aves Ridge was submerged at the aforesaid time. With the GAARlandia hypothesis geologically falsified, many biogeographical scenarios that have been proposed for the Greater Antillean biota now require re‐evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data  a1932765cNational Science Foundation 3aamphibians 3abasins 3abiogeography 3ageographical distribution 3ageophysics 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3areptiles 3ataxonomy 3aCaribbean 3aGrenada1 aHedges, S.

The effect of moisture and specific surface of lignin sample, temperature (50, 80, 100, 150°C), reaction time and the use of a catalyst have been studied using analytical techniques such as FT-IR, quantitative 31P NMR and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).The reaction appeared to be more efficient when a dried organosolv lignin was used (97% Dry Matter) and with a specific surface of 0.645m2/g. The highest degree of substitution of acetylated samples was obtained after 1h of reaction at a temperature of 100°C (180bar) and in the presence of pyridine as a catalyst.When compared with conventionally acetylated lignin (using a solvent medium), it appeared that supercritical conditions allowed a higher yield of acetylation and a decrease of the glass transition temperature of the lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetic anhydride 3aacetylation 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aesterification 3aglass transition temperature 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apyridines 3asolvents 0aOrganosolv lignin 0aAcetylation 0aSupercritical CO2 0aQuantitative 31P NMR 0aDifferential Scanning Calorimetry1 aCamy, Séverine1 aBenjelloun-Mlayah, Bouchra1 aCondoret, Jean-Stephane1 aDelmas, Michel0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 July, v. 58 p.287-297dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245010700208506007600315520143400391592002801825506003701853650001401890650002001904650001001924650003401934650001201968650002101980650001102001650002302012650002202035650001502057650001102072650002002083650001302103650001902116650004402135650002202179650001702201650001402218650001502232651001102247651001502258700002502273700002502298700002502323700002402348700002702372700003102399700002902430700002702459700001902486773012502505856007702630852000902707655001202716IND60660455320221207092823.0190823e20190810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066045532DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80803002doi7 aPMC67205452pmcid7 a314051932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Sabrina  S.10aChemistry and Pharmacology of the Kazakh <i>Crataegus Almaatensis</i> Pojark: An Asian Herbal Medicine  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrataegus almaatensis, an endemic ornamental plant in Kazakhstan is used in popular medicine due to its cardiotonic properties. The most studied species of the same genus are commonly found in Europe, which shows the importance of having the Kazakh species validated via its chemical and pharmacological studies. High-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) operated under optimized conditions enabled an isolation of the three main compounds from the aqueous phase of the leaves ethanol extract, further identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside (quercitrin) (4.02% of the crude extract-CECa); quercetin 3-O-&beta;-galactoside (hyperoside) (1.82% of CECa); kaempferol 3-O-&alpha;-L-rhamnoside (afzelin) (0.94% of CECa). The CECa, the aqueous phase of the crude extract (APCa) together with the isolates were evaluated for their vascular (vascular reactivity in human internal mammary artery-HIMA), anti-nociceptive (formalin-induced liking response and hot plate) and anti-inflammatory (subcutaneous air-pouch model-SAP) activities. CECa at the concentrations of 0.014 and 0.14 mg/mL significantly increased the maximum contractility response of HIMA to noradrenaline. The APCa CR curve (0.007&ndash;0.7 mg/mL) showed an intrinsic relaxation effect of the HIMA. APCa at the dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. significantly decreased the total leukocyte count and the IL-1&beta; release in the SAP wash.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrataegus 3aair pouch model 3acecum 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aethanol 3aherbal medicines 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3ainterleukin-1beta 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3aleukocyte count 3amedicine 3anorepinephrine 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aornamental plants 3apharmacology 3aquercetin 3aquercitrin 3aEurope 3aKazakhstan1 aBekbolatova, Elmira 1 aCotrim, Maria  Dulce1 aSakipova, Zuriyadda 1 aIbragimova, Liliya 1 aKukula-Koch, Wirginia 1 aGiorno, Thais  B.

However, empirical evidence to test predictions of the centre–periphery hypothesis (CPH) at contracting range limits is scarce. To address this issue, we assessed spatial patterns of genetic variation, effective population size, and contemporary and historical gene flow in a widespread, Tertiary relict tree species from subtropical China. LOCATION: Warm‐temperate deciduous forests of subtropical China. TAXON: Emmenopterys henryi (Rubiaceae) METHODS: We applied kernel density estimation to determine the centre of the species’ geographical range. Using microsatellite markers, we assessed genetic structure and diversity in 36 populations (503 individuals) sampled in the centre and periphery across the species’ range. We further examined both historical and contemporary gene flow. Finally, we applied coalescent methods to simulate population demography. RESULTS: In support of CPH predictions, the highest density of E. henryi coincided with the geographical centre of the species’ distribution range, and genetic diversity significantly declined with distance from this range centre. Historical migration from the core to the edge was significantly higher than in the opposite direction, whereas contemporary migration followed an opposite pattern. Central and peripheral populations had similar levels of genetic differentiation. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Core‐to‐edge patterns of genetic diversity, but not genetic differentiation, were consistent with the CPH in E. henryi. Also in line with the CPH, historical (but not contemporary) migration from the core to the edge was significantly higher than in the opposite direction. Results suggest that the complex topography in subtropical China and population demographic processes may strongly influence whether CPH predictions are met in different population genetic parameters.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFA0605104cState Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China  a31872652cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31570214cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31561143015cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aRubiaceae 3abiogeography 3ademography 3aeffective population size 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3astatistical analysis 3atopography 3atrees 3aChina1 aComes, Hans P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2659-80691 aFeng, Yu1 aZhang, Yong‐Hua1 aQiu, Ying‐Xiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4982-49970 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 Nov., v. 48, no. 11 p.2853-2864dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.142443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007900169300001400248520128200262592002801544650001401572650002401586651001001610700002001620700002401640773010901664856004801773852000901821655001201830IND50061892920221118072249.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006189292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-012-9810-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarangthem, Neeta10aCollection and evaluation of Hedychium species of Manipur, Northeast India  ap. 13-21.  aNE India is considered as one of the centre of diversity of gingers having a total account of 24 species out of the 65 valid species found in the world. Manipur is one of the seven states of NE India with a mere area of 0.7% out of the total area of India. This paper focuses on the distribution, classification and evaluation of Hedychium species collected from Manipur. A total of 11 species were collected, identified and classified based on their morphological characteristics. The species are identified as Hedychium rubrum A.S. Rao et Verma, H. coronarium Koenig, H. chrysoleucum Hook., H. coccineum Buch.-Ham., H. thrysiforme Ker-Gawl., H. flavescens Carey ex Roscoe, H. stenopetalum Lodd., H. urophyllum Lodd., H. marginatum Clarke, H. villosum Wall. and H. elatum R. Brown. Evaluation of its botanical characteristics are also conducted. Analytical hierarchy process method is used in this paper to address the possibility of analysing the potential of these diverse Hedychium resources based on their ornamental, adaptability and utilisation potential which was evaluated on 12 indicator points. H. elatum scored the highest overall index making it the most potential species for sustainable exploitation followed by H. coronarium while H. villosum ranked the lowest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHedychium 3acenter of diversity 3aIndia1 aTalukdar, N.

In this work, three natural flavonoids (baicalin, quercetin, and rutin) were used to simultaneously impart antioxidant and antibacterial functions to polyamide fiber using an adsorption technology. The relations of the chemical structures of flavonoids with their adsorption capability, adsorption mechanisms, and antioxidant and antibacterial activities were discussed. The Langmuir&ndash;Nernst adsorption model fitted the adsorption isotherms of the three flavonoids well. The adsorption kinetics of the three flavonoids conformed to the pseudo second-order kinetic model. Quercetin exhibited the highest affinity and adsorption capability, and imparted the highest antioxidant and antibacterial activities to polyamide fiber; and moreover, its antioxidant and antibacterial functions had good washing durability. This study demonstrates that the treatment using natural flavonoids is an effective way to exhance the health care functions of polyamide fiber.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abaicalin 3achemical structure 3adurability 3afabrics 3ahealth services 3akinetics 3amodels 3apolyamides 3aquercetin 3arutin 3asorption isotherms1 aGuan, Jin-Ping 1 aTang, Ren-Cheng 1 aQiao, Yi-Fan 0 tAntioxidants.g2019 Aug. 12, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80803013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03896naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245009800208300001800306500002000324520209100344592002802435596007102463596009402534650001702628650001502645650001702660650001502677650001202692650001802704650001502722650001702737650001202754650001302766650001202779650003002791650001502821650001002836650001502846650001302861650002102874650001702895650001102912650001402923650001402937650001402951651001302965700002602978700005803004700002503062700002303087773012503110856007403235852000903309655001203318IND60754083920221119171136.0211023e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408392DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.142552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeleye, Matthew Adesanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6034-580710aEnvironmental change during the last glacial on an ancient land bridge of southeast Australia  ap. 2946-2960.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remains an enigmatic period in southeast Australia due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of its palaeoclimatic records. A major feature of the LGM landscape was the existence of the Bassian Land Bridge, joining Tasmania with the mainland of Australia during periods of low sea level, and potentially facilitating increased biotic movement between these regions. To better understand biogeographical changes on the land bridge and in southeast Australia generally during the LGM, we present a 35 ka‐year palaeoecological record from one of the larger islands of Bass Strait. LOCATION: Bass Strait, southeast Australia. TAXON: Eucalyptus, Poaceae, Monotoca, Myriophyllum, Zygnemataceae, Botryococcus, Pediastrum. METHODS: Pollen, charcoal, and non‐pollen palynomorphs were analysed in a 1.75‐m sediment core from truwana/Cape Barren Island, Bass Strait, to reconstruct changes in vegetation, fire regimes and lake levels on the Bassian Land Bridge. Results were then compared to existing palaeoenvironmental studies in the region to develop a broader context of the prevailing land bridge environment and the potential influence on biotic dispersals in Australia during the last glacial period. RESULTS: Results suggest a major vegetation shift on the Bassian Land Bridge in response to the establishment of the LGM climate, with grassland expansion at the expense of woodland from ~29–11 ka. Floristic richness, biomass burned and lake levels also markedly decreased through this period, with the driest interval being ~25–18 ka. Dryland herbaceous taxa dispersed between the mainland and Tasmania when the landbridge was fully exposed. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with previous studies, our results show that the dry grassland that dominated southeast Australia (and Southern Hemisphere mid‐latitude areas) during the LGM also extended across the Bassian Land Bridge. The prevailing environment on the land bridge is likely to have exerted a selective influence on biotic dispersals in Australia during glacial periods.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Government Research Training Program scholarship awards  cAustralian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage 3aBotryococcus 3aEucalyptus 3aMyriophyllum 3aPediastrum 3aPoaceae 3aZygnemataceae 3aarid lands 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3ageographical distribution 3agrasslands 3alakes 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3asea level 3asediments 3awoodlands 3aTasmania1 aHaberle, Simon Graeme1 aMcWethy, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3879-48651 aConnor, Simon Edward1 aStevenson, Janelle0 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 Nov., v. 48, no. 11 p.2946-2960dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.142553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010900169300001400278520126400292592002801556650002501584650002501609650001701634650001401651650001401665650002401679650002701703650000901730650001401739650002401753650001301777650001601790653001401806653002401820653001601844653002101860653002501881700001901906773011501925856008602040852000902126655001202135IND60603788520221122134907.0190620e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060378852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Dipesh10aTinospora cordifolia stem extract as an antioxidant additive for enhanced stability of Karanja biodiesel  ap. 10-16.  aOxidative stability of biodiesel is an important fuel quality parameter that not only affects the composition of the fuel but also affects the performance of the engine and tailpipe emissions. The fatty acid profiling of Karanja oil used in this study revealed the presence of ≈69% unsaturated components and the Karanja biodiesel (2.49 h) failed to meet the ASTM D6751 (3 h) and EN 14214 (6 h) specification for oxidation induction period. The utility of T. cordifolia stem extract as an antioxidant additive for Karanja biodiesel has been investigated in this work. The extraction experiments were optimised in terms of solvent composition, extraction time and extraction temperature using response surface based Box-Behnken designing approach. Characterisation of the stem extract revealed high total phenolic content with excellent radical scavenging activity. The extract was reasonably soluble in biodiesel, and it was able to extend the oxidation induction period of biodiesel. The ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications were met at a loading of 100 and 600 ppm respectively. The findings of the study indicate that the T. cordifolia stem extract can serve as a cheap, environment-friendly and non-toxic alternative of synthetic antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTinospora cordifolia 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiodiesel 3aemissions 3aexperimental design 3afatty acid composition 3aoils 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aBiodiesel 0aOxidative stability 0aAntioxidant 0aPlant polyphenol 0aTinospora cordifolia1 aSingh, Bhaskar0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 123 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.06.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011800171300001400289520118900303592002801492650000901520650001701529650002001546650002001566650001801586650003101604650001601635700001801651700001801669773011501687856008601802990002301888852000901911655001201920IND60093755120221120051749.0141103e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009375512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemolab.2013.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mingjin10aKey wavelengths selection from near infrared spectra using Monte Carlo sampling–recursive partial least squares  ap. 17-24.  aVariable selection is a critical step in data analysis for near infrared spectroscopy. Recently, many studies have been reported on variable selection and researchers have proposed a large number of methods to identify variables (wavelengths) that contribute useful information. In the present study, a key wavelengths selection method named Monte Carlo sampling–recursive partial least squares (MCS-RPLS) is proposed. The method mainly includes three steps: (1) Monte Carlo sampling; (2) feature selection for each subset; and (3) determination of the optimum feature set for the dataset. The method has been used for feature selection and multivariate calibration on four near infrared spectroscopic datasets: corn moisture, corn protein, HSA and γ-globulin of biological samples. And the 10-fold cross validation results are compared with those obtained by full spectra-PLS, Moving Window Partial Least Squares (MWPLS), Monte Carlo-based Uninformative Variable Elimination (MC-UVE) and CARS. The results showed that the data dimensionalities and the RMSECV values of the selected variables are greatly reduced, thus the MCS-RPLS is available for feature selection from NIR data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acorn protein 3adata collection 3agamma-globulins 3aleast squares 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3awavelengths1 aZhang, Shizhi1 aIqbal, Jibran0 tChemometrics and intelligent laboratory systems.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 128 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.x0169-74397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2013.07.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04192naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001300289520217000302592002802472650001302500650003302513650001202546650002302558650001202581650001102593650001502604650002202619650001402641650001402655650001402669650002402683650002202707650002102729650001902750650001902769650001602788650001102804650001502815650001902830700002202849700001702871700001902888700001702907700002202924700001702946700001902963700001802982700002103000700002003021700001703041700002003058700001803078700002103096700001803117700001903135700001703154700001703171700001803188700002103206700002003227773014303247856008303390852000903473655001203482IND60648540920221118183158.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Hannah10aP155 Community-Based Nutrition Education Intervention Increases Likelihood of Cancer Preventative Lifestyle Behaviors  ap. S102.  aCancer mortality rates are decreasing; however, this decline is slower in rural areas. Fortunately, one third of common cancers are preventable through nutrition, physical activity, and weight management. Through education, individuals may be motivated to change behaviors to decrease cancer risk.To determine the effect of the Cooking for a Lifetime Cancer Prevention Cooking School (C4L) intervention on immediate and sustained changes in intentions to follow cancer preventative lifestyle guidelines.This quasi-experimental study utilizes pre- and post-C4L measures and follow-up measures compared to a non-equivalent control. This rural, community-based educational intervention includes nutrition and physical activity for cancer prevention presentations and cooking demonstrations. Follow-up events were held 12.1 + 4.9 weeks post-C4L and included C4L participants and non-participants. C4L participants (n = 1,241) were approximately 54.7 + 18.3 y, 84% female, 40% black, and 10% Hispanic. Follow-up participants (n = 887) were approximately 53.9 + 18.5y, 83% female, 42% black, and 9% Hispanic.Participants reported behavioral intentions before and after C4L and at follow-up using a researcher-designed questionnaire including Likert-type scales (1 = not at all likely to 5 = extremely likely). T-tests evaluated within and between-group differences.From pre- to post-C4L, likelihood to achieve and maintain a healthy weight, be physically active, limit alcohol, eat a plant-based diet, and limit red and processed meats increased (all P < .05). At follow-up, participants remained more likely to follow these guidelines than before C4L (P < .05). Compared to non-participants at follow-up (n = 380), participants were more likely to intend to eat fruits and vegetables (P < .05).C4L resulted in immediate and sustained positive changes in intention to implement cancer preventative lifestyle behaviors, despite being a one-time program. Furthermore, participants were more likely to intend to eat fruits and vegetables than non-participants after 12 weeks. C4L may contribute to cancer prevention in rural communities.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acommunity nutrition programs 3acooking 3adisease prevention 3afemales 3afruits 3aguidelines 3aideal body weight 3alifestyle 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3anutrition education 3aphysical activity 3aplant-based diet 3aprocessed meat 3aquestionnaires 3arural areas 3at-test 3avegetables 3aweight control1 aChatterjee, Swarn1 aKoonce, Joan1 aTurner, Pamela1 aBurton, Dawn1 aCampbell, Christa1 aCentner, Ann1 aCollins, Becky1 aDavis, Sylvia1 aHolland, Kathryn1 aHubbard, Rachel1 aBerg, Alison1 aAguirre, Monica1 aBeltran, Ines1 aCook, Georgeanne1 aDekle, Marnie1 aEnglish, Betty1 aFaulk, Kisha1 aHayes, Carla1 aSanders, Mary1 aShelton, Kashara1 aStewart, Rachel0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S102-S102dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245003600159300001600195500002000211520097900231592002801210650002301238650002401261650001401285650001901299650002001318650002301338651001501361773013201376856007401508852000901582655001201591IND60675774720221118044159.0191108e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067577472DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.122922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHind, Nicholas10a917. corethrogyne filaginifolia  ap. 226-247.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCorethrogyne filaginifolia (Hook. & Arn.)

The search for new anti-infection agents from natural resources, with different mode of actions and competitive effects became a necessity. In this study, twenty height methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were investigated for their biofilm formation ability. Subsequently, the antibiofilm effects of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil and its main component 1,8-cineole, against MRSA, as well as their antiquorum sensing potential, were evaluated. Our results displayed the potent efficacy of both E. globulus essential oil and 1,8-cineole against the development of biofilms formed by the methicillin-resistant strains. Additionally, E. globulus essential oil showed more potent of anti-QS activity, even at a low concentration, when compared to 1,8-cineole. All these property of tested agents may pave the way to prevent the development of biofilm formation by MRSA and subsequently the spreading of nosocomial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiofilm 3acineole 3across infection 3aessential oils 3amechanism of action 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3anatural resources 3apublic health 0aMRSA 0aBiofilm 0aEucalyptus globulus 0a1,8-Cineole 0aAntibacterial 0aAntiquorum sensing1 aNoumi, Emira1 aHadded, Ons1 aDridi, Neyla1 aPanwar, Harsh1 aCeylan, Özgür,1 aMastouri, Maha1 aSnoussi, Mejdi0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 May, v. 118 p.74-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009500159300001800254520077000272592002801042650001401070650002601084650001701110650001201127650001901139700001901158700002001177700002101197700002101218773010501239856007501344852000901419655001201428IND60578022420221119174817.0170811e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057802242DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501232n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUemura, Takashi10aControlled Cyclopolymerization of Difunctional Vinyl Monomers in Coordination Nanochannels  ap. 7321-7326.  aRadical cyclopolymerization of difunctional monomers based on 1,6-diene components was performed in one-dimensional channels of porous coordination polymers (PCPs). Although bulk or solution polymerization of the monomers usually gives cross-linked insoluble polymers, the unfavorable interpolymer reactions were effectively suppressed in the narrow nanochannels of PCPs to provide soluble linear polymers. The pore matrices and functionality of PCPs can be readily designed by changing the organic ligands, so that polymerization of the diene monomers in different sized pores was examined. The primary structures of the resulting polymers, such as branching, cyclic structure, and stereoregularity, were changed, depending on the pore characteristics of the PCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranching 3acoordination polymers 3acrosslinking 3aligands 3apolymerization1 aNakanishi, Ryo1 aKaseda, Tetsuya1 aUchida, Noriyuki1 aKitagawa, Susumu0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 11, v. 47, no. 21 p.7321-7326dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501232n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010600160300001400266520069300280592002800973650001301001650001401014650004401028650001401072653002401086653001301110653002301123653003101146653002301177700001901200700001701219700001701236700001601253700001201269700005801281773012301339856008201462852000901544655001201553IND60599314920221120213409.0180702e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aDecorating titanate nanotubes with protonated 1,2,4-triazole moieties for anhydrous proton conduction  ap. 26-30.  aAnhydrous proton conducting materials based on surface attachment of protonated 1,2,4-triazole moieties on titanate nanotubes are prepared through self-assembly technique. ¹H MAS NMR spectra have revealed that the triazole moieties located at the outer surface of nanotubes.

To this end, the amino functionalized cuprous oxide @ ceric dioxide (Cu2O@CeO2-NH2) core-shell nanocomposites were prepared to bond gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) by constructing stable Au-N bond between Au NPs and -NH2. Because the synergetic effect presents in Cu2O@CeO2 core-shell loaded with Au NPs (Cu2O@CeO2-Au), it shows better electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) than single Cu2O, Au NPs and Cu2O@CeO2. Featured by large specific surface area, good biocompatibility and good electrochemical properties which can greatly improve the electronic transmission rate, Cu2O@CeO2-Au was used as transducing materials to achieve efficiently capture antibodies and triple signal amplification of the proposed immunosensor. Under the optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range from 0.1pg/mL to 100ng/mL with a low detection limit of 0.03pg/mL (S/N=3). Furthermore, the proposed label-free immunosensor has been used to determine PSA in human serum with satisfactory results. Meanwhile, it displayed good reproducibility, acceptable selectivity, and long-term stability, which had promising application in bioassay analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abioassays 3abiocompatibility 3ablood serum 3acuprous oxide 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunosensors 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3asurface area 3asynergism 0aLabel-free immunosensor 0aProstate specific antigen 0aCu2O@CeO2 core-shell 0aGold nanoparticles1 aLi, Yueyun1 aFeng, Jinhui1 aDong, Yunhui1 aWang, Ping1 aChen, Lei1 aChen, Zhiwei1 aLiu, Hui1 aWei, Qin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.630-637dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245020900158520149400367592002801861650001301889650001101902650001201913650001501925650001501940650001601955650001101971650002201982650002602004650001802030651001102048700002202059773012002081856007302201852000902274655001202283IND60744119620221120041107.0210709e20210626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411962DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeekes, Khafi 10aTwenty-First Century Science Calls for Twenty-First Century Groundwater Use Law: A Retrospective Analysis of Transboundary Governance Weaknesses and Future Implications in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin  aHow has groundwater use been historically governed by the binational to municipal government levels across the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin (GLB)? To what extent have they contemplated the physical–environmental requirements to maintain aquifer storage in devising policies and making decisions governing groundwater use? Although it is amongst the largest freshwater stores in the globe, cases of groundwater shortages are increasingly being reported across GLB communities, raising questions on the fitness of governance approaches to maintain groundwater storage (GWS) with growing climate and human pressures. Applying retrospective analytical methods to assess the century-old collaboration of the United States and Canada to maintain GLB water quantities, we characterize long-term trends and undertake systematic diagnosis to gain insight into causal mechanisms that have persisted over the years resulting in current GWS governance gaps. We reveal the surprising prominence of policies originally intended to safeguard surface water quantities being used to govern groundwater use and thereby maintain GWS. We also connect these, based on sustainable aquifer yield theory, to growing groundwater insecurity in the Basin’s drought-prone and/or groundwater-dependent communities. Based on deep understanding of long-standing policy pathologies, findings inform transboundary GWS governance reform proposals that can be highly useful to multiple levels of government policymakers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3aclimate 3afreshwater 3agovernance 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aretrospective studies 3asurface water 3aCanada1 aKrantzberg, Gail 0 tWater.g2021 June 26, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245009600166520143800262592002801700650001101728650000901739650001801748650001501766650002201781650001501803650001901818650001501837650001801852651001401870700002101884700002701905773012001932856007302052852000902125655001202134IND60744119720221120041202.0210709e20210626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074411972DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrien, Maria Macarena10aWater Footprint and Virtual Water Trade of Maize in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina  aAgriculture is the largest fresh water consuming sector, and maize is the most produced and consumed crop worldwide. The water footprint (WF) methodology quantifies and evaluates the water volumes consumed and polluted by a given crop, as well as its impacts. In this work, we quantified for the first time the green WF (soil water from precipitation that is evapotranspired) and the green virtual water exports of maize from Buenos Aires province, Argentina, during 2016–2017, due to the relevance of this region in the world maize trade. Furthermore, at local level, we quantified the green, blue (evapotranspired irrigation), and grey (volume of water needed to assimilate a pollution load) WF of maize in a pilot basin. The green WF of maize in the province of Buenos Aires ranged between 170 and 730 m³/ton, with the highest values in the south following a pattern of yields. The contribution of this province in terms of green virtual water to the international maize trade reached 2213 hm³/year, allowing some water-scarce nations to ensure water and water-dependent food security and avoid further environmental impacts related to water. At the Napaleofú basin scale, the total WF of rainfed maize was 358 m³/ton (89% green and 11% grey) and 388 m³/ton (58% green, 25% blue, and 17% grey) for the irrigated crop, showing that there is not only a green WF behind the exported maize, but also a Nitrogen-related grey WF.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acorn 3afood security 3afreshwater 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3apollution load 3asoil water 3avirtual water 3aArgentina1 aAldaya, Maite M.1 aRodriguez, Corina Iris0 tWater.g2021 June 26, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011700166300001600283520166200299592002801961650002601989650003402015650001602049650001102065650003302076650001202109700002102121773012702142856008402269852000902353655001202362IND60764727920220422000000.0220422e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076472792DNAL7 a10.17221/117/2013-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyglová, K.10aPossible complex approaches towards evaluating the quality of a destination in the context of tourism management  ap. 199-207.  aThepaper deals with the issues concerning evaluating the quality of a destination in the context of tourism. A destination has to be looked on as a complex product of tourism consisting of products, services, natural resources, artificially created attractions and information being connected. The satisfaction of visitors to a destination is dependent on the quality of their overall experience that is created on the basis of the cooperation of all participants working in tourism in the given area &ndash; these are local inhabitants, service providers, public administration workers and destination management workers. The paper shows possible approaches towards the complex evaluation of the destination quality. The first of the models is based on the European Consumer Satisfaction Index methodology and modifies it for evaluating the satisfaction of a visitor to a destination (in the researched destination, the values of the total ECSI indexes were calculated at 70% level in the case of home as well as foreign visitors). The second model &ndash; so-called Four-dimensional model of the destination quality &ndash; is based on the integrated approach to quality management when &ndash; with the support of the principal component analysis &ndash; a new methodology for evaluating the quality of a destination was suggested; it is based on four topically defined quality dimensions: attractions, services, marketing management, cooperation and sustainability. In the case of the suggested models, we also see their potential for increasing the quality of services in rural areas, which is the subject of the authors&rsquo; further research. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer satisfaction 3agovernment and administration 3amethodology 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3atourism1 aVajčnerová, I.0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 60, no. 5 p.199-207dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/117/2013-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245013700161300001300298520197300311592002802284650001502312650002602327650002402353650002602377650002102403650001402424650002302438650001502461650001402476650001402490650001402504650003002518650001802548650001902566650001202585650000902597651001902606700001502625700001602640700002002656700001402676700001602690700001502706773014502721856008002866852000902946655001202955IND60764728020221121064222.0220904e20170313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076472802DNAL7 a10.17221/117/2016-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalogun, M.10aRelative efficiency of positive selection and tissue culture for generating pathogen-free planting materials of yam (Dioscorea spp.)  ap. 9-16.  aYams are staples in West Africa. They are propagated from tubers in an informal seed system. This encourages a build-up of diseases, and necessitates the rapid development of a formal seed system where certified seeds are functional. Although few reports exist on the use of meristem culture to generate pathogen-free yam, the success rate for the most economically important species in the sub-region, Dioscorea rotundata, for the most prevalent viruses is inadequate. To generate pathogen-free yam planting materials, the relative efficiency of tissue culture and positive selection was compared. Twenty-one asymptomatic yam plants were positively selected from 8187 stands of five landraces. Five of these stands were tested virus-negative by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Yam mosaic virus (YMV), Yam mild mosaic virus (YMMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and by PCR for the genus Badnavirus (BV), giving 0.08% success. Single nodes of the positively selected stands were used to establish in vitro plantlets, which were screened onto bacteriological indexing medium. The same was done for meristem- and node-derived plantlets of the improved variety TDr 95/19158. Incidence of endophytes ranged from 18 to 32% in the nodal plantlets while it was 0% in the meristem-derived plantlets. The effect of meristem culture combined with thermotherapy on the virus infection status was determined using virus-tested, one week old in vitro plantlets of eight improved genotypes. These in vitro plantlets were incubated at 36 ± 0.5°C and 16 h photoperiod for 21 days, after which meristems were excised, regenerated into plantlets and re-tested for viruses. Seventy-three percent of the samples were recovered from YMV but the effect on BV was inconsistent. Positive selection can be used as a palliative in generating quality declared seed but meristem culture combined with thermotherapy is more efficient for generating certified seed tubers of yam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBadnavirus 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aDioscorea rotundata 3aYam mild mosaic virus 3aYam mosaic virus 3acultivars 3adisease-free seeds 3aendophytes 3alandraces 3ameristems 3aplantlets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3athermotherapy 3atissue culture 3aviruses 3ayams 3aWestern Africa1 aMaroya, N.1 aAugusto, J.1 aAjayi, Abiodun,1 aKumar, L.1 aAighewi, B.1 aAsiedu, R.0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 53, no. 1 p.9-16dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/117/2016-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245010100206506007600307520111400383592002801497506003701525650001101562650001401573650001401587650002501601650001801626650002201644650002601666650001701692650002401709650001601733650001901749650001901768650002201787650002101809650002001830650001901850650001301869650001701882650001801899700002101917773012501938856007702063852000902140655001202149IND60660456320221207091851.0190823e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066045632DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80803082doi7 aPMC67199292pmcid7 a314432022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowicka, Paulina 10aAnti-Hyperglycemic and Anticholinergic Effects of Natural Antioxidant Contents in Edible Flowers  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, 16 selected edible flowers were evaluated for their content of bioactive compounds (polyphenols, carotenoids, triterpenoids) and for their anti-diabetic (ability to inhibit &alpha;-amylase and &alpha;-glucosidases) and anti-aging (ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) activities. Most of the flowers analyzed in this study have not been examined in this respect until now. Contents of the analyzed bioactive compounds differed significantly among the flowers. In particular, the highest contents of carotenoids and triterpenoids were determined in marigold, arnica, lavender, and daisy; in turn, the highest contents of phenolic acids, procyanidin polymers, and total polyphenols were assayed in hawthorn, primrose, and linden blossom. There was a positive correlation between the content of isoprenoids in edible flowers and their anti-aging activity, and between the content of polymeric procyanidins and flowers&rsquo; ability to inhibit &alpha;-glucosidase. In conclusion, edible flowers may be used to produce functional foods as well as for medical purposes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArnica 3aCrataegus 3aLavandula 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aanti-aging properties 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3acholinesterase 3aedible flowers 3aenzyme inhibition 3afunctional foods 3aglycemic effect 3aphenolic acids 3apolymers 3aprocyanidins 3atriterpenoids1 aWojdyło, Aneta 0 tAntioxidants.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80803083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015900176300001400335520133400349592002801683650002701711650001501738650002601753650001501779650002301794650001701817650002801834650001501862650001801877650001601895650001101911653002401922653002001946653002601966653002501992653002002017653001502037700002202052773011102074856008602185852000902271655001202280IND60542842020221120145444.0190408e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonatto, Cínthia C.10aHigher temperatures speed up the growth and control the size and optoelectrical properties of silver nanoparticles greenly synthesized by cashew nutshells  ap. 46-54.  aThere is an increasing worldwide interest in utilizing cashew products and byproducts as raw materials for green synthesis of nanostructures. However, previous reports regarding the use of cashew to develop nanostructures were based on a limited amount of cashew products or byproducts, and only using the Anacardium occidentale L. The aim of the present study was to synthesize and characterize some optical, structural, electrical, molecular, and biological properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced using a previously neglected cashew species and cashew part, the nutshells of Anacardium othonianum. Silver nanoparticles synthesis was confirmed by absorbance at a maximum of 415nm. It was shown that the size and electrical conductivity of the AgNPs synthesized can be controlled (negatively and positively, respectively) by increasing the reaction temperature. Further, AgNPs biosynthesized by cashew nutshells were moderately cytotoxic toward yeast cells at micromolar concentration. In conclusion, a facile, eco-friendly, and cost-effective one-step method has been thermally optimized to produce size-controlled spherical-shaped and negatively-charged AgNPs with optoelectrical and antifungal properties using a cocktail of biochemical constituents from cashew nutshells as a combined reducing and coating agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aabsorbance 3aantifungal properties 3abyproducts 3acost effectiveness 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrical conductivity 3ananosilver 3araw materials 3atemperature 3ayeasts 0aMetal nanoparticles 0aGreen synthesis 0aAnacardium othonianum 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aCashew nutshell 0aAntifungal1 aSilva, Luciano P.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2014 July, v. 58 p.46-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014900171300001600320520107100336592002801407650000801435650001501443650003101458650002801489650001501517650002801532650002101560650001501581650001101596650000901607650001401616650001401630650001301644650001801657650001701675653001401692653001701706653001801723653004301741653002301784700002401807700002601831700001901857700002501876773012501901856008202026852000902108655001202117IND60599315320221120052622.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Maurilia P.10aSelf-assembled monolayers of mercaptobenzoic acid and magnetite nanoparticles as an efficient support for development of tuberculosis genosensor  ap. 141-148.  aIn this work, a genosensor for the electrochemical detection of genomic DNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was developed. The biosensor is based on self-assembled monolayers of mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) and magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4Nps) on bare gold electrode for immobilization of DNA probe. The aim of this work was the development of a platform based on cysteine-coated magnetic Fe3O4Nps linked via the carboxylate group from MBA to the work electrode surface and subsequently to the DNA probe. The probe–genome interaction was evaluated using a [Fe(CN)6]⁴⁻/[Fe(CN)6]³⁻ redox pair. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to evaluate the bioelectrochemical behavior of the sensor. Atomic force microscopy images showed Fe3O4Nps immobilized across the electrode surface. The interaction of the sensor with different genome DNA concentrations resulted in changes in the charge transfer resistance, indicating a possible use for tuberculosis detection at low concentrations (detection limit of 6ngμL⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiosensors 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agenome 3airon 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3atuberculosis 0aBiosensor 0aTuberculosis 0aNanoparticles 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aCyclic voltammetry1 aAndrade, Cesar A.S.1 aMontenegro, Rosana A.1 aMelo, Fabio L.1 aOliveira, Maria D.L.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 433 p.141-148dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012100178300001600299500002900315500001100344520093800355592002801293650002401321650003901345650002101384650002201405650001801427700006301445773013101508856008201639852000901721655001201730IND60681773620221120210207.0200117e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068177362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-019-02149-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgos-Rodríguez, Jhoset10aFederal legal authorities: guidance for application to the early detection of and rapid response to invasive species  ap. 147-153.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aReview  aFederal agency programs and associated actions are contingent on having the legal authority to act. There is no single authority established to direct the early detection of and rapid response to invasive species (EDRR). Rather, a patchwork of authorities unevenly addresses various aspects of the suite of EDRR measures. To support the development of national EDRR capacity, it is essential to delineate the federal legal statutes, regulations, and policies that enable or limit invasive species EDRR. Here we set forth general principles and a checklist of actions that agencies can refer to when they construct a more comprehensive EDRR legal and policy framework for addressing invasive species. This guidance is intended to complement the review and analysis of federal authorities contained elsewhere in this issue (Burgos-Rodríguez and Burgiel in Biol Invasions. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02148-w, 2019, this issue).  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological invasion 3agovernmental programs and projects 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3arapid methods1 aBurgiel, Stanley W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6027-05770 tBiological invasions.g2020 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.147-153dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02149-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015700168300001800325520178200343592002802125653002302153653002102176653002202197653001602219653003102235653001402266653002402280700002302304700002202327700001902349700002202368773017002390856008202560852000902642655001202651IND60517067420221120035926.0190728e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706742DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130005072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolman, Sarah J.10aHarbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) observed during land-based surveys in The Minch, north-west Scotland  ap. 1185-1194.  aThe waters off north-west Scotland are known to provide important habitat for the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Between October 2008 and April 2011, systematic land-based surveys were carried out to assess the seasonal occurrence, group size and group behaviours of both species in a study area located off Melvaig, near Gairloch. Data were collected on 47 separate days, with a total of 4543 minutes of survey effort (in sea states ≤3) recorded during the spring months and 8204 minutes of effort during the autumn. A total of 189 sightings of marine fauna were recorded, comprising 126 cetacean sightings, 50 seal sightings and 13 sightings of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus). Six species of cetacean were identified, with most sightings comprising harbour porpoise (N = 72) or minke whale (N = 38). Harbour porpoise abundance was higher in autumn than in spring and there was a variation between years in numbers of minke whales sighted. In porpoises, sea state and cloud cover both influenced sightings and increasing sea state influenced survey area. Foraging behaviour was exhibited in 13% of harbour porpoise sightings and 34% of minke whale sightings. Results demonstrate a regular occurrence of harbour porpoises and minke whales in nearshore waters off Gairloch. Densities are comparable to boat surveys in the region and so support the use of land-based watches as a potential longer-term monitoring method for these species in coastal waters. Given the regular use of this area by these two European Protected Species, as well as the occurrence of a range of human activities potentially affecting them in the region, it may be appropriate to consider protecting this area for their conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aland-based surveys 0aharbour porpoise 0aPhocoena phocoena 0aminke whale 0aBalaenoptera acutorostrata 0aThe Minch 0anorth-west Scotland1 aHodgins, Nicola K.1 aMacLeod, Colin D.1 aPierce, G.

Yet sorghum is largely unknown as a food in the United States and other developed countries. Recently, the U.S. demand for sorghum as a gluten-free, non-GMO input to food products has been growing. At the same time, the use of sorghum for food and industrial uses is being promoted by the producer-financed United Sorghum Checkoff Program (USCP). How much of that growth can be attributed to the USCP promotion? Has the investment been profitable for sorghum producers? This study finds that USCP promotion programs have resulted in a 4% increase in the sales value of sorghum for that purpose and a 1% increase in total sorghum farm revenue. The farm level benefit-cost ratio is estimated at between 5.8 and 7.1 in terms of producer profit per dollar spent on promotion.  aWe gratefully acknowledge funding for this project from the United Sorghum Checkoff Program (USCP).  aPublisher supplied data  cUnited Sorghum Checkoff Program (USCP) 3aagribusiness 3acheck-off programs 3acost benefit analysis 3adeveloped countries 3afarm income 3afarms 3agluten-free foods 3ahumans 3anon-genetically modified foods 3asales 3aUnited States 0aSorghum 0ageneric advertising and promotion 0afood demand 0acheckoff program 0abenefit-cost analysis1 aCapps, Oral0 tJournal of international food & agribusiness marketing.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 32, no. 1 p.13-29dRoutledgewJournal:jnl43743x1528-69837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2018.15335103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002600136245007900162300001600241520137500257592002801632653003001660653002001690653001901710653001501729700002201744700002101766700002101787700003001808700002101838700002101859700001801880700002401898773012201922856007202044852000902116655001202125IND60126078720221121022524.0151105e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607872DNAL7 a10.1654/4295.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Dennis J.10aImmunobiology of Moniliformis moniliformis Infection in Female Wistar Rats  ap. 299-307.  aThe immunobiology of acanthocephaliasis was investigated using the model of Moniliformis moniliformis in experimentally infected, female Wistar rats. Serum was collected before infection and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 wk postinfection (PI). Marked eosinophilia was evident at wk 1 PI and persisted for the 8 wk. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) M was first detected at wk 2 PI, remained relatively steady during wk 2––6, and then increased dramatically between wk 6 and 8. Serum IgG levels increased steadily from wk 4 to wk 8 PI. Serum IgE, interleukin 4 (IL-4), and interferon gamma (IFN-γγ) were not detected. Sodium dodecyl sulfate––polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis revealed consistently high antigenicity for 4 proteins of approximately 46––52, 70––78, 80––99, and 125––150 kDa that correspond to M. moniliformis proteins of 46––50, 72––78, 99, and 140 kDa, respectively, seen on SDS-PAGE. Subcutaneous injection of rats with somatic products or excretory––secretory products at 1 or 5 mg protein/kg respectively, resulted in an IgG response similar to that evoked by infection with M. moniliformis. Although a dramatic humoral immune response was mounted by rats against M. moniliformis, the response did not appear to be protective, as evidenced by egg output and worm number, size, and location.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMoniliformis moniliformis 0amoniliformiasis 0aAcanthocephala 0aimmunology1 aClark, Deborah J.1 aDionne, Karen M.1 aBrightman, Holly1 aMcCaughern-Carucci, James1 aNickol, Brent B.1 aBrady, Thomas C.1 aBrink, Cheryl1 aPalladino, Agostino0 tComparative parasitology.g2008 July, v. 75, no. 2 p.299-307dHelminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4295.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008400170520136800254592002801622653002301650653001401673653001701687653003001704653002601734653001901760700001901779700005901798700001701857700005801874773010101932856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60735804120221119021144.0210619e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073580412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rinma.2021.1001822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuciño, Alberto14aThe influence of fine aggregates on Portland cement mortar compressive strength  aThe studies regarding the influence of stone-extracted materials on the mechanical properties of Portland cement mortars, has a growing interest in Mexico due to its geological diversity. This is of great relevance since, according to the mechanical properties, a suitable use of mortars can be proposed to satisfy specific requirements of regional construction systems. For this reason, the main goal of this research is to relate the composition of three types of aggregates commonly used in construction practices in two geologically different regions in Mexico with the mortar's compressive strength. Composition is analyzed by mineral crystalline phase identification. The analytical techniques employed were: Petrography, Qualitative X-ray Powder Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results obtained showed that sands with same origin sands (igneous sands) can provide very different compressive strength values; while aggregates from different origin (igneous and sedimentary) can have similar behavior regarding compressive strength. The amorphous fraction of the pink sand aggregate was attributed as the main factor regarding the change in mechanical properties. The gray igneous sand is adequate for a type N mortar, while the pink igneous sand and the rock limestone powder provide type M mortars.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNatural aggregates 0aLimestone 0aIgneous rock 0aChemical characterization 0aMechanical properties 0aMasonry mortar1 aVargas, Sofía1 aPérez, Nora A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5407-96131 aBucio, Lauro1 aOrozco, Eligio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5407-96130 tResults in materials.g2021 June, v. 10 p.100182-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27476x2590-048X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2021.1001823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014500173300001600318520111900334592002801453650001401481650001201495650001401507650002001521650001901541650001701560650003901577650003201616650001301648653002301661653002301684653005601707653002201763653003001785700002401815700002301839773009201862856008501954852000902039655001202048IND60599432420221118103713.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, Nicole S.10aDetermination of arsenic speciation in sulfidic waters by Ion Chromatography Hydride-Generation Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (IC-HG-AFS)  ap. 466-472.  aA method for the analysis of arsenic species in aqueous sulfide samples is presented. The method uses an ion chromatography system connected with a Hydride-Generation Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometer (IC-HG-AFS). With this method inorganic Asᴵᴵᴵ and Asⱽ species in water samples can be analyzed, including arsenite (HnAsIIIO3n−3), thioarsenite (HnAsIIIS3n−3), arsenate (HnAsVO4n−3), monothioarsenate (HnAsVSO3n−3), dithioarsenate (HnAsVS2O2n−3), trithioarsenate (HnAsVS3On−3) and tetrathioarsenate (HnAsVS4n−3). The peak identification and retention times were determined based on standard analysis of the various arsenic compounds. The analytical detection limit was ~1–3µgL⁻¹ (LOD), depending on the quality of the baseline. This low detection limit makes this method also applicable to discriminate between waters meeting the drinking water standard of max. 10µgL⁻¹ As, and waters that do not meet this standard. The new method was successfully applied for on-site determination of arsenic species in natural sulfidic waters, in which seven species were unambiguously identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3adetection limit 3adrinking water 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aion exchange chromatography 3asulfides 0aArsenic speciation 0aIon chromatography 0aHydride Generation Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry 0aGeothermal fluids 0aOn-site chemical analysis1 aStefánsson, Andri,1 aSigfússon, Bergur0 tTalanta.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 128 p.466-472dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245008900185300001400274500001400288520101900302592002801321650001701349650002501366650002101391650001501412650001001427650001101437650002201448650001401470650002001484650001501504653002901519653002401548653001701572700003101589700001701620773014101637856008501778852000901863655001201872IND60682118620221119085808.0200124e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068211862DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2018.15335112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ado Carmo Stangherlin, Isadora14aThe Impact of Social Norms on Suboptimal Food Consumption: A Solution for Food Waste  ap. 30-53.  aNAL-light  aConsumers seem to have a reduced preference to buy fruits and vegetables with unusual appearance, products with damaged package and close to the expiration date, usually called suboptimal food products. However, this pattern of behavior is an important contributor to food waste levels. Interventions aimed at encouraging the purchase of suboptimal food are scarce, however, needed. Across two studies, we investigated the effect of social norms in driving suboptimal food consumption. Additionally, it was tested if food waste problem awareness is the underlying mechanism in the relationship between social norms and intention to buy suboptimal food. Results show that appeals employing social norms positively affect purchases intentions toward the products. Moreover, food waste problem awareness mediates the effect of social norms on intentions to purchase the product with an unusual appearance. We discuss how social norms can be used to tackle food waste and implications for marketing and policy actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aappearance (quality) 3afood consumption 3afood waste 3afoods 3afruits 3aissues and policy 3amarketing 3asocial behavior 3avegetables 0aSuboptimal food products 0aconsumer food waste 0asocial norms1 ade Barcellos, Marcia Dutra1 aBasso, Kenny0 tJournal of international food & agribusiness marketing.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 32, no. 1 p.30-53dRoutledgewJournal:jnl43743x1528-69837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974438.2018.15335113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245006300154300001600217520085000233592002801083653005401111653004201165653004301207653002701250653001001277653001201287700001901299700002501318773012201343856007201465852000901537655001201546IND60126078820221121022334.0151105e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607882DNAL7 a10.1654/4320.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, Omar M.10aFour New Species of Acanthocephalans from Birds in Vietnam  ap. 200-214.  aDuring November 2000, a collection of acanthocephalans from 6 species of birds in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, included 4 new species.

We aimed to evaluate the anti-hypertrophic protein adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and two major protein degradation systems (ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy) in a model of surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) in rats with ischemic cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were randomized into the following groups: sham/sham (control group), myocardial infarction (MI)/sham (sham group) and MI/SVR (SVR group), with an interval of 4 weeks. Two (early, n = 5 for each) and 28 days (late, n = 5 for each) after SVR, ventricular size, and wall stress were assessed. Myocyte area, protein expression of AMPKα and autophagy markers, and gene expression of ubiquitin ligases (Atrogin-1 and Murf-1) were evaluated in the late phase. In the early phase, left ventricular dimensions and wall stress were smaller in the SVR group than in the sham group, whereas they were comparable in the late period. Myocyte area in the SVR group was reduced to the value in the control group, while it was larger in the sham group than in the control group. Total-AMPKα, p-AMPKα, and AMPKα phosphorylation rates were higher, and Atrogin-1 and Murf-1 were lower in the SVR group than in the sham group, while the autophagy markers were not different between the groups. p-AMPKα had strong negative correlations with myocyte area, Atrogin-1, and Murf-1. CONCLUSIONS: In myocyte reverse remodeling after SVR, AMPKα phosphorylation increased in association with reduced gene expression of ubiquitin ligases.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcJapan Heart Foundation Research Grant 2015  aNAcMochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research 2016 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aautophagy 3acardiomyopathy 3agene expression 3amodels 3amolecular biology 3amyocardial infarction 3aphosphorylation 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein synthesis 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aHieda, Tetsuya1 aSugimoto, Satoshi1 aAsai, Hidetsugu1 aYamakawa, Tomoji1 aWakasa, Satoru0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4885-4892dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07347-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008600176300001800262520102400280592002801304650001301332650004401345650002201389650002601411650002101437650001501458650001001473650000901483650001101492650001801503650001501521650001301536650002301549700003001572700001701602700003001619700002301649700002501672773011401697856008101811852000901892655001201901IND60080274720221117155703.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008027472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-014-1131-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatesan, Jayachandran10aMarine algae-mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles using a novel Ecklonia cava  ap. 1591-1597.  aIn the present study, we report rapid biological synthesis of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) using a novel marine brown alga Ecklonia cava (Family: Lessoniaceae) by the reduction of chloroauric acid. The formation of Au NPs reaction was complete within 1 min at 80 °C and physiochemically characterized with different analytical techniques. FTIR spectroscopy revealed that Au NPs were functionalized with biomolecules that have primary amine group, hydroxyl group and other stabilizing functional groups. X-ray diffraction pattern showed high purity and face-centered cubic structure of Au NPs. Microscopy results showed that these Au NPs are formed with shapes like spherical and triangular with an average size of 30 ± 0.25 nm. Synthesized Au NPs showed good antimicrobial and biocompatibility with human keratinocyte cell line. Thus, physiochemical characteristic results suggest that Au NPs will have promising biomedical applications in different area such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, biosensor, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiochemical compounds 3abiocompatibility 3abiosensors 3adrugs 3agold 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3amicroscopy 3ananogold 3atissue engineering1 aManivasagan, Panchanathan1 aKim, Se-Kwon1 aKirthi, Arivarasan Vishnu1 aMarimuthu, Sampath1 aRahuman, Abdul Abdul0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2014 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.1591-1597dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-014-1131-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245014500194500001900339500002000358520183300378592002802211650002202239650001702261650001602278650001102294650001602305650001302321650001302334650001102347650002202358650001602380650001602396650001502412650001702427650002302444650001602467700006402483700003602547700002102583700001902604700002702623773014302650856007402793852000902867655001202876IND60725493720221120192228.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072549372DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.150182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiaz, Asad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3913-777110aApplication of chitosan‐based apple peel polyphenols edible coating on the preservation of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa cv Hongyan) fruit  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was determined to investigate the efficacy of chitosan (CS)‐based apple peel polyphenols (APP) composite coatings to enhance the storage quality of strawberries. Strawberries were coated with CS‐APP1 (0.25% APP), CS‐APP2 (0.50%), CS‐APP3 (0.75%), CS‐APP4 (1.0%), and stored at 20°C and 35–40% RH. The uncoated fruit was considered as control. The fruits were evaluated for weight loss, decay, firmness, bioactive compounds, titratable acidity, and total soluble solids (TSS). The results revealed that CS‐APP coatings had a significant effect on all the tested parameters. The weight loss and decay percentage were reduced to 10.91% and 19%, respectively, in the CS‐APP4 treatment group. The highest value of TSS (6.8%) was observed in the CS‐APP3 treatment group on the 6th day of storage. Coatings with CS‐APP4 exhibited the maximum acid content (0.78 g/100 g) as compared to the CS only (0.68 g/100 g). The total phenol content was highest (1.3 mg/g) in the CS‐APP2 treatment group at the end of storage. CS‐APP2 composite coating could be effectively utilized to extend the postharvest life of strawberries as it retarded the senescence and maintained quality attributes of the fruits during storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Strawberry is a nutritionally rich fruit. However, it has a short shelf‐life and can deteriorate quickly. Chitosan (CS) is a biopolymer that is widely used for the application of edible coating with different antioxidant agents. Although apple fruit peel is discarded as industrial waste, yet it is a good source of polyphenols and natural antioxidants. Chitosan‐based APP edible coating can be used to prolong the postharvest life of strawberry as well as to minimize food processing industrial waste by utilizing apple peel as an antioxidant ingredient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aantioxidants 3aapple peels 3aapples 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3afirmness 3afruits 3aindustrial wastes 3aingredients 3apolyphenols 3ashelf life 3astrawberries 3atitratable acidity 3aweight loss1 aAadil, Rana Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0185-00961 aAmoussa, Abdou Madjid Olatounde1 aBashari, Mohanad1 aAbid, Mohamed,1 aHashim, Malik Muhammad0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e15018-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.150183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009900158300002000257520170400277592002801981650002202009650001902031650002002050650000902070650002002079650003702099650001302136650002102149650002102170650001102191650001302202650001302215650001102228650001602239650001902255650001902274650000902293650001502302700001702317700002302334700001802357773012402375856007502499852000902574655001202583IND60636171220221123002721.0190506e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063617122DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06785b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Tzu-Hsing10aPerformance of ZnMn₂O₄/SiO₂ sorbent for high temperature H₂S removal from hot coal gas  ap. 35795-35804.  aA spinel ZnMn₂O₄ sorbent supported on SiO₂ was fabricated using a wetness impregnation method for high temperature desulfurization. The operating parameters including operating temperature, ZnMn₂O₄ content, space velocity, gas composition, and multiple desulfurization/regeneration cycles were evaluated to understand the optimal condition. The ZnMn₂O₄/SiO₂ sorbent exhibits better desulfurization performance when operating temperature is controlled above 600 °C and the suitable space velocity is between 5000–15 000 h⁻¹. The relationship among CO, H₂, and CO₂ on sorbent utilization could be explained via the water shift reaction. The sorbent utilization of the ZnMn₂O₄/SiO₂ sorbent was retained at approximately 70% after ten desulfurization/regeneration cycles. Elemental analyses demonstrated that the formation of the spinel structure of ZnMn₂O₄/SiO₂ improved the Zn stability and no Zn vaporization or loss were observed after ten desulfurization/regeneration cycles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed regeneration (TPR) were used to characterize the crystal phase and regeneration phenomena of the ZnMn₂O₄/SiO₂ sorbent. XRD results demonstrated the presence of spinel structure of ZnMn₂O₄, and no Zn and Mn oxides were observed after multiple cycles, indicating that the ZnMn₂O₄/SiO₂ sorbent is thermodynamically stable for high temperature desulfurization. Through the EDS and TPR analyses, the residual sulfur was found in the regenerated sorbent and this sulfur species is sulfate from incomplete regeneration. A regeneration temperature of 700 °C was the best choice to overcome the formation of metal sulfate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acoal 3adesulfurization 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amanganese oxides 3asilica 3asorbents 3asulfates 3asulfur 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3avolatilization 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aWang, Shumao1 aChang, Feng-Hsiang1 aChu, Chen-Yao0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 19, v. 7, no. 57 p.35795-35804dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06785b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001800136245014400154300001600298520131500314592002801629653004201657653001301699653001001712653001601722653001501738653003601753700002301789700001401812700002001826700001401846773012201860856007201982852000902054655001202063IND60126078920221121022538.0151105e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607892DNAL7 a10.1654/4321.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, Omar M.10aOn the Ecology and Host Relationships of Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae (Acanthocephala: Quadrigyridae) from Cichlids in Lake Malawi  ap. 278-282.  aAbout 2,000 specimens of the quadrigyrid acanthocephalan Acanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae (Baylis, 1948) were collected from 9 species of cichlid fish hosts (Cichlidae: Perciformes) in 7 different sites in Lake Malawi, Africa, during September 2005. New host records are noted in 5 species, Labeotropheus trewavasae (Fryer), Melanochromis vermivorus (Trewavas), Nimbochromis polystigma (Regan), Tropheops microstoma (Trewavas), and Rhamphochromis sp. (Regan). High prevalence of A. tilapiae was observed in all host species analyzed. The parasite manages to infect its cichlid hosts, despite their distinct trophic specializations. Nevertheless, significant variation in parasite load was detected between sympatrically occurring rock-dwelling (mbuna) cichlids, with Pseudotropheus zebra (Boulenger) showing the most heavy infections. In addition, significant variation in parasite burden was detected between sampling locations, but host gender and weight did not explain significant variation in the numbers of A. tilapiae individuals. Differential exposure to parasites and host susceptibility may explain the marked variation in parasite abundance among cichlid hosts. Worms appear to be recruited in the summer, develop and mature through the winter, and reproduce sexually in late winter and spring.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcanthogyrus (Acanthosentis) tilapiae 0acichlids 0ambuna 0aLake Malawi 0aprevalence 0ahost and seasonal relationships1 aOosterhout, C.

It is excreted mainly through urine and feces. Exposure to E2 may affect the reproductive system of both animals and humans, especially since the removal of E2 in conventional processes and technologies present in the wastewater treatment plants is not sufficient. Chlorine is one of the most studied and used oxidant worldwide. Although there are studies that demonstrate the endocrine disrupting compounds removal like E2, its reaction with organic matter can originate by-products, namely, trihalomethanes, which are known to have high toxic potential. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the removal of E2 (50 μg E2 L⁻¹—maximum concentration) using peracetic acid (PAA), a seeming cleaner and innocuous alternative to chlorine. To this end, a series of jar tests were performed, using different peracetic acid concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 15 mg L⁻¹) and contact times (10, 15, and 20 min). The results obtained showed that a peracetic acid concentration of 15 mg L⁻¹ with a contact time of 20 min had a removal efficacy of approximately 100%. The second main goal of this study was to evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of the tested treatments on the zebrafish Danio rerio. Several oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated, namely glutathione S-transferase, lipid peroxidation, and catalase, besides vitellogenin. Both peracetic acid and E2 caused significant increases in the oxidative stress biomarkers, although this did not lead to increased lipid peroxidation levels. In addition, peracetic acid significantly decreased the estrogenic activity of E2, as indicated by decreased vitellogenin levels. Peracetic acid demonstrated to have great potential as an alternative disinfectant for chlorine treatments, and indications for future research are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  aUID/AMB/04085/2019cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BPD/109199/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aDanio rerio 3abiomarkers 3abyproducts 3acase studies 3acatalase 3achlorine 3adisinfectants 3aecotoxicology 3aendocrine system 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3afeces 3aglutathione transferase 3alipid peroxidation 3aorganic matter 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aperacetic acid 3areproductive system 3aurine 3avitellogenin 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aJorge, Joana1 aDias, Rita1 aNoronha, João P.1 aAmaral, Leonor1 aDaam, Michiel A.1 aMano, António P.1 aDiniz, Mário S.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Feb., v. 192, no. 2 p.114-114dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8079-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009300169500001900262520150700281592002801788650001601816650001201832650001201844650001101856650001401867650001601881650001301897650001501910650001901925650002301944650001901967650001301986650001401999653001802013653002102031700002002052700006202072700005902134700006102193773012402254856008402378852000902462655001202471IND60735804320221119021440.0210610e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073580432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorges, Marine14aThe study of long-term durability and bio-colonization of concrete in marine environment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this paper is to study the long-term durability and bio-colonization of concrete in marine environment. In this work, concrete formulations were developed and optimised by varying the type of cement (CEMII and CEMV) and introducing shellfish by-products (Oyster Shells) into their composition (by substituting 20% by weight of 4/10 aggregates). Four concrete formulations were thus studied.The durability of these materials upon bio-colonization were tested after 90 days, 180 and 360 days of immersion in natural seawater. The monitoring of the photosynthetic activity of biofilms and the biomass on the materials surface showed a better acclimatisation of the microphytobenthos in CEMII 20% Shells concrete than in other concretes despite a lower colonization on this concrete. It was also noticed that the chlorophyll biomass was the highest in concrete CEMV 20% Shells after 360 days. During immersion, the mechanical strengths of CEMII 0% Shells, CEMII 20% Shells and CEMV 20% Shells increased. At long term of immersion, the chloride ions diffusion was more reduced, in natural seawater, for CEMII 0% Shells, CEMII 20% Shells and CEMV 20% Shells concretes than for concrete CEMV 0% Shells. these results lead to the assumption that the accumulation of biofilm plays a role as protective barrier against the action of chloride ions. Finally, it appears that the concrete CEMII 20% Shells is the most suitable concrete mix design for marine infrastructure amongst the tested designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3acement 3achlorides 3achlorophyll 3aconcrete 3adurability 3ainfrastructure 3amarine environment 3aphotosynthesis 3aseawater 3ashellfish 0aOyster shells 0aBio-colonization1 aBourguiba, Amel1 aChateigner, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7792-87021 aSebaibi, Nassim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1241-27451 aBoutouil, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2752-82650 tEnvironmental and sustainability indicators.g2021 June, v. 10 p.100120-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:27272x2665-97277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.1001203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013000175300001400305500001400319520098900333592002801322650001401350650001701364650001401381650001201395650001101407650001801418650001401436650001101450650001001461650001401471650001801485650001201503650001001515651001101525653002101536653001801557653002801575653001301603700001901616700002101635773014101656856008501797852000901882655001201891IND60682118820221119085836.0200124e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068211882DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2019.15997502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharlebois, Sylvain10aFragmented Food Habits and the Disintegration of Traditional Meal Patterns: A Challenge to Public Health Nutrition in Canada?  ap. 69-78.  aNAL-light  aThis study examines the shifting patterns in meal consumption practices among Canadians and the sources of disruption of meal habits. It analyses the notion of breakfast, lunch, dinner, out-of-household consumption of food, cooking, and snacking which could be considered as disrupting eating habits. Meal skipping, primarily breakfast and lunch was common, particularly among women, as was consumption of food outside the home, particularly among lower income earners and respondents with lower education attainment. The findings of this survey suggest that contemporary Canadians are experiencing a disruption of meal times, a rise in the frequency of snacking and an erosion of the will or ability to prepare or cook meals at home. For many Canadians, the traditional notion of three-meals a day is becoming an ideal, rather than a daily reality. Fragmented food habits and the disintegration of traditional meal patterns represent a challenge to public health nutrition in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadians 3aagribusiness 3abreakfast 3acooking 3adinner 3aeating habits 3afrequency 3aincome 3alunch 3amarketing 3apublic health 3asurveys 3awomen 3aCanada 0afood consumption 0ameal skipping 0apublic health nutrition 0asnacking1 aSomogyi, Simon1 aKirk, Sara F.

These genes were reported to have positive regulation of the pathway in providing isoprenoid moieties. Though, some information is available on the pathway and secondary metabolites. However, most of the pathway steps are not characterized functionally. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: For the study, full-length pathway gene Hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA-synthase (CaHMGS; GenBank accession number: MZ997833), was isolated from previously annotated transcriptome data of Centella asiatica leaves. HMGS has been successfully cloned and heterologously expressed in bacteria E. coli strain DH5α. The cloned gene has been sequenced and further characterized through in silico studies by different bioinformatics tools. Also, the gene sequences have been submitted in NCBI. In silico studies of isolated gene sequence revealed the nature, characteristics of genes. The ORF of HMGS is 1449 bp encoding 482 amino acids. Predicted molecular weight (MW) of HMGS was 48.09 kDa and theoretical pI was 5.97. Blast results and Multiple sequence alignments of the gene showing the similarity with HMGS of other plants of their respective families. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) version 10.1.6 was used to construct a phylogenetic tree. Differential tissue-specific expression of different plant parts was also checked. Tissue expression patterns unveiled that the highest expression level of the CaHMGS had been seen in the roots and lowest in the node of the plant. Functional complementation experiment of the CaHMGS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild strain YSC1021 and haploid strain YSC1021 which lack HMGS protein confirmed that the CaHMGS gene encodes functional CaHMGS that catalyzed the biosynthesis of mevalonate in yeast. CONCLUSIONS: The gene was reported, cloned and characterized first time in Centella asiatica. Understanding this biosynthetic pathway gene will further help in the improvement of plants for enhanced secondary metabolites production.  aPublisher supplied data  a31/034(0178)2016-EMR-IcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aCentella asiatica 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3acomputer simulation 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3ahaploidy 3amolecular biology 3amolecular weight 3aphylogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3atranscriptome 3atriterpenoid saponins 3ayeasts1 aWarsi, Zafar Iqbal1 aKhatoon, Kahkashan1 aSangwan, Neelam S1 aKhan, Feroz1 aRahman, Laiq Ur0 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.4555-4563dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07300-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016200159300001800321520087000339592002801209650001301237650001201250650001201262650001401274650002001288650001701308650001301325700001901338700001601357773011401373856008101487852000901568655001201577IND60080274920221117155624.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008027492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-014-1133-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin10aIncreasing butanol/acetone ratio and solvent productivity in ABE fermentation by consecutively feeding butyrate to weaken metabolic strength of butyrate loop  ap. 1609-1616.  aIn this study, we attempted to increase butanol/acetone ratio and total solvent productivity in ABE fermentations with corn- and cassava-based media, by consecutively feeding a small amount of butyrate/acetate during solventogenic phase to weaken the metabolic strengths in butyrate/acetate closed-loops. Consecutively feeding a small amount of butyrate (a total of 3.0 g/L-broth) is most effective in improving performance of corn-based ABE fermentations, as it simultaneously increased average butanol/acetone ratio by 23 % (1.92–2.36) and total solvent productivity by 16 % (0.355–0.410 g/L/h) as compared with those of control. However, the butyrate feeding strategy could not improve butanol/acetone ratio and total solvent productivity in cassava-based ABE fermentations, where the metabolic strength of butyrate closed-loop had already been very low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacetone 3abutanol 3abutyrates 3afeeding methods 3afermentation 3asolvents1 aShi, Zhongping1 aLi, Zhigang0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2014 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.1609-1616dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-014-1133-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010200153300002000255520074300275592002801018650001701046650001001063650000901073650001301082650001501095650001301110650003101123650001501154700001901169700001801188700001901206773012401225856007501349852000901424655001201433IND60636171420221123002902.0190506e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063617142DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06808e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yue10aGeneral fabrication and enhanced VOC gas-sensing properties of hierarchically porous metal oxides  ap. 35897-35904.  aA facile and general route to synthesize hierarchically porous metal oxide nanostructures was reported here.

The signal sensitivity of the gas sensors exhibits a good linear relation with the VOC gas concentration. As one of the as-synthesized hierarchically porous metal oxides, ZnO exhibits the lowest detection limit of 15 ppb for formaldehyde, which is much lower than the limit value of indoor formaldehyde (60 ppb).

This paper focuses (a) on the development of an analytic enabling to extract and quantify the NI 3,4-dimethylpyrazolephosphate (DMPP), marketed since 1999. The efficiency of DMPP has been studied in laboratory and field soils. Here the DMPP analytic and the behaviour of a nitrifying bacterial consortium enriched from a field soil and exposed to zero, field applied and a 10 fold higher DMPP concentration than the recommended one for field application are in the focus. Methods: For extracting DMPP quantitatively from soils a method connected to a HPLC analytic has been developed by us and was standardized in laboratory experiment with a silt clay field soil (allochtone Vega). The method is detailed described here. Its reliability has been tested in a 3 years field trial under varying cropping systems and climatic conditions asides the influence of DMPP on CO2-, CH4- and N2O- emissions, measured by the closed chamber method. Parallel a nitrifying bacterial consortium of the silty clay field soil was enriched and subjected to 0, the recommended DMPP concentration for field applications and a 10 times higher one. In incubation experiments the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate in presence and absence of DMPP was spectrophotometer determined and pH-shifts with a scaled litmus paper. In sacrificed flasks at the end of incubation morphological changes of the bacteria involved were studied by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Results: The ammonium, nitrite and nitrate determinations and the TEM pictures show that in presence of the field applied DMPP concentration the nitrifying activity returned around 30 days later than in the control and the cells were slightly enlarged. In presence of a 10 times higher DMPP concentration a recovery was prevented. DMPP prolongs, compared with dicyandiamide (DCD), the period of nitrifiers' inhibition and reduced N2O- and CO2- the emissions (Weiske et al., Biol Fertil Soils 34:109-117, 2001a, Nutr Cycl Agroecosys 60:57-64, b).Conclusions: With the method developed by us the stability of DMPP in agricultural soils can be satisfyingly and reproducible studied down to a detection limit of 0.01 μg DMPP g-1 dry soil. The morphological changes in the nitrifying consortium due to DMPP concentrations are in agreement with the recovery rate found by nitrite and nitrate formation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aammonium sulfate 3abacteria 3aclay 3aclimatic factors 3acropping systems 3adetection limit 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agroundwater 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrites 3apaper 3asilt 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aChrist, Elke1 aHerbert, Tobias1 aWeiske, Achim1 aBlome, Johannes1 aHardt, Martin0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Oct., v. 371, no. 1-2 p.257-266dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1664-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015600180300001600336520152300352592002801875650001101903650001201914650002201926650001501948650001801963650001501981650001501996650001502011650002202026650001502048650002202063650001602085651001102101653001102112653001502123653002102138653003002159653001702189700002602206700001702232700002302249773011602272856008502388852000902473655001202482IND60682119120221119085711.0200124e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068211912DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2019.16052832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayanja, Maureen Nanziri10aPastoral community coping and adaptation strategies to manage household food insecurity consequent to climatic hazards in the cattle corridor of Uganda  ap. 110-119.  aEstablishing short and long term measures that pastoral and agropastoral households use to ensure they have access to food in periods of climate extremes could provide insights into ways to support households in similar conditions. Using semi-structured elicitation, 15 purposively selected participants from case households and 13 community leaders, in the central cattle corridor of Uganda were interviewed in January to February 2013. Thematic analysis revealed four coping strategies: harvesting immature food crops, selling off cattle, searching for alternative water sources and using alternative non-production-based means to access food. Three adaptation strategies identified were: diversifying livelihood activities, changing agricultural practices and investing in alternative water sources. Several strategies were related to incremental crop system changes, to maintain the existing way of practice. However, some were transformational, like formerly specialized livestock keepers taking on crop farming. Some strategies presented environmentally erosive effects; which could be curbed by evaluating the opportunity cost of diversification and transformative practices in relation to incremental adaptation. Insights gleaned could assist researchers to consider aspects for in-depth adaptation analysis and inform on how policies and institutions in Uganda could be used to facilitate, rather than undermine, pastoralists’ coping and adaptation; and thus guide interventions to strengthen food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3aclimate 3acoping strategies 3afood crops 3afood security 3aharvesting 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3aopportunity costs 3apastoralism 3aUganda 0aCoping 0aadaptation 0aclimate extremes 0ahousehold food insecurity 0apastoralists1 aRubaire-Akiiki, Chris1 aMorton, John1 aKabasa, John David0 tClimate and development.g2020 Feb. 7, v. 12, no. 2 p.110-119dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2019.16052833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015600172300001600328520174000344592002802084650001502112650002202127650002002149650001702169650004302186650001102229650001502240650001802255650001502273650001402288650002202302650001802324653002202342653005202364653002902416653001702445653001802462653002502480700002202505700002402527773009202551856008502643852000902728655001202737IND60599432920221118102401.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhani, Rouhollah10aSecond-order data obtained by beta-cyclodextrin complexes: A novel approach for multicomponent analysis with three-way multivariate calibration methods  ap. 254-262.  aThis research reports the first application of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) complexes as a new method for generation of three way data, combined with second-order calibration methods for quantification of a binary mixture of caffeic (CA) and vanillic (VA) acids, as model compounds in fruit juices samples. At first, the basic experimental parameters affecting the formation of inclusion complexes between target analytes and β-CD were investigated and optimized. Then under the optimum conditions, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and bilinear least squares/residual bilinearization (BLLS/RBL) were applied for deconvolution of trilinear data to get spectral and concentration profiles of CA and VA as a function of β-CD concentrations. Due to severe concentration profile overlapping between CA and VA in β-CD concentration dimension, PARAFAC could not be successfully applied to the studied samples. So, BLLS/RBL performed better than PARAFAC. The resolution of the model compounds was possible due to differences in the spectral absorbance changes of the β-CD complexes signals of the investigated analytes, opening a new approach for second-order data generation. The proposed method was validated by comparison with a reference method based on high-performance liquid chromatography photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA), and no significant differences were found between the reference values and the ones obtained with the proposed method. Such a chemometrics-based protocol may be a very promising tool for more analytical applications in real samples monitoring, due to its advantages of simplicity, rapidity, accuracy, sufficient spectral resolution and concentration prediction even in the presence of unknown interferents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3afactor analysis 3afruit juices 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anormal values 3aprediction 3aprotocols 3aspectral analysis 3avanillic acid 0aBeta-cyclodextrin 0aBilinear least squares/residual bilinearization 0aParallel factor analysis 0aCaffeic acid 0aVanillic acid 0aFruit juices samples1 aGhasemi, Jahan B.1 aShemirani, Farzaneh0 tTalanta.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 128 p.254-262dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245011800214300001200332520166900344592002802013650001302041650002402054650001002078650001402088650002202102650001802124650000902142650000902151650001102160650001502171650001102186650001102197650001202208650002102220650001102241650001602252651001402268700006402282700006602346773015102412856008202563852000902645655001202654IND60681774220221122050708.0210311e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068177422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-8080-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfonso, María Belén,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0543-809810aMicroplastics integrating the zooplanktonic fraction in a saline lake of Argentina: influence of water management  ap. 117.  aThis study address for the first time in Argentina and the South American continent the effect of water management on the presence of microplastics (MPs) in a shallow lake, assessing their contribution to the zooplankton fraction. Water samples were collected in the lake and its principal affluent, an irrigation channel, from winter 2018 to summer 2019 with a zooplankton net (47 μm). MPs were present in all analyzed samples, with a dominance of fibers, black color, and ≤ 1000 μm range size. MPs concentration was maximum during summer at the lake (180 MPs m⁻³) while during spring (140 MPs m⁻³) at the channel. Rotifers and cyclopoids dominated the zooplanktonic fraction at both sites which range sizes (< 200 to 600 μm) included most of the size range found for MPs (50–950 μm). According to our results, the MPs found represents a potential risk for the first levels of the food web. In the lake, the concentration of MPs concerning total zooplankton abundance was higher when the channel was closed. Nevertheless, when the channel was open, the higher concentration in summer matches with the increase of tourism and an extraordinary rainfall. Our results suggest that while the runoff of agro-industrial waste regulates the MPs concentration in the channel, its water management, the touristic activities, and the runoff of MPs from nearby urban settlements regulate the concentration of MPs in the lake. These findings emphasize the need for better treatment of urban and agro-industrial waste that develops near continental aquatic systems, mainly in those where tourism activities are frequent and treatment facilities scarce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotifera 3aagricultural wastes 3acolor 3afood webs 3airrigation canals 3amicroplastics 3arain 3arisk 3arunoff 3asalt lakes 3aspring 3asummer 3atourism 3awater management 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArgentina1 aArias, Andrés Hugo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3322-330X1 aPiccolo, María Cintia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5184-91490 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Feb., v. 192, no. 2 p.117-117dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8080-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007000167300001800237500001500255520105900270592002801329650001101357650001401368650001701382650003301399650001201432650001501444650001201459650001801471650002901489650001101518650002301529650001801552650001401570650001501584650001801599650001301617650002101630653001801651700001701669700001901686700002001705700002401725700001901749700002001768773011401788856008101902852000901983655001201992IND60080275120221122134210.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008027512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-014-1135-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoguang10aProduction of bioethanol and biodiesel using instant noodle waste  ap. 1627-1635.  a2019-12-06  aInstant noodle manufacturing waste was used as feedstock to convert it into two products, bioethanol and biodiesel. The raw material was pretreated to separate it into two potential feedstocks, starch residues and palm oil, for conversion to bioethanol and biodiesel, respectively. For the production of bioethanol, starch residues were converted into glucose by α-amylase and glucoamylase. To investigate the saccharification process of the pretreated starch residues, the optimal pretreatment conditions were determined. The bioethanol conversion reached 98.5 % of the theoretical maximum by Saccharomyces cerevisiae K35 fermentation after saccharification under optimized pretreatment conditions. Moreover, palm oil, isolated from the instant noodle waste, was converted into valuable biodiesel by use of immobilized lipase (Novozym 435). The effects of four categories of alcohol, oil-to-methanol ratio, reaction time, lipase concentration and water content on the conversion process were investigated.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been used increasingly for natural ventilation design in urban neighborhoods. The accuracy of such simulations relies largely on how the CFD domain is chosen. In the domain, we define the Influence Region as the area where the surrounding buildings must be modeled explicitly to predict the ventilation flow rate accurately. This study presents the early efforts to determine the adequate size of the Influence Region in the CFD domain using a coupled indoor-outdoor CFD simulation, in which the air change rate (ACH) no longer varies noticeably with increasing number of surrounding obstacles. Convergence charts of ACH as a function of an increasing number of surrounding building layers are generated using various urban parameters (e.g., wind condition, aspect ratio, building height relative to surroundings, downstream obstacles, and non-idealized surroundings). Our analysis demonstrated that only including the adjacent layer of surrounding obstacles is not sufficient for predicting correctly the ACH because of the artificial channeling effect between buildings. For both normal and oblique wind directions, three layers of surroundings are required for regular street canyons with an aspect ratio H/W=1. In the case of wide canyons (H/W=1/3), two layers of surroundings are needed because there is less flow interference between upstream and downstream obstacles. For the urban configuration, where the target building is significantly taller than nearby structures, the ACH on higher floors does not vary much with increasing amount of surroundings, which significantly reduces the required number of buildings in the Influence Region. In addition, buildings at the side and downstream of the target building can be moderately excluded in the Influence Region as long as the most adjacent downstream layer of obstacles is modeled. A real urban configuration with non-uniform spacing among buildings is evaluated. We showed that the required size of the Influence Region that is derived from uniform building arrays still generally applies to non-idealized landscapes. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing the sensitivity of the selected Influence Region in CFD simulations to reduce unintended modeling errors and computing expense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuildings 3acanyons 3aenergy 3afloors 3afluid mechanics 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anatural ventilation 3aprediction 3aurban areas 3awind direction 0aNatural ventilation 0aInfluence Region 0aStreet canyon 0aAir change rate (ACH) 0aCFD1 aChen, Yujiao1 aMalkawi, Ali0 tApplied energy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 182 p.625-633dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011400162300001800276520124300294592002801537650001501565650001201580650002301592650001201615650001401627650001501641650001501656650001101671650001101682700001601693700002101709700001801730773011401748856008101862852000901943655001201952IND60080275220221122134132.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008027522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-014-1136-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmribt, Z.10aOptimization and robustness analysis of hybridoma cell fed-batch cultures using the overflow metabolism model  ap. 1637-1652.  aThe maximization of biomass productivity in fed-batch cultures of hybridoma cells is analyzed based on the overflow metabolism model. Due to overflow metabolism, often attributed to limited oxygen capacity, lactate and ammonia are formed when the substrate concentrations (glucose and glutamine) are above a critical value, which results in a decrease in biomass productivity. Optimal feeding rate, on the one hand, for a single feed stream containing both glucose and glutamine and, on the other hand, for two separate feed streams of glucose and glutamine are determined using a Nelder–Mead simplex optimization algorithm. The optimal multi exponential feed rate trajectory improves the biomass productivity by 10 % as compared to the optimal single exponential feed rate. Moreover, this result is validated by the one obtained with the analytical approach in which glucose and glutamine are fed to the culture so as to control the hybridoma cells at the critical metabolic state, which allows maximizing the biomass productivity. The robustness analysis of optimal feeding profiles obtained with different optimization strategies is considered, first, with respect to parameter uncertainties and, finally, to model structure errors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aammonia 3abiomass production 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3ahybridomas 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aoxygen1 aDewasme, L.1 aVande Wouwer, A.1 aBogaerts, Ph.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2014 Aug., v. 37, no. 8 p.1637-1652dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-014-1136-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245012200217520118600339592002801525653003601553653001601589653001001605653001401615653002701629700003001656700006101686773012001747856008301867852000901950655001201959IND60735804820221119021519.0210519e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073580482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ceja.2021.1001162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriceño-Ahumada, Zenaida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4365-064710aAqueous foams and emulsions stabilized by mixtures of silica nanoparticles and surfactants: A state-of-the-art review  aIn the last years, mixtures of silica nanoparticles and surfactants have been widely and successfully used to stabilize a multiplicity of aqueous foams and emulsions with current and potential applications in the engineering processes. The physicochemical properties and large-scale industrial production of silica nanoparticles, as well as the practical and cheap methods offered by surfactants to modify the nanoparticles' wettability, are the main reasons for the silica nanoparticle-surfactant pair to be an effective combination on the stabilization of both aqueous foams and emulsions. This state-of-the-art review aims to offer a well-defined picture of the contemporary research on foams and emulsions (oil-in-water, water-in-oil, and the particular case of the bicontinuous ones) stabilized by mixtures of silica nanoparticles and surfactants (cationic, anionic, nonionic, and zwitterionic) featuring the top results and outlining future research in the area. Attention is paid to the processes and materials where the foams and emulsions discussed are present. The function of silica nanoparticles-surfactants synergy on stabilizing foams and emulsions is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSilica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) 0aSurfactants 0aFoams 0aEmulsions 0aBicontinuous emulsions1 aSoltero-Martínez, J.F.A.1 aCastillo, Rolando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6331-03110 tChemical engineering journal advances.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 7 p.100116-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27516x2666-82117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceja.2021.1001163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245019200170300001400362500001900376520168000395592002802075650002202103650001002125650001402135650001302149650001302162650001402175650002402189650001402213650001102227650002302238650001102261650001302272650002502285650001302310653002302323653001402346653001602360653003202376653000602408653000802414653000702422653000802429653000702437653000802444653000802452653000902460653001002469653000802479653000702487653000802494653000902502653000902511653000902520653000802529653000702537653000802544653000702552653000802559653000802567653000802575653000802583700002202591700002302613773010002636856008502736852000902821655001202830IND60722782920221120155712.0210401e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072278292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2020.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, Yoshitake10aMatcha consumption maintains attentional function following a mild acute psychological stress without affecting a feeling of fatigue: A randomized placebo-controlled study in young adults  ap. 44-52.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTea is a beverage commonly consumed worldwide. Matcha is a type of green tea produced by drying and grinding tea leaves (Camellia sinensis L.) into a fine powder. Matcha contains catechin, theanine, and caffeine, which affect cognitive function. Epidemiological studies conducted in Japan have shown that green tea consumption improves cognitive impairment. Previously, we found that daily matcha intake improves attention and executive function in middle-aged and older people. However, its effect on cognitive function in younger adults remains unclear. Moreover, it is unclear which cognitive functions are impaired by stress. This study aimed to clarify whether the administration of matcha improves the attentional function of young adults after mild acute stress and which cognitive function is improved. We included 42 participants aged 25 to 34 years who consumed 2 g of matcha daily for 2 weeks. The Uchida–Kraepelin test was used to induce mild acute psychological stress. Memory, attention, facial expression recognition, working memory, visual information, and motor function were evaluated. Reaction times on the Stroop test for attentional function were significantly lower in the matcha group than in the placebo group. Correct hits in the emotion perception test increased significantly for participants in the matcha group compared to those in the placebo group. We found no significant between-group differences in the other tests. In conclusion, after 2 weeks of matcha intake, the attentional function was maintained after mild acute psychological stress. Thus, matcha might improve cognitive function during or after stress conditions in young adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aJapan 3abeverages 3acaffeine 3acatechin 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3agreen tea 3amemory 3anutrition research 3apeople 3aplacebos 3apsychological stress 3atheanine 0acognitive function 0aattention 0ayoung adult 0arandomized controlled trial 0aC 0aCFS 0aCG 0aCPT 0aEC 0aECG 0aEGC 0aEGCG 0aFPCPT 0aFTT 0aGC 0aGCG 0aNVRT 0aPOET 0aPOMS 0aSAT 0aSD 0aSDC 0aST 0aUKT 0aVAS 0aVBM 0aVIM1 aKaneko, Toshiyuki1 aTakihara, Takanobu0 tNutrition research.g2021 Apr., v. 88 p.44-52dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2020.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001900162245011300181300001800294520157200312592002801884650001901912650001001931650001701941650001101958650001501969650003501984650001202019650001802031650002202049650002102071650002202092650003002114650002202144650001302166650000902179650004602188650003402234650002102268700002302289700001802312700001102330700002202341700001602363700001502379773010002394856007702494852000902571655001202580IND60083355820221116193823.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008335582DNAL7 a218549442pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-37652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrøndum, R.F.10aReliabilities of genomic prediction using combined reference data of the Nordic Red dairy cattle populations  ap. 4700-4707.  aThis study investigated the possibility of increasing the reliability of direct genomic values (DGV) by combining reference populations. The data were from 3,735 bulls from Danish, Swedish, and Finnish Red dairy cattle populations. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers were fitted as random variables in a Bayesian model, using published estimated breeding values as response variables. In total, 17 index traits were analyzed. Reliabilities were estimated using a 5-fold cross validation, and calculated as the within-year squared correlation between estimated breeding values and DGV. Marker effects were estimated using reference populations from individual countries, as well as using a combined reference population from all 3 countries. Single-country reference populations gave mean reliabilities across 17 traits of 0.19 to 0.23, whereas the combined reference gave mean reliabilities of 0.26 for all populations. Using marker effects from 1 population to predict the other 2 gave a loss in mean reliability of 0.14 to 0.21 when predicting Swedish or Finnish animals with Danish marker effects, or vice versa. Using Swedish or Finnish marker effects to predict each other only showed a loss in mean reliability of 0.03 to 0.05. A combined Swedish-Finnish reference population led to an average reliability as high as that from the 3-country reference population, but somewhat different for individual traits. The results from this study show that it is possible to increase the reliability of DGV by combining reference populations from related populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding value 3abulls 3adairy cattle 3amodels 3aprediction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCattlexgenetics 2aDairyingxmethods 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenomicsxmethods 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aReference Values1 aRius-Vilarrasa, E.1 aStrandén, I.1 aSu, G.1 aGuldbrandtsen, B.1 aFikse, W.F.1 aLund, M.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Sept., v. 94, no. 9 p.4700-4707dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-37653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245007200202300001600274500001900290500002000309520158200329592002801911596005301939650002401992650001002016650002702026650001302053650001402066650001502080650001802095650001302113700001702126700002102143700001602164700001902180773012202199856007302321852000902394655001202403IND60705320920221118033511.0200803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070532092DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.130802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgueiro, Pedro A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5055-280510aCan quarries provide novel conditions for a bird of rocky habitats?  ap. 988-994.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHighly degraded habitats such as quarries often require active restoration efforts, but classical reclamation practices may undermine the occurrence of species that are locally rare or of conservation concern. We argue that some species can benefit from quarry landform whenever the presence of certain elements in the surroundings is preserved. We uncover the role of quarry landforms as providers of artificial habitat for the establishment of a bird of rocky habitats—the Black Redstart (Phoenicurus ochruros). We identified and monitored the location of territories of this species in seven quarries and their surroundings, over an entire breeding season. A multiscale approach was applied in order to take into account optimal spatial scales of response of the species to each habitat descriptor. We found this species mainly associated with quarried areas embedded within an inhospitable landscape. Mean slope, built‐up area, and number of habitats were important descriptors for Black Redstart territory location. Black Redstart territories are constrained at two scales. Core areas (0.25 ha) are mainly defined by optimal conditions for nest site location, where inaccessible rocky slopes provide safer places for nesting. At a larger scale (>2.00 ha) territories must enclose other land uses that deliver access to food supplies and offer good display positions to signal the limits of territories, allowing control of possible intruders. Localized actions aiming to maintain novel elements may result in the preservation of species such as the Black Redstart.  aPublisher supplied data  cSECIL ‐ Companhia Geral de Cal e Cimento, S.A. 3aartificial habitats 3abirds 3aecological restoration 3ahabitats 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3anesting sites 3aquarries1 aSilva, Carmo1 aSilva, Alexandra1 aSá, Cátia1 aMira, António0 tRestoration ecology.g2020 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.988-994dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.130803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001400279500001500293520085300308592002801161650002101189650002201210650001201232650001101244650001401255650003301269650001301302650001601315653001201331653001401343653001701357653001101374653001301385653001201398653002101410700001701431700001701448700001201465700001801477773010601495856008601601852000901687655001201696IND60540776520221121064058.0190318e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054077652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yan-Yan10aCompare study cellulose/Ag hybrids using fructose and glucose as reducing reagents by hydrothermal method  ap. 14-21.  a2019-12-06  aThe primary objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of reducing reagents on the hybrids from cellulose and Ag, which have been successfully synthesized by using fructose and glucose as reducing reagents via a hydrothermal method, respectively.

The influences of the various reaction parameters including the heating time, heating temperature, and types of reducing reagents on the hybrids were investigated. Silver particles can be better dispersed in the cellulose matrix by adjusting reaction parameters. Experimental results demonstrated that the types of reducing reagents played an important role in the shape and dispersion of silver particles in hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermogravimetry 3aX-ray diffraction 3aglucose 3asilver 3acellulose 3ascanning electron microscopy 3afructose 3atemperature 0aHybrids 0aCellulose 0aHydrothermal 0aSilver 0aFructose 0aGlucose 0athermal analysis1 aLi, Shuming,1 aMa, Ming-Guo1 aYao, Ke1 aSun, Runcang,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 June 15, v. 106 p.14-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012800168300001600296520168000312536039301992592002802385596002602413650001702439650001902456650001502475650002002490650001202510650001102522650001502533650002202548650001502570650002202585650001602607650001202623650001502635651001702650651001102667651000902678653001602687653002402703653001702727653001602744773011602760856008502876852000902961655001202970IND60682119320221119085659.0200124e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068211932DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2019.16052852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltea, Laura10aPerceptions of climate change and its impacts: a comparison between farmers and institutions in the Amazonas Region of Peru  ap. 134-146.  aPeru is considered among the 20 most vulnerable countries to climate change and its effects are already being felt in many areas. Through a case study in the Inter Andean sector of the Region of Amazonas, the study aims at exploring the perceptions and interpretations of climate change and its impacts from two different perspectives: regional institutions and smallholder farmers. The novelty of this study lies in examining simultaneously different levels of society and comparing two sets of views. In addition, it focuses on the inter Andean sector of Peru in the Region of Amazonas, an area that is relatively underexplored in the scientific literature. Data collection involved 13 semi-structured interviews at the institutional level, 23 semi-structured interviews in two selected rural communities and 2 participatory workshops deploying Participatory Rural Appraisal tools. The most commonly reported indicators of change include higher temperatures, shifts in the rainy season and more frequent extreme weather events. As a consequence of these changes, reduced crop yield, greater incidence of coffee rust, increased difficulties with the organization of the agricultural calendar and new diseases for animals and humans were mentioned. Compared to institutions, farmers provided a more accurate description of how climate change affects the local livelihood system. Institutions highlighted the problem of limited availability of historical climatic data and scientific studies related to the Region. In this context, local knowledge and bottom-up perspectives can play an important role to inform policies and plans to address climate change at the local scale.  aThis research is part of a Ph.D programme in Social and Political Science of the University of Sassari, Italy.

Tethering of EBV genomes to cellular chromosomes is required for the synthesis and persistence of viral plasmids in tumor cells. However, it is not established how EBV genomes are tethered to cellular chromosomes. We test the hypothesis that the viral protein EBNA1 tethers EBV genomes to chromosomes specifically through its N-terminal AT-hook DNA-binding domains by using a small molecule, netropsin, that has been shown to inhibit the AT-hook DNA-binding of EBNA1 in vitro. We show that netropsin forces the loss of EBV genomes from epithelial and lymphoid cells in an AT-hook dependent manner and that EBV-positive lymphoma cells are significantly more inhibited in their growth by netropsin than are corresponding EBV-negative cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-binding domains 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 3abinding capacity 3acarcinoma 3achromosomes 3aepithelium 3agenome 3ahuman diseases 3alymphocytes 3alymphoma 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasmids 3aviruses 0aEpstein Barr Virus 0aNetropsin 0aAT-hook1 aSugden, Bill0 tVirology.g2015 Oct., v. 484 p.251-258dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.05.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015500167500002900322520122900351592002801580650002901608650002701637650001401664650002101678650001901699650001301718650001301731650001101744650001101755653002801766653002501794653003001819653003301849653002201882700002701904700005501931700006201986773011402048856008402162852000902246655001202255IND60722783020221120164653.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072278302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1015492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaube, Oliver10aIncreasing people's acceptance of anthropogenic climate change with scientific facts: Is mechanistic information more effective for environmentalists?  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aKnowledge-deficit models highlight that providing novel information increases knowledge and acceptance of empirical facts. Motivated cognition models, however, highlight that people often discount new attitude-conflicting facts. Thereby, according to motivated cognition models, people's levels of global warming knowledge and anthropogenic climate change acceptance markedly reflect their preexisting environmental attitude. In four studies (N = 845), we tested the efficacy of new information to foster knowledge and alter acceptance while simultaneously controlling for environmental attitude. Despite corroborating the association of knowledge and acceptance (Study 1), providing information about the physical-chemical mechanism behind global warming did not always promote the acceptance of anthropogenic climate change (Study 2 vs. Studies 3 and 4). Moreover, acceptance increases induced with mechanistic information did not exceed acceptance gains induced with information about global warming's consequences (Study 3). By contrast, our findings corroborate environmental attitude's relevance for two central remnants of learning: knowledge (Studies 1, 3, and 4) and behavior (e.g., information seeking: Study 4).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aattitudes and opinions 3acognition 3aefficacy testing 3aglobal warming 3ajournals 3alearning 3amodels 3apeople 0aEnvironmental attitudes 0aKnowledge management 0aInformation dissemination 0aClimate change communication 0aSocial acceptance1 aRanney, Michael Andrew1 aHenn, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4036-14871 aKaiser, Florian G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7269-71320 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2021 Feb., v. 73 p.101549-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1015493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015200170300001600322520101900338592002801357650002201385650003201407650002801439650001801467650002201485650002001507650001001527650001701537650002501554650001501579650005201594650001001646650000801656650001401664700001801678700002001696700002101716700001901737700001501756773014101771856008701912852000901999655001202008IND60608457320221119025812.0200511e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060845732DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2010.115126962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zheng-He10aExpression of genes for two phosphofructokinases, tonoplast ATPase subunit A, and pyrophosphatase of tea roots in response to phosphorus-deficiency  ap. 449-453.  aLimited data are available on the levels of expression of the genes encoding ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (ATP-PFK), pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK), tonoplast adenosinetriphosphatase (V-ATPase) subunit A, and tonoplast pyrophosphatase (V-PPiase) in response to phosphorus (P)-deficiency. Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a useful species in which to investigate adaptations to P-deficiency in higher plants due to its high tolerance to P-deficiency. Partial cDNAs encoding these four enzymes were isolated from tea roots. Thereafter, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyse the levels of expression of these four genes in tea roots in response to P-deficiency. The results showed that P-deficiency decreased the levels of expression of the genes for ATP-PFK and V-ATPase subunit A, whereas not only did it not decrease, but it slightly increased the levels of expression of the genes for PPi-PFK and V-PPiase. This may contribute to the high tolerance of tea plants to P-deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abiotechnology 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahorticulture 3aphosphofructokinases 3aphosphorus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3atea 3atonoplast1 aChen, Li-Song1 aChen, Rong-Bing1 aZhang, Fang-Zhou1 aYang, Lin-Tong1 aTang, Ning0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 85, no. 5 p.449-453dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2010.115126963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245006600204300001600270500001900286500002000305520161500325592002801940596005101968650001702019650002302036650002702059650000902086700002002095700005702115773012202172856007302294852000902367655001202376IND60705321120221118033624.0200803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070532112DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.131362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTielke, Ann‐Kathrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3841-040610aMild cycles open closed communities to ecological restoration  ap. 841-849.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecies loss is a global issue. With up to a million species at risk and insufficient protected area to maintain the world's biodiversity, humanity will increasingly need to rely on species re‐introductions to locally restore diversity and function. However, such restoration attempts are bound to fail when ecological communities get locked in a closed state that is resistant to recovery. It is presently unknown how to repair these closed systems. We use mathematical models to identify ways out of this problem. We first show how ecological communities may enter a closed state, to then explain how to open them up again for restoration of their original diversity. We find that restoration is often still possible shortly after initial species loss, as (1) the secondary extinctions that produce closure have not happened yet and (2) mild population fluctuations still allow successful repair during a transient postdisturbance phase. However, after this typically short window of opportunity for restoration, the system enters a new equilibrium, which may be a closed state. Our analysis shows how to take ecological communities out of the closed state: Appropriate management of carrying capacities produces a regime of mild population fluctuations that opens a window for successful species re‐introductions. These windows can be perpetually recurring or permanently open. Such opportunities for repair can be absent under regimes of wild cycles or perfect stability. We conclude that mild cycles may open windows of opportunity for the repair of communities that have become resistant to recovery.  aPublisher supplied data  aVO 1669/1‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aecological restoration 3arisk1 aKarreman, Japke1 aVos, Matthijs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6123-96460 tRestoration ecology.g2020 July, v. 28, no. 4 p.841-849dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.131363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012000168300001800288520111600306592002801422653001701450653002401467653003501491653002201526700002101548700002501569700002301594773017001617856008201787852000901869655001201878IND60517068320221120035850.0190728e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706832DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130009452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegrati, Mariana10aSeabird and dolphin associations: do seabirds benefit from feeding in association with dusky dolphins in Patagonia?  ap. 1147-1153.  aThe objective of this study was to describe associations between several species of seabirds and dusky dolphins. We investigated during what dolphin activities seabirds were most commonly associated, and the size of flock in relation to the number of dolphins in a group. Since both seabirds and dolphins may display different feeding strategies, we also investigated if benefits differed among seabird species. Data were collected in Golfo Nuevo (42°20′S65°00′W) on-board a research vessel between 2001 and 2008. A total of 224 mixed groups of seabirds were encountered during this study. The seabird–dolphin associations were mainly observed during dusky dolphin surface feeding. Shearwaters and kelp gulls were mainly observed in flocks that were associated with dolphins, while Magellanic penguins and cormorants were mainly observed without dolphins. Seabirds may be conditioned to the foraging strategy of dolphins, since birds are associated with dolphins only during dolphin surface feeding. This association probably helped seabirds to find prey, but there were no obvious benefits to dolphins.  aPublisher supplied data 0acommensalism 0afeeding association 0aseabird–cetacean interaction 0aPeninsula Valdés1 aDans, Silvana L.1 aGaraffo, Griselda V.1 aCrespo, Enrique A.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 Sept., v. 94, no. 6 p.1147-1153dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154130009453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002000136245021200156300001600368520145900384592002801843653002801871653002301899653001301922653002101935653002501956653001701981653002201998653001602020653002402036653001602060653001902076700001702095700002002112700001602132773012202148856007202270852000902342655001202351IND60126079820221121022554.0151105e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012607982DNAL7 a10.1654/4337.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarson, Maxwell10aTaxonomy and Faunistics of the Helminth Parasites of Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822), and Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters, 1852) from Temporary Pans and Pools in the Save-Runde River Floodplain, Zimbabwe  ap. 228-240.  aTwo freshwater fish species, Clarias gariepinus and Oreochromis mossambicus, were collected from pans, dry-season pools, and tributaries of the Save and Runde rivers in the southeastern lowveld of Zimbabwe from December 2004 until June 2006. Helminth parasites infecting these fish were isolated from the gills, skin, muscles, body cavity, gall bladder, stomach, and intestines and were examined microscopically. Adult helminths were collected from the darter, Anhinga melanogaster, a piscivorous bird, to compare and possibly link them to the larvae recovered from fish. Stomach contents of the birds were analyzed, and their prey fish species were identified. Larval helminths collected include digenean metacercariae (clinostomes and strigeids), larval cestodes (gryporhynchids), and juvenile nematodes (Contracaecum). Adult worms include the monogeneans Macrogyrodactylus clarii, Macrogyrodactylus karibae, and Macrogyrodactylus congolensis; the digenean Clinostomum complanatum; the nematodes Paracamallanus cyathopharynx, Contracaecum rudolphi, Contracaecum multipapillatum, and Contracaecum rodhaini; and the cestodes Polyonchobothrium clarias and Echinorhynchotaenia tritesticulata. Many of these observations are the first record of that particular parasite species in Zimbabwe or southern Africa. Morphological measurements were made and compared with the original species description, and some unique morphological features are here described.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOreochromis mossambicus 0aClarias gariepinus 0aZimbabwe 0aSave-Runde River 0aAnhinga melanogaster 0aContracaecum 0aMacrogyrodactylus 0aClinostomum 0aEchinorhynchotaenia 0aDiplostomum 0aParacamallanus1 aBray, Rodney1 aOllevier, Frans1 aHuyse, Tine0 tComparative parasitology.g2008 July, v. 75, no. 2 p.228-240dHelminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4337.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245018000209506011700389506007600506520199900582592002802581506003702609650004302646650002702689650001202716650002902728650001302757650002202770650001902792650000702811650002202818650000902840650001702849650001102866650001902877650001802896650001302914651001202927653003102939653001902970653002002989653002103009700002703030700001803057700002003075773010403095856008303199852000903282655001203291IND60735805120221207065531.0220502e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073580512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envc.2021.1001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0985-179810aPotential ecological risk, in-situ phytoextraction potential of Lycopersicon esculentum, and pollution indices of selected toxic metals in Hausawan - Kaba, Kano State, Nigeria  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnthropogenic pollution due to inappropriate treatment of agricultural and industrial waste has been posing an ecological threats worldwide. However, an increasing pressure and demand for sustainability in farming, brought about the use of many hazardous chemicals and industrial wastes, such as the use of tannery sludge as an effective organic manure. This study was initiated as a follow up investigation to assess the potential ecological risk; the level of metal pollution in soil and Lycopersicon esculentum (L. esculentum) and its potentiality for in-situ phytoextraction in Hausawan - Kaba, Kano State, Nigeria. The suspected sludge, soil and plants grown in three different farms; farmland-1, farmland-2, and farmland-3 (control) in the study area were collected. The concentration of Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb) were spectrophotometrically detected. In addition, Bioaccumulation Factors (B.F), Pollution Index (P.I), Ecological Risk Index (ERI) and Potential Ecological Risk (PER) index of metals in three different sampling sites were calculated. The results indicated that PER value and concentration of metals in soil from farmland-1 is higher than that of farmland-2 and control site. Cd was observed to be the major contributor of ERI and had the highest average concentration in soil and plant samples. The results also showed that properties of soil such as pH, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), and organic matter content influenced the metal concentrations. Bioaccumulation Factor (B.F) > 1 observed for the plants manifested their phytoremediation potential. Therefore, the study concluded that based on the PER analysis, the study area is a potentially “low ecological risk” environment and the L. esculentum has a great potential to uptake large quantity of Cd, Pb and Cr in its root system; translocate to shoots and can be evidently used as hyperaccumulator for in-situ phytoextraction when cultivated in a soil contaminated with either Cr, Cd and/or Pb.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3acation exchange capacity 3achromium 3ahyperaccumulators 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphytoaccumulation 3arisk 3aroot systems 3asludge 3asoil pollution 3atannery waste 3atoxicity 3aNigeria 0aPhytoremediation potential 0aTannery sludge 0aHausawan–Kaba 0aHyperaccumulator1 aYoung, Abigail Clement1 aChen, Deqiang1 aMughal, Nafeesa0 tEnvironmental challenges.g2021 Aug., v. 4 p.100113-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27646x2667-01007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envc.2021.1001133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245017900168300001600347520093300363592002801296650003501324650003201359650001401391650002001405650001301425650001301438650001401451650001601465650001801481650001601499650001501515650001101530650002201541653000801563653000701571653001301578653002601591653001201617653001201629700001901641700002601660700002101686700002301707773008901730856008401819990002301903852000901926655001201935IND60697466520221122213340.0201230e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069746652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Linda L.10aMutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase that make it sensitive to degradation by the viral protease in virions are selected against in patients  ap. 127-135.  aMutations in the thumb subdomain of reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 can cause this enzyme to be degraded in virions by the viral protease (PR). Many of these mutations confer a temperature-sensitive phenotype on RT and viral replication. The degradation of RT by PR appears to take place after Gag-Pol has been processed. We show here that mutations in other parts of RT, including the RNase H domain, can make RT PR-sensitive and temperature-sensitive. These data explain why some mutations in the RNase H domain, which had little or no effect on the polymerase activity of purified recombinant RT, had a profound effect on viral titer. Because the PR-sensitive phenotype significantly reduced viral titer, we previously suggested that these mutations would be selected against in patients. We also show that RT mutations that are known to confer a temperature sensitive phenotype are rarely found in the Stanford database.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3adatabases 3aenzyme activity 3amutation 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aproteinases 3aribonucleases 3atemperature 3aviral load 3avirion 3avirus replication 0aHIV 0aRT 0aProtease 0aTemperature sensitive 0aRNase H 0aGag-Pol1 aBoyer, Paul L.1 aJane McWilliams, Mary1 aSmith, Steven J.1 aHughes, Stephen H.0 tVirology.g2015 Oct., v. 484 p.127-135dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015200170300001400322520185600336592002802192650001302220650003002233650001702263650002602280650002002306650001602326650002302342650001402365650001402379650002302393650001102416650005302427650001002480650001602490650002002506650001902526650001202545650002302557650001602580650002302596653001402619653002002633653001002653653003002663653002002693653001402713653002202727700005802749700002202807700001902829700006102848700002202909773009002931856008503021852000903106655001203115IND60599433320221118102336.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirasoli, Mara10aElectronic nose and chiral-capillary electrophoresis in evaluation of the quality changes in commercial green tea leaves during a long-term storage  ap. 32-38.  aElectronic nose and capillary electrophoresis were applied in quality control of green tea samples subjected to long-term storage. Twelve representative green teas were considered, available as an “aged” (tea leaves stored during a long-term period of two years) and/or “not aged” (fresh products) samples. Their infusions were analyzed by an electronic nose, equipped with an array of six metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors to obtain olfactive fingerprints of the volatile compounds in the infusions headspace. Upon training and chemometric analysis of acquired data (linear discriminant analysis), the electronic nose was found to be able in correctly classifying unknown samples as “aged” or “not aged”. Concomitantly, the infusion samples were analyzed by Cyclodextrin-modified Micellar Electrokinetic Chromatography (CD-MEKC) for determination of catechins. The analysis of seven most represented catechins and the methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine revealed a general loss of the polyphenols in each of the considered aged samples (up to 45%, w/w). In addition, the applied enantioselective method based on (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HP-βCD) as chiral selector, was exploited for the estimation of (+)-Gallocatechin in the presence of (−)-Gallocatechin; the latter, as the non-native enantiomer, can be associated to the epimerisation of (−)-Epigallocatechin and was assumed as a marker occurring in case of uncorrected storage conditions of tea leaves. Interestingly, it was observed that epimerization did not significantly occur during aging. The application of CD-MEKC and electronic nose allowed for a fast characterization of green teas taking into account that the aroma is a decisive parameter for the acceptance of the product, whereas the catechins content is associated to the biological value.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3acapillary electrophoresis 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aelectronic nose 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3aheadspace analysis 3aleaves 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3aodors 3apolyphenols 3aquality control 3asemiconductors 3astorage 3astorage conditions 3atheobromine 3avolatile compounds 0aGreen tea 0aElectronic nose 0aAroma 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aChiral analysis 0aCatechins 0aLong-term storage1 aGotti, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0622-22481 aDi Fusco, Massimo1 aLeoni, Alberto1 aColliva, Carolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8360-91421 aRoda, A.q(Aldo),0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.32-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008700172506007600259520116000335592002801495506003701523653000801560653001601568653001901584653000901603653001601612653003001628700001601658700001701674700002201691773010301713856008301816852000901899655001201908IND60735805320221207065531.0220606e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073580532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cdev.2021.2036822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatharu, Navneet K.10aRole of vertebrate GAGA associated factor (vGAF) in early development of zebrafish  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHomeotic genes and their genomic organization show remarkable conservation across bilaterians. Consequently, the regulatory mechanisms, which control hox gene expression, are also highly conserved. The crucial presence of conserved GA rich motifs between Hox genes has been previously observed but what factor binds to these is still unknown. Previously we have reported that the vertebrate homologue of Drosophila Trl-GAF preferentially binds to GA rich regions in Evx2-hoxd13 intergenic region of vertebrate HoxD cluster. In this study, we show that the vertebrate-GAF (v-GAF) binds at known cis-regulatory elements in the HoxD complex of zebrafish and mouse. We further used morpholino based knockdown and CRISPR-cas9 knockout technique to deplete the v-GAF in zebrafish. We checked expression of the HoxD genes and found gain of the HoxD4 gene in GAF knockout embryos. Further, we partially rescued the morphological phenotypes in GAF depleted embryos by providing GAF mRNA. Our results show that GAF binds at intergenic regions of the HoxD complex and is important for maintaining the spatial domains of HoxD4 expression during embryonic development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aGAF 0aGAGA factor 0aTrithorax like 0aHoxD 0aHox cluster 0aChromatin domain boundary1 aYadav, Sonu1 aKumar, Megha1 aMishra, Rakesh K.0 tCells and development.g2021 June, v. 166 p.203682-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27700x2667-29017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cdev.2021.2036823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245008200204300001600286520158200302592002801884650001901912650002201931650001701953650001901970650002001989650002202009650002102031650001102052650001302063650002402076650002602100650001902126650001602145651001102161700002802172700001902200773014302219856008102362852000902443655001202452IND60681774920221122050606.0200117e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068177492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-018-0199-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUstaoglu, Eda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6874-516210aQuantifying and modelling industrial and commercial land-use demand in France  ap. 519-549.  aDeterminants of industrial/commercial land uses are controversial, and few studies have so far considered the factors influencing industrial and commercial developments. The understanding of such dynamics is important to simulate future land-use demand, which is an essential input for land-use modelling applications. The rigorous estimation of demand for industrial and commercial land is also important to support planning policies and decisions, which aim at allocating scarce land resources efficiently. This study uses regional data from 1990 and 2000 to investigate potential driving factors of industrial/commercial land demand for France, and 2012 data for model validation concerning the projections of land demand. A static model and a change model are specified based on the supply and demand relationship of the regional industrial/commercial land market in France. The estimated models indicate that regional characteristics of location and area, mineral resources and infrastructure, and socio-economic factors are critical to understanding industrial/commercial land developments. From regression analysis, static models show better performance over land-use change models in both the estimation and model validation stages. The change models are biased towards unobserved variables and time-lag effects of the changes in explanatory variables. The use of regression approaches is a valuable tool to explore the factors underlying industrial and commercial expansion at regional level, but their usage for long-term projections is subject to high uncertainties.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aland markets 3aland resources 3aland use change 3amineral resources 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic factors 3asupply balance 3auncertainty 3aFrance1 aBatista e Silva, Filipe1 aLavalle, Carlo0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2020 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.519-549dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0199-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01284naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013800158300002000296520020700316592002800523650001500551650001400566650001300580650001600593700001800609700001700627700001800644700001600662700001700678700001800695700001300713773012400726856007500850852000900925655001200934IND60636172220221123023042.0190505e20170208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063617222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra90007d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qingjun10aCorrection: The polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman response of few-layer and bulk WTe₂ under different excitation wavelengths  ap. 10557-10558.  aCorrection for ‘The polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman response of few-layer and bulk WTe₂ under different excitation wavelengths’ by Qingjun Song et al., RSC Adv., 2016, 6, 103830–103837.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3atellurium 3atungsten 3awavelengths1 aWang, Haifeng1 aXu, Xiaolong1 aPan, Xingchen1 aWang, Yilun1 aSong, Fengqi1 aWan, Xiangang1 aDai, Lun0 tRSC advances.g2017 Feb. 08, v. 7, no. 17 p.10557-10558dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra90007d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002000176245006900196300001500265520140200280592002801682650001301710650002401723650001001747650001301757650001801770650003101788650001501819650001501834650001301849650001901862650001901881650001901900650001401919650001701933700001401950700002201964773015201986856007002138856010102208990002302309852000902332655001202341IND60608457520221119025711.0190510e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060845752DNAL7 a10.3791/544352doi7 aPMC52262072pmcid7 a278423452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawal, Siddarth10aCapture and release of viable circulating tumor cells from blood  ap. e54435.  aWe demonstrate a method for size based capture of viable circulating tumor cell (CTC) from whole blood, along with the release of these cells from chip for downstream analysis and/or culture. The strategy employs the use of a novel Parylene C membrane slot pore microfilter to capture CTC and a coating of poly (N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PIPAAm) for thermoresponsive viable release of the captured CTC. The capture of live cells is enabled by leveraging the design of a slot pore geometry with specific dimensions to reduce the shear stress typically associated with the filtration process. While the microfilter exhibits a high capture efficiency, the release of these cells is non-trivial. Typically, only a small percentage of cells are released when techniques such as reverse flow or cell scraping are used. The strong adhesion of these epithelial cancer cells to the Parylene C membrane is attributable to non-specific electrostatic interaction. To counteract this effect, we employed the use of PIPAAm coating and exploited its thermal responsive interfacial properties to release the cells from the filter. Blood is first filtered at room temperature. Below 32 °C, PIPAAm is hydrophilic. Thereafter, the filter is placed in either culture media or a buffer maintained at 37 °C, which results in the PIPAAm turning hydrophobic, and subsequently releasing the electrostatically bound cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aambient temperature 3ablood 3acoatings 3aculture media 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aepithelium 3afiltration 3ageometry 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3ashear stress1 aAo, Zheng1 aAgarwal, Ashutosh0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Oct. 28, , no. 116 p.e54435-e54435dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/544353Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54435/capture-and-release-of-viable-circulating-tumor-cells-from-blood  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245011000198300001800308506007600326520139800402506003701800650002101837650001601858650001501874650002401889650001001913650002401923650000901947650001401956650001201970650001901982650001502001650002102016650001102037650001402048700001102062700001302073700001402086700001902100700002002119700001402139773017302153852000902326856008302335930003302418946001302451655001202464IND4391683120221207144322.0070523e20070522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439168312DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07016811042doi7 aPMC18855922pmcid7 a174961422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.10aDeletion of PrBP/δ impedes transport of GRK1 and PDE6 catalytic subunits to photoreceptor outer segments  ap. 8857-8862.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mouse Pde6d gene encodes a ubiquitous prenyl binding protein, termed PrBP/δ, of largely unknown physiological function. PrBP/δ was originally identified as a putative rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) subunit in the retina, where it is relatively abundant. To investigate the consequences of Pde6d deletion in retina, we generated a Pde6d⁻/⁻ mouse by targeted recombination. Although manifesting reduced body weight, the Pde6d⁻/⁻ mouse was viable and fertile and its retina developed normally. Immunocytochemistry showed that farnesylated rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) and prenylated rod PDE6 catalytic subunits partially mislocalized in Pde6d⁻/⁻ rods, whereas rhodopsin was unaffected. In Pde6d⁻/⁻ rod single-cell recordings, sensitivity to single photons was increased and saturating flash responses were prolonged. Pde6d⁻/⁻ scotopic paired-flash electroretinograms indicated a delay in recovery of the dark state, likely due to reduced levels of GRK1 in rod outer segments. In Pde6d⁻/⁻ cone outer segments, GRK1 and cone PDE6α' were present at very low levels and the photopic b-wave amplitudes were reduced by 70%. Thus the absence of PrBP/δ in retina impairs transport of prenylated proteins, particularly GRK1 and cone PDE, to rod and cone outer segments, resulting in altered photoreceptor physiology and a phenotype of a slowly progressing rod/cone dystrophy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3abody weight 3acyclic GMP 3aelectroretinography 3agenes 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amice 3aphenotype 3aphotons 3aphotoreceptors 3aphysiology 3aprotein subunits 3aretina 3arhodopsin1 aLi, S.1 aDoan, T.1 aRieke, F.1 aDetwiler, P.B.1 aFrederick, J.M.1 aBaehr, W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 May 22, v. 104, no. 21 p.8857-8862dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07016811043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02675naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009100204300001800295506007600313520130400389506003701693650001001730650002601740650002701766650001701793650002801810650001501838650001901853650001501872650001901887700002501906700002301931773017301954852000902127856008302136930003302219946001302252655001202265IND4391682620221207141124.0070523e20070522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439168262DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07025101042doi7 aPMC18855872pmcid7 a175176562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Ikuko10aPolymerization kinetics of ADP- and ADP-Pi-actin determined by fluorescence microscopy  ap. 8827-8832.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe used fluorescence microscopy to determine how polymerization of Mg-ADP-actin depends on the concentration of phosphate. From the dependence of the elongation rate on the actin concentration and direct observations of depolymerizing filaments, we measured the polymerization rate constants of ADP-actin and ADP-Pi-actin. Saturating phosphate reduces the critical concentration for polymerization of Mg-ADP-actin from 1.8 to 0.06 μM almost entirely by reducing the dissociation rate constants at both ends. Saturating phosphate increases the barbed end association rate constant of Mg-ADP-actin 15%, but this value is still threefold less than that of ATP-actin. Thus, ATP hydrolysis without phosphate dissociation must change the conformation of polymerized actin. Analysis of depolymerization experiments in the presence of phosphate suggests that phosphate dissociation near the terminal subunits is much faster than in the interior. Remarkably, 10 times more phosphate is required to slow the depolymerization of the pointed end than the barbed end, suggesting a weak affinity of phosphate near the pointed end. Our observations of single actin filaments provide clues about the origins of the difference in the critical concentration at the two ends of actin filaments in the presence of ATP.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3adissociation 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrolysis 3amicrofilaments 3aphosphates 3apolymerization1 aVavylonis, Dimitrios1 aPollard, Thomas D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 May 22, v. 104, no. 21 p.8827-8832dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07025101043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02837naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008000204300001800284506007600302520133500378506003701713650001901750650002001769650002201789650001101811650001901822650002701841650001701868700001501885700001701900700001601917700001201933700001701945700001301962700001701975700002001992700001802012700001402030773017302044852000902217856008302226930003302309946001302342655001202355IND4391682320221207143214.0070523e20070522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439168232DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07004801042doi7 aPMC18855842pmcid7 a174961442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaofeng10aRestructuring of the dinucleotide-binding fold in an NADP(H) sensor protein  ap. 8809-8814.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNAD(P) has long been known as an essential energy-carrying molecule in cells. Recent data, however, indicate that NAD(P) also plays critical signaling roles in regulating cellular functions. The crystal structure of a human protein, HSCARG, with functions previously unknown, has been determined to 2.4-Å resolution. The structure reveals that HSCARG can form an asymmetrical dimer with one subunit occupied by one NADP molecule and the other empty. Restructuring of its NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold upon NADP binding changes an extended loop to an α-helix to restore the integrity of the Rossmann fold. The previously unobserved restructuring suggests that HSCARG may assume a resting state when the level of NADP(H) is normal within the cell. When the NADP(H) level passes a threshold, an extensive restructuring of HSCARG would result in the activation of its regulatory functions. Immunofluorescent imaging shows that HSCARG redistributes from being associated with intermediate filaments in the resting state to being dispersed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The structural change of HSCARG upon NADP(H) binding could be a new regulatory mechanism that responds only to a significant change of NADP(H) levels. One of the functions regulated by HSCARG may be argininosuccinate synthetase that is involved in NO synthesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3acrystal structure 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aintermediate filaments 3anitric oxide1 aDai, Xueyu1 aZhao, Yanmei1 aChen, Qiang1 aLu, Fei1 aYao, Deqiang1 aYu, Quan1 aLiu, Xinping1 aZhang, Chuanmao1 aGu, Xiaocheng1 aLuo, Ming0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 May 22, v. 104, no. 21 p.8809-8814dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07004801043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070523b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02289naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013700127300001600264300002200280500002300302520122100325650001601546650001701562650001301579650002301592650002301615650002001638650003001658650001701688651001001705653002301715700001801738700001401756773009201770852000901862939003301871946001101904655001201915IND9300383020221118190218.0930121e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930038302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasimike, M.10aHabitat preference and seasonal variations of phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera, Psychodidae) in Marigat area, Baringo District, Kenya  ap. 307-314.  ap. 307-314. maps.  aSummary in French.  aA number of natural and man-made habitats in Marigat area of Kenya were surveyed for sandflies in 1985/86. Of the 98,573 adult sandflies collected, 2.7 % belonged to the genus Phlebotomus and 97.3% to Sergentomyia. Relative abundance of sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus was four times higher in burrows than in termite hills, while sandflies of the genus Sergentomyia collected from termite hills were twice as numerous as those from burrows. Termite hills had the highest sandfly population compared to other sites, followed by tree holes and animal burrows. Fifteen species were identified, of which have belonged to Phlebotomus and 10 to Sergentomyia. The most abundant and widespread species were Sergentomyia antennatus, S. bedfordi, S. ingrami, Phlebotomus martini, S. schweitzi, S. africanus and P. duboscqi. Sandflies of both genera were present for the greater part of the year. Most species of sandflies decreased in numbers during the dry season. High population densities of sandflies were recorded during the wet period. Correlations between relative abundance of sandfly vectors of leishmaniases and rainfall were positive. However, none of the correlation coefficients was statistically significant. 3aPhlebotomus 3aSergentomyia 3ahabitats 3apopulation density 3aseasonal variation 3adisease vectors 3ageographical distribution 3ainsect traps 3aKenya 0aseasonal abundance1 aMutinga, M.J.1 aKumar, R.0 tInsect science and its application.g1992 June, v. 13, no. 3 p.307-314x0191-90407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02340naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014900126300001600275300002100291500019700312500002300509520118300532650002001715650001301735650001601748650001801764650002101782650002501803650001601828650001601844773008901860852000901949939003301958946001101991655001202002IND9206482420221118185731.0921023s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920648242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbata, K.J.10aFood plant preferences and spatial dispersion patterns of the armoured ground cricket, Acanthoplus speiseri Brancsik (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae)  ap. 635-639.  ap. 635-639. ill.  aSpecial issue: Aspects of pest management in relation to agricultural production and environmental conservation in Africa / edited by A.M.

The average numbers of the ground cricket found feeding on each food plant per transect in each of the three study areas were tested for differences at the 0.05 level of probability by Duncan's multiple range test. The variance/mean ratio (S2/X) was used to analyse spatial dispersion patterns. A. speiseri fed on 12 plant species from the Compositeae, Gramineae and Solanaceae families. Hyparrhenia nyassae (Rendle) Stapf., (Gramineae) and Rottboelia exaltata Linn. f., (Gramineae), were the most preferred food plants. The armoured ground cricket densities on the two food plants were insignificantly different from each other. The cultivated plants, Zea mays L., and Sorghum vulgare Pers., were fed upon opportunistically by the ground crickets. The variance/mean ratio identified aggregation in the armoured ground cricket populations in all three study areas (S2/X > 1, P < 0.001). The significance of the findings on food plant preferences and dispersion patterns are discussed in relation to future sampling and control of A. speiseri. 3aSorghum bicolor 3aZea mays 3acrop damage 3aTettigoniidae 3ahost preferences 3aspatial distribution 3ahost plants 3aplant pests0 tInsect science and its application.g1991, v. 12, no. 5/6 p.635-639x0191-90407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02374naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007400128300001600202300002100218500024000239500002300479500001500502520114800517650002201665650002001687650001601707650001601723650001301739650001501752650001001767653002401777653001001801700001701811700001801828773008901846852000901935939003301944946001101977655001201988IND9205699220221118185756.0920914s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920569922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaladde, S.M.10aSensory biology of Chilo spp. with specific reference to C. partellus  ap. 593-602.  ap. 593-602. ill.  aSpecial issue: Tropical stem borers of graminaceous crops: a new synthesis / edited by K.N.

The larval and adult antennae of this insect have hygro/thermosensitive sensilla equipped with receptor cells sensitive to minute changes in temperature. Inputs through those cells may partly be responsible for the light evasive and other light/temperature dependent behaviour patterns. The grooved basiconic sensilla especially those found on the male antennae are sensitive to the female sex pheromone components of C. partellus. Host-plant odours are most likely perceived by one or two of the other antennal olfactory sensilla, namely the smooth-surfaced basiconica and coeloconica sensilla. Chilo partellus moths have a limited number of gustatory sensilla on the tarsi, ovipositor, antennae and the proboscis. Electrophysiological bioassays done on the ovipositor and tarsal sensilla are discussed. Similar tests on the larval maxillary styloconica sensilla showed that the lateral and medial sensilla differed in their sensitivity. Their taste receptor cells can detect differences between saps from susceptible and resistant host-plants. 3asensory receptors 3aChilo partellus 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3asensilla 3apheromones 3aodors 0aBiological Sciences 0aChilo1 aKahoro, H.M.1 aOchieng, S.A.0 tInsect science and its application.g1990, v. 11, no. 4/5 p.593-602x0191-90407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01639naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007800128300001600206300002100222500024000243500002300483500002300506500001500529520037400544650001300918650002000931650002200951650001400973650002600987650001401013650002001027653002401047653001701071653002301088773008901111852000901200939003301209946001101242655001201253IND9205699520221118185741.0920914s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920569952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeuschner, K.12aA review of laboratory and field screening procedures for Chilo partellus  ap. 627-638.  ap. 627-638. ill.  aSpecial issue: Tropical stem borers of graminaceous crops: a new synthesis / edited by K.N.

In steamed soil (25 C, -100 or -500 kPa matric potential), strain 2-79RN10 maintained its initial high populations (approximately 3 X 10(4) or 3 X 10(7) cfu/g of soil) over a 14-day period, and significantly reduced hyphal radius, hyphal density, and recoverable numbers of propagules of ThzId1. In raw soil under similar environmental conditions (22-25 C, -10 to -1,000 kPa), populations of 2-79RN10 decreased by approximately four log10 units over a 3-wk period, and did not affect the ability of Trichoderma spp. to colonize sclerotia of Sclerotinia selerotiorum. In two years of field experiments using raw or steamed soil in microplots, populations of 2-79RN10 decreased gradually after 1-2 wk and did not reduce the ability of Trichoderma spp. to colonize sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Colonization of sclerotia by Trichoderma spp. after 9 wk was significantly higher in steamed soil (mean = 65%) than in raw soil (mean = 30%) when THzID1 was added, suggesting possible inhibition of THzID1 by indigenous soil microbes, or utilization by ThzId1 of nutrients released by steaming of soil. In treatments where ThzId1 was not added, low levels of colonization of sclerotia were observed, apparently due to indigenous Trichoderma spp., and these levels were higher in raw soil (mean = 18%) than in steamed soil (mean = 5%). These results suggest that under certain restrictive conditions, high population levels of antagonistic bacteria in bulk soil suppressed a fungal biocontrol agent, but that this suppressive effect was reduced or eliminated when a high bacterial population was not present. 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3asclerotia 3ahyphae 3asoil 3aTrichoderma lixii 3ainfection 0aHypocrea lixii 0aantagonism 0agrowth rate1 aKnudsen, G.R.1 aEschen, D.J.0 tPhytopathology.g1991 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.994-1000x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02193naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010800129300001800237500001500255520109900270650002301369650001601392650001301408650001301421650002001434650003701454650001401491650002201505650001001527650001001537650001301547653002901560653002701589653001501616700001901631773009201650852000901742939003301751946001101784655001201795IND9104504420221118185656.0911112e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerschbach, C.10aInfluence of glutathione (GSH) on sulphate influx, xylem loading and exudation in excised tobacco roots  ap. 1021-1029.  a2019-12-04  aIn short-term experiments sulphate influx of excised tobacco roots (Nicotiana tabacum L. var. 'Samsun') followed monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an approximate Km of 12 plus or minus 4 micromole and Vmax of 657 plus or minus 211 nmol g-1 FW h-1. An inhibition of sulphate influx, xylem loading and exudation of more than 70% was achieved with 0.1 mM GSH within 1 h. Cysteine was two orders of magnitude more effective as an inhibitor than GSH. An inhibition of more than 75% was already obtained with 1.0 micromolar cysteine. It may, therefore, be assumed that GSH is decomposed to yield cysteine concentrations that may inhibit sulphate influx, xylem loading and exudation. When BSO, a specific inhibitor of the initial step of GSH synthesis, was added, cysteine-mediated inhibition on sulphate influx, xylem loading and exudation was strongly diminished. Apparently, GSH synthesis is required to obtain inhibition of these processes by cysteine. The physiological mechanisms that may cause the inhibition of sulphate influx, xylem loading and exudation by glutathione are discussed. 3anutrient transport 3aglutathione 3asulfates 3aexplants 3anutrient uptake 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aexudation 3aNicotiana tabacum 3axylem 3aroots 3acysteine 0aorganic sulfur compounds 0abuthionine sulfoximine 0ainhibition1 aRennenberg, H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1991 Aug., v. 42, no. 241 p.1021-1029x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03233naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010600126300001800232520221800250650001902468650001402487650002002501650002302521650001802544650001002562650001602572650000802588650001402596650002002610650001202630653001102642653001102653700001902664700001902683773009202702852000902794939003302803946001102836655001202847IND9104504520221118185641.0911112e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, P.J.10aEffects of growth and assay temperatures on unidirectional K+ fluxes in roots of rye (Secale cereale)  ap. 1031-1041.  aThe effects of growth and assay temperature on unidirectional K+ fluxes in excised roots of rye (Secale cereale cv. Rheidol) were studied using 86Rb+ as a tracer. Both K+ influx to the vacuole, estimated as K+ uptake between 3 and 12 h after transfer of unlabelled roots to radioactive solution, and movement of K+ to the xylem were determined directly. Other fluxes were determined on excised roots of plants, which had been labelled with 86Rb+ since germination, by conventional triple exponential efflux analysis. When assayed at 20 degrees C, roots of plants previously grown at 20 degrees C (WG roots) had lower rates of net K+ uptake than roots of low temperature-acclimated plants, grown with a temperature diferential between roots (8 degrees C) and shoots (20 degrees C) either since germination (DG roots) or for 3 d prior to experiments (DT roots). This resulted from a greater unidirectional K+ efflux across the plasma membrane and a reduced K+ flux to the xylem in WG roots, compared to DG or DT roots, rather than a decrease in unidirectional K+ influx or a decrease in the net K+ flux to the vacuole. Indeed, although WG roots had lower rates of K+ influx and K+ efflux across the tonoplast at 20 degrees C than DG or DT roots, roots of plants from all growth temperature treatments showed an equivalent net K+ flux to the vacuole. Although all unidirectional K+ fluxes in roots from plants grown under all temperature regimes were reduced by lowering the temperature of the root, these fluxes were differentially affected in roots of plants from contrasting growth temperature treatments. Rapid cooling to 8 degrees C of WG roots resulted in a lower rate of K+ influx and a transient increase in K+ efflux across both the plasma membrane and tonoplast, compared to DG and DT roots. Furthermore, since the K+ flux to the xylem was lower in WG roots, the net K+ uptake at 8 degrees C into WG roots was considerably reduced compared to DG and DT roots. These results suggest that low temperature-acclimation of K+ fluxes in rye roots may involve a reduction in the temperature sensitivity of K+ influx and a curtailment of K+ efflux across both the plasma membrane and tonoplast at low temperatures. 3aSecale cereale 3apotassium 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient transport 3aion transport 3axylem 3atemperature 3asap 3atonoplast 3aplasma membrane 3acooling 0aefflux 0ainflux1 aEarnshaw, M.J.1 aClarkson, D.T.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1991 Aug., v. 42, no. 241 p.1031-1041x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001600218500001500234520153700249650002701786650002201813650002001835650002101855650001801876650002501894650001201919650001801931650002201949650001901971650001301990650001202003650002202015650001302037650001402050650002002064651001902084653002102103653001902124653002002143700001502163773007302178852000902251939003302260946001302293655001202306IND9104505320221118184818.0911118e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, J.R.10aSoils suppressive to black root rot of burley tobacco, caused by Thielaviopsis basicola  ap. 946-954.  a2019-12-04  aSoils suppressive to black root rot were detected in fields in which the pathogen was present but in which little or no disease had developed on susceptible cultivars of burley tobacco. Suppressive soils were characterized by low base saturation, low calcium, exchangeable aluminum levels of 1 meq/100 g of soil or higher, and soil pH less than 5. Suppressiveness was confirmed under controlled environmental conditions with fumigated field soils reinfested with Thielaviopsis basicola. Isolates of T. basicola from suppressive soils caused black root rot when placed in conducive soil, indicating that the absence of disease was not due to differences in pathogen virulence. The mechanism of suppression was not biotic; autoclaving soil had no effect on suppressiveness, and transfer of suppressive soil to conducive soil (fumigated soil; 1:9, by volume) did not induce suppressiveness. Soil calcium level was not the mechanism of suppression because amending suppressive soils with calcium hydroxide nullified suppressiveness and amending soils with calcium sulfate did not. Disease developed in acidified conducive soil only if exchangeable aluminum levels were low. The acidification treatments had no effect on the inoculum density of the fungus, and the survival of the chlamydospores of T. basicola was not affected by the soil or soil treatments. Mechanisms of soil suppression to black root rot on burley tobacco are abiotic and dependent on the interrelationships among soil pH, base saturation, and exchangeable aluminum. 3aThielaviopsis basicola 3asuppressive soils 3abase saturation 3aaluminum sulfate 3aacidification 3aexchangeable cations 3acalcium 3apathogenicity 3aNicotiana tabacum 3achlamydospores 3aaluminum 3asoil pH 3acalcium hydroxide 3aroot rot 3amortality 3acalcium sulfate 3aNorth Carolina 0asoil fungistasis 0asoil chemistry 0asoil acidulants1 aShew, H.D.0 tPhytopathology.g1991 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.946-954x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02140naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007200125300001800197500001500215520107100230650001801301650001001319650001101329650002001340650001801360650002001378650001701398650001301415653000901428653001101437653002901448653001901477653002301496653001101519653001001530700001601540700001701556773009201573852000901665939003301674946001101707655001201718IND9104505120221118184850.0911112e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAung, L.H.14aThe abscisic acid content of citrus with special reference to lemon  ap. 1083-1088.  a2019-12-04  aFree and conjugated abscisic acid (ABA) in the fruit peel of four species of citrus and their distribution in the various reproductive organs of Citrus limon L. cv.

Design-based stereological methods were used for the estimation of various leaf anatomical characteristics such as mesophyll volume, proportion of intercellular spaces, number of mesophyll cells, mean mesophyll cell volume, and internal leaf surface area. The structure of the mesophyll was more affected by different levels of PPFD than were the stomatal characteristics. Increased PPFD produced thicker leaves with a larger mesophyll volume having a higher number of less elongated mesophyll cells and a larger internal leaf surface area. 3amicroscopy 3aintercellular spaces 3aHordeum vulgare 3alight intensity 3astomata 3amesophyll 0aplant anatomy 0aepidermis 0astomatal frequency 0astereological microscopy0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1991 Aug., v. 42, no. 241 p.999-1001x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245015000122300001600272520154200288650002301830650002501853650004201878650001401920650002301934650001701957650001901974650003201993650002302025650002602048650002402074653002402098653001202122700001802134700001802152773010102170852000902271939003302280946001102313655001202324IND9104503520221118185248.0911112e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, J.10aUltrastructural responses of vessel contact cells in cotton plants resistant or susceptible to infection by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum  ap. 211-222.  aWhen vascular elements of cotton plants became infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum, contact parenchyma cells surrounding the initially infected vessels responded with changes in their ultrastructural characteristics that could be categorized into three groups. In one group, contact cells were invaded by the fungus and rapidly disintegrated within 24 h after inoculation. In the second group, the cytoplasm in contact cells degenerated within 48 h after inoculation but without apparent hyphal invasion. The evidence suggests that this cytoplasmic degeneration may represent a type of defence response. In the third group, which comprised the majority of contact cells, the cytoplasm remained uninvaded and appeared healthy after inoculation; however, it showed ultrastructural evidence of cytoplasmic reorganization and increased metabolic activity that resulted in the deposition of a complex wall apposition, as well as the development of osmiophilic droplets in the cytoplasm and their apparent secretion through the plasmalemma into the apposition layers and vessel lumens. Lateral colonization by the fungus into the vascular parenchyma cells in both cvs Seabrook Sea Island SBSI and Rowden seemed to be prevented by these cellular responses. The responses, however, were produced faster and were more pronounced in the contact cells of the resistant cultivar than in the susceptible cultivar. Thus is appears that quantitative differences in these reactions may contribute to the degree of resistance to Fusarium. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aGossypium barbadense 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3apathogenesis 3ahistopathology 3ahost-parasite relationships 3adefense mechanisms 3aplant vascular system 3avarietal resistance 0acell ultrastructure 0avessels1 aMueller, W.C.1 aBeckman, C.H.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1991 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.211-222x0885-57657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03370naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001600166245011300182300001600295500002400311500001500335520197900350650002402329650001102353650003002364650003002394650001502424650002402439650001202463650002302475653004002498653002902538653001002567700001602577700001602593700001502609700001402624773009602638852000902734856008802743930003302831945002502864946001102889655001202900IND4431368720221118185242.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF8221 aXiang, M.C.10aDetection and quantification of the nematophagous fungus Hirsutella minnesotensis in soil with real-time PCR  ap. 170-175.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify in soil the fungus Hirsutella minnesotensis, an important parasite of secondary-stage juvenile (J2) of the soybean cyst nematode. A primer pair 5′-GGGAGGCCCGGTGGA-3′ and 5′-TGATCCGAGGTCAACTTCTGAA-3′ and a TaqMan probe 5′-CGTCCGCCGTAAAACGCCCAAC-3′ were designed based on the sequence of the ITS region of the rRNA gene. The primers were highly species-specific. The PCR reaction system was very sensitive and able to detect as few as 4conidiag⁻¹ soil. Regression analysis showed similar slopes and efficiency on DNA from pure culture (y =−3.587x +41.017, R ² =0.9971, E =0.9055) and from Logconidiag⁻¹ soil (y =−3.855x +37.669, R ² =0.9139, E =0.8172), indicating that the real-time PCR protocol can reliably quantify H. minnesotensis in the soil. The real-time PCR assay was applied to 20 soil samples from soybean fields, and compared with a parasitism assay. The real-time PCR assay detected H. minnesotensis in six of the soils, whereas the parasitism assay detected H. minnesotensis in the same six soils and three additional soils. The real-time PCR assay was weakly correlated (R ² =0.49) with the percentage of parasitized J2 in the six soils, indicating that different types of soil may interfere the efficiency of the real-time PCR assay, possibly due to the effect of soil types on efficacy of DNA extraction. The parasitism assay appeared to be more sensitive than real-time PCR in detecting presence of H. minnesotensis, but real-time PCR was much faster and less costly and provided a direct assessment of fungal biomass. Using the two assays in combination can obtain more complete information about the fungus in soil than either assay alone. Hirsutella parasitism was widespread and detected in 13 of the 20 field soils, indicating that these fungi may contribute to suppressiveness of soybean cyst nematode in nature and likely have high biological control potential for the nematode. 3aHeterodera glycines 3aassays 3abiological control agents 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aHirsutella 3anematophagous fungi 3abiomass 3abiological control 0areal-time polymerase chain reaction 0aHirsutella minnesotensis 0afungi1 aXiang, P.A.1 aJiang, X.Z.1 aDuan, W.J.1 aLiu, X.Z.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.170-175dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.12.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd8CTe2010/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02141naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110072002000130072002000150100002100170245011100191300001600302520119700318650000901515650001101524650002101535650001701556650001201573650002301585650002301608653002101631700001901652700002001671773007801691852000901769946001301778655001201791IND4412644320221118184027.0081118s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441264432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Although originally suspected to be a phenotypic anomaly related to genetic modifications, nontransgenic littermates subsequently were affected with equal frequency, inculpating the FVB/NHsd founder colony. The masses were subcutaneous, soft, and exophytic and appeared over the course of a few weeks. Female mice were affected more frequently than males. Gross examination revealed the masses to consist of uni- or bilateral hernias of variable size, occasionally containing small or large intestine (or both), cecum, mesenteric adipose tissue, male reproductive organs, and ureters. All hernial sacs pouched through the femoral triangle laterally to the femoral vessels and therefore were classified as lateral femoral hernias. Lateral femoral hernias have not previously been described in the veterinary literature and have never been described as background lesions in a strain of mice. Our findings suggest likely genetic drift in this strain of FVB/NHsd mice, causing a background lesion that confounded phenotypic analyses of transgenic mice derived from this strain. 3amice 3ahernia 3alesions (animal) 3ainbred lines 3astrains 3agenetic background 3alaboratory animals 0afemoral triangle1 aPenney, Janice1 aBoerboom, Derek0 tComparative medicine.g2008 Aug., v. 58, no. 4 p.395-398x1532-08207nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02518naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245012100154300001800275520132100293650001201614650001101626650001801637650001501655650002601670650002701696650002201723650001201745650001901757650001501776653002201791653001601813700001501829700001701844773010201861852000901963856007701972930003302049945001302082946001302095655001202108IND2053352120221118184238.0961002e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205335212DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950592i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, J.G.10aQuantitative measurement of fiber fractions of cool- and warm-season grass herbage using cell-wall-degrading enzymes  ap. 1475-1482.  aQuantitative in vitro methods using commercial cellulase (CEL), pectinase (PECT), and hemicellulase (HCEL) preparations were developed to simplify prediction of digestibility of cool- and warm-season forage grasses. Samples of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L. var. Pennlate), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. var. KY 31) (cool-season grasses), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman var. NY 1145), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. var. KY 1625) (warm-season grasses) were taken at advancing stages of maturity. Isolated cell-wall material (CWM) was prepared by repetitively extracting lyophilized, ground tissue with aqueous and organic solvents. Relative solubilities of CWM digested individually with CEL, HCEL, or PECT were 100:30:40, respectively. When enzyme preparations were used sequentially, the influence of CEL, HCEL, and PECT on CWM solubility depended on the order in which the enzyme preparations occurred in the sequence. The fraction of CWM solubilized with CEL was similar to that obtained when CWM was digested with CEL, HCEL, and PECT simultaneously. Solubilities of cell-wall material in unfractionated tissues digested with CEL were comparable to those of corresponding CWM digested with CEL; thus, the laborious steps required for isolation of cell-wall material can be avoided. 3agrasses 3aforage 3afiber content 3acell walls 3aquantitative analysis 3ain vitro digestibility 3apolygalacturonase 3aseasons 3asolubilization 3acellulases 0acool-season grass 0ahemicellase1 aTodd, J.R.1 aFissel, G.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1475-1482x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950592i3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03628naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245012600132300001600258520243900274650002202713650001902735650001102754650002502765650001302790650001702803650002202820650001702842650001602859650001702875650002202892650001802914653001702932700002002949700001902969700001602988773014803004852000903152930003303161945001303194946001103207655001203218IND2037686620221118184221.0940304e19930301ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203768662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoulougliotis, D.10aEvidence for CN- binding at the PS II non-heme Fe2+. Effects on the EPR signal for Q-AFe2+ and on QA/QB electron transfer  ap. 275-282.  aEarlier studies have demonstrated that NO binds to the non-heme iron of the PS II ferroquinone complex in competition with the physiological ligand CO2/HCO3- (Petrouleas, V. and Diner, B.A. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1015, 131-140; Diner, B.A. and Petrouleas, V. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1015, 141-149). We examine in this paper the effect of cyanide, also a potential iron chelator. Competition experiments involving CN- and NO show that 50 mM CN- at pH 6.5 eliminates the EPR signal at g = 4 arising from the Fe2+-NO adduct. Illumination of CN(-)-treated PS II preparations under conditions which induce single charge separation produces a new EPR signal at g = 1.98. The temperature and power dependence indicate that this signal is directly or indirectly associated with a transition metal species. The signal is produced with undiminished intensity upon illumination in the presence of hydroxylamine as an exogenous electron donor and of DCMU, indicating that it originates from an acceptor side species prior to the DCMU block. Upon successive one-electron charge separations the g = 1.98 signal oscillates with period of two. These results strongly suggest that the g = 1.98 signal originates from the state Q(A)- Fe2+. An approximate titration of the g = 1.98 signal development as a function of the total cyanide concentration at pH 6.5 indicates a kd of 50-80 mM, significantly higher than the kd for cyanide-NO competition, estimated to be in the range of 10 mM. It is likely that, while displacement of NO requires the binding of one cyanide molecule, development of the modified Q(A)-Fe2+ signal at g = 1.98 requires the binding of more than one cyanide molecules. The kinetics of the fluorescence relaxation following saturating flashes show only subtle differences over the concentration range at which cyanide displaces NO and probably bicarbonate as well. Treatment with higher concentrations of cyanide at pH 6.5 causes an inversion in the phase of the oscillation pattern that characterizes the decay of the fluorescence yield. The latter effect becomes more pronounced at higher pH levels. The absence of a slowing of the fluorescence relaxation in the presence of cyanide may indicate that CN- can fulfill the same role as bicarbonate, perhaps in promoting proton transfer coupled to interquinone electron transfer. Only the relative rates of the two interquinone electron transfer reactions are reversed. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotosystem II 3aanions 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aquinones 3aspectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 3anitric oxide 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aelectron transfer 3abinding sites 0aferrous ions1 aKostopoulos, T.1 aPetrouleas, V.1 aDiner, B.A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Mar. 1, v. 1141, no. 2/3 p.275-282x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle04259naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001800184245010400202300001600306500002400322500001500346520226800361650002102629650001002650650001402660650002702674650002202701650002102723650002102744650001902765650001302784650002402797650002302821650001602844650002202860650001402882650001502896651001102911653001102922653001902933700001602952700001302968700001502981700001802996700002003014700001503034700001503049700001703064700001703081700001603098700001403114700001603128700001503144700001803159700001603177700001503193700001403208700001703222773010803239852000903347856008803356930003303444945002503477946001103502655001203513IND4431365820140725000000.0100115e20100205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.04.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK001 0aF300 0aF6001 aDe Frenne, P.10aSignificant effects of temperature on the reproductive output of the forest herb Anemone nemorosa L  ap. 809-817.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aClimate warming is already influencing plant migration in different parts of the world.

This study focuses on the effect of temperature on sexual reproductive output (number of seeds, seed mass, germination percentage and seedling mass) of Anemone nemorosa L., a model species for slow colonizing herbaceous forest plants. We sampled seeds of A. nemorosa in populations along a 2400km latitudinal gradient from northern France to northern Sweden during three growing seasons (2005, 2006 and 2008). This study design allowed us to isolate the effects of accumulated temperature (Growing Degree Hours; GDH) from latitude and the local abiotic and biotic environment. Germination and seed sowing trials were performed in incubators, a greenhouse and under field conditions in a forest. Finally, we disentangled correlations between the different reproductive traits of A. nemorosa along the latitudinal gradient. We found a clear positive relationship between accumulated temperature and seed and seedling traits: reproductive output of A. nemorosa improved with increasing GDH along the latitudinal gradient. Seed mass and seedling mass, for instance, increased by 9.7% and 10.4%, respectively, for every 1000°Ch increase in GDH. We also derived strong correlations between several seed and seedling traits both under field conditions and in incubators. Our results indicate that seed mass, incubator-based germination percentage (Germ%Inc) and the output of germinable seeds (product of number of seeds and Germ%Inc divided by 100) from plants grown along a latitudinal gradient (i.e. at different temperature regimes) provide valuable proxies to parameterize key population processes in models. We conclude that (1) climate warming may have a pronounced positive impact on sexual reproduction of A. nemorosa and (2) climate models forecasting plant distributions would benefit from including the temperature sensitivity of key seed traits and population processes. 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3aseedlings 3ageographical variation 3aherbaceous plants 3aAnemone nemorosa 3aclimatic factors 3aglobal warming 3alatitude 3asexual reproduction 3aplant reproduction 3atemperature 3aseed productivity 3aheat sums 3aunderstory 3aEurope 0atraits 0aclimate change1 aGraae, B.J.1 aKolb, A.1 aBrunet, J.1 aChabrerie, O.1 aCousins, S.A.O.1 aDecocq, G.1 aDhondt, R.1 aDiekmann, M.1 aEriksson, O.1 aHeinken, T.1 aHermy, M.1 aJõgar, Ü.1 aSaguez, R.1 aShevtsova, A.1 aStanton, S.1 aZindel, R.1 aZobel, M.1 aVerheyen, K.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Feb. 5, v. 259, no. 4 p.809-817dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.04.0383Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013700129300001600266520144600282650002201728650001801750650001501768650001901783650001601802650001701818650002901835653002101864653000901885653002001894653002101914700002101935773014801956852000902104930003302113945001302146946001102159655001202170IND2037686420221118184204.0940304e19930301ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203768642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreasson, E.10aHeterogeneity in photosystem I--the larger antenna of photosystem I alpha is due to functional connection to a special pool of LHCII  ap. 175-182.  aThylakoids from spinach were fragmented by sonication and separated by aqueous two-phase partitioning into grana originating vesicles (alpha vesicles) and stroma membrane originating vesicles (beta vesicles) (Andreasson et al. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 936, 339-350). PS I alpha and PS I beta were isolated from these two vesicle populations respectively, and their properties were compared. PS I alpha contains more of light harvesting complex II (LHCII) than PS I beta. The LHCII is functionally connected to PS I, a connection which is abolished by addition of octyl glucoside. The grana-derived alpha vesicles were further fragmented by sonication and separated by aqueous two-phase partitioning into vesicles enriched in margins and vesicles enriched in PS II alpha from the center of the grana. By non-denaturating isoelectric focusing it was found that the LHCII pattern of PS I alpha was almost identical to that of LHCII of the margin enriched vesicles but very different from that of LHCII associated with PS II alpha. It is concluded that: (1) PS I alpha (originating from grana membranes) has a larger functional antenna size than PS I beta (originating from stroma membranes) because of association with LHCII; (2) PS I alpha is located in the periphery of the grana (margins and end membranes) and associated with a different pool of LHCII compared to that associated with PS II alpha of the more central core of the grana. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotosystem I 3athylakoids 3aplant proteins 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3alight harvesting complex 0areaction centers 0ap700 0agrana membranes 0astroma membranes1 aAlbertsson, P.A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Mar. 1, v. 1141, no. 2/3 p.175-182x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01368naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008800130300001500218520040600233650001900639650002000658650001500678650002000693650001500713650001400728650002900742650001700771653001600788700001400804773014600818852000900964930003300973945001301006946001101019655001201030IND2037697520221118183745.0940307e19930816ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203769752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruszecki, W.I.10aLHCII, the major light-harvesting pigment-protein complex is a zeaxanthin epoxidase  ap. 97-101.  aSeveral experiments are presented indicating that LHCII, the major light-harvesting pigment-protein complex of Photosystem II isolated from rye leaves, exhibits properties of an enzyme catalyzing the epoxidation of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin.

Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide. 3ageographical distribution 3aforest trees 3ageographical variation 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3aheat stress 3aglobal warming 3ainformation 3aforest ecosystems 3atree mortality 3aforest health 0aliterature reviews 0aclimate change1 aMacalady, Alison K.1 aChenchouni, Haroun1 aBachelet, Dominique1 aMcDowell, Nate1 aVennetier, Michel1 aKitzberger, Thomas1 aRigling, Andreas1 aBreshears, David D.1 aHogg, E.H.

The current study was conducted to examine the objective and subjective carcass and meat quality traits of cattle fed diets containing corn or wheat (20% or 40%) DDGS (DM basis) as compared to a standard barley-based finishing diet (control). In general, meat obtained from animals fed the barley-based control diet was slightly darker in colour (lower chroma and hue at 24h, P <0.01) and less tender (highest proportion of tough shears at 2d and lowest proportion of tender shears at 20d). Meat from corn DDGS was rated as more tender and palatable than control samples (P <0.05), and 20% corn samples were rated better for beef flavour intensity (P <0.01) and desirability (P <0.05) than 40% corn DDGS samples. In contrast, meat from steers fed wheat DDGS showed intermediate characteristics between steers fed control and corn DDGS diets. Hence, feeding wheat DDGS had no negative effects, and feeding corn DDGS had some positive effects on meat quality characteristics of beef. 3abeef carcasses 3abarley 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3acattle feeding 3aoff flavors 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3acarcass yield 3abeef quality 3abeef cattle 3awheat 3acorn 3acarcass weight 3asteers 3ameat tenderness 3alongissimus muscle 3adistillers grains 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCadaver 2aCattle 2aEdible Grain. 2aColor 2aHordeum 2aHumans 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aMuscle, Skeletal 2aPoaceae 2aSolubility 2aStress, Mechanical 2aTaste 2aTriticum 2aZea mays 0afeed grains 0alongissimus dorsi 0aflavor1 aAalhus, J.L.1 aDugan, M.E.R.1 aRobertson, W.M.1 aMcAllister, T.A.1 aWalter, L.J.1 aMcKinnon, J.J.0 tMeat science.g2010 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.569-577dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.10.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20100310b20100403c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02442naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245004800145300001600193500001500209520079400224650001601018650002501034650000701059650001301066650002001079650001801099650002401117650005301141650004501194650001801239650007801257650002101335650003101356650001301387650002101400650002801421650002201449650001901471653001701490653002501507653001201532653002801544700001601572700001801588700002201606700001501628700002101643773014601664852000901810930003301819945001301852946001101865655001201876IND2038122320221118184125.0940322e19930807ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203812232DNAL7 a83937092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumner, I.G.10aKinetic analysis of papaya proteinase omega  ap. 243-251.  a2019-12-05  aPapaya proteinase omega (ppomega) has been purified from dried latex both by immunoaffinity and traditional methods. Kinetic analysis revealed that (1), the ppomega-catalysed hydrolysis of N-benzoyl-l-arginine p-nitroanilide (BApNA) has a lower specificity (kcat/Km) than the same reaction catalysed by papain; (2), the ppomega-catalysed hydrolysis of a tripeptide substrate having phenylalanine at the second position (S2-site) showed a more similar specificity to that catalysed by papain; (3), the significant difference between the two enzymes is that steady state kinetics with both l-BApNA and a tripeptide enables the identification in ppomega of other ionizations affecting binding. The active sites of papain and ppomega can therefore be distinguished by pH-dependence of kcat/Km. 3aproteinases 3aamino acid sequences 3apH 3akinetics 3aenzyme activity 3aCarica papaya 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntibodiesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aBenzoylarginine Nitroanilidexmetabolism 2aBinding Sites 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLatexxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPapainxchemistry 2aPlant Proteins 0apurification 0an-terminal sequences 0apawpaws 0amolecular sequence data1 aVaughan, A.1 aEisenthal, R.1 aPickersgill, R.W.1 aOwen, A.J.1 aGoodenough, P.W.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Aug. 7, v. 1164, no. 3 p.243-251x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02057naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245019300126300001600319520107200335650002201407650001801429650001601447650002201463700001801485700002201503700001801525773014601543852000901689930003301698945001301731946001101744655001201755IND2037593520221118184102.0940301e19930705ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203759352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, I.H.10aModulation analysis of the electron spin echo signals of in vivo oxidised primary donor 14N chlorophyll centres in bacterial, P870 and P960, and plant Photosystem I, P700, reaction centres  ap. 183-189.  aThe primary donors of two structurally characterised photosynthetic bacterial reaction centres, P870+ from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and P960+ from Rhodopseudomonas viridis, and the spinach Photosystem I primary donor P700+ were studied by electron spin echo modulation. The values obtained for the in vivo isotropic hyperfine interaction, a(iso), were considerably smaller than literature reports from in vitro studies. The results for P960+ and P870+ are in accord with data from other spectroscopic techniques and reveal that the electron is more localised in one half of the chlorophyll dimer with a ratio of 2:1. Damping of the modulations was most severe for P960+, which interacts with the non-haem iron of the reaction centre as well as a donor cytochrome, cyt c. The reduced hyperfine interactions obtained for P700+ indicate that P700+ is either a chlorophyll dimer with the electron extensively localised on one of the chlorophyll pair with a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1, depending on which of the published values of a(iso) for chlorophyll a+ is used, or a monomer. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotosystem I 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transfer1 aHeathcote, P.1 aMacLaughlan, D.J.1 aEvans, M.C.W.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 July 5, v. 1143, no. 2 p.183-189x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02611naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012800128300001600256500001500272520152300287650001501810650002201825650002101847650001901868650001601887650002401903653001701927653001801944653001801962700001601980700001401996700001502010773014602025852000902171930003302180945001302213946001102226655001202237IND2037593220221118184111.0940301e19930705ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203759322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrrgang, K.D.10aIdentification, isolation and partial characterisation of a 14-15 kDa pigment binding protein complex of PS II from spinach  ap. 173-187.  a2019-12-05  aWe described recently a new Chl a/b binding polypeptide in PS Il from spinach (Irrgang, K.D., Bechtel, C., Vater, J. and Renger, G. (1990) in Current Research in Photosynthesis (Baltscheffsky, M., ed.), Vol. I, pp. 375-378, Kluwer, Dordrecht). This 14-15 kDa chlorophyll a/b binding polypeptide complex was isolated and purified from intrinsic photosystem II membrane polypeptides. About 3 Chl a and 1 Chl b were bound per protein molecule. A polyclonal antiserum was induced against this pigment-protein complex. SDS polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with immunoblotting revealed reactivities with two polypeptides of very similar relative molecular masses of 14 and 15 kDa that are clearly identified in thylakoids, PS II membrane fragments, ISO and RSO thylakoids. Their N-termini were blocked by an as yet unidentified modifying group. Using analytical isoelectric focusing under denaturing conditions their isoelectric points were determined to be 5.2-5.3 and around 6.0-6.5. The isolated polypeptides of the pigment-protein complex tend to self-associate into oligomeric forms of about 66-70 kDa. Furthermore, under mild solubilisation conditions an oligomeric pigment-protein complex of 120 kDa was observed. This oligomer was shown to be heterogeneously composed of the 14-15 kDa proteins and at least another pigment-binding polypeptide with an Mr of 22-24 kDa. The low molecular mass pigment-protein complex (CP14-15) is proposed to act as an additional antenna complex within PS II. 3athylakoids 3aSpinacia oleracea 3abinding proteins 3aphotosystem II 3achlorophyll 3aimmunocytochemistry 0apurification 0achlorophyll b 0achlorophyll a1 aKablitz, B.1 aVater, J.1 aRenger, G.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 July 5, v. 1143, no. 2 p.173-187x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01832naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002600148245011500174300001800289500002400307520077700331650001601108650002001124650004301144650001501187650002201202650001601224700001901240700002901259700002001288773010101308852000901409856008801418655001201506IND4435492920221118184130.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443549292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2010.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirita, Raluca-Ioana10aApproach to hydrophilic interaction chromatography column selection: Application to neurotransmitters analysis  ap. 3091-3104.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents the comparison between 12 hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography columns that are commercially available.

For additional information, the retention data have been analyzed statistically by factor analysis. Principal component analyses (PCA) were calculated to evidence different separation behaviour between the stationary phases, based on the retention data measured for three compound classes: anionic acidic compounds, cationic basic compounds and zwitterionic amino acids. Finally, a generic procedure is suggested for optimization of HILIC analyses, depending on the ionization state of the analytes. 3aamino acids 3afactor analysis 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aionization 3aneurotransmitters 3azwitterions1 aWest, Caroline1 aFinaru, Adriana-Luminita1 aElfakir, Claire0 tJournal of chromatography.g2010 Apr. 30, v. 1217, no. 18 p.3091-3104dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2010.03.0013Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01995naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245007100155300001800226520092100244650001301165650001101178650001601189650003101205650002301236650001701259650003301276700001501309700001801324700001701342700001601359773010101375852000901476856007701485930003301562945001301595946001301608655001201621IND2053411020221118184118.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205341102DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950496h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasiraghi, E.10aQuality attributes of Milano salami, and Italian dry-cured sausage  ap. 1248-1252.  aAmong dry-cured sausages produced in Italy, Milano salami is one of the most widespread. The purpose of the present work was to examine a wide range of analytical parameters to describe the chemical and physical characteristics of a set of 37 Milano salamis. Principal component analysis has been adopted, and the most relevant variables have been selected. Only 6 of 19 variables (L*, modulus, pH, NaCl/moisture, moisture/protein, lactic acid) were used in the final chemometric model. The first two principal components were significant according to double cross validation and accounted for 84.8% of sample variance. A correlation (p < 0.001) between principal component scores and sensory ratings, given by a panel of selected assessors, was obtained. On the basis of the correlation with sensory preference scores, the quantitative descriptive analysis profiles and quality scores for each sample were computed. 3asausages 3asalami 3acured meats 3aphysicochemical properties 3asensory evaluation 3ameat quality 3aprincipal component analysis1 aPompei, C.1 aDellaglio, S.1 aParolari, G.1 aVirgili, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1248-1252x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950496h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02597naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245015100150300001800301520136900319650001101688650001501699650001501714650002501729650001901754650001201773650001301785653002401798653001401822653002601836653003001862700001501892700001701907700001701924773010101941852000902042856007702051930003302128945001302161946001302174655001202187IND2053410020221118184105.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205341002DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950557b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoki, T.10aResponse surface analyses of the effects of calcium and phosphate on the formation and properties of casein micelles in artificial micelle systems  ap. 1230-1234.  aArtificial casein micelles were prepared at a casein concentration of 2.5% by adding calcium phosphate, and citrate to sodium caseinate solution. The final calcium, phosphate, and citrate concentrations in micelle systems were 15-40, 0-30, and 10 mM, respectively. The number of prepared artificial micelle samples was 42. The predicted equations for micellar casein, micellar calcium, micellar phosphate, casein aggregates cross-linked by micellar calcium phosphate, and serum casein released on cooling were formulated using a second-order model by multiple regression techniques. Perspective views and cross-sectional views of response surfaces were constructed from the equations. Although micelle formation depended strongly on calcium concentration, the effect of phosphate was obvious, especially at low calcium concentrations. Perspective views of response surfaces for micellar calcium, micellar phosphate, and casein aggregates cross-linked by micellar calcium phosphate were very similar, and they increased with increases in calcium and phosphate concentrations. Serum casein released from micelles on cooling decreased with increases in calcium and phosphate concentrations. The combined effects of calcium and phosphate on the formation and properties of casein micelles were clearly demonstrated by multiple regression and surface response analyses. 3acasein 3aphosphates 3acaseinates 3asurface interactions 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3amicelles 0amultiple regression 0aformation 0aprotein cross-linking 0asurface response analysis1 aUehara, T.1 aYonemasu, A.1 aEl-Din, M.Z.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1230-1234x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950557b3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03140naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010800176300001600284500002400300520159700324650001701921650001101938650002201949650000901971650001301980650001201993650001502005650001602020650001102036650002002047650002302067650001802090650001502108650002002123650001802143650001502161650001102176650002002187650001102207650001902218650002002237650001702257650001702274651001102291700002302302700002002325700002702345700001902372700002102391773009802412852000902510856005502519655001202574IND4444936320221118183920.0101105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444493632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00512.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarchevêque, Marie10aRestoration of a Mediterranean Postfire Shrubland: Plant Functional Responses to Organic Soil Amendment  ap. 729-741.  aIncludes references  aWe investigated the potential of plant functional responses to speed up restoration in a postfire ecosystem. The patterns of change in plant nutrient uptake and water potential after compost amendment were monitored for 2 years in a 7‐year‐old postfire shrubland in southeastern France. We studied four different stress‐tolerant species with contrasting life traits: three shrub species and a perennial herb. Three treatments were applied: control, 50 and 100 Mg/ha of fresh cocomposted sewage sludge and green waste. In both compost treatments, concentrations of all the macronutrients increased. The amendment improved N and cation nutrition, but the positive effect of compost on plant nutrient status was most apparent on leaf P concentrations, indicating that P was a limiting nutrient in this shrubland. Compost had no significant short‐term effect on trace metal concentrations in plants. The plant nutrition response of different species to the compost varied; the nutritional status of Brachypodium retusum and Cistus albidus improved the most, whereas that of Quercus coccifera and Ulex parviflorus improved the least. Woody species exhibited no increase in N stocks. Phosphorus accumulation was also about three times higher in plots amended at 50 Mg/ha than in control plots for B. retusum and C. albidus. The severe summer drought of 2003 altered the compost effect. Contrary to our expectations, plants on amended plots did not exhibit a better water status in summer: the effect of the summer drought had a greater effect on water status than did the compost treatment. 3aBrachypodium 3aCistus 3aQuercus coccifera 3aUlex 3acomposts 3adrought 3aecosystems 3agreen waste 3aleaves 3anutrient uptake 3anutritional status 3aorganic soils 3aphosphorus 3aplant nutrition 3asewage sludge 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3asoil amendments 3asummer 3atrace elements 3awater potential 3awater uptake 3awoody plants 3aFrance1 aBallini, Christine1 aBaldy, Virginie1 aKorboulewsky, Nathalie1 aOrmeño, Elena1 aMontès, Nicolas0 tRestoration ecology.g2010, v. 18, no. 5 p.729-741dBlackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00512.x 7aarticle02909naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001100145245013100156300001600287500002400303520164500327650001201972650001501984650001101999650001102010650002002021650001502041650002702056650001002083650001302093650001602106650001402122650001402136650001102150650000902161650002002170650001002190650002502200650002002225700001402245700001502259700001402274773009402288852000902382856004802391655001202439IND4432426920221118184234.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443242692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0099-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Y.10aCombined effects of simulated tidal sea-level rise and salinity on seedlings of a mangrove species, Kandelia candel (L.) Druce  ap. 287-300.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the effects of the simultaneous occurrence of salt stress and tidal sea-level rise on mangroves, potted Kandelia candel seedlings were treated under deep flooding (flooded 40 cm above the soil surface for 16 h per day, inundating the entire plant) and shallow flooding (flooded just above the soil surface for 8 h per day) at salinity levels of 5, 15, and 25 ppt over 14 months. Deep flooding enhanced stem elongations at all salinity levels but increased stem biomass only at 5 ppt. Deep flooding increased both leaf production and leaf fall; leaf biomass increased at 5 ppt, but decreased at 15 and 25 ppt. Biomass ratios of root/shoot (R/S) of deep flooding treatments were significantly lower than those of shallow flooding treatments. Under deep flooding, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities did not show significant change between 5 and 15 ppt, but increased at 25 ppt. With increasing salinity level, peroxidase (POD) activities increased, and the difference between shallow and deep flooding was enhanced. Malonaldehyde (MDA) content significantly decreased at 25 ppt with 40 cm flooding, but was not affected by other treatments. These results demonstrated that the growth and physiological responses of K. candel seedlings under deep flooding conditions varied with salinity level; growth was enhanced at low salinity level but inhibited at high salinity level. It is therefore probable that K. candel will shift from downstream to upstream, where the influence of fresher river water resources will ameliorate the effects of increased salinities that accompany deeper tidal flooding in these mangrove ecosystems. 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afloods 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphysiological response 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asea level 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil 3astem elongation 3astems 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater resources1 aGu, Y.

Ammonium-loaded clinoptilolite (A-Cp) may reduce N leaching from sandy soils while sustaining plant productivity. We conducted two greenhouse plant growth experiments with sweet corn (Zea mays L.). Pots containing a sandy soil planted with sweet corn were fertilized with either ammonium sulfate (AS) or one of three size fractions of A-CP, small (< 0.25 mm), medium (0.25 to 2 mm), or large (2 to 4 mm), at rates of 112, 224, or 336 kg N ha-1 (Experiment #1) and 112 or 224 kg N ha-1 (Experiment #2). We compared ammonium (NH4(+)) and NO3(-) leaching from these pots and compared corn relative growth rates (RGR), leaf area ratio (LAR), and net assimilation rate (NAR) among all N fertilizers. Soil amended with AS leached 10 to 73% of the added N, depending on N rate, whereas < 5% Of the added N leached from the A-Cp amended soil regardless of N rate and Cp particle size. No differences in corn growth were observed among N fertilizers, however, plants fertilized with A-Cp assimilated significantly more N than AS fertilized plants. Results indicate fertilization with A-Cp will minimize N leaching from sandy soils while sustaining normal corn growth. 3aZea mays 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aslow-release fertilizers 3anitrates 3asoil fertility 3afractionation 3aleaching 3anet assimilation rate 3aleaf area 3asoil amendments 3aammonium nitrogen 3anitrate nitrogen 3airrigation 3aapplication rate 3aammonium compounds 3aUtah 0agrowth rate 0asize 0agrowth 0aclinoptilolite1 aDrost, D.T.1 aBoettinger, J.L.1 aNorton, J.M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 3 p.515-530x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093654213Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03805naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001100145245009200156300001600248520222700264650002002491650001002511650001502521650002602536650002802562650002302590650001602613650002302629650002702652650002102679650001202700650001102712650001302723650002002736650001102756650001102767650002602778650003702804650002102841650003602862653001302898653001402911653001102925653001602936700001802952700001602970700002102986773007903007852000903086856008503095930003303180945001303213946001303226655001203239IND2063299220221118183946.0980422s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206329922DNAL7 a10.1080/019041698093654172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, R.10aEffects of phosphorus nutrition on carbohydrate and protein metabolism in alfalfa roots  ap. 459-474.  aAlfalfa (Medicago sativus L.) root reserves are thought to provide nutrients to regrowing shoots, enhance stress tolerance, and improve plant persistence. Factors affecting carbohydrate and protein accumulation and metabolism in roots are important in alfalfa production. Our objectives were to determine the influence of phosphorus (P) nutrition on alfalfa shoot growth and root carbohydrate and protein metabolism after defoliation and how quickly growth and root carbohydrate and protein metabolism of P-deficient alfalfa plants responds to supplemental P. In Experiment 1, nodulated alfalfa was grown in quartz sand with minus-nitrogen (N) Hoagland's solution containing 0, 1, 2, or 6 mM P. Root P concentrations increased with increasing solution P levels. Phytate P in roots of plants grown with 6 mM P was greater than that of plants grown in 0, 1, or 2 mM P. Shoot mass and shoots per plant were reduced by 67 and 43%, respectively, in plants grown with 0 mM P as compared to plants grown with 6 mM P. Root starch and protein concentrations did not decline after defoliation in plants provided 0 mM P. Defoliation increased endoamylase activity in roots of plants that received P. Root total amylase activity declined as P supply increased, and was not associated with root starch degradation. In Experiment 2, P-efficient alfalfa plants were provided with minus-N Hogland's solution containing 6 mM P either at defoliation (day 0), or at Day 14, and these plants were compared to other provided 0 or 6 mM P throughout the study. Root P concentrations increased within 7 days of P application. Shoot regrowth of P-deficient plants recovered to equal that of plants provided 6 mM P within 7 to 21 days after P application. Application of P at defoliation enhanced root starch use, whereas P application on Day 14 had no effect on root starch depletion. Normal root-starch utilization occurred in plants provided 6 mMP when plants were defoliated a second time 35 days after the initial harvest. Normal root protein utilization was not restored by P application during regrowth. Roots of P-deficient alfalfa contained high concentrations of organic reserves, but use of these reserves alter defoliation was impaired. 3aMedicago sativa 3aroots 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aprotein metabolism 3adefoliation 3anutrient solutions 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3anutrient content 3abiomass 3ashoots 3aamylases 3aenzyme activity 3astarch 3asugars 3anutrient deficiencies 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aapplication rate 3achemical constituents of plants 0aphytates 0aresponses 0agrowth 0aendoamylase1 aVolenec, J.J.1 aJoern, B.C.1 aCunningham, S.M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 3 p.459-474x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093654173Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02778naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012500160300001600285500001500301520088600316650001701202650001801219650002301237650002301260650002801283650002201311650002801333650001001361650002901371650001401400650001101414650001401425650002101439650001101460650001401471650001601485650001201501650001701513650002001530650002001550650001201570650001901582650001301601650002001614650002101634650001401655650003601669650001601705653002401721653001401745653001001759653001501769653001101784653002701795700002101822700001701843773007901860852000901939856008501948930003302033945001302066946001302079655001202092IND2063299420221118183958.0980422s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206329942DNAL7 a10.1080/019041698093654182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerraj, R.10aEffects of salt stress on nitrogen fixation, oxygen diffusion, and ion distribution in soybean, common bean, and alfalfa  ap. 475-488.  a2019-12-04  aThe exposure of legume nodulated-roots to 100 mM NaCl resulted in a rapid decrease in plant growth associated with a short-term inhibition of both nodule growth and nitrogenase activity (C2H2 reduction=ARA). However, these NaCl effects varied among species, common bean being more sensitive than soybean and alfalfa. The higher sensitivity of common bean was associated with a higher accumulation of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) in the nodules and only a small difference between salt-treated and control plants of common bean in their responses of ARA to raising rhizosphere PO2. By contrast, soybean and alfalfa plants showed a higher stimulation of ARA by PO2 for the salt-treatment than for the control. It is concluded that the intraspecific variation in short-term inhibition of ARA by salt may involve the regulation of O2 diffusion and the distribution of ions in nodules. 3agas exchange 3aion transport 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3apotassium chloride 3ainterspecific variation 3anitrogen fixation 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3astems 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3adiffusion 3asodium 3aacetylene 3aroot shoot ratio 3aleaves 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3acalcium 3aroot nodules 3asodium chloride 3aenzyme activity 3abiomass 3ainorganic ions 3asalinity 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3amagnesium 3achemical constituents of plants 3anitrogenase 0aspecies differences 0areduction 0aroots 0ainhibition 0astress 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aVasquez-Diaz, H.1 aDrevon, J.J.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 3 p.475-488x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093654183Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02993naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245010000159300001800259500001500277520157100292650001101863650001401874650002001888650001601908650002801924650003501952650001401987650000902001650001802010650000702028650002302035650002202058650001802080653002402098653001402122653001602136653002302152653001002175653001902185653001002204700001302214700001302227773008202240852000902322856008502331930003302416945001302449946001302462655001202475IND2063025820221118184559.0980409s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206302582DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093653532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Z.H.10aRoot and rhizosphere responses of iron-efficient or -inefficient apple genotypes to solution pH  ap. 1517-1525.  a2019-12-04  aSolution culture with four pH levels was employed in this experiment to evaluate root and rhizosphere responses of Malus xiaojinensis [iron (Fe)-efficient species] and M. baccata (Fe-inefficient species) in order to pursue some of their physiological mechanisms for Fe absorption. The results showed that M. xiaojinensis had a higher fresh weight per seedling than M. baccata at any of the solution pH levels tested and the differences were significant between the two species with increasing of the solution pH levels, particularly at the pH of 7.4 or 8.4. The reducing abilities of root exudates for the two species under test were decreased with increasing of the solution pH from 5.4 to 8.4, in which the reducing abilities for M. xiaojinensis were always more than two times higher than those for M. baccata. The significant decrease of the reducing ability was found only at pH of 8.4 for M. xiaojinensis or at both 7.4 and 8.4 for M. baccata, respectively. Malus xiaojinensis had significantly higher respiration rates than M. baccata at the higher solution pH levels. Both rhizosphere pH and rhizosphere redox potential were influenced by the solution pH levels remarkably in distances of 0-4 mm to root surface or in distances of 5-10 mm along the root from the root tip, respectively. Genotypic differences in these two parameters were clearly showed at the solution pH of 7.4, in which rhizosphere pH of M. xiaojinensis was clearly lower than that of M. baccata, while the rhizosphere redox potential of the former was much higher than that of the latter. 3aweight 3aroot tips 3aredox potential 3arhizosphere 3ainterspecific variation 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aseedlings 3airon 3aroot exudates 3apH 3anutrient solutions 3agenetic variation 3aMalus baccata 0aspecies differences 0areduction 0arespiration 0amalus xiaojinensis 0aMalus 0amineral uptake 0aroots1 aWang, Q.1 aChen, L.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 11 p.1517-1525x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093653533Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03606naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245010100157300001800258500001500276520197200291650002002263650002102283650001102304650001502315650001002330650002102340650001102361650000902372650001302381650001102394650002102405650001302426650001102439650001202450650001002462650001402472650001402486650002802500650002102528650001702549650000902566650001402575650003602589653001502625653002102640653002602661653002202687700001602709700001702725700001502742773008202757852000902839856008502848930003302933945001302966946001302979655001202992IND2063026420221118184341.0980409s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206302642DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093653562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, A.10aEffect of zinc ammonia acetate on germination and early seedling growth of three maize genotypes  ap. 1551-1566.  a2019-12-04  aZinc ammonia acetate (ZAA) is marketed as an agricultural additive (ACA) and has been shown to increase the yield of corn (Zea mays L.). However, the response is sometimes variable and the effective components and the mode of action are not known. To address these issues, the effect of four concentrations (0, 0.85, 8.5, and 85 ppm) of ZAA on laboratory germination and early seedling growth of three maize genotypes were evaluated. The ZAA at 0.85 and 8.5 ppm tended to increase the total seminal root length, and shoot and root dry weight of seedling in all genotypes. Hydroponic studies revealed that plant height and whole plant dry weight of 2-week-old seedlings tended to be increased with 0.85 and 8.5 ppm of ZAA in all genotypes compared to the control. The number of seminal and lateral root for all genotypes, and seminal root total length for two genotypes were significantly increased by ZAA at both 0.85 or 8.5 ppm. However, the high root:shoot ratio observed for ZAA-treated seedlings was not due to increased root growth over shoot growth but resulted from a greater reduction in shoot growth at higher ZAA concentrations. The boron (B) content of the shoots of all genotypes had a positive linear response to increasing ZAA concentrations. Both 0.85 and 8.5 ppm of ZAA increased copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) contents of all genotypes. The calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P) concentrations were not significantly affected by ZAA treatments, although there was a trend toward an increase for some of these elements at both 0.85 and 8.5 ppm of ZAA. In a greenhouse test, plant height, leaf area, and shoot dry weight of 3-week-old seedlings of all genotypes were increased by ZAA at 0.85 and 8.5 ppm. Root volume was increased at both 0.85 and 8.5 ppm for one genotype. Considering the extremely low concentration of ZAA required to induce a plant response (0.85 or 8.5 ppm), some possible modes of action of ZAA are discussed. 3aseedling growth 3anutrient content 3aheight 3aphosphorus 3aroots 3aapplication rate 3ashoots 3airon 3agenotype 3alength 3aroot shoot ratio 3aZea mays 3acopper 3acalcium 3aboron 3aleaf area 3apotassium 3adry matter partitioning 3aseed germination 3aroot systems 3azinc 3amagnesium 3achemical constituents of plants 0adry matter 0aacetates (salts) 0aplant characteristics 0aammonia additives1 aJones, R.J.1 aMalzer, G.L.1 aRehm, G.M.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 11 p.1551-1566x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093653563Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02049naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010200143300001600245520091300261650001101174650001201185650001201197650001301209650001201222650002201234650002601256650001301282650003001295650001501325650001301340650002201353650002701375650005701402700001801459700001401477700001401491773006901505852000901574939003301583946001101616655001201627IND9104508120221118184509.0911119s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450812DNAL7 a18789972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahler, J.10aSynchronized meiosis and recombination in fission yeast: observations with pat1-114 diploid cells  ap. 445-451.  aThe mutation pat1-114 has been used to synchronize meiosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We have investigated several aspects of such synchronized meiotic cultures. In both pat1-114 and pat1(+) diploids, meiotic landmark events are initiated at the same time after meiosis induction, but synchrony is much more pronounced in the pat1-114-driven meiosis. Commitment to recombination and to meiosis have been timed at 2 h after meiotic induction. Due to a seven-fold reduction of intragenic recombination frequency in the ade6 region of pat1-114 diploids, physical analysis of recombination has not been possible. We have distinguished three factors that influence intragenic recombination frequencies: temperature, azygotic versus zygotic meiosis, and the nature of the pat1 allele. Differences and similarities in the timing of meiotic landmarks in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are discussed. 3ayeasts 3amutants 3ameiosis 3adiploidy 3aalleles 3agenetic variation 3agenetic recombination 3agenotype 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 2aCell Cycle 2aDiploidy 2aMeiosisxgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aSchuchert, P.1 aGrimm, C.1 aKohli, J.0 tCurrent genetics.g1991, v. 19, no. 6 p.445-451x0172-80837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01586naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245004800166300001800214500011300232500001500345520050000360650002000860650002300880650002000903650001100923650001700934650001400951650002100965650001300986653002000999653002301019773007801042852000901120930003301129945002501162946001301187655001201200IND4412655420221118184439.0081118e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441265542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Efficacy for several health endpoints requires levels of 80 nmol/L or higher. Toxicity occurs at levels of 500 nmol/L or higher. The input needed for efficacy, in addition to typical food and cutaneous inputs, will usually be 1000-2000 IU/day of supplemental cholecalciferol. Toxicity is associated only with excessive supplemental intake (usually well above 20,000 IU/day). 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3ablood chemistry 3adosage 3ahuman health 3avitamin D 3ahuman physiology 3atoxicity 0anutrient excess 0aliterature reviews0 tNutrition reviews.g2008 Oct., v. 66, no. 10 p.S178-S181x0029-66437nnas  aDNAL  a20090115b20090206c00000000  aINDd1CTe2009/01/11  aOther US 7aarticle04143naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002200173245008500195300001600280500002400296500001500320520156300335650001501898650002001913650001801933650003501951650001101986650001001997650004302007650002502050650002002075650002302095650002602118650001302144650001702157650001602174650002902190650001602219650002002235650002102255650000902276650000802285650001202293650001602305650002202321650001902343650001702362650002102379650002202400650001602422650002202438650001402460650001202474650001602486650001802502650002302520650006602543650002402609650001102633650002302644650001802667650000902685650002302694650004202717650001202759650002502771650001302796650001602809653002502825700001702850700001802867700002302885700001702908700001902925700001802944773009002962852000903052856008503061930003303146945002503179946001303204655001203217IND4431367620140725000000.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136762DNAL7 a196474152pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aAndersson, Ulrika10aMetabolic effects of whole grain wheat and whole grain rye in the C57BL/6J mouse  ap. 230-239.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: A diet rich in whole grain cereals is suggested to protect against type 2 diabetes and facilitate body weight regulation. However, little is known about the impact of different cereals and the underlying mechanisms. The objective of this study was to compare the long-term metabolic effects of diets supplemented with whole grain wheat or whole grain rye in the C57BL/6J mouse. Methods: Mice were fed the whole grain supplements in a low-fat background diet for 22 wk. Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed during the study and in vitro insulin secretion assays were performed at the end of the study. Body weight, energy intake, body fat content, and plasma parameters were measured during the study. Results: A dietary supplement of whole grain rye suppressed body weight gain and resulted in significantly decreased adiposity, plasma leptin, total plasma cholesterol, and triacylglycerols compared with a supplement of whole grain wheat. Also, a slight improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in the rye group compared with the wheat group. The decreases in body weight and adiposity were observed in the absence of differences in energy intake. Conclusion: Long-term administration of whole grain rye evokes a different metabolic profile compared with whole grain wheat in the C57BL/6J mouse, the primary difference being that whole grain rye reduces body weight and adiposity compared with whole grain wheat. In addition, whole grain rye slightly improves insulin sensitivity and lowers total plasma cholesterol. 3aadipocytes 3ahigh fiber diet 3aenergy intake 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aleptin 3awheat 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3acholesteremic effect 3agene expression 3ainsulin resistance 3aanimal disease models 3abody fat 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3anutritional intervention 3abody weight 3aglycemic effect 3atriacylglycerols 3amice 3arye 3ainsulin 3aweight loss 3aglucose tolerance 3aweight control 3alow fat diet 3aglycemic control 3along term effects 3acholesterol 3awhole grain foods 2aAdiposity 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aEdible Grain. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLeptinxblood 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aObesityxbloodxprevention & control. 2aSecale. 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aTriticum 2aWeight Gain 0anutrition physiology1 aRosén, Liza1 aÖstman, Elin1 aStröm, Kristoffer1 aWierup, Nils1 aBjörck, Inger1 aHolm, Cecilia0 tNutrition.g2010 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.230-239dElsevier Science Inc.x0899-90077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2009.06.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20110623b20110701c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/09  aOther US 7aarticle02617naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009500129300001800224500001500242520165400257650002801911650001601939650001501955650002301970650002801993650002002021650001402041650002202055650001402077653003302091653001302124773007502137852000902212930003302221946001302254655001202267IND9104506420221118183751.0911118e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKloepper, J.W.10aDevelopment of in vivo assays for prescreening antagonists of Rhizoctonia solani on cotton  ap. 1006-1013.  a2019-12-04  aPrescreens of bacteria for biological control of soilborne diseases traditionally consist of tests for antibiosis in vitro. Two in vivo assays were developed as possible alternative prescreens for selecting candidate biological control agents for preemergence and postemergence damping-off diseases of cotton caused by Rhizoctonia solani. In the "radicle assay," radicles from surface-disinfested seed were inoculated with R. solani. In the "hypocotyl assay," excised surface-disinfested hypocotyls were inoculated with the pathogen. Inoculated radicles and hypocotyls were rated daily for symptom development for the next 6-7 days using a scale of 0-7 (0 = no symptoms; 7 = complete necrosis). The effects of growth medium for the fungal inoculum, form of inoculum, and age of host tissue on the development of necrosis were determined for both assays. The assays were "optimized" by selecting those experimental parameters that allowed a progressive development of symptoms. When tested in the optimized radicle and hypocotyl assays, the previously reported biological control rhizobacteria strains Pf-5 (Pseudomonas fluorescens) and GBO-3 (Bacillus subtilis) significantly reduced symptom development. Pf-5 populations increased during the evaluation time from 0.5 to 4 log units on radicles and from 3 to 7 log units on hypocotyls, depending on the inoculum density. Populations of GBO-3 on radicles increased 3 log units with low inoculum density but decreased 1.4 log units with high inoculum density, whereas, on hypocotyls, populations increased 1.4 log units with low inoculum density and decreased 3.5 log units with high inoculum density. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3adamping off 3ahypocotyls 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3adisease control 3abioassays 3aBacillus subtilis 3ascreening 0aplant diseases and disorders 0aradicles0 tPhytopathology.g1991 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.1006-1013x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03139naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245006900164300001800233520177400251650002102025650001902046650002702065650002302092650002602115650002802141650002102169650002002190650002102210650002002231650001102251650001502262650001502277650002102292651001602313653001402329653002902343700001902372700001602391700001602407773008102423852000902504856008502513930003302598945001302631946001302644655001202657IND2063084020221118184241.0980413s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206308402DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093653192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinclair, A.G.10aDetermination of optimum nutrient element ratios in plant tissue  ap. 1069-1083.  aA new approach for determining optimum nutrient element ratios in plant tissue is presented. Essential steps in the procedure involve: a) measuring patterns of response to pairs of nutrient elements in factorial fertilizer trials, b) modeling the yield response surface using a bivariate, Mitscherlich-related response function, c) defining balanced nutrition in terms of the parameters of the response surface, d) identifying combinations of P and S fertilizer resulting in balanced nutrition, and e) determining from plant chemical analysis the ratio of nutrients in plant tissue in nutritionally balanced combinations. The approach is illustrated by data from a phosphorus (P) by sulfur (S) factorial field fertilizer trial on a mown mixed white clover (Trifolium repens cv Grasslands Huia) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L cv Grasslands Nui) sward. Different parameters of yield [total dry matter production, clover dry matter production, clover nitrogen (N) uptake] required different ratios of S:P in fertilizer and consequently in plant tissue for nutritional balance. Also, plant tissue S:P ratios for balanced nutrition declined as the level of nutrition increased. Economic optimum S:P fertilizer ratios were higher than those ratios required for nutrient element balance due to the lower cost and higher effectiveness per kilogram of fertilizer S compared with fertilizer P. Ratios of S and P to N in clover tissue were useful indicators of the adequacy of S and P for clover which was dependent on N2 fixation for its N supply. It is suggested that a nutrient element index system showing both relative and absolute nutrient element status might be built around N as an internal standard for legumes dependent on N2 fixation and possibly also for non-legumes. 3aTrifolium repens 3aLolium perenne 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asulfur fertilizers 3anutrient availability 3adry matter accumulation 3anitrogen content 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3aplant nutrition 3asulfur 3aphosphorus 3acrop yield 3aapplication rate 3aNew Zealand 0as p ratio 0ayield response functions1 aMorrison, J.D.1 aSmith, L.C.1 aDodds, K.G.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 9 p.1069-1083x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093653193Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03211naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245009900132300001800231520207600249650001102325650002602336650002002362650002802382650001202410650001702422650002802439650001002467650001102477650002102488650002502509650002302534650001402557650001802571650002502589653001002614700001602624700001902640773007502659852000902734939003302743946001302776655001202789IND9104506520221118184256.0911118e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennypacker, B.W.10aImpact of drought stress on the expression of resistance to Verticillium albo-atrum in alfalfa  ap. 1014-1024.  aDrought stress alters plant metabolism, causing changes in growth, hormone levels, photosynthesis, and nutrient uptake. Verticillium albo-atrum reduces growth and stomatal conductance in resistant alfalfa clones in the absence of abiotic stress. The additional effect of drought stress on the growth of resistant alfalfa infected with V. albo-atrum is unknown; consequently, experiments were conducted to assess the stability of resistance to V. albo-atrum in alfalfa grown under the stress of drought. Two resistant alfalfa clones were grown in the greenhouse in 0.03-m3 cylinders that allowed the development of a gradually increasing drought stress. Plants were stubble-inoculated with V. albo-atrum and grew for 6 wk before drought stress was imposed. Effect of the combined stresses was measured over the next two 6-wk growing periods, with measurements taken at harvest during the second growth period and weekly during the third growth period. The experiment was repeated. Plant height, leaf and stem dry weight, and aerial biomass were significantly reduced by drought during both the second and third growth periods. V. albo-atrum-infected plants were shorter and had more stems, fewer internodes, and reduced stem and aerial biomass at the second harvest. Only height and flowering were reduced in infected plants during the third growth period. Significant pathogen X clone interactions indicated that the two clones differed in sensitivity to V. albo-atrum. Significant pathogen X water interactions in disease rating and stem dry weight demonstrated that stem dry weight was less affected by the pathogen, and fewer symptoms were present under drought stress than under nondrought-stressed conditions. V. albo-atrum had no consistent significant effect on stomatal conductance but did alter leaf water potential. The absence of pathogen X water interactions for most of the growth parameters and the decreased effect of the pathogen on stem dry weight under drought stress indicated that resistance to V. albo-atrum in alfalfa is stable under drought stress. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aMedicago sativa 3aVerticillium albo-atrum 3adrought 3awater stress 3adry matter accumulation 3astems 3aleaves 3aleaf conductance 3aleaf water potential 3adisease resistance 3aflowering 3avascular wilt 3astomatal conductance 0awilts1 aLeath, K.T.1 aHill, R.R.

The content of Pb in the analyzed plant parts increased following the increase in Pb content in the nutrient medium. This increase was expressed to a higher extent in the roots than in the stems and leaves. In the presence of high concentration of Pb in the leaf area, the dry mass and the height of plants were reduced. Lead treatment of sunflower plants led to a pronounced reduction of chlorophyll (a+b) content, accompanied by much smaller decrease of photosynthetic O2 evaluation rate and PSII efficiency at low light intensity. Hence, Pb effect did not result in the destruction of the photosynthetic apparatus, but in its reduction. The highest Pb concentration in the nutrient solution induced, however, at saturating photon flux density (PFD) a decrease in photochemical quenching and in the efficiency of PSII electron transport and significantly affected nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching, indicating an increase in proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and a decrease of photophosphorylation. 3aHelianthus annuus 3astems 3aphytotoxicity 3athylakoids 3alead 3afluorescence 3achemical constituents of plants 3aleaf area 3aheight 3alight intensity 3aelectron transfer 3anutrient solutions 3aoxygen 3aphosphorylation 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aroots 3aleaves 0adry matter 0agrowth rate 0aplant characteristics1 aPlesnicar, M.1 aSakac, Z.1 aPankovic, D.1 aArsenijevic-Maksimovic, I.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 1 p.75-85x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093653843Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02157naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012500127300001600252500001500268520094300283650001501226650002201241650002501263650002201288650001901310650002001329650001401349650002201363650002201385650001901407650001401426650002301440650001001463653002701473653001901500653001501519653001801534700001501552700001601567773007301583852000901656939003301665946001301698655001201711IND9104506020221118183742.0911118e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910450602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmsellem, Z.10aAbolition of selectivity of two mycoherbicidal organisms and enhanced virulence of avirulent fungi by an invert emulsion  ap. 985-988.  a2019-12-04  aMycoherbicidal preparations to selectively control weeds typically require high inoculum levels and long dew periods for establishment. The dew requirement was obviated and the inoculum threshold was reduced to one conidium per droplet when an invert emulsion was used as an adjuvant. Invert emulsion also abolished the selectivity of Alternaria cassiae and A. crassa. A. cassiae attacked eight plant species, including soybean and members of other families. The emulsion also facilitated cross-infectivity by A. crassa, a mycoherbicide specific to Datura spp., Cassia obtusifolia, and other species. Nonpathogenic fungi, such as Aspergillus nidulans and Trichoderma harzianum, colonized soybean when applied in the emulsion. Besides retaining water for spore germination, the invert emulsion may cause cuticular damage, allowing leaf penetration by the fungi. The emulsion could also suppress the plants' elicited responses to infection. 3ahost range 3aSenna obtusifolia 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aDatura stramonium 3aSolanum nigrum 3across infection 3aemulsions 3aAlternaria crassa 3aTrichoderma lixii 3amycoherbicides 3avirulence 3aAlternaria cassiae 3acrops 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0aHypocrea lixii 0aAlternaria 0apathogenicity1 aSharon, A.1 aGressel, J.0 tPhytopathology.g1991 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.985-988x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01332naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009600171300001600267500002400283520050600307650001500813650001300828650001100841650002500852700002600877773009400903852000900997856004801006655001201054IND4408472620221118183817.0080801e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440847262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9495-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Ricardo N.12aA GIS-based tool for storage, selection and visualization of time series 4D marine datasets  ap. 297-300.  aIncludes references  aWe present an initial attempt for the development of a distributed and scalable GIS-like tool for the storage, selection and visualization of 4D marine datasets.

However, we argue that a useful concept of craving, and its measurement, must be distinguished from more general measures of appetite. Furthermore, we believe that their defence of their own significant finding misses the point that it is size, but not direction, of change that is altered by VNS. Finally, their multiple regression cannot be meaningfully interpreted with any confidence, not just because of the likelihood of overdetermination, but because the dependent variable, i.e. the direction of change of appetitive ratings, was not shown to be a reliable change, let alone an effect of VNS. 3acraving 3afood intake 3afoods 3apsychology1 aMohiyeddini, C.0 tAppetite.g2008 July, v. 51, no. 1 p.229-230dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2007.11.006 7aarticle02897naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015400127300001600281500001500297520168600312650001701998650001902015650001802034650001802052650001702070650000802087650001002095650001602105650001302121650001702134650002502151650002002176651001102196653001602207700001502223700001802238700001702256700001602273773009602289852000902385930003302394945001302427946001102440655001202451IND2052055520221118184033.0960711e199603  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205205552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmstahl, S.14aThe Malmo food study: the relative validity of a modified diet history method and an extensive food frequency questionnaire for measuring food intake  ap. 143-151.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To assess the relative validity of two diet assessment methods, an extensive quantitative food frequency questionnaire (method A) and a novel shorter quantitative food frequency questionnaire with a 14-day food record (method B). Design: A randomized prospective cohort study. Setting: General community. Subjects: 206 residents of the town of Malmo, aged between 50-69 years, 101 men and 105 women who completed the methods during one year. Methods: Both diet methods were designed to cover the whole diet and portion sizes were estimated using a booklet with 120 photographs; method A comprised 250 items and method B combined a two-week food record measuring lunch and dinner meals and a shorter 130 item quantitative food frequency questionnaire for average consumption of foods, snacks and beverages during the past year. An 18 day dietary record comprising six 3-day weighed records evenly distributed over one year served as a reference method. Results: Pearson's correlation coefficients varied from 0.25 for fat intake to 0.84 for milk products for method A and from 0.32 for fish to 0.88 for meat for method B. Correlations for most food groups ranged between 0.50-0.80, and were higher for method B. Only small changes were noted after adjustment for energy intake. On average for most food groups categorization of subjects into quartiles, 55% of subjects belonging to the lowest quartile, and 57-59% of those belonging to the highest quartile for method A and B were correctly classified. Conclusion: A combined food record with a quantitative food frequency questionnaire is a better tool for food assessment than an extensive food frequency questionnaire. 3aportion size 3aquestionnaires 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3aepidemiology 3amen 3awomen 3afood groups 3aaccuracy 3adiet history 3anutrition assessment 3adietary surveys 3aSweden 0afood intake1 aRiboli, E.1 aLindgarde, F.1 aGullberg, B.1 aSaracci, R.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1996 Mar., v. 50, no. 3 p.143-151x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02555naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230500001500246520136300261650001501624650002001639650001901659650001201678650001001690650003001700650002301730650002201753650001601775650001301791650001401804650002701818650001201845653002101857653001601878700001801894700001801912700001701930773009601947852000902043930003302052945001302085946001102098655001202109IND2053672520221118184045.0961022e199607  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205367252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinsey, P.M.14aThe importance of measured intake in assessing exposure of breast-fed infants for organochlorines  ap. 438-442.  a2019-12-05  aObjectives: To estimate infants' intake of organochlorines (OCs) from their measured intake of breast milk; to compare these with the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Design: Primiparous nursing mothers were recruited from either an industrial or rural area between January and November 1992. Setting: Mothers volunteered in response to information displayed at their Infant Welfare Centre. All sampling was undertaken in the subject's home. Subjects: The sole entry criterion was primiparity. Three breast milk samples were collected at one month intervals from each mother. OC levels were measured on a milk fat basis by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer and individual milk intakes were used to determine the infant's daily OC intake. Of the 23 mothers who entered the study, 17 finished, resulting in 57 samples for intake determination. Results: Some intakes of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), chlordane, dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide (HE) exceeded the ADI. High OC levels in breast milk did not necessarily result in a high intake for the infant. Conclusions: Assessment of the exposure of infants to OC contaminants in breast milk requires an accurate estimate of OC intake. Intakes estimated using inferred rather than measured values for milk fat and milk intake are not reliable indicators of actual intakes. 3aestimation 3amaternal effect 3abreast feeding 3amothers 3awomen 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3afood contamination 3achemical analysis 3abreast milk 3amilk fat 3aingestion 3aenvironmental exposure 3ainfants 0amilk consumption 0afood safety1 aDonohue, D.C.1 aCumming, F.J.1 aAhokas, J.T.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1996 July, v. 50, no. 7 p.438-442x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle03656naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011600165300001800281520220900299650001102508650002602519650001702545650001402562650001302576650002002589650002602609650000902635650002102644650001502665650001002680650001502690650002802705650002102733650000902754650002302763651001402786653001702800653001302817700001802830700001602848700002302864700001702887773008102904852000902985856008502994930003303079945001303112946001303125655001203138IND2063087520221118183640.0980413s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206308752DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093653282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBufogle, A. Jr.10aRice variety differences in dry matter and nitrogen accumulation as related to plant stature and maturity group  ap. 1203-1224.  aDifferences in nitrogen (N) use by different varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L.) have been reported by numerous researchers. Some have indicated that N fertilization required for maximum yield differs between modern varieties and old varieties (varieties no longer in production); others have suggested that among modern varieties, semidwarf varieties require higher N rates than taller varieties. The objectives of this study were to evaluate differences in dry matter and N accumulation among modern long-grain varieties in relation to plant stature (tall versus semidwarf) and maturity group (early versus very early), and to compare old varieties and modern varieties. A greenhouse pot experiment with Crowley silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Albaqualf) was conducted to compare old and modern long-grain varieties at 52 days after sowing. Based on the results of the pot experiment, three varieties each from six variety groups (old varieties, modern medium-grain varieties, and four groups of modern long-grain varieties) were planted in the field on Crowley silt loam soil. Each variety was fertilized with three preflood N levels (0, 67, and 135 kg N ha-1). Plants were harvested 49 days after sowing and 25 days after 50% heading. Old and modern long-grain varieties did not differ in total N accumulation at any N level. However, long-grain varieties produced more grain than the old varieties at all N levels, and among long-grain varieties, semidwarf varieties produced more grain than tall varieties when 135 kg N ha-1 were applied. Early and very early varieties did not differ in total N accumulation or grain yield. Varieties that produced a higher grain yield did so by partitioning more N to grain than straw. Modern medium-grain varieties accumulated more N than old and long-grain varieties and produced more grain with both 67 and 135 kg N ha-1. Medium-grain varieties had a higher harvest index and physiological efficiency than old varieties but did not differ from long-grain varieties. This suggests that medium-grain varieties also partition more of their N into grain than straw and possibly are able to absorb more N from soil than old or long-grain varieties. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aOryza sativa 3avarieties 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient availability 3aurea 3anitrogen content 3acrop yield 3aseeds 3arice straw 3adry matter accumulation 3aapplication rate 3arice 3aflooded conditions 3aLouisiana 0aheading date 0amaturity1 aBollich, P.K.1 aKovar, J.L.1 aMacchiavelli, R.E.1 aLindau, C.W.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 9 p.1203-1224x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093653283Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02613naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008500163300001800248500001500266520127600281650001401557650001801571650001901589650001601608650001501624650002301639650001601662650001601678650001501694650001901709650002401728650001801752651001901770653001701789653001901806653001801825653001301843653002201856700001901878773008101897852000901978856008501987930003302072945001302105946001302118655001202131IND2063087820221118184113.0980413s1997    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206308782DNAL7 a10.1080/019041697093653292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, A.M.10aEffect of planting date, starter fertilizer, and fungicide interaction on cotton  ap. 1225-1230.  a2019-12-04  aIt is widely believed that starter fertilizer applications and fungicide treatments, either separate or in combination, can lead to increased plant stands and yields in cool, wet growing seasons. Over a three year period, tests were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Two methods of starter application and two fungicide treatments were evaluated over two planting dates. Seedling stand counts and lint yield were measured. Our results show that on a North Carolina coastal plain soil there were no interactions between the treatments. A placement of starter fertilizer 5 cm to the side and 5 cm below the seed showed to have more consistent results in increasing plant stand and yield over a banded application. Fungicide treatments were not effective in increasing plant stands and increased yield in only one year over the untreated check. Yield was positively influenced by earlier planting dates and stand was found to increase in one year with an earlier planting date. Our results suggest that starter fertilizer applications can increase yield and plant stand in good years, but there is no interaction between starter fertilizers, fungicide treatments, and planting date on well-drained coastal plain soils. 3ametalaxyl 3aplanting date 3aband placement 3alint cotton 3aquintozene 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aetridiazole 3afertilizers 3acrop yield 3asoil treatment 3acoastal plain soils 3atop dressings 3aNorth Carolina 0asidedressing 0adeep placement 0a5x5 placement 0aplanting 0astarter dressings1 aEdmisten, K.L.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1997, v. 20, no. 9 p.1225-1230x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041697093653293Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03167naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245020700127300001600334520216800350650001402518650001202532650002302544650001602567650000802583653003602591700001502627700001702642700001902659773009702678852000902775930003302784945001302817946001102830655001202841IND2045230720221118183857.0950323e199412  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204523072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZampelas, A.10aPostprandial lipoprotein lipase, insulin and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses to test meals of different fatty acids composition: comparison of saturated, n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids  ap. 849-858.  aObjective: The present study was carried out to investigate effects of meals, rich in either saturated fatty acids (SFA), or n-6 or n-3 fatty acids, on postprandial plasma lipid and hormone concentrations as well as post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Design: The study was a randomized single-blind study comparing responses to three test meals. Setting: The volunteers attended the Clinical Investigation Unit of the Royal Surrey County Hospital on three separate occasions in order to consume the meals. Subjects: Twelve male volunteers with an average age of 22.5 +/- 1.4 years (mean +/- SD), were selected from the University of Surrey student population; one subject dropped out of the study because he found the test meal unpalatable. Interventions: Three meals were given in the early evening and postprandial responses were followed overnight for 11 h. The oils used to prepare each of the three test meals were: a mixed oil rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA) which mimicked the fatty acid composition of the current UK diet, corn oil, rich in n-6 fatty acids and a fish oil concentrate (MaxEPA) rich in n-3 fatty acids. The oil under investigation (40 g) was incorporated into the test meals which were otherwise identical [208 g carbohydrates, 35 g protein, 5.65 MJ (1350 kcal) energy]. Postprandial plasma triacylglycerol (TAG), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), and insulin responses, as well as post-heparin LPL activity (measured at 12 h postprandially only) were investigated. Results: Fatty acids of the n-3 series significantly reduced plasma TAG responses compared to the mixed oil meal (P < 0.05) and increased post-heparin LPL activity 15 min after the injection of heparin (P < 0.01). A biphasic response was observed in TAG, with peak responses occurring at 1 h and between 3-7 h postprandially. GIP and insulin showed similar responses to the three test meals and no significant differences were observed. Conclusion: We conclude that fish oils can decrease postprandial plasma TAG levels partly through an increase in post-heparin LPL activity, which however, is not due to increased GIP or insulin concentrations. 3afish oils 3ainsulin 3alipoprotein lipase 3afatty acids 3amen 0agastric inhibitory polypeptides1 aMurphy, M.1 aMorgan, L.M.1 aWilliams, C.M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1994 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.849-858x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle03001naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008100160300001600241520151500257650001601772650001101788650001301799650002301812650002601835650001501861650001401876650001101890650001501901650002101916650002701937650002601964650001401990650002002004650001102024650001102035650002102046650002002067650003602087650002102123651001302144653001502157653002202172700001602194700001702210773007902227852000902306856008502315930003302400945001302433946001302446655001202459IND2090690420221118184601.0980526s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209069042DNAL7 a10.1080/019041698093654342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBall, R.A.10aStarch and nitrogen status in soybean during shading and nutrient deficiency  ap. 665-685.  aPlant mineral requirements are based on nutrient prediction models, but plant energy is seldom taken into consideration. Starch, a potential indicator of plant energy reserve, was assessed by first investigating the association between leaf starch and nitrogen (N) during and after shading, and secondly by quantifying leaf phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) content to the starch-N relationship. Soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr] were field-grown in 1992, 1993 and 1994 at Fayetteville, Arkansas, and shaded during vegetative and reproductive growth (V7 to R4). The 1994 shading study also incorporated a treatment of K and P fertilizer. Starch and N levels (% leaf DW) were predicted from calibration models based on spectra produced by near infra-red spectroscopy. Starch measured at 1,800 h was reduced by shading, declined after flowering, and was more strongly associated with radiation and leaf N as growth stage R4 was reached. The range of starch concentration in leaf tissue was from zero to 18% leaf DW, and nitrogen varied from 3.5 to 5.5% leaf DW. Starch and N levels were inversely related for leaves located at or near the top of the plant canopy. From covariant analysis, we did not find the starch-N relationship to change with differing K content of leaves from the 1994 study. Leaf samples with low and high P content showed differences in the slopes of the starch-N curves due to the mild nutrient stress. The starch-N relationship may be useful in identifying plants affected by P deficiency. 3aGlycine max 3astarch 3anitrogen 3anutritional status 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aenergy 3ametabolism 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apotassium fertilizers 3aflowering 3asolar radiation 3acanopy 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3amineral content 3achemical constituents of plants 3aartificial shade 3aArkansas 0adry matter 0acrop growth stage1 aSabbe, W.E.1 aDeLong, R.E.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 4 p.665-685x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093654343Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02183naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010600162300001400268500002400282520091900306650001801225650001201243650001601255650001001271650001901281653001001300653002501310653002201335653003501357653001001392653001001402700001501412700001501427700002201442700002501464700001901489700001601508700001801524700001801542773012001560852000901680856004801689655001201737IND4430996020221118183920.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443099602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0723-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFamulari, D.10aDevelopment of a low-cost system for measuring conditional time-averaged gradients of SO₂ and NH₃  ap. 11-27.  aIncludes references  aA conditional time-averaged gradient (COTAG) system has been developed to provide direct long-term (weekly to monthly) average flux gradient measurements for a range of trace gases, between land and atmosphere. Over daily periods, atmospheric conditions can range from high stability, where the vertical gradients of ambient concentration are enhanced due to very small diffusivity, to highly unstable conditions, in which concentration gradients are small due to the intense turbulent activity of the surface layer. The large vertical gradients generated by high stability would bias the estimate of the actual flux: to avoid this, the COTAG system samples conditionally, within a carefully refined range of stability. A comparison with a continuous flux gradient system suggested that the removal of stable conditions from the sampling period does not substantially modify the evaluation of the long-term fluxes. 3aair pollution 3aammonia 3adiffusivity 3agases 3asulfur dioxide 0aCOTAG 0aConditional sampling 0aDeposition fluxes 0aLow-cost deposition monitoring 0aNH₃ 0aSO₂1 aFowler, D.1 aNemitz, E.1 aHargreaves, K.

Throughout the first half of this century, sporadic efforts at evaluation and commercial use of Texas bluegrass were thwarted primarily by slow stand establishment and difficulties with seed processing. Subsequent advances in seed harvesting, processing, and planting equipment and selection of superior plant genotypes could reduce effects of these limitations. In much of the southern mid- and tall-grass prairie regions and lower southeastern states where Texas bluegrass appears to have potential, there is no currently available sustainable cool-season forage grass. Effects of initial plant spacing and lime, phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) application were evaluated in a field and a green house experiment on acid infertile Louisiana Coastal Plain soils. Stands from transplanting on 10- and 30-cm spacings were comparable by the third growing season as the sparsely planted stand spread aggressively. The only consistent response to soil amendment was enhanced forage production from N fertilization in the spring. A plant photoperiodic response appears to limit potential to respond to N in autumn and winter. Forage production of dense stands and responses to spring application of N indicate that Texas bluegrass has considerable potential as a productive, sustainable cool-season forage grass for at least some soils on the southeastern Coastal Plain as well as that recently reported for the southern mid- and tall-grass prairie regions. 3aapplication timing 3aliming 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3acrop yield 3astand density 3abiological production 3aphotoperiod 3asward 3aPoa arachnifera 3aphosphorus 3arhizomes 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aLouisiana 0aestablishment 0ayield response functions 0aPoa 0alime1 aRead, J.C.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 6 p.1093-1102x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093654683Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03546naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013900161300001800300500001500318520192200333650001402255650002102269650001202290650001502302650001502317650001902332650001002351650002102361650001102382650002102393650002002414650002302434650001102457650001002468650001102478650001202489650002602501650001402527650002102541650001902562650001302581650001302594650003502607650000902642650001402651653001502665653002602680700001602706773008102722852000902803856008502812930003302897945001302930946001302943655001202956IND2124338120221118184314.0980730s1998    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212433812DNAL7 a10.1080/019041698093654662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf, Em.10aPattern of accumulation of some major and trace elements in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive lines of lentil under nitrogen deficiency  ap. 1067-1081.  a2019-12-04  aThe response of two lines of lentil (Lens culinaris), ILL 6796 (salt-tolerant) and ILL 6778 (salt-sensitive), to nitrogen (N) deficiency was examined under glasshouse conditions. Plants of the two lines were subjected to 56(control), 28, 14, and 7 mg N L-1 in Rorison's nutrient solution. The ILL 6796 had significantly greater dry matters of shoots and roots, and seed yield than ILL 6778 at varying external N levels of the growth medium. Concentrations of N and P in different plant parts of the two lines generally decreased with decrease in N levels of the rooting medium. By contrast, an increase in leaf calcium (Ca2+) concentrations in both lines was observed with decreasing external N levels, although root Ca2+ concentrations decreased considerably and those of seed remained unaffected. An antagonistic effect between N and Ca2+ was observed in the leaves of both lines. Magnesium (Mg2+) in the leaves and roots of both lines generally decreased, whereas those of seed remained unaffected under N deficient regimes. Comparison of lines showed that ILL 6796 had greater N in the leaves and roots, and potassium (K+) in the roots than those of ILL 6778. By contrast, ILL 6778 accumulated significantly greater Mg2+ and zinc (Zn2+) in leaves and manganese (Mn2+) in seed than ILL 6796 at the lower N levels. Of the different trace elements analyzed only iron (Fe2+), Mn2+ and Zn2+ in seed of both lines slightly increased with decrease in N level of the growth medium. The concentrations of trace elements in different plant parts of both lines did not bear any relationship with the uptake of major nutrients under N deficient regimes. It is concluded that in lentil uptake of major nutrients such as N, P, K, Ca, and Mg was perturbed due to N deficiency, but in contrast, the uptake of trace elements Fe, Mn, Zn, and copper (Cu) in the leaves and roots remained unaffected except the leaf Zn2+ in ILL 6778. 3amanganese 3anutrient content 3acations 3acrop yield 3aphosphorus 3aLens culinaris 3aroots 3aapplication rate 3ashoots 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient solutions 3aleaves 3aseeds 3acopper 3acalcium 3anutrient deficiencies 3apotassium 3aline differences 3asalt tolerance 3asalinity 3anitrogen 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3azinc 3amagnesium 0adry matter 0abiological resistance1 aZafar, Z.U.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1998, v. 21, no. 6 p.1067-1081x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041698093654663Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02501naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011200126300001600238520165900254650001401913650002401927650002001951650002301971650000801994700001802002700001702020773009602037852000902133930003302142945001302175946001102188655001202199IND2180514820221118183710.0981015e199802  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218051482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, K.M.10aErythrocyte membrane fatty acid composition of smokers and non-smokers: effect of vitamin E supplementation  ap. 145-150.  aObjective: Adequate dietary intakes of vitamin E and essential polyunsaturated fatty acids are important to maintain cell membrane integrity, and deficiencies have been associated with smoking related cardiovascular disease. Sufficient vitamin E is required to prevent free radical mediated peroxidation of membrane lipids. Consequently, smokers may have a greater requirement for this antioxidant. To investigate, we assessed the concurrent influences of smoking, vitamin E supplementation and red blood cell (RBC) PUFA composition on the susceptibility of the cells to lipid peroxidation in adult males. Design and subjects: Thirty male smokers and thirty male non-smokers were randomly ascribed to daily 280 mg vitamin E or placebo supplements for 10 weeks. RBC were analysed at weeks 0 and 10 for fatty acid methyl esters, vitamin E, and their susceptibility to in vitro H2O2 induced lipid peroxidation. Results: Concentrations of essential fatty acids (EFA) in RBC were lower in smokers than in non-smokers. Supplementation with vitamin E increased levels of RBC EFA in smokers to match those of non-smokers. Furthermore, the ratio of vitamin E to PUFA in RBC from smokers and non-smokers was inversely correlated with their susceptibility to peroxidation. Conclusions: An adequate vitamin E to PUFA ratio is required to protect cell membranes from oxidative damage. The significant correlation between susceptibility to peroxidation and the PUFA content of RBC before supplementation suggests an inadequate intake of vitamin E in relation to PUFA intake. Moreover, the requirement for vitamin E appears to be greater in smokers than in non-smokers. 3avitamin E 3avitamin supplements 3asmoking (habit) 3alipid peroxidation 3amen1 aMorrice, P.C.1 aDuthie, G.G.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1998 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.145-150x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01669naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006900124300001400193500001500207520077200222650003000994650002501024650001301049650002201062650001301084650001901097653001001116653001301126653001601139700001701155773007901172852000901251930003301260945001301293946001301306655001201319IND2056218220221118184727.0970328e199606  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205621822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUng, Y.T.10aFeasibility of drying CCA-treated red pine poles during fixation  ap. 46-50.  a2019-12-05  aThis study evaluates the effects of exposing red pine poles to combinations of high humidity fixation and low humidity drying conditions in a kiln immediately after treatment with chromated copper arsenate (CCA-C) wood preservative. The rate of fixation is slowed substantially as a result of cooling of the wood surface under the drying conditions. However, as long as the wood moisture content does not drop below the fiber saturation point, there do not appear to be any adverse effects on CCA leaching from the fixed wood or on redistribution of preservative chemical. This practice does not provide great savings in drying time, but energy consumption should be reduced in dehumidification kiln fixation chambers if drying is started before fixation is complete. 3achromated copper arsenate 3aspatial distribution 3aleaching 3awood preservation 3ahumidity 3aPinus resinosa 0apoles 0afixation 0akiln drying1 aCooper, P.A.0 tForest products journal.g1996 June, v. 46, no. 6 p.46-50x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle03316naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245007600186300001600262500002400278520190200302650001502204650001202219650002302231650002102254650001202275650001202287650002502299650000902324650002002333650001302353650001302366650002902379650001202408650002602420650000902446650002202455650000902477650001702486650003702503700002302540700003202563700002302595773011002618852000902728856008502737655001202822IND4435622820221118184713.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443562282DNAL7 a196446572pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8474-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopic, Aleksandra10aInsulin Mimetic Effect of Tungsten Compounds on Isolated Rat Adipocytes  ap. 296-306.  aIncludes references  aInvestigations of effective, orally active, and safe antidiabetic metallopharmaceuticals have been carried out during the last two decades. It has been reported that tungsten compounds mimic the action of insulin in intact cell systems. As insulin mimetics, the most investigated tungsten compound was sodium tungstate (ST), rarely investigated was tungstophosphoric acid (WPA), but never alanine complex of tungstophosphoric acid (WPA-A). In this study, the insulin mimetic activity of three different tungsten compounds, ST, WPA, and WPA-A, was evaluated by means of in vitro measurements of the glucose uptake and inhibition of free fatty acids release from epinephrine-treated isolated rat white adipocytes. We investigated the influence of concentration (lower and higher, 0.1 and 1.0 mM, respectively) and solvent: isotonic salt solution—saline (0.9% w/v of NaCl) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 2% v/v), on the biological effect of tested compounds. Our experimental data showed that all of the three investigated tungsten compounds possess insulin mimetic activity in vitro on the isolated adipocytes. Influence of concentration and solvents on insulin mimetic effect for the certain tungsten compounds were: WPA was shown effect independently of concentration and solvents; higher concentration and DMSO were significant decreasing insulin mimetic effect of ST; lower concentration and saline led to decreasing effect of WPA-A. Generally, there were no differences in insulin mimetic effect of three tungsten compounds in lower concentration and dissolved in DMSO. When saline was used as solvent, it was needed higher concentration of investigated compounds to accomplish the same effect. In conclusion, our results suggest that low concentration (0.1 mM) of ST, WPA, and WPA-A dissolved in 2% DMSO could be the good candidates for in vivo investigation of their antidiabetic properties. 3aadipocytes 3aalanine 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3aphosphotungstic acid 3arats 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3atungsten 2aAdipocytesxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMolecular Mimicry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTungsten Compoundsxpharmacology1 aMilenkovic, Marina1 aUskokovic-Markovic, Snezana1 aVucicevic, Dragana0 tBiological trace element research.g2010 June, v. 134, no. 3 p.296-306dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8474-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03334naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245013600179300001600315500002400331520195500355650002002310650001602330650001402346650002402360650002002384650002102404650001502425650001702440650001802457650002402475650001102499650001602510650003302526650002302559650001202582650001202594650001402606700002802620700003102648700002302679773011002702852000902812856005502821655001202876IND4438347020221118184720.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443834702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondragon-Bernal, Olga10aOptimization of synbiotic fermented food from hydrosoluble soy extract applying experimental design and sensory analysis techniques  ap. 371-389.  aIncludes references  aIn this work, a synbiotic food from hydrosoluble soy extract was developed and tested. Food products made from soymilk have frequently been rejected because of their peculiar leguminous flavor. Although lactic fermentation promotes an improvement in final flavor, Bifidobacterium produces acetic acid, which renders off flavor in the product. To improve sensory features of soymilk's synbiotic beverage, 16 flavor compounds were evaluated by preliminary affective tests using hedonic scale. The ideal sweetness and flavor were optimized using experimental design and just-about-right scale. Sucrose concentration presented the highest significant effect (P [less-than or equal to] 0.05). Products with higher sucrose contents (9.0-11.2 g/100 mL) and 0.08-0.16 g/100 mL of flavoring presented ideal sweetness. For ideal flavor, 11 g/100 mL sucrose content or higher with any amount of flavoring was considered ideal. In conclusion, predictive models for responses with respect to the ideal flavor and sweetness, overall acceptance and purchasing attitude of a soymilk symbiotic food were obtained and validated, with highly accepted and positive purchase intent (70%) by target public. The use of the just-about-right scale in sensory test is employed to measure the ideal amount of a determined compound that should be added to promote greater acceptance and preference according to the taste panel. Given that the sensory tests for the choice of the ideal are carried out in a linear manner and with one variable at a time, the present study has innovated in the application of the just-about-right scale, simultaneously evaluating two aspects of the ideal (sweetness and flavor) with a central composite rotatable design experimental design, and using the response surface methodology applied in the optimization of soymilk's symbiotic food. Predictive models for responses could be obtained to different sensorial optimizations in food researches. 3aBifidobacterium 3aacetic acid 3abeverages 3aexperimental design 3afermented foods 3aflavor compounds 3aflavorings 3afood choices 3afood research 3alactic fermentation 3amodels 3aoff flavors 3aresponse surface methodology 3asensory evaluation 3asoymilk 3asucrose 3asweetness1 aRodrigues, Maria Isabel1 aBolini, Helena Maria Andre1 aMaugeri, Francisco0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2010 June, v. 25, no. 3 p.371-389dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00265.x 7aarticle01731naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011300128300001400241500001500255520064400270650001100914650002400925650002600949651001200975651001000987653001400997653002201011653002101033653001401054653001001068653001001078653001201088653001201100700001901112700001501131700001601146773007901162852000901241930003301250945001301283946001301296655001201309IND2056219020221118184604.0970328e199606  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205621902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFridley, K.J.10aEffect of 85 years of service on mechanical properties of timber roof members. 2.

It is one of their main defensive adaptations or even an exclusive weapon. The gland was also occasionally reported in alate imagoes, but never in the worker caste. Here, we report the first observation of a frontal gland in workers of several Neotropical and one African species of Apicotermitinae. The ultrastructure of Aparatermes cingulatus and Anoplotermes nr. subterraneus is described in detail. In these two species, the gland is well-developed, functional and consists of class 1 secretory cells. The presence of envelope cells, wrapping the gland, is an unusual feature, as well as the presence of several zonulae adherens, connecting neighbouring glandular cells. The frontal gland of workers is homologous to this organ in soldiers and imagoes, as evidenced by the same position in the head and its connection to the same muscle. However, the defensive role of the frontal gland in workers remains to be confirmed. 3aRhinotermitidae 3aTermitidae 3aadherens junctions 3ahead 3atropics 3aultrastructure1 aSillam-Dussès, David.1 aWeyda, František1 aDejean, Alain1 aRoisin, Yves1 aHanus, Robert1 aBourguignon, Thomas0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2010 May, v. 97, no. 5 p.495-503dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-010-0664-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01959naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006700126300001400193520116800207650002201375650002201397653002401419653002201443653001201465700001701477700001601494773007901510852000901589930003301598945001301631946001301644655001201657IND2056218820221118184344.0970328e199606  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205621882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStahl, D.C.10aBehavior of metal-plate-connected trusses with square-end webs  ap. 78-84.  aMetal-plate-connected trusses are presently fabricated with webs cut to produce tight joints and approximately equal panel lengths on the top and bottom chords. This paper evaluates the structural feasibility of replacing these custom-cut webs with webs that have square end cuts and come in a few standard "commodity" lengths. A computer model was developed to simulate the behavior of trusses with square-end webs and its performance was verified by comparison with data from full-scale truss tests. The model and the test data showed that moments in chords and webs were affected by the presence of square-end webs, raising the possibility that higher grade chords and/or webs could be required. The square ends themselves have less effect on member forces when the web length is such that panel lengths are approximately equal. Although plate buckling did not directly cause failure of any of the trusses tested or modeled, we believe that plate buckling should be treated as a truss failure mode for design purposes. Given this limitation and the narrow scope of this study, we believe that the use of square-end webs is feasible from a structural viewpoint. 3atimber connectors 3acomputer software 0acomputer simulation 0aperformance tests 0atrusses1 aCramer, S.M.1 aWolfe, R.W.0 tForest products journal.g1996 June, v. 46, no. 6 p.78-84x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle02688naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245016700166300001600333500002400349520152700373650001701900650001101917650001801928650001101946650001001957650001901967650001201986650002301998650001402021650001002035650001002045650001402055651001102069700003502080773009302115852000902208856008502217655001202302IND4435604420221118184355.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443560442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-010-0666-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakubas, Dariusz10aSex- and age-related differences in the timing and body condition of migrating Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenobaenus  ap. 505-511.  aIncludes references  aThe migration strategies of birds may vary strongly between species and also between age and/or sex groups. We studied the autumn migration and body condition of molecularly sexed Reed Warblers Acrocephalus scirpaceus and Sedge Warblers Acrocephalus schoenobaenus (211 and 208 ind., respectively) at a stopover site on Lake Druzno, Northern Poland, in 2008. Immature male Reed Warblers were caught significantly later than females (median dates 9 days later), but in the Sedge Warbler, both sexes of immatures migrated at about the same time. Adult males and females of both species did not differ in their time of migration. Adult and immature males of both species were larger (wing length and body mass) than females. In both species, fat reserves were similar in both sexes of both age classes. Adults of both sexes of Reed and Sedge Warbler were generally caught earlier than immatures. In both species, the body mass and fat reserves of immatures were generally less than in adults. The autumn protogyny of immature Reed Warblers may allow smaller females to limit competition with bigger males during migration and at the wintering grounds. In the Sedge Warbler, which tends to match its migration to peak of occurrence of superabundant food at stopover sites, both sexes gain an advantage from migrating at the same time. Since part of the measured wing length variation in both species was explained by sex differences, temporal trends in wing length recorded at stopover sites should be interpreted with caution. 3aAcrocephalus 3aadults 3aage structure 3aautumn 3abirds 3abody condition 3afemales 3agender differences 3aimmatures 3alakes 3amales 3aprotogyny 3aPoland1 aWojczulanis-Jakubas, Katarzyna0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2010 May, v. 97, no. 5 p.505-511dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-010-0666-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02779naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010400168300001600272500002400288520164600312650002201958650002001980650001302000650001302013650001302026650001502039650001502054650001002069650001402079650001402093650002002107650000902127650001202136650002502148700002102173773009302194852000902287856008502296655001202381IND4435604220221118184357.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443560422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-010-0663-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorowski, Zbigniew10aField vole (Microtus agrestis) seasonal spacing behavior: the effect of predation risk by mustelids  ap. 487-493.  aIncludes references  aThere are numerous studies showing that predation risk may change different aspects of the behavior of prey, such as habitat use, activity pattern, and foraging. Prey should exhibit the strongest antipredatory response against their most deadly predator. Small mustelids are considered the most important mammalian predators of voles. Nevertheless, there is no general agreement as to whether strong antipredatory reactions exist in natural free-living populations of voles. Here, we studied the field vole Microtus agrestis spatial reaction to high predation risk from small mustelids in the breeding (August) and nonbreeding (October) seasons under natural conditions. Voles were exposed to a caged weasel (Mustela nivalis) and a stoat (Mustela erminea), as well as to the odors of these predators. The reactions of 30 field voles were monitored with radiotelemetry. The field voles were found to display antipredator reactions that varied with season. In the breeding period, in response to predation risk, voles reduced locomotory activity and daily-range size, whereas in the nonbreeding period they did not. Changes in home range position were similar for control and treatment voles, in both the breeding and nonbreeding periods. The results indicate that mustelid predators modify the spatial behavior of small rodents in natural conditions depending on season. This might be a reflection of differences in state-dependent responses to predation from sexually active or inactive individuals. This suggests that the basic antipredatory reaction of voles under high predation risk from small mustelids limits their locomotory activity. 3aMicrotus agrestis 3aMustela erminea 3abreeding 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3alocomotion 3aodors 3apredation 3apredators 3aradio telemetry 3arisk 3arodents 3aspatial distribution1 aOwadowska, Edyta0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2010 May, v. 97, no. 5 p.487-493dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-010-0663-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03071naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092245013900110300001400249500005700263520179900320650002502119650002302144650002302167650001602190650001302206650000902219650001902228650001402247650001202261650001902273650001302292650001202305650002302317650001402340650002802354650001302382650001102395700002102406700001702427700001902444773017702463852000902640655001202649IND6082544220221118184328.0141110s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608254422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aTiming and concentration of hydrogen cyanamide sprays affect bud development, flower mortality, and hasten fruit maturity of blueberry  ap. 27-30.  aMeeting held on June 10-12, 2001 in Stuart, Florida.  aThe effects of hydrogen cyanamide (H₂CN₂) sprays on vegetative and reproductive bud growth and development were evaluated for 'Misty' southern highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum L. hybrid) and 'Climax' rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade). 'Climax' plants were sprayed with 0% or 1% H₂CN₂ (v/v) at each of several time intervals or flower bud growth stages following either 270 or 600 hours of artificial chilling. 'Misty' plants were sprayed with 0%, 1%, or 2% H₂CN₂ (v/v) immediately after exposure to 0, 150, or 300 hours of artificial chilling. H₂CN₂ application to 'Climax' plants at 3 days after forcing (DAF) and at 10% to 30% stage 3 flower bud development dramatically accelerated leafing, and only minimal flower bud damage was observed at these application times. For 'Misty', vegetative budbreak was increased and advanced by both H₂CN₂ spray concentrations, regardless of pretreatment chilling levels; the number of vegetative budbreaks per plant increased with increased concentration. Timing of anthesis did not appear to be affected by H₂CN₂, but fruit maturity was hastened. Increased pretreatment chilling also hastened fruit development. This effect on maturity appears to be due primarily to increased and accelerated vegetative budbreak, which probably increased leaf:fruit ratios. Greater flower bud mortality from H₂CN₂ occurred in nonchilled plants than in those chilled for 150 or 300 hours, especially at 2% H₂CN₂. These results indicate that H₂CN₂ has potential value in stimulating vegetative bud development, which potentially hastens maturity in blueberries grown under the mild winter conditions of the Southeast.

Subjects and methods: Two-hundred and fifty-two women were followed from 5-7 months of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. Energy intake was estimated during pregnancy and at 1, 3 and 6 month(s) postpartum using 24 h dietary recall. Body weight was measured on enrollment, another once or twice during pregnancy, and at 1, 3 and 6 month(s) postpartum. The weekly rates of pregnancy weight gain and postpartum weight changes were determined. Weight and length of the infants were measured at birth and at approximately 1, 3 and 6 month(s). Results: Maternal energy intake at 5-7 months of gestation was 1464±416 kcal/day (mean±s.d.). Women gained a mean of 200 g/week or a total of 4 kg during the second half of pregnancy. An analysis of maternal weight showed no indication of accrual of fat stores during pregnancy. Dietary energy during lactation exceeded the intake during pregnancy by 248-354 kcal/day. Mothers lost an estimated average of 1 kg of weight during the first 6 months of lactation. The mean (±s.d.) birth weight was 2.55±0.38 kg, and the prevalence of low birth weight (<2500 g) was 48%. Infants exhibited some catch-up growth only during the first 3 months but overall growth during the first 6 months did not change from their relative status at birth when compared with NCHS reference. Conclusion: These rural Bangladeshi women failed to gain sufficient weight during the last half of pregnancy to maintain body weight during lactation when the energy demand is high. Poor growth of their primarily breastfed infants raises concern about the adequacy of lactation in this community. 3abreast feeding 3acompensatory growth 3adiet recall 3aenergy intake 3ainfants 3alactation 3alow birth weight 3amaternal nutrition 3amothers 3apregnancy 3aweight gain 3awomen 3aBangladesh1 aRaaij, J.M.A.1 aHautvast, J.G.A.J.1 aYunus, M.1 aFuchs, G.J.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.151-156x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.16015143Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121007  aNon-US 7aarticle04077naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245009400205300001800299500002400317506007600341520173100417506003702148650001202185650002602197650001602223650002702239650001002266650002402276650002002300650002102320650001902341650001802360650001802378650001202396650001602408650000902424650001602433650001802449650002602467650001202493650002402505650004002529650002002569650002602589650005802615650002002673650005902693650002502752650004002777650004002817650000902857650002302866650002102889650002302910650002202933700001702955700002002972700001702992700002003009700002203029700002003051700002203071700002103093773011603114852000903230856008003239655001203319IND4435539220221207141906.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443553922DNAL7 a202314122pmid7 aPMC28635302pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01398-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaraguchi, Norihiro10aImpairment of Host Defense against Disseminated Candidiasis in Mice Overexpressing GATA-3  ap. 2302-2311.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCandida species are the most common source of nosocomial invasive fungal infections. Previous studies have indicated that T-helper immune response is the critical host factor for susceptibility to Candida infection. The transcription factor GATA-3 is known as the master regulator for T-helper type 2 (Th2) differentiation. We therefore investigated the role of GATA-3 in the host defense against systemic Candida infection using GATA-3-overexpressing transgenic mice. The survival of GATA-3-overexpressing mice after Candida infection was significantly lower than that of wild-type mice. Candida outgrowth was significantly increased in the kidneys of GATA-3-overexpressing mice, compared with wild-type mice. The levels of various Th2 cytokines, including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13, were significantly higher while the level of Th1 cytokine gamma interferon was significantly lower in the splenocytes of GATA-3-overexpressing mice after Candida infection. Recruitment of macrophages into the peritoneal cavity in response to Candida infection and their phagocytic activity were significantly lower in GATA-3-overexpressing mice than in wild-type mice. Exogenous administration of gamma interferon to GATA-3-overexpressing mice significantly reduced Candida outgrowth in the kidney and thus increased the survival rate. Administration of gamma interferon also increased the recruitment of macrophages into the peritoneal cavity in response to Candida infection. These results indicate that overexpression of GATA-3 modulates macrophage antifungal activity and thus enhances the susceptibility to systemic Candida infection, possibly by reducing the production of gamma interferon in response to Candida infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida 3aantifungal properties 3acandidiasis 3acell-mediated immunity 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-5 3akidneys 3amacrophages 3amice 3asplenocytes 3asurvival rate 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aCandidaximmunology 2aCandidiasisximmunologyxmortality. 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxsecretion. 2aGATA3 Transcription Factorxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aGene Expression 2aInterferon-gammaxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aKidneyxmicrobiology 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunology 2aMacrophages, Peritonealximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Transgenic 2aSpleenximmunology 2aSurvival Analysis1 aIshii, Yukio1 aMorishima, Yuko1 aYoh, Keigyou1 aMatsuno, Yosuke1 aKikuchi, Norihiro1 aSakamoto, Tohru1 aTakahashi, Satoru1 aHizawa, Nobuyuki0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.2302-2311dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01398-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02993naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245016200157300001600319500002400335520150700359650002101866650001901887650001701906650001901923650002201942650002001964650001401984650000901998650001902007650001102026650000702037650001502044650002402059650003302083650001602116650002202132650001002154650003002164700001802194700001902212700001802231700001702249700001702266773013002283852000902413856007702422655001202499IND4435713920221118184130.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443571392DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.23222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPai, Cheng-Kang10aPrediction of optimum reaction conditions for the thermo-tolerant acetylxylan esterase from Neocallimastix patriciarum using the response surface methodology  ap. 628-633.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Xylan is the second most abundant renewable polysaccharide in nature and also represents an important industrial substrate. The complete degradation of xylan requires the combination of several types of xylanolytic enzymes, including endo-β-1,4-xylanases, β-xylosidases, and acetylxylan esterases. As a biocatalyst, xylanolytic enzymes with good thermal stability are of great interest, therefore, a thermo-tolerant acetylxylan esterase, AxeS20E, was investigated.RESULTS: The cDNA encoding the carbohydrate esterase (CE) domain of AxeS20E from Neocallimastix patriciarum was expressed in Escherichia coli as a recombinant His₆ fusion protein. The recombinant AxeS20E protein was obtained after purification by immobilized metal ion-affinity chromatography. Response surface modeling (RSM) combined with central composite design (CCD) and regression analysis were then employed for the planned statistical optimization of the acetylxylan esterase activities of AxeS20E. The optimal conditions for the highest activity of AxeS20E were observed at 54.6 °C and pH 7.8. Furthermore, AxeS20E retained more than 85% of its initial activity after 120 min of heating at 80 °C.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that RSM combined with CCD and regression analysis were effective in determining optimized temperature and pH conditions for the enzyme activity of AxeS20E. The results also proved AxeS20E was thermo-tolerant and might be a good candidate for various biotechnological applications. 3aEscherichia coli 3aNeocallimastix 3abiocatalysts 3achromatography 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3amodels 3apH 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3axylan 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase1 aZeng, Yi-Fang1 aYueh, Pei-Ying1 aChen, Ming-Ju1 aTung, Li-Chu1 aLiu, Je-Ruei0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.628-633dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.23223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03969naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001800182245014400200300001800344500002400362500001500386506007600401520182300477506003702300650003802337650002602375650003102401650002402432650001402456650002002470650001602490650001202506650002102518650002002539650001102559650001902570650002702589650001502616650001702631650002902648650002702677650003802704650001002742650001102752650004202763650003002805650003802835650006102873650004902934650003102983653001703014653001803031700002403049700001603073700002503089773011503114852000903229856008103238655001203319IND4444618520221207140914.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444461852DNAL7 a208139082pmid7 aPMC29716262pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1631882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinoda, Ayumi10aNucleus-Independent Control of the Rubisco Operon by the Plastid-Encoded Transcription Factor Ycf30 in the Red Alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae  ap. 1532-1540.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChloroplasts originated from a cyanobacterium, which was engulfed by a primitive eukaryotic host cell. During evolution, chloroplasts have largely lost their autonomy due to the loss of many genes from their own genomes. Consequently, expression of genes encoded in the chloroplast genome is mainly controlled by the factors transferred from the cytosol to chloroplasts. However, chloroplast genomes of glaucophytes and red algae have retained some transcription factors (hypothetical chloroplast open reading frame 27 to 30 [Ycf27-Ycf30]) that are absent from green algae and land plants. Here, we show that the red algal chloroplast up-regulates transcription of the Rubisco operon rbcLS-cbbX via Ycf30 independently of nuclear control. Light-induced transcriptional activation of the Rubisco operon was observed in chloroplasts isolated from the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. The activation was suppressed by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. These results suggest that chloroplast autonomously regulates transcription of the Rubisco operon in response to the activation of photosynthesis driven by the light. Transcriptional activation of the Rubisco operon was specifically repressed by the addition of anti-Ycf30 antibodies. Furthermore, reduced NADP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, and 3-phosphoglyceric acid triggered the up-regulation of Rubisco transcription in the dark, and the activation was dependent on Ycf30. Thus, red algal chloroplasts have retained a nucleus-independent transcriptional regulation of the Rubisco operon to respond to environmental changes. The autonomous system would have been necessary for the initial fixation of cyanobacterial photosynthesis in the ancient nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic host. It has remained functional in the red algal chloroplast over evolutionary time.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3aopen reading frames 3aevolution 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aChlorophyta 3acytosol 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3aoperon 3aphotosynthesis 3a3-phosphoglyceric acid 3aRhodophyta 3achloroplasts 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLight 2aOperon 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRhodophytaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptional Activation 0aRhodophycota 0aChlorophycota1 aWeber, Andreas P.M.1 aTanaka, Kan1 aMiyagishima, Shin-ya0 tPlant physiology.g2010 Nov., v. 154, no. 3 p.1532-1540dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1631883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03096naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100002600183245012600209300001600335500002400351520156400375650001901939650001001958650001201968650002101980650003402001650001702035650002002052650002402072650001702096650002102113650001802134650002102152650002702173653002002200700002802220700002402248700002802272773012302300852000902423856008702432930003302519945002502552946001302577655001202590IND4431377320221118181516.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2009.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ505 0aQ3051 aSiomos, Anastasios S.10aEffects of heat treatment on atmospheric composition and color of peeled white asparagus in modified atmosphere packaging  ap. 118-122.  aIncludes references  aFreshly harvested spears of white asparagus were subjected or not to heat treatment by immersion in a hot water bath at 55°C for 3min, then left unpeeled or were peeled before wrapping in 16µm stretch film and stored at 3°C for 6days. During storage, the atmosphere within the packages was sampled for O₂, CO₂ and C₂H₄ determination, while spear fresh weight, color and anthocyanin content at the 3cm apical peel segments were determined before and after storage. The results showed that CO₂ concentration in packages of white asparagus spears was not greatly influenced by peeling or heat treatment. On the other hand, a higher package O₂ depletion of treated (peeled or heated) spears was observed. Peeling also resulted in an increase of ethylene peak concentration, indicating wound-induced ethylene production, which was suppressed by heat treatment. The initial color of the whole spear was retained, while the appearance of a violet coloration on the spear tip was prevented by heat treatment in both unpeeled and peeled spears. Industrial relevance: Peeled white asparagus has drawn the attention of industry as a novel lightly processed product. The combination of heat treatment with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) could be used to improve the storage life of this product. Moreover, both peeling and heat treatment cause changes in ethylene production and respiration rate of asparagus spears and this information could be useful for development of novel application to MAP design for lightly processed (peeled) white asparagus. 3aheat treatment 3acolor 3apeeling 3aasparagus spears 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3aethylene production 3aanthocyanins 3anutrient content 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3apostharvest physiology 0awhite asparagus1 aGerasopoulos, Dimitrios1 aTsouvaltzis, Pavlos1 aKoukounaras, Athanasios0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2010 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.118-122dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2009.08.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle01871naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001400218520095100232650002201183650002301205650001601228650001101244650001201255650001301267650001801280651002601298653001801324653001601342700001601358773007901374852000901453930003301462945001301495946001301508655001201521IND2060236920221118181256.0971023e199706  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206023692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, E.10aUse of anti-stain chemical treatments by the western U.S. softwood lumber industry, 1994  ap. 69-73.  aIn the summer of 1995, a questionnaire designed to assess the use of anti-stain chemicals was mailed to all producing members of the Western Wood Products Association.

Only 21 of the 106 respondents used anti-stain treatments on lumber in 1994. The total volume of lumber treated by these respondents was approximately 913 million board feet. Respondents also provided information regarding species treated, chemicals used, treatment methods used, and the acceptability of stain in specific market segments. Douglas-fir was the species treated with anti-stain chemicals most often, with western hemlock next. The Kopcoat, Inc., chemical NP-1 was used most often, and dip tanks were the most common method of treatment. 3awood preservation 3awood preservatives 3astain fungi 3alumber 3asurveys 3asoftwood 3adiscoloration 3aWestern United States 0afungal stains 0autilization1 aMorrell, J.0 tForest products journal.g1997 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.69-73x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle02099naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002500137245008300162300001600245500002400261520114000285650002101425650001301446650001201459650001601471650001801487650001101505650001101516650001601527650001401543773013001557852000901687856007701696655001201773IND4435714420221118181235.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443571442DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.23522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKılıç Apar, Dilek10aGas-liquid mass transfer studies for biomass support materials in a bioreactor  ap. 668-673.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Oxygen mass transfer can be described and analyzed by means of the mass transfer coefficient kLa, which is the most important parameter involved in the design and operation of mixing-sparging equipment for bioreactors. In the present study, the effect of biomass support materials on the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient was studied in a bioreactor under variable process conditions. The biomass support materials used were activated carbon, pumice and loofa sponge.RESULTS: Compared with the case with distilled water only, the presence of the biomass support materials negatively influenced mass transfer. On the other hand, the mass transfer coefficient increased with increased impeller speed, air flow rate and temperature; and decreased with the increase of liquid viscosity and biomass support material concentration for all cases.CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the experimental data showed that kLa values were affected by process variables. Besides the major exponential correlations used in the literature, satisfactory linear correlations for the relationship between the kLa and process variables were obtained. 3aactivated carbon 3aair flow 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3amass transfer 3aoxygen 3apumice 3atemperature 3aviscosity0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.668-673dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.23523Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02220naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001400137245008100151300001800232520102800250650001301278650001601291650001401307650001601321650001801337650001001355650001101365650001001376650001501386650001401401650001601415650002501431650001301456650003601469653001801505700001601523773010201539852000901641856007701650930003301727945001301760946001301773655001201786IND2053331320221118181238.0961002e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205333132DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950541l2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, K.S.10aFatty acid compositions in newly differentiated tissues of soybean seedlings  ap. 1395-1398.  aSix soybean genotypes with various fatty acid compositions were allowed to germinate in sand under a greenhouse. Seedlings were picked up after 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 days and dried under sun. During germination, the fatty acid composition of cotyledons changed slightly, but those of all newly differentiated tissues, including root, hypocotyl, epicotyl, unifoliate, and trifoliate, changed dramatically, especially within the first 5 days. Although lipids from these tissues contained the five major fatty acids found in original seeds, their fatty acid compositions were totally different from that of the seed: higher in palmitic, linolenic, and stearic acid and lower in oleic and linoleic acid. There existed a distinct difference in fatty acid compositions between the young tissues below and those above cotyledons in the seedling. Furthermore, all new tissues conserved their fatty acid compositions regardless of genotypes, which may be explained by conservation of membrane lipids predominating in these tissues. 3asoybeans 3aGlycine max 3aseedlings 3agermination 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3aleaves 3astems 3ahypocotyls 3aepicotyls 3afatty acids 3acell differentiation 3agenotype 3achemical constituents of plants 0ayoung tissues1 aBrown, E.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1395-1398x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950541l3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02205naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008000164300001600244500002400260520103600284650001401320650001201334650001601346650001401362650001201376650001501388650001801403650001101421650002401432650001501456650002601471650001601497700001401513700001901527700002201546700002201568773011101590852000901701856008501710655001201795IND4435698520221118181322.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443569852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0357-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Xiongjun10aReactor scale up for biological conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol  ap. 485-493.  aIncludes references  aThe absence of a systematic scale-up approach for biological conversion of cellulosic biomass to commodity products is a significant bottleneck to realizing the potential benefits offered by such conversion. Motivated by this, we undertook to develop a scale-up approach for conversion of waste paper sludge to ethanol. Physical properties of the system were measured and correlations were developed for their dependence upon cellulose conversion. Just-suspension of solid particles was identified as the scale up criterion based on experiments at lab scale. The impeller speed for just solids suspension at large scale was predicted using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The scale-up strategy was validated by analyzing mixing requirements such as solid-liquid mass transfer under the predicted level of agitation at large scale. The scale-up approach enhances the prediction of reactor performance and helps provide guidelines for the analysis and design of large scale bioreactors based on bench scale experimentation. 3aagitation 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acellulose 3aethanol 3aguidelines 3amass transfer 3amixing 3aphysical properties 3aprediction 3apulp and paper sludge 3awaste paper1 aLynd, Lee1 aBakker, André1 aLaroche, Richard.1 aWyman, Charles E.0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 May, v. 33, no. 4 p.485-493dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0357-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01763naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245014100169300001600310500002400326520069200350650001501042650001601057650001401073650002101087650001201108650001301120650001001133650001601143650001601159650001101175650001101186651001001197700001701207773010101224852000901325856005501334655001201389IND4444892720221118181209.0101105s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444489272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-1984.2010.00294.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTSUJI, KAORU10aOdor‐guided bee pollinators of two endangered winter/early spring blooming orchids, Cymbidium kanran and Cymbidium goeringii, in Japan  ap. 249-253.  aIncludes references  aWe detected the pollinators of two endangered orchid species, Cymbidium kanran and Cymbidium goeringii, in their natural habitats.

Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct regulatory networks from gene expression datasets and/or genome sequences, but most of them can only infer qualitative regulation relationships. Thus, developing a quantitative model that can estimate the kinetic parameters of transcriptional regulatory functions is an urgent and important task. In this paper I propose REMBE, a regulatory model based on binding energy, to quantify transcriptional regulatory networks. My model combines multiple kinetic quantities, including binding strength, TF-DNA's binding energy, transcription productivity with respect to each binding state, and hidden TFs' concentration, into a general learning model. Experimental results show that my model can effectively learn these kinetic parameters and TFs' concentration from genome sequences and gene expression data. Moreover, these learned parameters and TFs' concentration provide more informative biological senses than merely qualitative regulatory relationships can do. 3adata collection 3aenergy 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2010 May, v. 33, no. 4 p.495-505dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-009-0358-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02323naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003500145245011700180300001600297500002400313520109600337650002301433650001901456650002201475650002101497650001001518650002001528650002401548650001401572650001601586650005201602650001501654650002901669700002301698700002301721773009901744852000901843856008501852655001201937IND4435647820221118181105.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443564782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-010-0562-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazmul Hussain Nazir, K.

Based on bioinformatic annotation, we found 155 putative genes of cytochromes P450 in the whole genome sequence; however, 13 of 155 appeared to be pseudogenes due to sequence deletions and/or inframe stop codon(s). There are 87 families of A. oryzae cytochromes P450 (AoCYPs), indicating considerable phylogenetic diversity. To characterize A. oryzae AoCYPs, we attempted to isolate cDNAs using RT-PCR and determined their transcriptional capabilities. To date, we have confirmed gene expression of 133 AoCYPs and cloned 121 AoCYPs as full-length cDNAs encoding a mature open reading frame. Using experimentally deduced sequences and intron-exon organization, we analyzed AoCYPs phylogenetically. We also identified intronic consensus sequences in AoCYPs genes. The experimentally validated exonic and intronic sequences will be a powerful advantage in identification and characterization of novel P450s from various ascomycetous fungi. 3aAspergillus oryzae 3abioinformatics 3acomplementary DNA 3acytochrome P-450 3afungi 3agene expression 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3apseudogenes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astop codon 3atranscription (genetics)1 aIchinose, Hirofumi1 aWariishi, Hiroyuki0 tArchives of microbiology.g2010 May, v. 192, no. 5 p.395-408dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-010-0562-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02220naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010300160300001600263500002400279520107500303650002401378650001701402650003901419650001501458650004401473650001901517650001401536650002101550700001801571700002001589700002901609700001501638773011101653852000901764856008501773655001201858IND4435697920221118181050.0100416s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443569792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0343-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, X.12aA comparison of analytical techniques for evaluating food waste degradation by anaerobic digestion  ap. 427-438.  aIncludes references  aOrganic matter contained in food waste was degraded by anaerobic digestion under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions at two hydraulic retention times. Evolution of the digestion process was followed by thermogravimetry analysis, fluorescence spectroscopy and ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance. All analytical methods suggested that longer retention times might be required for food waste stabilization under mesophilic conditions as compared to thermophilic stabilization. All the analytical methods showed that the stabilization process consisted of two steps, where complex organic molecules were formed during initial stabilization and then digested providing sufficient hydraulic retention time. Longer hydraulic retention times were required for food waste stabilization under mesophilic conditions. Overall, thermal and ¹H NMR analyses of the digestate samples might be recommended if more detailed analysis is required, while fluorescence measurements can be used as a fast screening technique, which provides qualitative assessment of the stabilization process. 3aanaerobic digestion 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afood waste 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3ascreening 3athermogravimetry1 aCuetos, M.

Bark in pulp is undesirable because it increases the need to use chemicals for cooking and bleaching. Dry pulpwood increases energy consumption and wood loss when debarking, chipping, and refining. The bark/wood shear strength of 40 spruce and 40 pine pulpwood piles at 4 pulpmills in Sweden was studied. The piles measured 10 m3 and were evaluated over a 14- or 15-week storage period. The bark/wood shear strength did not change appreciably during the first 6 weeks of storage. After 6 weeks, an obvious increase in the shear strength was observed. Both bark/wood shear strength and green density were correlated (r2 = 0 75) with the moisture content of the sapwood. The variation within and between logs was high. Norway spruce had a higher shear strength than Scots pine. The models tested show relatively good promise for finding extremes (wood piles with a high shear strength), which can lead to unsatisfactory debarking. 3ashear strength 3apulpwood 3amodels 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3astorage 3acambium 3ameasurement 0aresistance 0awood freshness 0alogs 0abarking1 aNylinder, M.0 tForest products journal.g1996 , v. 46, no. 11/12 p.57-62x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle02529naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009700130300001400227520168400241650003101925650002201956650001601978650001101994650001702005653001202022653001802034700001602052773007902068852000902147930003302156945001302189946001302202655001202215IND2056829920221118181408.0970430e199612  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205682992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeamaster, R.L.14aThe use of an optical profilometer to measure surface roughness in medium density fiberboard  ap. 73-78.  aIn the drive for higher quality wood products, it is important to monitor surface quality at different stages of processing. Examples of where information on the surface roughness or topography can be advantageous include: monitoring the performance of sawing, planing, or abrasive processes; predicting adhesive joint performance; and assuring integrity of thin surface laminates. This study was designed to determine the sensitivity of a laser-based optical profilometer to quantify degrees of surface roughness and to detect certain machining defects on wood composites after sanding. In addition, the best parameter or combination of parameters extracted from the output signals would be determined. While previous work by the authors has shown the feasibility of applying this technology to various types of wood fiber composites, only medium density fiberboard (MDF) was studied. A matched set of MDF specimens was obtained from the National Particleboard Association (NPA) and sanded in triplicate with 80-, 120-, 150-, 180-, and 220-grit abrasives. After scanning, two specimens (sanded with 80 and 120 grit) were exposed to 18 percent equilibrium moisture content for 48 hours and rescanned to determine the sensitivity of the technique to raised grain. Additional machining defects were provided accidentally when the drum sander generated snaking on the surfaces of some specimens. NPA provided several specimens with manufacturing defects, including some with pitting and some that had been sanded sequentially with 80 and 120 grit but had some 80-grit marks. The laser system was found to be sensitive to a range of grit marks and all of the above-mentioned defects. 3amedium density fiberboards 3asurface roughness 3ameasurement 3alasers 3awood defects 0asanding 0aprofilometers1 aBeall, F.C.0 tForest products journal.g1996 , v. 46, no. 11/12 p.73-78x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle04049naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100001900183245011200202300001600314500002400330500001500354520249500369650001502864650002002879650001802899650001302917650002302930650002302953650002802976650001403004650002103018650002003039650001903059650001203078653003003090700002303120700002403143700002203167700002303189700001703212773012303229852000903352856008703361930003303448945002503481946001303506655001203519IND4431377920221118181127.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2009.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ505 0aQ2051 aAlegria, Carla10aEvaluation of a pre-cut heat treatment as an alternative to chlorine in minimally processed shredded carrot  ap. 155-161.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of a pre-cut heat treatment (100°C/45s) as an alternative decontamination treatment to chlorinated-water (200ppm active chlorine/1min, 5°C) was evaluated in minimally processed carrot (shredded). The quality of shredded carrots was studied just after minimal processing and during storage at 5°C (10days) by evaluating microbial (total mesophilic aerobic, yeast and moulds and lactic acid bacteria counts), physical-chemical (soluble solids content, pH, titratable acidity, whiteness index), physiological (peroxidase activity and headspace analysis) and sensorial attributes (colour, fresh-like appearance, aroma and general acceptance). The relationships between sensory perception of undesired changes, microbial contamination threshold, physico-chemical and physiological indices were investigated and compared between heat-treated and control samples. The use of heat in pre-cut carrot proved to be more efficient than chlorinated-water concerning microbial control (threshold concentration of 7 Log₁₀ cfu g⁻¹), providing an acceptable fresh-like quality product during 10days of storage (5°C), which corresponds to a 3-day shelf-life extension compared to control samples. Heat-treated shredded carrot showed lower respiratory and POD activities than chlorinated samples suggesting that the use of heat provides a metabolic activity lowering effect besides the microbial effect which could be important to shelf-life extension of the fresh-cut product. Industrial relevance: In minimally processed vegetables, namely in shredded carrot, chlorine solutions have been widely used by the industry for sanitization purposes. However, reduced microbiological efficiency allied to sensorial changes and eventual formation of carcinogenic chlorinated compounds pointed out the need for alternative decontamination methodologies. Also, the evermore conscious consumers are demanding minimization of the potentially negative impact of food processing on human health and the environment. From the practical experience of a fresh-cut industry directly involved in the R&D research project which supported this study, the marketability of minimally processed shredded carrot is limited due to rapid microbial growth and colour loss (decrease of orange intensity and/or whitening of the shreds). As a result, a pilot-plant scale study was performed, evaluating quality attributes of shredded carrot processed according to a clean pre-cut alternative decontamination process. 3ashelf life 3adecontamination 3afood analysis 3achlorine 3afood contamination 3asensory properties 3amicrobiological quality 3ashredding 3afood composition 3afresh-cut foods 3aheat treatment 3acarrots 0aminimally processed foods1 aPinheiro, Joaquina1 aGonçalves, Elsa M.1 aFernandes, Isabel1 aMoldão, Margarida1 aAbreu, Marta0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2010 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.155-161dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2009.10.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle02582naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156100002800165245009600193300001400289500002400303520125100327650002601578650002501604650001001629650001801639650001901657650001301676650001701689650002801706650002601734650001701760650001201777650002301789650001401812700002201826773012101848852000901969856008701978930003302065945002502098946001302123655001202136IND4431379720221118181138.0100115e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2009.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aKulshrestha, Suzanne A.10aChanges in permeability of moderate electric field (MEF) treated vegetable tissue over time  ap. 78-83.  aIncludes references  aA microscopic examination of beet tissue given a moderate electric field treatment shows that some cells lose their membrane selectivity while others remain intact. Raw, thawed, or precooked potato cylinders were chilled, and then warmed to 25°C by either allowing them to equilibrate or by MEF treatment. The conductivity from 100Hz to 20kHz and apparent dielectric constant from 100Hz to 5kHz was initially not significantly different between raw-untreated samples and raw-MEF treated samples, but over 24h, that of the raw-MEF treated samples increased while that of the raw-untreated samples remained constant. No such distinct pattern emerged from the thawed or precooked samples. The apparent dielectric constant of raw-MEF treated potato above 5kHz was not significantly different from raw-untreated potato and higher than thawed and precooked potato. None of the samples showed marked changes in dielectric constant at 5-20kHz over the 24hour period. Apparently, even mild electrical treatments permeabilize vegetable tissue, permitting enhanced diffusion. This work has implications in improving nonthermal permeabilization processes for eukaryotic cells, which can be used in fruit and vegetable drying and juice extraction operations. 3amembrane permeability 3aelectrical treatment 3abeets 3aplant tissues 3amicrostructure 3apotatoes 3apigmentation 3aelectrical conductivity 3adielectric properties 3acooked foods 3athawing 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3adiffusion1 aSastry, Sudhir K.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2010 Jan., v. 11, no. 1 p.78-83dElsevier Sciencex1466-85647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2009.10.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/03  aOther US 7aarticle04131naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002200193245009100215300001800306500002400324506007600348520183000424506003702254650002702291650001302318650001302331650001702344650002302361650001302384650001102397650002102408650001602429650001402445650002302459650001402482650001102496650001902507650001202526650001202538650002102550650001302571650001302584650002402597650003302621650001802654650002702672650004102699650001502740650002202755650003702777650003602814650002802850650002402878650001402902650002702916650002202943700001402965700002202979700002403001700001803025700002003043700002103063700002303084700001703107700002303124700002503147773011303172852000903285856005503294655001203349IND4410117620221207135819.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441011762DNAL7 a186313652pmid7 aPMC25751292pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01679.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Elizabeth14aThe complete genome sequence of Moorella thermoacetica (f.

Clostridium thermoaceticum), which is the model acetogenic bacterium that has been widely used for elucidating the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of CO and CO₂ fixation. This pathway, which is also known as the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, allows acetogenic (often called homoacetogenic) bacteria to convert glucose stoichiometrically into 3 mol of acetate and to grow autotrophically using H₂ and CO as electron donors and CO₂ as an electron acceptor. Methanogenic archaea use this pathway in reverse to grow by converting acetate into methane and CO₂. Acetogenic bacteria also couple the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway to a variety of other pathways to allow the metabolism of a wide variety of carbon sources and electron donors (sugars, carboxylic acids, alcohols and aromatic compounds) and electron acceptors (CO₂, nitrate, nitrite, thiosulfate, dimethylsulfoxide and aromatic carboxyl groups). The genome consists of a single circular 2 628 784 bp chromosome encoding 2615 open reading frames (ORFs), which includes 2523 predicted protein-encoding genes. Of these, 1834 genes (70.13%) have been assigned tentative functions, 665 (25.43%) matched genes of unknown function, and the remaining 24 (0.92%) had no database match. A total of 2384 (91.17%) of the ORFs in the M. thermoacetica genome can be grouped in orthologue clusters. This first genome sequence of an acetogenic bacterium provides important information related to how acetogens engage their extreme metabolic diversity by switching among different carbon substrates and electron donors/acceptors and how they conserve energy by anaerobic respiration. Our genome analysis indicates that the key genetic trait for homoacetogenesis is the core acs gene cluster of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMoorella thermoacetica 3aacetates 3aalcohols 3aanaerobiosis 3aaromatic compounds 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acarboxylic acids 3achromosomes 3adatabases 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agenetic traits 3aglucose 3amethane 3amultigene family 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aopen reading frames 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Bacterial 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Order 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxgenetics 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology1 aXie, Gary1 aBarabote, Ravi D.1 aSaunders, Elizabeth1 aHan, Cliff S.1 aDetter, John C.1 aRichardson, Paul1 aBrettin, Thomas S.1 aDas, Amaresh1 aLjungdahl, Lars G.1 aRagsdale, Stephen W.0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2008 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.2550-2573dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01679.x 7aarticle02870naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092024002200118024001900140040001800159100001900177245009100196300001800287500002400305506007600329520136100405506003701766650001101803650001601814650002101830650001401851650001101865650002101876650000901897650001301906650000801919650001401927650001301941650001901954650001401973650001801987650002502005700002202030700001902052700001402071700001402085700001702099700002102116700002102137700001602158773010602174852000902280856003902289655001202328IND4439535720221207141915.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443953572DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.30772doi7 aPMC47064492pmcid7 a199983242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tengfei10aPharmacology and immunological actions of a herbal medicine ASHMITM on allergic asthma  ap. 1047-1055.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAllergic asthma is a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease for which there is no satisfactory treatment. Studies reported tolerability and efficacy of an anti-asthma herbal medicine intervention (ASHMI) for asthma patients, developed from traditional Chinese medicine. To investigate the pharmacological actions of ASHMI on early- and late-phase airway responses (EAR and LAR), Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice received 6 weeks of ASHMI treatment beginning 24 h following the first intratracheal OVA challenge. EAR were determined 30 min following the fourth challenge and LAR 48 h following the last challenge. ASHMI effects on cytokine secretion, murine tracheal ring contraction and human bronchial smooth muscle cell prostaglandin (PG) production were also determined.ASHMI abolished EAR, which was associated with significantly reduced histamine, leukotriene C4, and OVA-specific IgE levels, as well as LAR, which was associated with significantly reduced bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) eosinophils, decreased airway remodeling, and lower Th2 cytokine levels in BALF and splenocyte cultures. Furthermore, ASHMI inhibited contraction of murine tracheal rings and increased production of the potent smooth muscle relaxer PGI₂. ASHMI abrogation of allergic airway responses is associated with broad effects on asthma pathological mechanisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasthma 3aeosinophils 3aherbal medicines 3ahistamine 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin E 3amice 3amyocytes 3aova 3aovalbumin 3apatients 3aprostaglandins 3asecretion 3asmooth muscle 3atraditional medicine1 aSrivastava, Kamal1 aWen, Ming-Chun1 aYang, Nan1 aCao, Jing1 aBusse, Paula1 aBirmingham, Neil1 aGoldfarb, Joseph1 aLi, Xiu-Min0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.1047-1055dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.3077 7aarticle01547naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012200126300001400248520070200262650001300964650001400977650002200991650002101013650001201034651001101046653001201057700001801069773007801087852000901165930003301174945001301207946001301220655001201233IND2060686220221118181038.0971128e199705  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206068622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, M.14aThe effects of marketing practices on stumpage returns in nonindustrial private forest timber sales in western Oregon  ap. 23-28.  aWe evaluated the effects of marketing practices on net stumpage returns in 99 timber sales by using data from a mail survey of western Oregon nonindustrial private-forest owners who harvested timber in 1991. Most landowners did not use the active marketing practices commonly recommended by foresters. Lower-than-average stumpage returns were associated with the use of passive marketing practices: relying on a logger to manage the sale, contacting only one or two potential buyers, paying the logger on a proceeds-split basis, and allowing the buyer to initiate the sale. The landowners' self-assessed degree of knowledge about log prices was also significantly associated with stumpage returns. 3astumpage 3amarketing 3acosts and returns 3aprivate forestry 3asurveys 3aOregon 0atimbers1 aCleaves, D.A.0 tForest products journal.g1997 May, v. 47, no. 5 p.23-28x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle02780naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245010600155300001800261500001500279520155000294650002501844650001501869650000901884650002701893650003001920650001401950650002401964650002301988653001802011653002602029653001702055653003402072700001702106773010202123852000902225856007702234930003302311945001302344946001302357655001202370IND2053329620221118180826.0961002e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205332962DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950705y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickinson, E.10aRheology of milk protein gels and protein-stabilized emulsion gels cross-linked with transglutaminase  ap. 1371-1377.  a2019-12-04  aOscillatory shear measurements have been used to investigate the rheological properties of enzymically cross-linked milk protein gels at neutral pH with and without emulsion droplets. A Ca2+-independent transglutaminase extracted from microorganisms was used as the enzyme source. Storage and loss moduli are presented for gels formed from enzyme-treated beta-lactoglobulin solutions (13 and 14 wt % protein) and beta-lactoglobulin-stabilized emulsions (7-9 wt % protein, 32.5 wt % oil). The frequency dependence of the small-deformation elastic moduli of the enzyme-treated gels is weaker than for the equivalent heat-set beta-lactoglobulin gels (90 degrees C for 30 min), and the strain dependence of the elastic moduli of the enzyme-treated gels is of opposite sign to that of the heat-set gels at large deformations. These differences in rheological behavior are consistent with a network consisting of permanent covalent cross-links for the enzyme-induced gels and predominantly physical cross-links for the heat-set gels. Thermal processing after enzyme treatment is very effective in making a strong gel from either a beta-lactoglobulin solution or a beta-lactoglobulin-stabilized emulsion. Lecithin addition to the beta-lactoglobulin-stabilized emulsion gel before enzyme treatment was found to have a weakly positive effect on the gel strength arising from lecithin-protein complexation. When beta-lactoglobulin was replaced with sodium caseinate, the rate and extent of enzyme-induced cross-linking was found to increase substantially. 3aphosphatidylcholines 3acaseinates 3agels 3arheological properties 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aemulsions 3athermal degradation 3abeta-lactoglobulin 0adairy protein 0aprotein cross-linkage 0ainteractions 0alecithin-protein interactions1 aYamamoto, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.1371-1377x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950705y3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02406naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001600139245006800155300001600223520112500239650002201364650001101386650001101397650001101408650001501419650002401434650001501458650001601473650001501489650001901504650002201523653001401545653002401559653001601583653001501599700001701614700001901631700002001650700001901670773010001689852000901789856007901798930003301877945001301910946001301923655001201936IND2053140820221118180840.0960920e199502  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205314082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00050a0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCross, J.W.10aTransport and metabolism of pollen suppressant SC-2053 in wheat  ap. 548-556.  aSC-2053, 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-oxo-5-(methoxyethoxy)cinnoline-3 -carboxylic acid, is a pollen suppressant (chemical hybridizing agent) in wheat. Metabolism of this compound was studied using [14C]SC-2053 labeled uniformly in the chlorophenyl ring. Wheat plants were treated when the spike was 2-4 cm in length. The floral spike contained about 10% of the label taken up into the plant 4 days after treatment, 15% 14 days after treatment. Unchanged [14C]SC-2053 plus two more polar metabolites were 90-95% of the total 14C extracted from the plants 14 days after treatment. The more polar metabolite was a glycoside of the other. Treated wheat plants and wheat callus cultures metabolized [14C]SC-2053 by a similar route. The aglycon purified from a callus culture filtrate was identified as 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-oxo-5-(2-hydroxyethoxy)cinnoline 3-carboxylic acid. This alcohol results from demethylation of the 5-methoxyethoxy group. In plants this metabolite is glycosylated, but in callus cultures only the initial demethylated compound accumulated in the medium. The major metabolite in mature straw was the glycoside. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aleaves 3acallus 3apollen 3ametabolism 3amechanism of action 3aseparation 3ametabolites 3aglycosides 3ainflorescences 3aspectral analysis 0astructure 0atransport processes 0agametocides 0acinnolines1 aHerzmark, P.1 aGuilford, W.L.1 aPatterson, T.G.1 aLabovitz, J.N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.548-556x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00050a0543Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03256naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245010500205300001800310500002400328500001500352520151400367650002801881650001201909650002701921650002201948650002901970650001401999650001702013650003002030650002102060650001302081650002602094650001702120650001102137650001602148650002702164650001902191650002002210650000902230650002002239653001202259653003002271653001302301653002402314700001502338700001502353773011102368852000902479856008302488930003302571945002502604946001302629655001202642IND4397809020221118181147.0071113e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439780902DNAL7 a189441682pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-97-9-10402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF8311 aTanguay, P.10aIdentifying Pigmentation-Related Genes in Ophiostoma piceae Using Agrobacterium-Mediated Integration  ap. 1040-1048.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWood sapstain, a cosmetic defect that results in significant economical loss to forest-products industries, is caused by mycelial melanization of the wood-colonizing ophiostomatoid fungi. To improve our understanding of how melanin biosynthesis is regulated in the cosmopolitan sapstaining fungus, Ophiostoma piceae, we used insertional mutagenesis. Insertional mutants were generated by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) and Agrobacterium-mediated integration (AMI). We screened 1,053 REMI and 1,083 AMI transformants and found 30 mutants with impaired growth or pigmentation. We characterized four AMI transformants in more detail, in which the T-DNA integrated at a single locus. The albino mutant TOPA45 had incorporated the T-DNA in a polyketide synthase gene (PKS1). The mutants TOPA1 and TOPA1076 displayed reduced pigmentation. In TOPA1, the T-DNA was inserted into a gene that encodes a putative protein kinase activator whereas, for TOPA1076, it was inserted into a gene that encodes a protein with unknown function. Finally, the vegetative hyphae of mutant TOPA814 were not melanized, whereas the synnemata displayed the same level of pigmentation as the wild type. In the TOPA814 mutant, segregation analysis revealed that the mutant phenotype was not linked to the T-DNA insertion locus but to a translocation from the PIG1 locus to the left border of the T-DNA. The protein predicted for the PIG1 locus had a middle homology region that was specific to fungal transcription factors. 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3amelanin 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aOphiostoma piceae 3achromosome translocation 3aphenotype 3apigmentation 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene segregation 3amycelium 3atranscription factors 3atransfer DNA 3ahyphae 3apolyketides 3agenetic transformation 3asapstain fungi 3aprotein kinases 3aloci 3afungal proteins 0aenzymes 0aprotein kinase activators 0apigments 0apolyketide synthase1 aTangen, K.1 aBreuil, C.0 tPhytopathology.g2007 Sept., v. 97, no. 9 p.1040-1048dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-9-10403Available from publisher's Web site  a20080430b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle03859naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007700168300001600245500001500261520265100276650001702927650002102944650000902965650001402974650002002988650001803008650002103026650001903047650002303066650002003089653002203109653001203131653001203143700001903155700001903174773007903193852000903272856008503281930003303366945001303399946001303412655001203425IND2058635120221118181628.0970725s1996    nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205863512DNAL7 a10.1080/019041696093651322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrossopoulos, J.B.10aSeasonal dynamics of mineral nutrient by walnut tree reproductive organs  ap. 421-434.  a2019-12-04  aThe dry weight accumulation per male and female flower as well as the concentration per gram of dry weight and the accumulation of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) were determined in walnut tree (Juglans regia L.) catkins and female flowers at the stage of flower bud and during the flower development. Catkin emergence was accompanied by a very fast hydration of the tissues. After the catkin matured, the fresh and dry weights were reduced. The female flower development period was accompanied by the dry and fresh weight increase. Total N, P, K, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn concentrations in catkin buds were detected at lower levels, Mg in equal levels, and Ca at higher levels as compared to the nutrient concentrations in young growing leaves. The estimated values of the ratio NCmfb/NCygl were: total N = 0.54, P = 0.83, K = 0.56, Ca = 1.5, Mg = 1.0, Fe = 0.46, Mn = 0.71, Cu = 0.85, and Zn = 0.60. Nutrient concentration in female flower buds was detected in almost equal levels with the exception of total N and Fe. The estimated values of the ratio: NCffb/NCygl were: total N = 0.57, P = 1.1, K = 1.17, Ca = 1.06, Mg = 0.9, Fe = 0.47, Mn = 1.0, Cu = 0.92, and Zn = 0.85. Total N, P, Mn, Cu, and Zn accumulations in the catkin were increased during the fast growing phase and decreased after catkin maturing. Potassium, Mg, and Fe accumulation continued to increase in the mature catkin. Calcium accumulation decreased at a very late mature catkin phase. Total N, P, and K accumulation rates during the catkin fast growing phase were higher than the dry weight accumulation rate. Calcium, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn accumulation rates at the same period were lower or equal to dry weight accumulation rates. In mature catkins, the total N, P, Mn, Cu, and Zn depletion rates were higher than the dry weight depletion rate. The continual increase of K, Ca, Mg, and Fe accumulation in mature catkin resulted in the increase of nutrients concentration also. Total N and P showed the highest remobilization values from mature catkin of 51.4% and 45%, respectively. Calcium, K, Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn remobilization values estimated to be 22.1%, 7.5%, 3.2%, 45.3%, 33.4%, and 31.8%, respectively. Iron showed no remobilization at all. Nutrients remobilization from catkins as compared to the leaves had almost similar values for total N, Zn, and Cu, higher for P, Ca, and Mn, and lower for Mg, Fe, and K. Accumulation of all nutrients in female flowers increased after fertilization. The dry weight accumulation rate was higher than the nutrient accumulation rates. 3amale flowers 3anutrient content 3abuds 3aflowering 3aplant nutrition 3aJuglans regia 3anitrogen content 3afemale flowers 3aseasonal variation 3amineral content 0amineral nutrition 0acatkins 0aflowers1 aKouchaji, G.G.1 aBouranis, D.L.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1996, v. 19, no. 2 p.421-434x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041696093651323Available from publisher's Web site  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03570naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001700183245013200200300001600332500002400348500001500372520141300387650002701800650001801827650002301845650002001868650002301888650002001911650001801931650001501949650002001964650002701984650002202011650001602033650001202049650003402061650003002095650005802125650000902183650003202192650002402224650002202248650002902270650003102299650003702330650002902367650001402396650001002410653000902420653002002429653002002449653002302469700003202492700003302524700001902557773012902576852000902705856007702714930003302791945002502824946001102849655001202860IND4431488120221118181640.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148812DNAL7 a203550702pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.38412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL2001 aParvin, Rana10aEffect of dietary level of methionine on growth performance and immune response in Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica)  ap. 471-481.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Methionine (Met) being the first limiting amino acid in maize/soybean-based quail diets, its supplementation provides scope for improvement of protein quality and reduction of dietary protein concentration. The question remains to what extent it can be incorporated in the diet of genetically improved quails. Therefore the effect of dietary Met level was assessed on growth performance and immune response in growing Japanese quails (n = 400) divided equally into 20 groups. Five dietary treatments (~230 g kg⁻¹ crude protein and 12.14 MJ kg⁻¹ metabolisable energy) were formulated with 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 g kg⁻¹ Met respectively, and each was offered to four groups of birds from 0 to 35 days of age.RESULTS: Live weight at day 35 increased (P < 0.0001) up to 5.0 g kg⁻¹ dietary Met level but did not improve further at higher Met levels (5.5 and 6.0 g kg⁻¹). Improved (P < 0.039) feed conversion ratio was achieved at 5.5 g kg⁻¹ Met level, which was statistically similar to that at 5.0 g kg⁻¹ Met level during 0-14 days of age. Cellular (phytohaemagglutinin from Phaseolus vulgaris) immune response increased (P < 0.0001) with increasing dietary Met concentration, whereas humoral (sheep red blood cells) immune response did not differ.CONCLUSION: The optimal requirement of Met was 5.0 g kg⁻¹ for growth and 5.5 g kg⁻¹ for maximum cellular immune response. 3achemical concentration 3aanimal growth 3aexperimental diets 3apoultry feeding 3atransgenic animals 3aliveweight gain 3acrude protein 3amethionine 3aimmune response 3aamino acid composition 3aCoturnix japonica 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCoturnixxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxstandards 2aDietary Supplements 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aErythrocytesxmetabolism 2aHemagglutininsxmetabolism 2aImmunity, Cellularxdrug effects 2aMethioninexpharmacology 2aPhaseolus 2aSheep 0adiet 0aJapanese quails 0aprotein content 0aanimal performance1 aMandal, A.

As this entity is not associated with prothrombin time elevation, it is important to determine whether alternate methods can help identify it. We investigated subtle vitamin K depletion in a hospital setting and determined whether protein-calorie malnutrition predicts its presence. Design, setting, subjects: Using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay of plasma phylloquinone and a food frequency questionnaire for phylloquinone intake, we examined the phylloquinone status of 27 hospitalized patients with normal coagulation parameters, no liver disease, and no recent warfarin use. We assessed protein-calorie nutritional status with Reilly's criteria and anthropometrics. Results: 51% of patients (95% Cl = 31% to 70%) had evidence of subtle vitamin K depletion as defined by a subnormal plasma phylloquinone concentration. Patients whose phylloquinone intake was less than the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) over the preceding year had lower plasma phylloquinone concentrations when compared to other patients: median (range) 0.106 nmol/l (0.022-0.461) versus 0.301 nmol/l (0.067-3.928), respectively (P = 0.023). Plasma phylloquinone concentrations were no different, however, between well-nourished and malnourished patients: median (range) 0.245 nmol/l (0.022-0.522) versus 0.188 nmol/l (0.067-3.928), respectively (P = 0.782). Conclusions: Subtle vitamin K depletion is common among hospitalized patients and protein-calorie malnutrition does not predict its presence. 3anutrient intake 3afood intake 3amalnutrition 3aphylloquinone 3amen 3awomen 3aprothrombin 3athromboplastin 3aanthropometric measurements 3apatients 3ablood plasma 3aprediction 3aMassachusetts 0aprotein energy deficiency 0adepletion 0avitamin deficiencies 0avitamin K1 aLennon, C.1 aO'Brien, M.1 aBooth, S.L.1 aSadowski, J.1 aMason, J.B.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1998 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.934-937x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03345naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007800128300001600206500001500222520207900237650001602316650001802332650001802350650002002368650001602388650003202404650001202436650002302448650002502471650001102496650001602507650002502523650001202548650002602560650001402586650002302600651001202623653001602635653001902651700001602670700001602686773009502702852000902797930003302806945001302839946001102852655001202863IND2198212220221118181601.0990417e199805  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219821222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuillaume, M.10aObesity and nutrition in children. The Belgian Luxembourg Child Safety IV  ap. 323-328.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To analyse the association between nutritional and familial factors and obesity in boys and girls. Design: Randomized, cross-sectional population study. Setting: Province de Luxembourg, Belgium. Subjects: One thousand and twenty-eight boys and girls in age strata 6-8, 8-10 and 10-12 y, comprising 70.3% of primary cohort. Methods: Examinations included anthropometric measurements and questionnaires covering familial, socio-economic and psychosocial factors. A three day dietary record was obtained in 955 children. This was analysed in relation to the anthropometric data. Results: In comparison with similar studies from other regions and recommended allowances, the intakes of total energy, fat, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol, were high, while consumption of carbohydrate and fiber was low, as well as the polyunsaturated/saturated ratio of fat. Total energy intake showed no or weakly significant correlations with anthropometric factors. However, total fat (P = 0.045) and saturated fat (P = 0.0005) intake showed consistent positive correlations with body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and skinfold thickness, with corresponding negative relationships to carbohydrate intake (P = 0.034) in boys. Such relationships were also found when calculated as energy density. These associations were not statistically significant in girls. The high fat, low carbohydrate pattern of the nutritional status seemed to be more pronounced in families where the father had a low level of education (lipids, boys, P = 0.0007), and where both parents were obese (saturated fat, boys, P = 0.023), suggesting involvement of socioeconomic and familial factors. Conclusion: The lack of correlation between factors indicating obesity and total energy intake suggests that the positive energy balance causing obesity is due mainly to a low energy output. However, since energy intake measurements are imprecise, overeating can not be excluded, particularly since elevated consumption of food with high contents of fat, found in these children seems to be poorly regulated. 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3aenergy intake 3aschool children 3adietary fat 3aanthropometric measurements 3aparents 3agender differences 3adietary carbohydrate 3aheight 3acholesterol 3asocioeconomic status 3aobesity 3asaturated fatty acids 3aeducation 3askinfold thickness 3aBelgium 0abody weight 0aenergy balance1 aLapidus, L.1 aLambert, A.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1998 May, v. 52, no. 5 p.323-328x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02879naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001500169245013200184300001500316500002400331500001500355520144700370650002801817650001901845650002201864650002201886650002001908650002201928650001901950650001601969650001801985653001902003653000902022653002702031700001502058700001802073700001402091700001602105773010702121852000902228856009102237930003302328945002502361946001102386655001202397IND4397670420221118181632.0071109e20070709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439767042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2007.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aK0001 aNakaya, K.10aSpatial averaging effect on local flux measurement using a displaced-beam small aperture scintillometer above the forest canopy  ap. 97-109.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA scintillometer is a turbulence-measuring instrument that comprises a transmitter and a receiver. It obtains a spatially averaged flux because of its long measurement path. We used a displaced-beam small aperture scintillometer (DBSAS) 10 m above an 18 m-high deciduous forest canopy with an 86 m optical measurement path during June-November 2002 and 2003. We compared the dissipation rates of temperature fluctuations measured by DBSAS and eddy-covariance (EC) systems. Results showed that the difference in dissipation rates using the different sensors changed according to the normalized vertical wind deviation, which is linked to convective and mechanical mixing of the atmosphere, and the wind direction. The energy imbalance of the EC measurements, which is the validity criteria of the flux measurement, changed according to the difference of dissipation rates between the DBSAS and the EC. The contribution of the local vertical advection, which caused the energy imbalance, was small for the DBSAS even in conditions in which the mechanical mixing of the atmosphere was poor. The wind direction dependency of the difference of dissipation rates was inferred to result from the source area differences between the DBSAS and EC system. Considering its larger source area of flux measurement, the DBSAS applied to a mixed forest is concluded to measure a more spatially averaged turbulence signal than the EC in the flux measurement. 3aatmospheric circulation 3aturbulent flow 3adeciduous forests 3ameasuring devices 3aair temperature 3aspatial variation 3awind direction 3ameasurement 3aheat transfer 0ascintillometry 0awind 0aeddy covariance method1 aSuzuki, C.1 aKobayashi, T.1 aIkeda, H.1 aYasuike, S.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2007 July 9, v. 145, no. 1-2 p.97-109dElsevierx0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2007.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02574naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008300124300001600207520138300223650001101606650001601617650001501633650001701648650002301665650002701688650001401715650002001729651001001749653002001759653001001779700001501789700001501804700001901819700002301838700002001861700001901881700001901900700001701919700001801936773009601954852000902050930003302059945001302092946001102105655001202116IND2201288220221118181636.0991025e199903  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220128822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgudo, A.10aDietary intake of vegetables and fruits among adults in fiber regions of Spain  ap. 174-180.  aObjective: To assess the consumption of vegetables and fruits (V&F) in adults from five regions in Spain according to sex, age and educational level. Design: Cross-sectional study within the members of the EPIC cohort in Spain. Setting: Three regions of the north of Spain (Asturias, Guipuzcoa and Navarra) and two regions of the south of Spain Granada and Murcia). Subjects: 41448 healthy volunteers (15365 men, 25813 women), aged 29-69 y. Interventions: Information on habitual diet during the previous year was collected by means of a computerised version of a diet history questionnaire. Results: Among men, the mean daily consumption of vegetables and of fruits was 273.7 g (3.4 servings) and 348.3 g (4.4 servings) respectively. Among women the corresponding vegetables and fruit intakes per day were 244.4 g (3.1 servings) and 349.4 g (4.4 servings). The total V&F intake tended to increase with age and educational level. Overall, 74% of subjects consumed 400 g/d (5 servings) of vegetables and fruit. Conclusions: Consumption of vegetables and fruits in healthy adults in Spain is considerably higher than in most European countries and the United States; this complies with what is considered to be the Mediterranean diet. Despite some regional differences, there were no clearly differentiated patterns of V&F intake between southern and northern regions within Spain 3aadults 3afood intake 3avegetables 3afood choices 3agender differences 3ageographical variation 3aeducation 3adietary surveys 3aSpain 0aage differences 0afruit1 aAmiano, P.1 aBarcos, A.1 aBarricarte, A.1 aBeguiristain, J.M.1 aChirlaque, M.D.1 aDorronsoro, M.1 aGonzalez, C.A.1 aLasheras, C.1 aMartínez, C.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1999 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.174-180x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03650naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002100174245011800195300001600313500002400329500001500353520144800368650002101816650002501837650002301862650001701885650001101902650002601913650001201939650002001951650001301971650001401984650001501998650002202013650002202035650002102057650002502078650001402103650002302117650001002140650003402150650004002184650001702224650004002241650001702281650002202298650001402320650003002334650003702364650004102401651001002442651001002452653002302462653002502485700002702510700001902537700002102556700002202577700002102599773012902620852000902749856007702758930003302835945002502868946001102893655001202904IND4431487620140725000000.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148762DNAL7 a203550652pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.38352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ125 0aQ5051 aAzokpota, Paulin10aVolatile compounds profile and sensory evaluation of Beninese condiments produced by inocula of Bacillus subtilis  ap. 438-444.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: Three Beninese food condiments (ABS1₂₄h, IBS2₄₈h and SBS3₄₈h) were produced by controlled fermentation of African locust beans using inocula of pure cultures of Bacillus subtilis, BS1, BS2 and BS3, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of the volatile compounds in the condiments produced have been performed using the Likens-Nickerson simultaneous distillation-extraction method and GC-MS analysis, followed by a sensory evaluation in comparison with the spontaneously fermented condiments.RESULTS: A total of 94 volatile compounds have been found including 53 compounds identified in relatively high concentrations and were subdivided into seven main groups with the predominance of four major groups: pyrazines, aldehydes, ketones and alcohols. Compared to the spontaneously fermented condiments, volatile compounds identified in controlled fermented condiments have been found in high number and in concentrations which varied according to the inoculum of B. subtilis used. The condiments produced with starter cultures scored significantly (P < 0.05) higher for odour than the spontaneously fermented condiments. But the overall acceptability (7/10) of the two types of condiments was similar.CONCLUSION: The investigated B. subtilis, BS1, BS2 and BS3 can be considered as potential starter cultures for the fermentation of African locust beans to produce good quality of Beninese food condiments. 3astarter cultures 3achemical composition 3avolatile compounds 3afermentation 3aParkia 3aquantitative analysis 3aketones 3afermented foods 3aalcohols 3apyrazines 3acondiments 3aBacillus subtilis 3atraditional foods 3afood composition 3aqualitative analysis 3aaldehydes 3afood acceptability 3aodors 2aBacillus subtilisxmetabolism 2aCondimentsxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aDistillation 2aFabaceaexmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aOdorants. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aSeedsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 3aBenin 0aBenin 0asensory properties 0aAfrican locust beans1 aHounhouigan, Joseph D.1 aAnnan, Nana T.1 aOdjo, Théophile1 aNago, Mathurin C.1 aJakobsen, Mogens0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2010 Feb., v. 90, no. 3 p.438-444dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.38353Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/04/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01761naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245011700154300001600271520048900287650002100776650001000797650002200807650002300829650001200852650001600864650001400880650002600894650004400920653001800964653001600982653001900998700001601017700001801033700001401051700001501065773010001080852000901180856007901189930003301268945001301301946001301314655001201327IND2053123720221118181417.0960919e199502  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205312372DNAL7 a10.1021/jf00050a0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFronza, G.10aNatural abundance 2H nuclear magnetic resonance study of the origin of 2-phenylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate  ap. 439-443.  aThe site-specific natural abundance deuterium distribution of 2-phenylethanol (1) and 2-phenylethyl acetate (2) obtained through a variety of methods has been determined by 2H NMR spectroscopy.

The antimutagens in these herbs were purified by chromatographically monitoring the antimutagenicity with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain. Instrumental elucidation found that the active compound isolated from these herbs was 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-4H-1-benzopyran 4-one (luteolin), a common flavonoid. Luteolin was a desmutagen against Trp-P-2 but not a bioantimutagen. Chlorophyll was also found to be a desmutagen but required a larger dose. Other common phytochemicals, alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, xanthophylls, sterols, and saponins, were almost nonactive against Trp-P-2. These results revealed that luteolin contributed greatly to the antimutagenicity against Trp-P-2 in these herbs. 3aextracts 3adiet 3aneoplasms 3achemical constituents of plants 3adisease prevention 3aflavones 3aindoles 3abioassays 3acarcinogens 3aSalvia officinalis 3aMentha piperita 3aThymus vulgaris 0apurification 0adietary anticarcinogen 0aantimutagenicity tests 0adietary antimutagens1 aKanazawa, K.1 aAshida, H.1 aDanno, G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1995 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.410-414x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00050a0293Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03302naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245016500177300001000342520199700352592002802349650001502377650002402392650001602416650001002432650001302442650001902455650001502474650001902489650001902508650001702527650001402544650001702558650002502575651001102600700007002611773013102681856008302812852000902895655001202904IND60762754120221119083130.0221002e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076275412DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-021-00588-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOluwole, Adewumi Olufemi10aPhotocatalytic degradation of tetracycline in aqueous systems under visible light irridiation using needle-like SnO2 nanoparticles anchored on exfoliated g-C3N4  ap. 5.  aBACKGROUND: Pharmaceuticals is one of the groups of contaminants of emerging concern that are resistant to decomposition or removal by most of the existing water and wastewater treatment procedures, hence the need to develop techniques to facilitate the removals of this group of organic contaminants from water systems. In this study, needle-like SnO₂ nanoparticles was synthesised and loaded on exfoliated g-C₃N₄ nanosheet through a hydrothermal method, for use as sensitive visible light induce-photocatalyst for the decomposition of tetracycline in aqueous systems. The synthesised composites was characterized and analysed for the nature of the heterojunction between the SnO₂ nanoparticle and g-C₃N₄ nanosheet using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. RESULTS: The composites were of improved surface properties and enhanced visible-light absorption. The synthesised SnO₂/g-C₃N₄ nanocomposites with various amounts of SnO₂ (10–50 mg), employed in the degradation of tetracycline under visible light irradiation, were of good degradation efficiency. The degradation efficiencies of tetracycline by 1 wt.%, 2 wt.%, 3 wt.% and 5 wt.% SnO₂/g-C₃N₄ photocatalyst were 81.54%, 90.57%, 95.90% and 92.15% as compared to g-C₃N₄ and SnO₂ with 40.92% and 51.32% degradation efficiencies. The synergistic interaction between the needle-like SnO₂ and exfoliated g-C₃N₄ nanosheet promoted the separation of photogenerated electron holes pairs, which enhanced their migration rate between SnO2 and g-C3N4 heterojunction, thereby facilitating the degradation of tetracycline. The ·O₂⁻ was noted to be the major reactive species in the photocatalytic of the 3 wt.% SnO₂/g-C₃N₄ nanocomposite. CONCLUSION: The fabricated SnO₂ nanoparticles anchored on exfoliated g-C₃N₄ showed good performance for the decomposition of tetracycline in water, with possible application on other pharmaceuticals having same moiety (similar chemical structures).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ahot water treatment 3airradiation 3alight 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aspectroscopy 3asynergism 3atetracycline 3awastewater treatment 3aEurope1 aOlatunji, Olatunde Stephen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8348-13530 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2022 Dec., v. 34, no. 1 p.5-5dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00588-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011700164520171400281592002801995650001302023650001002036650002702046650001202073650001902085650001302104650001502117650001702132650001902149650000902168650002002177650001502197650001502212651001502227700002102242700002902263700002202292700002602314700002002340700002302360700002302383700002002406700002502426773012302451856008102574852000902655655001202664IND60760520420221116172007.0211223e20211204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076052042DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111224722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Markus 10aCompetition of Plants and Microorganisms for Added Nitrogen in Different Fertilizer Forms in a Semi-Arid Climate  aIn nitrogen (N) -limited agricultural systems, a high microbial immobilization of applied fertilizer-N can limit its availability to plants. However, there is scarce information on the effect of the form of fertilizer used on the plant–microorganism competition in clay-rich soils under a severe semi-arid climate. In a field study, we investigated the wheat–microorganism competition after the direct application of NH₄¹⁵NO₃ closely to seeds in arable fields in North Kazakhstan, documenting the effect of the use of liquid versus granular fertilizer and mini-tillage versus no-tillage. Our results barely showed any fertilizer-N translocation in the soil. Plants outcompete microorganisms for fertilizer-N during the vegetation period. Microbial-to-plant ¹⁵N ratios revealed a predominant fertilizer-¹⁵N uptake by plants. The strong competition for N was mainly related to the placement of the fertilizer close to the seeds. Moreover, the long time interval between fertilization and sampling enhanced the competition for N, meaning that previously microbially immobilized N became available to plants through the death of microorganisms and their subsequent mineralization. The fertilizer distribution between microorganisms and plants did depend on the form of fertilizer used, owing to the good solubility of granular fertilizer. The smaller fertilizer-N uptake under the no-tilling condition was probably due to the more intense soil compaction, which caused a reduction in plant growth. The application of fertilizer close to the seeds and the small fertilizer translocation during the vegetation period ultimately resulted in a high level of plant N being derived from the fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3adeath 3afertilizer application 3aliquids 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3ano-tillage 3aplant growth 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asoil compaction 3asolubility 3avegetation 3aKazakhstan1 aAkshalov, Kanat 1 aCarstens, Jannis Florian1 aShibistova, Olga 1 aStange, Claus Florian1 aThiedau, Simon 1 aKassymova, Alfiya 1 aSauheitl, Leopold 1 aMeinel, Tobias 1 aGuggenberger, Georg 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Dec. 04, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111224723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008200168300001600250500001900266520163800285592002801923650002001951650001301971650001501984650001901999650001402018650001402032653001802046653001502064653002502079653001902104700002202123700003002145700002202175773010202197856008602299852000902385655001202394IND60695257920210619000000.0200516e20050901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069525792DNAL7 a10.1080/15572536.2006.118327742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulden, Gro10aGalerina Earle: A polyphyletic genus in the consortium of dark-spored agarics  ap. 823-837.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe basidiomycete genus Galerina Earle accommodates more than 300 small brown-spored agarics worldwide, predominantly described from the Northern hemisphere. The delimitation of species and infrageneric units hitherto has been based on morphological and, to some extent, ecological characters. In this study we have analyzed nuclear ribosomal LSU and ITS sequences to reveal infrageneric phylogeny and the phylogenetic placement of Galerina among the dark-spored agarics. Sequences from 36 northern hemisphere Galerina species and 19 other dark-spored taxa were analyzed, some of them obtained from EMBL/GenBank. Our results, received from Bayesian and distance methods, strongly suggest that Galerina is a polyphyletic genus. The LSU analysis shows that Galerina is composed of three or four separate monophyletic main groups. In addition, a few species cluster together with other dark-spored agarics. The same groups are recognized in the ITS tree and they correspond roughly to previously recognized subgenera or sections in Galerina. With high support our LSU analysis suggests that Gymnopilus is a monophyletic genus and that Gymnopilus and one of the Galerina lineages (“mycenopsis”) are sister groups. The analyses further indicate that the Galerina lineages, as well as the genus Gymnopilus, could be referred to a strongly emendated family Strophariaceae, which corresponds largely to the family as circumscribed by Kühner (1980). Our results affirm that morphological characters often are highly homoplastic in the agarics. At the present stage formal taxonomic consequences or nomenclatural changes are not proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aGalerina 3aGymnopilus 3aStrophariaceae 3amonophyly 3apolyphyly 0aBasidiomycota 0aAgaricales 0abrown-spored agarics 0aCortinariaceae1 aStensrud, Øyvind1 aShalchian-Tabrizi, Kamran1 aKauserud, Håvard0 tMycologia.g2005 Sept. 1, v. 97, no. 4 p.823-837dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15572536.2006.118327743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245013900210300001800349506007600367520166400443592002802107596004702135506003702182650001302219650001502232650004602247650001202293650000902305650001002314650001102324650002602335650001202361650001402373650001302387650001302400650001002413650003002423650002502453651001002478700003302488700002002521700001702541700001902558700002002577700001602597773014802613856008202761852000902843655001202852IND60687995420221207073356.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068799542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02492-02doi7 aPMC71363132pmcid7 a320605802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Theresa10aIdentification and quantification of cannabinol as a biomarker for local hemp retting in an ancient sedimentary record by HPTLC-ESI-MS  ap. 2633-2644.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCannabis products have been used in various fields of everyday life for many centuries, and applications in folk medicine and textile production have been well-known for many centuries. For traditional textile production, hemp fibers were extracted from the stems by water retting in stagnant or slow-moving waters. During this procedure, parts of the plant material‚ among them phytocannabinoids‚ are released into the water. Cannabinol (CBN) is an important degradation product of the predominant phytocannabinoids found in Cannabis species. Thus, it is an excellent indicator for present as well as ancient hemp water retting. In this study, we developed and validated a simple and fast method for the determination of CBN in sediment samples using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), thereby testing different extraction and cleanup procedures‚ as well as various sorbents and solvents for planar chromatography. This method shows a satisfactory overall analytical performance with an average recovery rate of 73%. Our protocol enabled qualitative and quantitative analyses of CBN in samples of a bottom sediment core‚ having been obtained from a small lake in Northern India, where intense local retting of hemp was suggested in the past. The analyses showed a maximum CBN content in pollen zone 4 covering a depth range of 262–209 cm, dating from approximately 480 BCE to 1050 CE. These findings correlate with existing records of Cannabis-type pollen. Thus, the method we propose is a helpful tool to track ancient hemp retting activities.

This kind of assay can be completed by the following two steps: (1) PS quenches the fluorescence of dye-labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes very effectively when they are brought into close proximity as a result of the adsorption of ssDNA on PS. The adsorption is ascribed to the strong π–π stacking between unpaired DNA bases and PS. (2) Upon presence of target ssDNA, the specific hybridization of the probe with its target produces a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The duplex detaches from PS due to its rigid conformation, the absence of unpaired DNA bases, and electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged dsDNA backbone and PS, leading to recovery of dye fluorescence. This assay system exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 5 nM. It suggests that this sensing platform can differentiate between perfectly complementary and mismatched targets. The fluorescence enhancement in response to single-base mismatched target T₂, two-base mismatched target T₃, and three-base mismatched target T₄ is about 71%, 63%, and 58% of that from complementary target T₁, respectively. The suggested method can also discriminate complementary and single-base mismatched sequences embedded in rather larger strands with short oligonucleotide probes. The fluorescence enhancement in response to single-base mismatched sequence embedded in large strand is 83% of that from the one embedded with complementary sequence. In further experiments, it is demonstrated that the present system can be used for multiple DNA detection. Finally, efforts are made toward its application in human blood serum system to evaluate the ability to withstand the interference arising from real sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ananospheres 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleobases 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aoligonucleotides 3apolystyrenes 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aLi, Hailong1 aLuo, Yonglan1 aZhang, Yingwei1 aTian, Jingqi1 aSun, Xuping0 tRSC advances.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 1, no. 7 p.1318-1323dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ra00241d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011700165300001400282520138000296592002801676650001201704650001401716650001701730650001401747650001001761650001101771650001501782650001401797650000901811650001101820650001401831650001601845650002501861653002801886653002501914653002601939653002601965700001401991700001502005700001202020773010302032856008602135852000902221655001202230IND60633499720221121023159.0200106e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063349972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yan10aGeo-accumulation vector model for evaluating the heavy metal pollution in the sediments of Western Dongting Lake  ap. 40-48.  aThe conventional geo-accumulation index (GI) cannot deal with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of pollutants or conduct a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments. To solve these problems, a geo-accumulation vector (GV) model is designed based on uncertainty analysis theory. GV uses the probability vector to quantify the possibility for the pollution condition of a heavy metal to belong to a certain grade and then uses the first-order moment principle to determine its category. The GV model is applied in this study to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of Western Dongting Lake. The results show that (i) compared with the conventional GI model, the GV model has better capacity in evaluating synthetic pollution and in dealing with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of sediments; (ii) the sediments of Li River estuary, Yuan River estuary, Songzi River estuary, and the central part of Western Dongting Lake are “moderately to heavily contaminated,” “moderately to heavily contaminated,” “moderately contaminated,” and “uncontaminated to moderately contaminated” by heavy metals, respectively. These sediments also have 0.19, 0.36, 0.48, and 0.15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category, respectively; and (iii) all deterioration risks are introduced by cadmium.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aestuaries 3aheavy metals 3ahydrology 3alakes 3amodels 3apollutants 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3asediments 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aGeo-accumulation vector 0aUncertainty analysis 0aHeavy metal pollution 0aWestern Dongting Lake1 aBao, Qian1 aXiao, Xiao1 aLin, Ma0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 June, v. 573 p.40-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001400259520195800273592002802231650001102259650001802270650001802288650001402306650001702320650001202337651001002349653003502359653002202394653001802416653002302434700002102457700001702478700001502495700001502510700001402525700001502539700005702554773010302611856008602714852000902800655001202809IND60633499820221121023057.0200106e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063349982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Benwei10aHydrodynamics, erosion and accretion of intertidal mudflats in extremely shallow waters  ap. 31-39.  aIntertidal flats are shallow-water environments that undergo cyclical variations in water depth, leading to a frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water stages (ESWS; water depths <0.2 m). However, relatively little is known about the hydrodynamic conditions and erosion–accretion processes during ESWS, because the water depth is too shallow to measure in situ sediment dynamic processes using traditional methods. To address this gap, based on in situ measurements with four advanced instruments, we quantified the hydrodynamic conditions, erosion and accretion during ESWS in calm weather conditions on a highly turbid intertidal flat in Jiangsu coast, China. Our results revealed that marked erosion and accretion occurred during ESWS at the flood and ebb tidal stages, respectively. The resulting bed-level changes were three times greater during ESWS than relatively deep water stages (RDWS; water depths >0.2 m), and the rate of change was an order of magnitude faster than during RDWS. This larger and faster bed-level change occurred even though the ESWS duration only accounted for 10% of the entire tidal cycle. This result occurred because the bed shear stress due to combined current–wave action during ESWS, was, on average, two times higher than during RDWS at the flood stage causing more extensive erosion. Whereas during the ebb stage, this shear stress during ESWS was only half of that during RDWS resulting in greater accretion. The main implications of these results are that, because ESWS occur frequently (twice every tide) and are associated with large bed shear stress and bed-level changes, these conditions are likely to play an important role in morphological changes of intertidal flats. Our study shows that ESWS have a key influence on intertidal flat hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. Thus our results are the basis for an improved understanding of the coastal morphodynamic processes on intertidal flats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3ahydrodynamics 3alittoral zone 3asediments 3ashear stress 3aweather 3aChina 0aExtremely shallow water stages 0aBed-level changes 0aHydrodynamics 0aSediment transport1 aCooper, James R.1 aLi, Jiasheng1 aYang, Yang1 aYang, S.L.1 aLuo, Feng1 aYu, Zixian1 aWang, Ya Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8771-465X0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 June, v. 573 p.31-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012900176300001200305520100600317592002801323650002301351650001701374650001301391650000901404650001601413650001601429650002501445650002701470650002501497700002601522700005701548700001701605773010501622856008601727852000901813655001201822IND60526649320221120144413.0190409e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052664932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrydenberg, Rikke P.10aHigh intensity ultrasound effects on heat-induced whey protein isolate gels depend on α-lactalbumin: β-lactoglobulin ratio  ap. 1-3.  aThe effects of high intensity ultrasound (HIU) treatment on physical properties of whey protein isolate (WPI) gels, i.e., water holding capacity, gel strength and elasticity, were studied. WPIs with different α-lactalbumin:β-lactoglobulin (α-la:β-lg) ratios were subjected to ultrasonication (24 kHz, 300 W cm−2, 2078 J mL−1) with and without temperature control, i.e., T < 20 °C and T < 65 °C, respectively. Effects of ultrasonication were greatly affected by the relative amount of α-la, most likely due to the type of interactions formed during gelation after ultrasonication. For WPI with relative high α-la content ultrasonication improved the water holding capacity and gel strength of the heat-induced gels. To the contrary, for WPIs with intermediate or low α-la content, no changes in physical properties were observed. These results contribute to clarifying the mechanisms underlying the effects of HIU on WPI, linking effects on protein level to physical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3agel strength 3agelation 3agels 3alactalbumin 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3awater holding capacity 3awhey protein isolate1 aHammershøj, Marianne1 aAndersen, Ulf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4345-44031 aWiking, Lars0 tInternational dairy journal.g2016 May, v. 56 p.1-3dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04092naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008500166300001800251506002800269506005900297520253000356592002802886596004502914506003702959650001302996650002303009650001503032650001603047650002003063650000903083650001003092650001003102650001403112650002103126650001003147650000903157650001503166653001403181653000903195653001603204653002103220700002103241700002203262700002503284773015503309856007903464903002203543852000903565655001203574IND60580928720221207140247.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058092872DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-129072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Vera C.10aCausal effect of prolificacy on milk yield in dairy sheep using propensity score  ap. 8443-8450.  aResource is Open Access  aAmerican Dairy Science Association License Information  aIn animal production, it is often important to investigate causal relationships among variables. The gold standard tool for such investigation is randomized experiments. However, randomized experiments may not always be feasible, possible, or cost effective or reflect real-world farm conditions. Sometimes it is necessary to infer effects from farm-recorded data. Inferring causal effects between variables from field data is challenging because the association between them may arise not only from the effect of one on another but also from confounding background factors. Propensity score (PS) methods address this issue by correcting for confounding in different levels of the causal variable, which allows unbiased inference of causal effects. Here the objective was to estimate the causal effect of prolificacy on milk yield (MY) in dairy sheep using PS based on matched samples. Data consisted of 4,319 records from 1,534 crossbred ewes. Confounders were lactation number (first, second, and third through sixth) and dairy breed composition (<0.5, 0.5–0.75, and >0.75 of East Friesian or Lacaune). The causal variable prolificacy was considered as 2 levels (single or multiple lambs at birth). The outcome MY represented the volume of milk produced in the whole lactation. Pairs of single- and multiple-birth ewes (1,166) with similar PS were formed. The matching process diminished major discrepancies in the distribution of prolificacy for each confounder variable indicating bias reduction (cutoff standardized bias = 20%). The causal effect was estimated as the average difference within pairs. The effect of prolificacy on MY per lactation was 20.52 L of milk with a simple matching estimator and 12.62 L after correcting for remaining biases. A core advantage of causal over probabilistic approaches is that they allow inference of how variables would react as a result of external interventions (e.g., changes in the production system). Therefore, results imply that management and decision-making practices increasing prolificacy would positively affect MY, which is important knowledge at the farm level. Farm-recorded data can be a valuable source of information given its low cost, and it reflects real-world herd conditions. In this context, PS methods can be extremely useful as an inference tool for investigating causal effects. In addition, PS analysis can be implemented as a preliminary evaluation or a hypothesis generator for future randomized trials (if the trait analyzed allows randomization).  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3acost effectiveness 3acrossbreds 3adairy sheep 3adecision making 3aewes 3afarms 3aherds 3alactation 3alactation number 3alambs 3amilk 3amilk yield 0acausality 0amilk 0aprolificacy 0apropensity score1 aThomas, David L.1 aValente, Bruno D.1 aRosa, Guilherme J.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Oct., v. 100, no. 10 p.8443-8450dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-129073Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016000162300001600322520136600338592002801704596012001732596003501852596004501887650001601932650001101948650002601959650002501985650001302010650002002023650001002043650001302053650001302066650002102079650002002100650001802120650001302138650001702151650001402168650001302182650002802195650001402223653004202237653002002279653003102299653001402330653001802344653001002362653004202372653001002414653003802424653003302462700001902495700006202514773015002576856008102726961001302807852000902820655001202829IND60684765220221116150746.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068476522DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-11-19-0309-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuan10aComparative Genomics Screen Identifies Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns from ‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ spp. That Elicit Immune Responses in Plants  ap. 539-552.  aCitrus huanglongbing (HLB), caused by phloem-limited ‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ bacteria, is a destructive disease threatening the worldwide citrus industry. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood and no efficient strategy is available to control HLB. Here, we used a comparative genomics screen to identify candidate microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) from ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ spp. We identified the core genome from multiple ‘Ca. Liberibacter’ pathogens, and searched for core genes with signatures of positive selection. We hypothesized that genes encoding putative MAMPs would evolve to reduce recognition by the plant immune system, while retaining their essential functions. To efficiently screen candidate MAMP peptides, we established a high-throughput microtiter plate-based screening assay, particularly for citrus, that measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is a common immune response in plants. We found that two peptides could elicit ROS production in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana. One of these peptides elicited ROS production and defense gene expression in HLB-tolerant citrus genotypes, and induced MAMP-triggered immunity against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our findings identify MAMPs that boost immunity in citrus and could help prevent or reduce HLB infection.  aPublisher supplied data  aARS 2030-21000-046-00Da2030-21000-050-00DcUnited States Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service  cARS Research Associate Program  aIOS-1557661cNational Science Foundation 3aArabidopsis 3aCitrus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPseudomonas syringae 3abacteria 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agreening disease 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aindustry 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apeptides 3areactive oxygen species 3ascreening 0a‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ species 0acitrus greening 0adefense signaling pathways 0aelicitors 0ahuanglongbing 0aMAMPs 0amicrobe-associated molecular patterns 0aPAMPs 0apattern-triggered immune response 0aplant responses to pathogens1 aBendix, Claire1 aLewis, Jennifer D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4337-82920 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2020 Mar., v. 33, no. 3 p.539-552dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-11-19-0309-R3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013000167300001400297520201200311592002802323650001702351650001902368650001902387650001502406650002302421650002202444650002402466650000902490650001102499650001102510650001502521650002302536650001602559650002102575650001502596650001102611651001402622653000902636653002702645653001902672653002202691653001102713700005302724700001502777700001802792700001502810700005402825700005302879700001702932773011802949856008603067852000903153655001203162IND60633499920221121002404.0200106e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063349992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hong10aImpacts of future climate change on water resource availability of eastern Australia: A case study of the Manning River basin  ap. 49-59.  aHydrological responses of catchments to climate change require detailed examination to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems. This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern Australia (i.e. the Manning River catchment) and analyzed climate-hydrology relationships. For this evaluation, the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall-runoff relationships of the catchment. Statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models (GCMs) under RCP8.5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the Manning River catchment. Our results showed that the XAJ model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall-runoff relationships with an R² ≥ 0.94 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency ≥0.92. The median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021–2060 and an increase for the period 2061–2100. Annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly, while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future. Our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall, with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature. An increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 GCMs suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time-scales in the future. A trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern Australia. These results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3aissues and policy 3ameteorological data 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atemperature 3awater management 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aAustralia 0aGCMs 0aXinanjiang (XAJ) model 0aClimate change 0aEastern Australia 0aRunoff1 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6422-58021 aLiu, De Li1 aZhang, Mingxi1 aFeng, Puyu1 aCheng, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5298-95731 aYu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6950-18211 aEamus, Derek0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 June, v. 573 p.49-59dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05342naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245019300161300001800354520313600372592002803508650001503536650002603551650001403577650001603591650002003607650001603627650003803643650001703681650001703698650001003715650002103725650001003746650001903756650001403775650003203789650001603821650004803837650001403885650001803899650000903917650001703926650001003943650001703953650002103970650001703991650001404008651001004022653001504032653002604047653004804073653001404121700001604135700001704151700001804168700001404186700001904200700001604219700001704235700001704252700001904269700001604288700001504304700001704319700001704336773015504353856007904508852000904587655001204596IND60580928920221118195028.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058092892DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-129402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiacinti, G.10aPrevalence and characterization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carrying mecA or mecC and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in dairy sheep farms in central Italy  ap. 7857-7863.  aBetween January and May 2012, a total of 286 bulk tank milk samples from dairy sheep farms located in central Italy were tested for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred fifty-three samples were positive for S. aureus (53.5%), with an average count of 2.53 log cfu/mL. A total of 679 S. aureus colonies were screened for methicillin resistance by the cefoxitin disk diffusion test, and 104 selected cefoxitin-susceptible isolates were also tested for their susceptibility to other antimicrobials representative of the most relevant classes active against Staphylococcus spp. by using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, carrying respectively the mecA and the mecC genes, were detected in 2 samples from 2 different farms (prevalence 0.7%). The mecA-positive MRSA isolate was blaZ positive, belonged to spa type t127, sequence type (ST)1, clonal complex (CC)1, carried a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IVa, and was phenotypically resistant to all the β-lactams tested and to erythromycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. The mecC-positive MRSA isolate was negative for the chromosomally or plasmid-associated blaZ gene but positive for the blaZ allotype associated with SCCmec XI (blaZ-SCCmecXI), belonged to spa type 843, ST(CC)130, carried a SCCmec type XI, and was resistant only to β-lactams. Both MRSA were negative for the presence of specific immune-evasion and virulence genes such as those coding for the Panton-Valentine leucocidin, the toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and the immune evasion cluster genes. Regarding the presence of the major S. aureus enterotoxin genes, the mecC-positive MRSA tested negative, whereas the ST (CC)1 mecA-positive MRSA harbored the seh gene. Among the 104 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, 63 (60.58%) were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested, and 41 (39.42%) were resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial. In particular, 23 isolates (22.12%) were resistant to tetracycline, 16 (15.38%) to sulfonomides, 14 (13.46%) to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and 9 (8.65%) to ampicillin, whereas only 1 isolate was resistant to both fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. The high prevalence of S. aureus found in bulk tank milk samples and the isolation of MRSA, although at a low prevalence, underlines the importance of adopting control measures against S. aureus in dairy sheep farms to minimize the risks for animal and public health. Moreover, this study represents the first report of mecC-positive MRSA isolation in Italy and would confirm that, among livestock animals, sheep might act as a mecC-MRSA reservoir. Although this lineage seems to be rare in dairy sheep (0.35% of farms tested), because mecC-positive MRSA are difficult to detect by diagnostic routine methods employed for mecA-positive livestock-associated MRSA, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of the importance of searching for the mecC gene in all the mecA-negative S. aureus isolates displaying resistance to oxacillin, cefoxitin, or both.  aPublisher supplied data 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acefoxitin 3achromosomes 3acontrol methods 3adairy sheep 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3aenterotoxins 3aerythromycin 3afarms 3afluoroquinolones 3agenes 3aimmune evasion 3akanamycin 3alivestock and meat industry 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aoxacillin 3apublic health 3arisk 3aseptic shock 3asheep 3astreptomycin 3asulfamethoxazole 3atrimethoprim 3avirulence 3aItaly 0asheep milk 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 0amecA/mecC1 aCarfora, V.1 aCaprioli, A.1 aSagrafoli, D.1 aMarri, N.1 aGiangolini, G.1 aAmoruso, R.1 aIurescia, M.1 aStravino, F.1 aDottarelli, S.1 aFeltrin, F.1 aFranco, A.1 aAmatiste, S.1 aBattisti, A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Oct., v. 100, no. 10 p.7857-7863dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-129403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013100162300001800293520134500311592002801656596005901684596009201743650001501835650001201850650001901862650002101881650001001902650001601912650002001928650002101948650001701969650001301986650002101999650001102020650001002031650001902041650001902060650003702079700001602116700001702132700001402149773014802163856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60687995820221116172306.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068799582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02482-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haili10a3, 3′-Diaminobenzidine with dual o-phenylenediamine groups: two in one enables visual colorimetric detection of nitric oxide  ap. 2545-2550.  aNitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the generation of smog and ozone. Although great efforts have been made to determine NO by using o-phenylenediamine (OPD)-based fluorescent probes, more simple and reliable colorimetric assays for detection of NO are extremely scarce because a single OPD structure cannot produce enough optical absorption for chromogenesis. In this study, we report an innovative two-in-one visual colorimetric methodology. Commercially available 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with two OPD structures in a single molecule is selected as the colorimetric probe, and it reacts with NO via diazo-coupling reaction to generate 1H,3’H-[5,5′]bibenzotriazolyl because of the increase of conjugated double bonds, accompanying a distinct color change from colorless to brownish yellow. This two-in-one colorimetric assay can determine NO at a concentration as low as 3 ppm by the naked eye and 40 ppb by UV-vis spectrometry, which is the lowest limit of detection (LOD) among reported colorimetric assays for NO. Moreover, the present two-in-one visual colorimetric assay also has good selectivity toward NO over other common potential gas interferents such as CO₂, NO₂, NH₃, N₂, O₂, and SO₂. This present study provides a new insight for the design and development of assays for NO.

We quantified the pathogenicity of Cordyceps javanica strain Apopka 97 strain (Cja Apopka 97) (blastospores and conidia) against D. citri using the spray technique. We also used light and scanning electron microscopy to observe the Cja Apopka 97, infection process against D. citri adults at different stages pre- and post-mortem. Our findings demonstrated that psyllid mortality in the blastospore treatment ranged from 8 to 25% within 24–48 h of exposure, compared to 0% in the conidial and control treatments. However, psyllid mortality rate had reached 100% by 7 days after exposure at a concentration of 10⁷ spores/mL, under both fungal treatments compared to the controls (0%). SEM and light microscopy revealed several stages in in the Cja Apopka 97 infection process of D. citri, including spore adherence and germ tube formation within 24 h post-inoculation, penetration pegs and mycelia growth on wings after 72 h, rupturing of cuticle after 96 h and mycelial mass colonizing host body after 144 h. Our study findings provide basic information on the interaction of entomopathogenic fungi with D. citri which will assist in the understanding of the infection process and the potential roles of entomopathogenic fungi in its management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps 3aDiaphorina citri 3aagronomy 3abiological control 3ablastospores 3aconidia 3agerm tube 3alight microscopy 3amortality 3amycelium 3apathogenicity1 aAvery, Pasco B.1 aZhu, Wenchao 1 aPitino, Marco 1 aArthurs, Steven P.1 aWang, Liande 1 aQiu, Dongliang 1 aMao, Runqian 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Dec. 06, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111224763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245005500212300001600267506007600283520096000359592002801319506003701347650001701384650001501401650001501416650001001431650001301441650001101454650000901465650001401474650001201488650001701500650002901517653001701546653001101563653001401574653002401588653002501612653001901637653001601656653002101672653002401693700002101717700002001738773010401758856008501862852000901947655001201956IND60691221320221207075942.0200428e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069122132DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2016.12436482doi7 aPMC55192362pmcid7 a277154412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawyer, Iain A.10aSpecific genomic cues regulate Cajal body assembly  ap. 791-803.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe assembly of specialized sub-nuclear microenvironments known as nuclear bodies (NBs) is important for promoting efficient nuclear function. In particular, the Cajal body (CB), a prominent NB that facilitates spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis, assembles in response to genomic cues. Here, we detail the factors that regulate CB assembly and structural maintenance. These include the importance of transcription at nucleating gene loci, the grouping of these genes on human chromosomes 1, 6 and 17, as well as cell cycle and biochemical regulation of CB protein function. We also speculate on the correlation between CB formation and RNA splicing levels in neurons and cancer. The timing and location of these specific molecular events is critical to CB assembly and its contribution to genome function. However, further work is required to explore the emerging biophysical characteristics of CB assembly and the impact upon subsequent genome reorganization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA splicing 3abiogenesis 3acell cycle 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahumans 3aloci 3aneoplasms 3aneurons 3aspliceosomes 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCajal bodies 0acoilin 0achromatin 0agenome organization 0ahistone locus bodies 0anuclear bodies 0aoncogenesis 0aphase separation 0aspliceosomal snRNPs1 aHager, Gordon L.1 aDundr, Miroslav0 tRNA biology.g2017 June 3, v. 14, no. 6 p.791-803dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2016.12436483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002200159245009700181300001800278500000900296520163800305592002801943650001501971650001401986650001302000650001002013650001802023650002802041650001902069650001802088650001602106650001502122650000902137650002202146650001302168650002402181650001702205650002602222650003102248650001302279650002702292650002802319650001102347650000902358650002502367700002302392700002302415700002202438700001702460700002302477700001902500773019402519852000902713856007702722655001202799IND4400672920221118081752.0191028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440067292DNAL7 a179653842pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2006.03692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVetterlein, Doris10aCompetitive Mobilization of Phosphate and Arsenate Associated with Goethite by Root Activity  ap. 1811-1820.  aepub  aArsenate (Asⱽ) is the predominant form of arsenic in soils under aerobic conditions and competes with the major plant nutrient phosphorus (P) in the form of phosphate (Pⱽ) not only for sorption sites on mineral surfaces in soil but also for root membrane transporters. Plants have evolved several mechanisms for the mobilization of Pⱽ in soils in response to P deficiency, such as the release of organic anions and protons. The aim of the present study was to test whether these mechanisms result in a simultaneous mobilization of arsenate and what would be the consequences for As transfer from soil to plant. The compartment system approach with Zea mays as model crop was chosen as an experimental setup. The system is equipped with micro suction cups and allowed us to investigate processes occurring in the vicinity of roots. As a case study, an artificial quartz substrate with well defined soil physical properties was fertilized, spiked with Asⱽ, and amended with increasing amounts of goethite (0, 1, and 4 g kg⁻¹ in treatments G-0, G-1, and G-4, respectively). The addition of goethite alleviated the Asⱽ-induced growth reduction and reduced Asⱽ transfer from the substrate to the plant but induced P deficiency at the same time. When low amounts of goethite (1 g kg⁻¹) were added, plants mobilized Pⱽ but not Asⱽ, which might be related to differences in surface complexation reported for Pⱽ and Asⱽ No mobilization of Pⱽ or Asⱽ was observed with the addition of higher amounts of goethite, probably because of decreasing competition between organic anions, Pⱽ, and Asⱽ for binding sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphates 3aarsenates 3agoethite 3aroots 3abinding sites 3asoil-plant interactions 3asoil pollution 3asoil solution 3arhizosphere 3aphosphorus 3airon 3auptake mechanisms 3aZea mays 3achemical speciation 3acase studies 2aArsenatesxmetabolism 2aIron Compoundsxmetabolism 2aMinerals 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aQuartz 2aSoil 2aZea maysxmetabolism1 aSzegedi, Krisztian1 aAckermann, Juliane1 aMattusch, Jürgen1 aNeue, H.-U.,1 aTanneberg, Hartmut1 aJahn, Reinhold0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2007 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.1811-1820dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2006.03693Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02428naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006300169300001400232520118700246592002801433650001701461650001901478650001001497650001301507650001301520650001501533650001201548650002601560650001401586650001001600650001101610650001301621650001301634650002601647650001901673650002401692650001601716650002001732650002601752773011301778856008201891852000901973655001201982IND60593775420221119135126.0191025e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059377542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2018.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRensing, Stefan A10aGreat moments in evolution: the conquest of land by plants  ap. 49-54.  a500Ma ago the terrestrial habitat was a barren, unwelcoming place for species other than, for example, bacteria or fungi. Most probably, filamentous freshwater algae adapted to aerial conditions and eventually conquered land. Adaptation to a severely different habitat apparently included sturdy cell walls enabling an erect body plan as well as protection against abiotic stresses such as ultraviolet radiation, drought and varying temperature. To thrive on land, plants probably required more elaborate signaling pathways to react to diverse environmental conditions, and phytohormones to control developmental programs. Many such plant-typical features have been studied in flowering plants, but their evolutionary origins were long clouded. With the sequencing of a moss genome a decade ago, inference of ancestral land plant states using comparative genomics, phylogenomics and evolutionary developmental approaches began in earnest. In the past few years, the ever increasing availability of genomic and transcriptomic data of organisms representing the earliest common ancestors of the plant tree of life has much informed our understanding of the conquest of land by plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aabiotic stress 3aalgae 3aancestry 3abacteria 3acell walls 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3afungi 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahabitats 3amosses and liverworts 3aplant hormones 3asignal transduction 3atemperature 3atranscriptomics 3aultraviolet radiation0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2018 Apr., v. 42 p.49-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2018.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016200168300001400330520192500344592002802269650001802297650001102315650002602326650002202352650001602374650002002390650002002410650001102430650001902441650001402460650001902474650001702493650000902510650001702519650001702536650001802553650001202571650001202583651001002595653002702605653002202632653003602654653005302690700001502743700001702758773010202775856008502877852000902962655001202971IND60546105920221121034932.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054610592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, M.F.10aEnvironmental hazards and distribution of radioactive black sand along the Rosetta coastal zone in Egypt using airborne spectrometric and remote sensing data  ap. 71-78.  aHigh-resolution airborne gamma ray spectrometry, conducted in 2003, was used to estimate radioactive elements spatial abundance along the Rosetta coastal zone area. It was noticed that both Uranium and Thorium are concentrated in the black sand deposits along the beach. In contrary, Potassium was observed in high level abundance at the cultivated Nile Delta lands due to the accumulated usage of fertilizers. Exposure Rate (ER), Absorbed Dose Rate (ADR) and Annual Effective Dose Rate (AEDR) were calculated to evaluate the radiation background influence in human. Results indicated that the human body in the study sites is subjected to radiation hazards exceeds the accepted limit for long duration exposure. In addition, the areas covered by the highest concentration of Uranium and Thorium show the highest level of radiogenic heat production. Detection the environmental hazards of the radioactive black sands in the study site encouraged this research to monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of these sediments. The Landsat Thematic Mapper images acquired in 1990, 2003 and 2013 were analyzed using remote sensing image processing techniques. Image enhancements, classification and changes detection indicated a positive significant relationship between the patterns of coastline changes and distribution of the radioactive black sand in the study sites. The radioactive black sands are usually concentrated in the eroded areas. Therefore, in 1990 high concentration of the radioactive black sands were observed along the eastern and western flanks of the Rosetta promontory. Distribution of these sediments decreased due to the construction of the protective sea walls. Most of the radioactive black sands are transported toward the east in Abu Khashaba bay under the effect of the longshore currents and toward the west in Alexandria and Abu Quir bay under the action of the seasonal reverse currents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbed dose 3acoasts 3aenvironmental hazards 3aexposure duration 3afertilizers 3agamma radiation 3aheat production 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3apotassium 3aremote sensing 3ariver deltas 3asand 3aspatial data 3aspectroscopy 3athematic maps 3athorium 3auranium 3aEgypt 0aRadioactive black sand 0aRadiation hazards 0aAirborne gamma ray spectrometry 0aRosetta promontory and remote sensing techniques1 aAziz, A.M.1 aGhieth, B.M.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2014 Nov., v. 137 p.71-78dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245013800178300001600316520094700332592002801279650002201307650002201329650001701351650001101368650001901379650001001398650001201408650001401420650001501434650002001449650001801469651001101487653001701498653001501515653001901530653002001549653001201569653001901581653001401600653001601614653001601630653002001646700002801666700002601694773015701720856008301877852000901960655001201969IND60543761820221116150806.0190411e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054376182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.recqb.2015.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJofre-Meléndez, Rodolfo10aCalidad del agua de la niebla captada artificialmente en la microcuenca del río pixquiac, veracruz, méxico: resultados preliminares  ap. 122-130.  aIn order to determine if artificially collected water fog in the mountainous located in central the region of Veracruz state is suitable for human consumption; a preliminary sampling was made, from January to March (2010), the period with more fog frequency.

In the present study, bottles of 26 Romanian mineral water brands were purchased from the market to make a characterization based on the pH, conductivity, and fixed residue content. Focusing on the total fixed residue, the distribution of low, medium, and highly mineralized water was 43.9%, 41.46%, and 14.63% respectively. The mean of fixed residue concentration was 763.3 mg/L, ranging from 40.37 mg/L to 2,603 mg/L. The pH values of the still mineral waters varied between 6.86 and 7.91, while the pH values of the sparkling mineral waters were the lowest (4.7). The conductivity was strongly related to the concentration of the ions, so the maximum measured conductivity for the still waters was 573 μS/cm, for the partially sparkling waters 2,133 μS/cm, and for the sparkling mineral waters 3,079 μS/cm. The chemical composition of the mineral waters was highly dependent on the rock types. Using the hierarchical cluster analysis, two different clusters were detected according to the main characteristics of mineral waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3amarkets 3amineral content 3amineral water 3amineralization 3apH 3aRomania 0aconductivity 0afixed residue1 aBodor, Zs.1 aSzép, R.1 aSzép, A.0 tActa Universitatis Sapientiae, Alimentaria.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 13, no. 1 p.85-98dSciendowJournal:23143x2066-77447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ausal-2020-00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006500169300001600234500001900250520096600269592002801235650001101263650002401274650001001298650001701308650001401325650001101339650001201350650001201362650001701374650001601391650001201407650001601419650001101435650001301446653001401459653001101473653000901484653001501493700001901508700001401527773010101541856008601642852000901728655001201737IND60695260720221120194347.0200516e20050301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069526072DNAL7 a10.1080/15572536.2006.118328062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, M.J.10aFungal melanin detection by the use of copper sulfide-silver  ap. 312-319.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSilver-staining procedures were investigated for their effectiveness in identifying cell wall-based fungal melanins in live and fixed plastic embedded samples, particularly 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) based polyketide melanins. We developed a simple and reliable melanin-staining technique based on a silver accumulation method originally published for histological demonstration of heavy metal sulfides in mammalian tissues. Copper is bound to fungal melanin followed by formation of the copper sulfide at melanin sites in fungal cell walls, which then are amplified into vivid black stains using a silver enhancement step. The method demonstrates patterns of melanization in a range of fungal hyphae and is suitable for light and electron microscopy. Albino mutant fungi and normally nonmelanized fungi do not stain with the sulfide-silver technique. Mammalian melanocytes also were labeled by the technique, indicating its universality as a melanin probe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3aelectron microscopy 3afungi 3aheavy metals 3ahistology 3ahyphae 3amammals 3amelanin 3amelanization 3amelanocytes 3amutants 3apolyketides 3asilver 3asulfides 0acell wall 0acopper 0aDOPA 0amicroscopy1 aGardiner, R.B.1 aDay, A.W.0 tMycologia.g2005 Mar. 1, v. 97, no. 2 p.312-319dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15572536.2006.118328063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245017500167300001600342520118400358592002801542650001501570650002201585650001301607650001601620650002001636650002901656650002201685650000901707650001301716650001901729650001101748650001801759650001901777650001301796650001401809650001701823653002901840653001701869653002601886653001901912653001501931653002901946700001501975700001401990700001402004700001602018773011202034856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60584461920221118024552.0200509e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058446192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Guangming12aA graphene quantum dots based electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen detection using poly(5-formylindole)/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite  ap. 123-128.  aA novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for ultrasensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was developed using signal amplification strategy based on poly(5-formylindole)/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (P5FIn/erGO) and Au nanoparticle (AuNP) decorated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) (GQDs@AuNP). As an effective matrix for immobilization of primary antibody (Ab1), P5FIn/erGO nanocomposite facilitated the ion transport during the redox reactions and provided larger surface areas for the immobilization of Ab1. GQDs@AuNP was used as labels to conjugate with secondary antibody (Ab2), which improved electron transfer capability with stable ECL intensity. The multiple amplification of P5FIn/erGO and GQDs@AuNP made the ECL immunosensor have a broad linear range from 0.1pgmL⁻¹ to 10ngmL⁻¹ and a low detection limit with 3.78fgmL⁻¹. In addition, this ECL immunosensor performed with admirable stability and good selectivity and reproducibility as well. When this immunosensor was used for the analysis of CEA in human serum, good recoveries were obtained. Thus, there will be a promising future in the early diagnosis of cancer to detect CEA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectron transfer 3agold 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3aimmunosensors 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3aneoplasms 3aquantum dots 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aImmunosensor 0aGraphene quantum dots 0aGraphene oxide 0aPolyindole 0aCarcinoembryonic antigen1 aWang, Yang1 aTang, Yun1 aZhao, Dan1 aGuo, Qingfu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 101 p.123-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008600165300001400251520187900265592002802144650001202172650001202184650001502196650001502211650001402226650001302240653002202253653001402275653001102289653000802300653001402308700002202322773010202344856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60479957720221120214813.0160124e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047995772DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.54.2012.1-2.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorhidi, A.10a<i>Deppeopsis</i>, un Género Nuevo (Hamelieae, Rubiaceae) de México y Guatemala  ap. 85-90.  aWithin the frame of the <i>Deppea</i> two types of floral organisation have been recognised: the classic genus based on the type <i>D. erythrorhiza</i> Cham. et Schltdl., characterised by rotate corolla with very short tube, longer filaments and long linear anthers both longer than the corolla tube. The other floral type is characterised by funnel-form corolla, with longer upwards broadening corolla tube with short or absent filaments and short, ovate anthers. This corolla type was recognised by Standley (1933) and described as <i>Edithea</i> based on <i>E. floribunda</i> Standl. Based on seemingly intermediate corolla forms the two genera were united by the classic taxonomic treatment of Lorence and Dwyer (1988), but micromorphological-anatomical evidence (Borhidi <i>et al.</i> 2004) reinforced Standley’s concept, supported also by the molecular studies of Stranczinger <i>et al.</i> (2010). These latter ones claimed the attention to another taxonomic split existing within the generic frame of <i>Deppea</i> s. str. The separating evidences are in the fruit morphology. The great majority — including the type of the genus has subglobose or obovate to broadly elliptical hypanthium and fruit, ± as broad as long, smooth or 2 to 8-costate, and obovate placenta and loculicidal dehiscence. In contrast, five species have cylindrical or oblong to linear-oblong hypanthium and fruit 2 to 4 times as long as broad, with 8 densely disposed longitudinal nerves, oblong to linear-oblong placenta and apical to septicidal dehiscence. Molecular evidence grouped these species into a separate clade placed from the vicinity of <i>Deppea</i> species next to <i>Hoffmannia</i>. Therefore we consider this species-group as a new genus named <i>Deppeopsis</i> with the following description, and selecting <i>Deppea hernandezii</i> Lorence as the type of the new genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthers 3acorolla 3adehiscence 3ahypanthium 3anew genus 3aplacenta 0a<i>Deppeopsis</i> 0aGuatemala 0aMexico 0anew 0aRubiaceae1 aStranczinger, Sz.0 tActa botanica Hungarica.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 54, no. 1-2 p.85-90dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-64957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FABot.54.2012.1-2.103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011500174300001800289500001900307520168100326592002802007650002802035650001902063650002102082650001602103650002402119650001202143650001202155650001602167650002302183650001802206650002602224650001802250650001402268650002102282650001402303650001302317650002102330650001902351650001502370650001702385650001402402650001302416650001902429650001302448650001602461650001102477650001302488650001802501700002302519700006802542700002202610700002202632700002402654773010702678856008202785852000902867655001202876IND60700585820221120092832.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070058582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-020-01493-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhangi-Abriz, Salar10aGrowth-promoting bacteria and natural regulators mitigate salt toxicity and improve rapeseed plant performance  ap. 1035-1047.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSalinity is a major environmental stress that limits plant production and portraits a critical challenge to food security in the world. In this research, the impacts of plant growth–promoting bacteria (Pseudomonas RS-198 and Azospirillum brasilense RS-SP7) and foliar application of plant hormones (salicylic acid 1 mM and jasmonic acid 0.5 mM) on alleviating the harmful effects of salt stress in rapeseed plants (Brassica napus cv. okapi) were examined under greenhouse condition. Salt stress diminished rapeseed biomass, leaf area, water content, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chlorophyll content, while it increased sodium content, endogenous salicylic and jasmonic acids, osmolyte production, H₂O₂ and O₂•⁻ generations, TBARS content, and antioxidant enzyme activities. Plant growth, nutrient content, leaf expansion, osmolyte production, and antioxidant enzyme activities were increased, but oxidative and osmotic stress indicators were decreased by bacteria inoculation + salicylic acid under salt stress. Antioxidant enzyme activities were amplified by jasmonic acid treatments under salt stress, although rapeseed growth was not generally affected by jasmonic acid. Bacterial + hormonal treatments were superior to individual treatments in reducing detrimental effects of salt stress. The best treatment in rectifying rapeseed growth under salt stress was combination of Pseudomonas and salicylic acid. This combination attenuated destructive salinity properties and subsequently amended rapeseed growth via enhancing endogenous salicylic acid content and some essential nutrients such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aBrassica napus 3aOkapia johnstoni 3aPseudomonas 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3afoliar application 3afood security 3agreenhouse production 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaf area 3aleaf development 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aosmotic stress 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3arapeseed 3asalicylic acid 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asodium 3atoxicity 3awater content1 aTavasolee, Alireza1 aGhassemi-Golezani, Kazem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9560-18691 aTorabian, Shahram1 aMonirifar, Hassan1 aRahmani, Hadi Asadi0 tProtoplasma.g2020 July, v. 257, no. 4 p.1035-1047dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-020-01493-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013700175520172100312592002802033650001902061650001202080650001802092650002702110650002002137650001702157650001902174650001902193650001802212650001402230650002502244650001602269650001502285650001902300650002602319650002202345650002502367650000902392650002002401650001102421650001502432650001602447653002802463653002602491653004802517700002202565700001802587700001602605700002402621773011302645856008602758852000902844655001202853IND60678612420221116152547.0200210e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067861242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1195472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonquim, Flávia M.10aEco-efficiency analysis of desalination by precipitation integrated with reverse osmosis for zero liquid discharge in oil refineries  aIn a process for industrial water reuse with zero liquid discharge (ZLD), a membrane separation step followed by an evaporative process is usually required. It is proposed here to maximize water conversion in the reverse osmosis (RO) membranes, in order to reduce the associated environmental impacts and economic costs from evaporative process. Considering a typical oil refinery wastewater with high inorganic scaling tendency, three ZLD virtual scenarios were proposed. A RO water recovery of 59% (default scenario SI) was increased to 89.2% with an upstream BaSO₄ desupersaturation step (scenario SII). A 96.3% RO water recovery (SIII) was obtained adopting also a RO intermediate softening with CaO addition and calcite seeding, as well as MgSO₄ dosing for additional silica removal. In all cases, the water not separated in the membrane was completely recovered in downstream evaporation and evaporative crystallization steps. A life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis suggests that the proposed scenarios enabled expressive reduction in the environmental impacts related to global warming, freshwater ecotoxicity and water consumption. Besides, it has been shown that the proposed scenarios were economically favorable. By means of an eco-efficiency analysis, economic, energetic and environmental implications appointed to benefits on developing of chemical precipitation techniques for a high RO desalting recovery in ZLD operations for aqueous effluents of petroleum refineries. It has also been found that some degree of intervention may lead to an improvement of all eco-efficiency indicators, but at some extent of intervention, at least some of the eco-efficiency indicators may become less favorable.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium sulfate 3acalcite 3acalcium oxide 3achemical precipitation 3acrystallization 3adesalination 3aeco-efficiency 3aeconomic costs 3aecotoxicology 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental impact 3aevaporation 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming 3alife cycle assessment 3amagnesium sulfate 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3areverse osmosis 3asilica 3awastewater 3awater reuse 0aOil refinery wastewater 0aZero liquid discharge 0aPrecipitation integrated to reverse osmosis1 aSakamoto, Hugo M.1 aMierzwa, J.C.1 aKulay, Luiz1 aSeckler, Marcelo M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 250 p.119547-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1195473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100003700135245009700172300001500269520097900284592002801263650001401291650001701305650000901322650001801331650001101349650001901360700002901379700003001408700002501438700001801463700001801481700001701499700002301516773015201539856007001691856010001761852000901861655001201870IND60760175920221123030353.0211219e20211004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076017592DNAL7 a10.3791/627802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForteza-Genestra, Maria Antònia10aLabeling of extracellular vesicles for monitoring migration and uptake in cartilage explants  ap. e62780.  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are used in different studies to prove their potential as a cell-free treatment due to their cargo derived from their cellular source, such as platelet lysate (PL). When used as treatment, EVs are expected to enter the target cells and effect a response from these. In this research, PL-derived EVs have been studied as a cell-free treatment for osteoarthritis (OA). Thus, a method was set up to label EVs and test their uptake on cartilage explants. PL-derived EVs are labeled with the lipophilic dye PKH26, washed twice through a column, and then tested in an in vitro inflammation-driven OA model for 5 h after particle quantification by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Hourly, cartilage explants are fixed, paraffined, cut into 6 µm sections to mount on slides, and observed under a confocal microscope. This allows verification of whether EVs enter the target cells (chondrocytes) during this period and analyze their direct effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3adyes 3alipophilicity 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis1 aAntich-Rosselló, Miquel1 aOrtega, Francisco Gabriel1 aRamis-Munar, Guillem1 aCalvo, Javier1 aGayà, Antoni1 aMonjo, Marta1 aRamis, Joana Maria0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 Oct. 04, , no. 176 p.e62780-e62780dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/627803Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/62780/labeling-extracellular-vesicles-for-monitoring-migration-uptake  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148242009600165245008800261300001400349500001900363520138800382592002801770650002001798650001101818650001201829650001601841650001101857650000901868650001101877650001501888650001401903650001401917650002001931650001501951650001301966650001501979650001401994650001502008650001802023650001002041650000902051700002302060700002602083773011602109856008302225852000902308655001202317IND60683991620221121220554.0201106e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068399162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-019-00461-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolat, Derya10aBestimmung von Mineralstoffen in Blättern von 14 Apfelunterlagen aus der Abrissvermehrung10aIdentification of Minerals in Leaves of 14 Apple Rootstocks in Stool Bed Condition  ap. 77-81.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVery little is known about the mineral composition in the leaves of apple (Malus) rootstocks. Hence, in this study, variations in mineral composition were investigated among fourteen apple rootstocks (P.16, P.22, M.9, B.469, O.3, Mac.9, M.26, Pi.80, M.7, M.2, B.118, MM.11, M.25 and A.2) which have different growth vigor on a loamy soil in the stool bed conditions. Nitrogen (N) was determined by Kjeldahl method. Phosphorus (P) was analyzed using vanadate molybdate colorimetric method. Potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) concentrations were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The study results showed that the differences in mineral contents in leaves among apple rootstock genotypes were statistically significant. No problems were found in achieving adequate leaf N, P and Fe uptake of any rootstock. However, it was found to be lack of the K, Ca, Mg and Mn uptake in the majority of the rootstocks. Mac.9 rootstock, followed by B.469, showed high performance with in regard to the uptake of K, Ca and Mg. In general, the uptake of Fe, Ca and Mg of dwarf and semi-dwarf rootstocks were higher than those of vigorous rootstocks. Consequently, P.19, B.469, Mac.9 and M.26 rootstocks had adequate performances in the uptake of all macro and micro elements examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKjeldahl method 3aapples 3acalcium 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3airon 3aleaves 3aloam soils 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3amolybdates 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arootstocks 3aspectrometers 3avigor 3azinc1 aYıldırım, Fatma1 aYıldırım, Adnan N.0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2020 Mar., v. 62, no. 1 p.77-81dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl29949x0014-03097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-019-00461-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017300160300001800333520131600351592002801667650001201695650001801707650001701725650001501742650001601757650001001773650001401783650001001797650001901807650001901826650001901845650001001864650001901874650002701893650001801920650002201938650002101960650002201981650001102003650003602014700002702050700003302077700002202110700002202132700002602154773012502180856007502305852000902380655001202389IND60779440420221122040636.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077944042DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04292k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgaly, Hanan A.10aThymol ameliorated neurotoxicity and cognitive deterioration in a thioacetamide-induced hepatic encephalopathy rat model; involvement of the BDNF/CREB signaling pathway  ap. 6180-6194.  aIn the present study, we aimed to delineate the neuroprotective potential of thymol (THY) against neurotoxicity and cognitive deterioration induced by thioacetamide (TAA) in an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Rats received TAA (100 mg kg⁻¹, intraperitoneally injected, three times per week) for two weeks. THY (30 and 60 mg kg⁻¹), and Vit E (100 mg k⁻¹) were administered daily by oral gavage for 30 days after HE induction. Supplementation with THY significantly improved liver function, reduced serum ammonia level, and ameliorated the locomotor and cognitive deficits. THY effectively modulated the alteration in oxidative stress markers, neurotransmitters, and brain ATP content. Histopathology of liver and brain tissues showed that THY had ameliorated TAA-induced damage, astrocyte swelling and brain edema. Furthermore, THY downregulated NF-kB and upregulated GFAP protein expression. In addition, THY significantly promoted CREB and BDNF expression at both mRNA and protein levels, together with enhancing brain cAMP level. In conclusion, THY exerted hepato- and neuroprotective effects against HE by mitigating hepatotoxicity, hyperammonemia and brain ATP depletion via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects in addition to activation of the CREB/BDNF signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3aastrocytes 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acognition 3aedema 3aencephalopathy 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3aliver function 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotransmitters 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein synthesis 3athymol 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aAbdel-Rahman, Rehab F.1 aMohamed, Marawan Abd Elbaset1 aO.A., Ahmed-Farid1 aKhattab, Marwa S.1 aAbd-Elsalam, Reham M.0 tFood & function.g2022 June 6, v. 13, no. 11 p.6180-6194dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04292k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245017300206300001800379500001900397520132300416592002801739596009401767596008601861596006001947650002502007650002402032650001302056650001602069650000902085650002602094650002302120650001602143650002702159650001402186650001102200650002002211650001402231650001502245650001902260650001702279650002802296650002002324650002802344650001902372650001802391650002502409700001502434700002602449700001802475700002002493700001702513700001902530700001802549773010702567856008202674852000902756655001202765IND60700586020221121031028.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070058602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-020-01491-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Shakeel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8232-339610aFoliar application of melatonin delay leaf senescence in maize by improving the antioxidant defense system and enhancing photosynthetic capacity under semi-arid regions  ap. 1079-1092.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMelatonin is an important plant growth regulator which plays a key role in plant growth and development. The objective of the current research was to evaluate the effect of foliar application of melatonin (MF) on photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidant defense mechanism, and its relation with leaf senescence in maize crop grown in a semi-arid region. A field experiment was conducted during 2017 and 2018 growth season, where melatonin was applied to the foliage at concentrations of 0 (MF₀), 25 (MF₁), 50 (MF₂), and 75 (MF₃) μM at the ninth leaf stage. Foliar application of melatonin significantly improved chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, soluble sugar content, and soluble protein content during the process of leaf senescence. The application of melatonin also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, while reduced malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species accumulation. Melatonin foliar application also increased total leaf area per plant, grains per ear, thousand grain weight and grain yield of maize crop in a semi-arid region. The application of melatonin significantly improved photosynthetic activity, antioxidant defense mechanism, and yield of maize crop in a semi-arid region, where the most effective treatment was MF2.  aPublisher supplied data  a(863 Program, No.2013AA102902)cHigh Technology Research and Development Program of China  a(201303104)cthe special fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest  a(B12007)cthe 111 Project of Chinese Education Ministry 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3afoliar application 3agrain yield 3agrowth and development 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amelatonin 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant growth substances 3aprotein content 3areactive oxygen species 3asemiarid zones 3asugar content 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aSu, Wennan1 aKāmrān, Muḥammad,1 aAhmad, Irshad1 aMeng, Xiangping1 aWu, Xiaorong1 aJaved, Tehseen1 aHan, Qingfang0 tProtoplasma.g2020 July, v. 257, no. 4 p.1079-1092dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-020-01491-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245004100163300001600204520090400220592002801124650001401152650001001166650001501176650001601191650001901207650001901226651000901245653002401254653001401278653001401292653001201306653001201318653001401330773010401344856008501448852000901533655001201542IND60479958020221119053231.0160124e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047995802DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.54.2012.1-2.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPócs, T.10aBryophytes from the Fiji Islands, VI  ap. 145-188.  aThe recent investigation of the Fiji Islands in the Pacific revealed many new records and the known number of <i>Cololejeunea</i> species was raised from 10 to 38.

Dispersal behaviour affects population genetic structure that in turn reinforces social organization. We combined observational information with individual‐based genetic data in the Karoo scrub‐robin, a facultative cooperatively breeding bird, to understand how social bonds within familial groups affect mating patterns, cause sex asymmetry in dispersal behaviour and ultimately influence the evolution of dispersal. Our results revealed that males and females do not have symmetrical roles in structuring the population. Males are extremely philopatric and tend to delay dispersal until they gain a breeding position within a radius of two territories around the natal site. By contrast, females dispersed over larger distances, as soon as they reach independence. This resulted in male neighbourhoods characterized by high genetic relatedness. The long‐distance dispersal strategy of females ensured that Karoo scrub‐robins do not pair with relatives thereby compensating for male philopatry caused by cooperation. The observed female‐biased strategy seems to be the most prominent mechanism to reduce the risk of inbreeding that characterizes social breeding system. This study demonstrates that tying together ecological data, such as breeding status, determining social relationships with genetic data, such as kinship, provides valuable insights into the proximate causes of dispersal, which are central to any evolutionary interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispersal behavior 3arisk 3aevolution 3akinship 3amales 3abreeding 3asocial structure 3aphilopatry 3acooperatives 3afemales 3abirds 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPasseriformes 2aPopulationxgenetics 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSocial Behavior 0apopulation structure1 aLLOYD, P.1 aFELDHEIM, K.

Variable rate application of N fertiliser allows sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) growers to optimise the use of limited resources and match crop needs in space and time. This study outlines an approach and the merits of a data-driven, site- and season-specific forecast of yield at the block (field) resolution, by using publicly available spatio-temporal data such as satellite imagery, radiometrics, weather, and terrain attributes, in tandem with commonly available grower and mill data, namely yield, ratoons, harvest dates. The study used harvest data collected from two sugarcane properties (380 ha) in the Isis District of Queensland, between 2007 and 2018. Yield forecasts were produced with random forest models at two key management points in the season; early- (1 December) and late-season (1 June). Using a robust leave-one-season-out cross-validation technique, sugarcane yield could be forecasted early-season with a Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) of 0.61 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 32.1 t ha⁻¹, with an improvement later in the season with 0.63 LCCC and 30.9 t ha⁻¹ RMSE. Accurate early-season forecasts of yield at fine spatial supports offers growers the opportunity to make better-informed decisions regarding crop nutrition. This leads to more targeted and accurate applications of fertiliser, improving on-farm profitability, and critically decreasing off-site environmental damage to the Great Barrier Reef. The cost-effective, widely-applicable and scalable forecasting approach described in this case study could be expanded to a regional or industry scale, providing benefits to all industry stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3alandscapes 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrition 3aprecision agriculture 3aprofitability 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3arunoff 3aspace and time 3astakeholders 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3avariable rate application 3aweather 3aGreat Barrier Reef 3aQueensland 0a6ES 0aDYP 0aN 0aLOSO 0aLCCC 0aRMSE 0aSite-specific crop management 0aMachine learning 0aYield potential 0aData cube 0aNitrogen fertiliser1 aBishop, Thomas Francis Aloysius1 aFilippi, Patrick0 tField crops research.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 276 p.108360-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1083603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011100167300001800278500001900296520185000315592002802165596009702193650002502290650002502315650001702340650001602357650002402373650001502397650001802412650001302430650001102443650002002454650003102474650001802505650001102523650001602534650002602550650001102576650002102587650001902608650001302627650002902640700001802669700001802687700005802705773010702763856008202870852000902952655001202961IND60700586220221121051859.0200702e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070058622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-020-01492-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Deepak10aTissue-specific transcriptional regulation and metabolite accumulation in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.)  ap. 1093-1108.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTomato is an excellent model for studying fruit development, ripening, and other secondary metabolic pathways such as carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, flavonoid pathway, and many more. Tomato fruit development and ripening occurs under tight genetic control and involves the expression of thousands of genes affecting fruit quality and accumulation of pigments and metabolites. Here, we have described the development of a microarray platform that has allowed establishment of a framework for quantification of the expression of large number of genes and transcription factors possibly regulating various secondary metabolic pathways in tomato. To unravel the molecular mechanisms of fruit development and ripening, a tomato 60-mer oligonucleotide 44 K microarray along with the custom array for many genes and transcription factors was designed and validated in the fruit and leaf tissues. Comparative profiling of gene expression studies has allowed us to identify a large number of differentially expressed genes and transcription factors. Gene ontology revealed the involvement of these genes in various biological, cellular, and molecular processes like isoprenoid, terpenoid, pigment, ethylene biosynthesis, phytohormone signaling, and fruit ripening. Further, correlation, as well as differential expression studies, has revealed that several transcription factors like RIN, AGAMOUS, TAGL1, MYB, MADS-box etc. could be the possible regulators of various secondary metabolic pathways. The present study has identified various metabolites, their biosynthetic pathways and genes which may possibly be controlled by different transcription factors. The present findings have laid a base for understanding the transcriptional and metabolic shifts which occur in parallel during programmed fruit ripening and developmental processes in tomato.  aPublisher supplied data  aBT/PR11671/PBD/16/828/2008cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3aethylene production 3aflavonoids 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aoligonucleotides 3aplant hormones 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aKoul, Archana1 aKaul, Sanjana1 aDhar, Manoj K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8777-62440 tProtoplasma.g2020 July, v. 257, no. 4 p.1093-1108dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-020-01492-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008100162300001600243520117700259592002801436650000801464650000801472650001501480650001601495650002001511650002101531650001501552650001501567650001401582650002401596650002601620650001101646650001701657653001701674653001201691653003001703653002501733653002001758700001701778700001601795700001301811700001301824700001501837773011201852856008301964852000902047655001202056IND60584462320221118024457.0200509e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058446232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jue10aHand-in-hand RNA nanowire-based aptasensor for the detection of theophylline  ap. 153-158.  aTheophylline is a popular drug for many respiratory diseases. However, certain toxic side effects may be developed and the narrow safety range raises the demand for sensitive methods to constantly monitor theophylline levels. This study presents an electrochemical approach towards theophylline detection based on the recognition by split RNA aptamers. Target induced construction of hand-in-hand RNA nanowire on the electrode surface could further absorb silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as electrochemical species. When theophylline is not present, RNA probes are stable and their conformations remain unchanged. In contrast, theophylline is able to trigger the hairpin opening of RNA probe and subsequent self-assembly of RNA nanowire, which could be captured by DNA tetrahedron on the electrode interface. After further decorating Ag NPs on the nanowire, silver stripping current is measured to reveal initial theophylline concentration. The developed sensing strategy shows excellent specificity and sensitivity with the limit of detection of 50nM. Its practical utility is demonstrated by quantitative determination of theophylline levels in complex biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aRNA probes 3aaptasensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3anucleotide aptamers 3aquantitative analysis 3asilver 3atheophylline 0aTheophylline 0aAptamer 0aHand-in-hand RNA nanowire 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aDNA tetrahedron1 aCheng, Wenbo1 aMeng, Fanyu1 aYang, Mo1 aPan, Yue1 aMiao, Peng0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 101 p.153-158dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024003500147040001800182100001800200245015500218300001500373500001500388520137800403592002801781650002801809650001001837650001801847650002201865650000901887650002201896650001501918650001601933650001201949650001101961650002101972650002201993650001502015650000902030650002902039650003002068650001002098650002902108653002402137653001802161653002302179653000802202653000802210653002202218700001802240700001302258700001502271700001602286700001802302773011502320852000902435856008302444655001202527IND2208691020221122233644.0181204e20000101enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220869102DNAL7 a107593732pmid7 a10.1258/0023677007805779662doi4 a0023-6772(20000101)34:1L.97;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, S.10aDetermination of major and trace elements in the liver of Wistar rats by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry  ap. 97-105.  a2019-12-04  aInductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) were used to determine age-related changes in the concentrations of constituent elements in the livers of Wistar rats of 1 week to 12 months old. At first, sample preparation and analytical conditions were investigated in order to set up a simple routine procedure for measuring multiple elements simultaneously. Seventeen elements in the standard reference samples of bovine and pork livers as well as rat liver samples could be determined with a reasonable precision and reproducibility. They were P, K, Na, Fe, Mg, Ca, Zn, Rb, Cu, Mn, Mo, Al, Co, Sr, Cs, Pb, and Cd in order of the levels of concentration in the adult rat livers. Of these elements, the five major elements (P, K, Na, Fe, Mg, Ca) were determined with ICP-AES and the others with ICP-MS. Although the number of animals was too small to draw a statistically definite conclusion, it seems that age-related changes in the concentrations of these elements could be categorized into three general patterns: (1) remaining essentially constant throughout the animal ages, as observed for P, K, Na, Mg, Ca, Rb, Sr, Cs, and Pb, (2) increasing with age, as observed for Fe, Mn, Mo, Co, and Cd, and (3)decreasing with age, especially in the early stages of growth, as observed for Cu and Zn.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aliver 3anormal values 3ametallic elements 3arats 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphorus 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMicrowaves 2aRats 2aRats, Wistarxmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 2aSwine 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 0aspecies differences 0aTRACE ELEMENT 0aINDUCTIVELY PLASMA 0aAGE 0aRAT 0aMASS SPECTROSCOPY1 aTakahashi, I.1 aSato, H.1 aKubota, Y.1 aYoshida, S.1 aMuramatsu, Y.0 tLaboratory animals.g2000 Jan. 01, v. 34, no. 1 p.97-105dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1258/0023677007805779663Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03935naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012900175300001600304520195600320536031502276592002802591596004802619596003602667596008602703650001902789650001502808650001402823650001102837650001602848650001402864650001802878650001302896650001202909650001302921651002202934653001202956653002302968653001202991653001203003653001503015653001403030653001403044653001303058700001803071700001703089700001903106700001703125700001703142773012703159856008603286852000903372655001203381IND60576251020221119163036.0190724e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057625102DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2017.13095752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarballeira, Rafael12aA combined morphological and molecular approach to Nitzschia varelae sp. nov., with discussion of symmetry in Bacillariaceae  ap. 342-359.  aA previously unknown member of the Bacillariaceae was discovered almost simultaneously in four different brackish coastal wetlands on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of the Iberian Peninsula. It appears to tolerate a wide range of salinities but was never common in samples where it occurred. The frustules were consistently hantzschioid (i.e. with the raphe systems always on the same side of the frustule) and the valve outline was asymmetrical about the apical plane, two features that have until recently been considered characteristic of Hantzschia. Molecular phylogenies based on rbcL and LSU rDNA indicated, however, that the new species does not belong in Hantzschia but among the several disparate lineages that comprise the paraphyletic genus Nitzschia. This finding, coupled with the recent discovery of other diatoms with constant hantzschioid symmetry but with a morphology very similar to the type species of Nitzschia, is discussed in relation to the status and characterization of Hantzschia as an independent genus. It is concluded that, while a core of hantzschioid species may exist that can be classified together, corresponding to the traditional understanding of the genus Hantzschia, there is no single morphological feature common to all of them that can be used to diagnose the group and differentiate it from the various hantzschioid lineages that are separate from true Hantzschia and currently placed in e.g. Nitzschia or Cymbellonitzschia. Testing whether a hantzschioid species does or does not belong to Hantzschia will in many cases require molecular evidence. Although the new coastal species does not belong to the same lineage as the type species of Nitzschia, N. sigmoidea, it is described for the moment as N. varelae Carballeira, D.G. Mann & Trobajo, sp. nov., until there is a better understanding of generic limits in the Bacillariaceae following a wider molecular and morphological survey of that family.  aThe Xunta de Galicia funded this research through the project 08MDS036000PR of the Incite Programme.

The sensor probe fabrication includes dip coating of nanocomposite layer of zinc oxide and molybdenum sulphide (ZnO/MoS₂) over unclad core of optical fiber as the transducer layer followed by the layer of molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) as the recognition medium. The addition of molybdenum sulphide in the transducer layer increases the absorption of light in the medium which enhances the LMR properties of zinc oxide thereby increasing the conductivity and hence the sensitivity of the sensor. The sensor probe is characterized for p-cresol concentration range from 0µM (reference sample) to 1000µM in artificially prepared urine. Optimizations of various probe fabrication parameters are carried to bring out the sensor's optimal performance with a sensitivity of 11.86nm/µM and 28nM as the limit of detection (LOD). A two-order improvement in LOD is obtained as compared to the recently reported p-cresol sensor. The proposed sensor possesses a response time of 15s which is 8 times better than that reported in the literature utilizing electrochemical method. Its response time is also better than the p-cresol sensor currently available in the market for the medical field. Thus, with a fast response, significant stability and repeatability, the proposed sensor holds practical implementation possibilities in the medical field. Further, the realization of sensor probe over optical fiber substrate adds remote sensing and online monitoring feasibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiosensors 3acoatings 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3amarkets 3amolecular imprinting 3amolybdenum 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3aoptical fibers 3ap-cresol 3apolymers 3aremote sensing 3asulfides 3aurine 3azinc oxide 0aP-cresol 0aArtificial urine 0aOptical fiber sensor 0aLossy mode resonance 0aMolecular imprinting 0aZinc oxide/ molybdenum sulphide nanocomposite1 aGupta, Banshi D.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 101 p.135-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014000159300001800299520182200317592002802139650001702167650001002184650001402194650001902208650001302227650002602240650003302266650001902299650001702318650004002335650001702375650000802392651001002400700001602410700001802426700001702444700001702461700001602478700001602494700001202510700001502522700001702537773012502554856007502679852000902754655001202763IND60779440820221122040450.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077944082DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04381a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoqin10aChimonanthus salicifolius attenuated vascular remodeling by alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 6293-6305.  aChimonanthus salicifolius (CS), the leaves of Chimonanthus salicifolius S. Y. Hu., is an effective tea to prevent and treat hypertension in China. This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of CS in the protection against vascular remodeling in hypertension. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were orally administered with aqueous extracts of CS for 6 months. The blood pressure and morphological changes of the aorta were measured. Their mechanisms were studied by combining chemical identification, network pharmacology analysis and validation in vivo. Hypertensive rats showed an impaired vascular structure and dyslipidemia as illustrated by the increase of the vascular media thickness and collagen deposition in the aorta. CS treatment exhibited significant beneficial effects on blood pressure control and aortal morphology. A total of 21 compounds from CS were identified, which were linked to 106 corresponding targeted genes for vascular remodeling. The network pharmacology predicted that CS prevented vascular remodeling through the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. The in vivo experiments further showed that CS treatment upregulated Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 and downregulated CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein at both mRNA and protein levels, paralleling reduced apoptotic cells in the arterial wall. Additionally, CS diminished the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, total cholesterol contents and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios in the sera of SHRs, which might also contribute to its protection of vessels. Collectively, CS protects against vascular modeling by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-related apoptosis in hypertension, and it could be a potential agent for the prevention and treatment of vascular modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChimonanthus 3aaorta 3aapoptosis 3ablood pressure 3acollagen 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3apharmacology 3atea 3aChina1 aXu, Pingcui1 aLin, Bingfeng1 aDeng, Xuehui1 aZhu, Jiazhen1 aChen, Xinyi1 aLiu, Shuang1 aLi, Rui1 aWang, Nani1 aChen, Liping0 tFood & function.g2022 June 6, v. 13, no. 11 p.6293-6305dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04381a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245013200172300001800304520142300322592002801745650002301773650001001796650002501806650002101831650003001852650001401882650002701896650001701923650003001940650001201970650002401982650001202006650001502018650001702033700002302050700002402073773012502097856007502222852000902297655001202306IND60779440920221122040616.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077944092DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04428a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPengrattanachot, Nattavadee14aThe impact of prebiotic fructooligosaccharides on gut dysbiosis and inflammation in obesity and diabetes related kidney disease  ap. 5925-5945.  aObesity is an extensive health problem worldwide that is frequently associated with diabetes. It is a risk factor for the development of several diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Recent studies have reported that gut dysbiosis aggravates the progression of obesity and diabetes by increasing the production of uremic toxins in conjunction with gut barrier dysfunction which then leads to increased passage of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the blood circulatory system eventually causing systemic inflammation. Therefore, the modification of gut microbiota using a prebiotic supplement may assist in the restoration of gut barrier function and reduce any disturbance of the inflammatory response. In this review information has been compiled concerning the possible mechanisms involved in an increase in obesity, diabetes and kidney dysfunction via the exacerbation of the inflammatory response and its association with gut dysbiosis. In addition, the role of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), a source of prebiotic widely available commercially, on the improvement of gut dysbiosis and attenuation of inflammation on obese and diabetic conditions has been reviewed. The evidence confirms that FOS supplementation could improve the pathological changes associated with obesity and diabetes related kidney disease, however, knowledge concerning the mechanisms involved is still limited and needs further elucidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption barrier 3ablood 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adigestive system 3adigestive system diseases 3adysbiosis 3afructooligosaccharides 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3akidneys 3alipopolysaccharides 3aobesity 3aprebiotics 3arisk factors1 aThongnak, Laongdao1 aLungkaphin, Anusorn0 tFood & function.g2022 June 6, v. 13, no. 11 p.5925-5945dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04428a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01300naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245011400167300001600281520047900297592002800776650001100804650000900815651001000824700002000834773009100854856008000945852000901025655001201034IND60760176520221123030349.0211219s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076017652DNAL7 a10.1163/156853891X001032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuiselli, Luca M.10aComposition and variation of the diet of Vipera aspis francisciredi in relation to age and reproductive stage  ap. 137-144.  aThe composition of the diet has been investigated in some populations of Vipera aspis francisciredi from the Tolfa Mountains (central Italy) and related to snake size and reproductive stage.

However, it is not clear if co-infections with these viruses affect the severity of the diseases they produce, the amount of virus shed, and transmission of the viruses. In this study we infected domestic ducks with a virulent NDV virus (vNDV) and either a LPAIV or a HPAIV by giving the viruses individually, simultaneously, or sequentially two days apart. No clinical signs were observed in ducks infected or co-infected with vNDV and LPAIV, but co-infection decreased the number of ducks shedding vNDV and the amount of virus shed (P<0.01) at 4 days post inoculation (dpi). Co-infection did not affect the number of birds shedding LPAIV, but more LPAIV was shed at 2dpi (P<0.0001) from ducks inoculated with only LPAIV compared to ducks co-infected with vNDV. Ducks that received the HPAIV with the vNDV simultaneously survived fewer days (P<0.05) compared to the ducks that received the vNDV two days before the HPAIV. Co-infection also reduced transmission of vNDV to naïve contact ducks housed with the inoculated ducks. In conclusion, domestic ducks can become co-infected with vNDV and LPAIV with no effect on clinical signs but with reduction of virus shedding and transmission. These findings indicate that infection with one virus can interfere with replication of another, modifying the pathogenesis and transmission of the viruses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asurvival rate 3aducks 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3adisease transmission 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aviruses 3aviral shedding 3apathogenesis 3amixed infection 3avirulence 0aDomestic ducks 0aViral interference 0aAvian influenza virus 0aNewcastle disease virus 0aCo-infections1 aCosta-Hurtado, Mar1 aMiller, Patti J.1 aAfonso, Claudio L.1 aSpackman, Erica1 aR.

Genotypic differences in salt tolerance/susceptibility have been identified in chickpea genotypes grown in adequately-watered soil in pots with different salt concentrations, but few studies have been conducted in saline fields. This three-year study compared the growth and yield of chickpea genotypes to determine whether genotypic differences in salt tolerance/susceptibility identified in glasshouse pot experiments applied when grown in a dryland saline field. The emergence, phenology, growth, leaf ion concentration, yield and yield components of 10–20 chickpea genotypes were compared under controlled saline and water conditions in the glasshouse, and saline and non-saline conditions in the field in a semiarid environment. In the field, soil salinity and yields varied from year to year in the non-saline and saline treatments. Genotypic differences in salt tolerance and sensitivity were observed in the controlled salt and water conditions in the glasshouse. The salt tolerant and salt sensitive check genotypes, GENESIS 836 and RUPALI, respectively, grown in all three comparison years were similarly tolerant and sensitive in the glasshouse and dryland field in all three comparison years. However, other genotypes selected for salt tolerance under controlled conditions were not observed to be tolerant in the dryland field. While salinity slowed the rate of emergence and increased the time to flowering, the variation in saline yields among genotypes was associated with aboveground biomass, filled pod number and seed number at maturity in both the glasshouse and field, but not the number of emerged plants that survived to maturity or the delay in flowering. Salinity significantly increased the leaf Na⁺, K⁺ and Cl⁻ concentrations in the glasshouse and field (except in the glasshouse in 2010). Na⁺ increased in young and old leaves by 28–84%, but the concentrations of Na⁺ or K⁺ in the leaves across genotypes was not correlated with yield in saline soil. Salinity increased leaf Cl– concentrations by 80–290%; the increase in young leaves had a significant association with reduced yield among genotypes only in the glasshouse in one year. We conclude that selection under controlled soil salinity and water content in pots can identify some genotypes that are salt tolerant, but for dryland saline environments verification of their tolerance in comparable environments is essential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aaboveground biomass 3aarid lands 3achickpeas 3agenetic variation 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3aphenology 3aresearch 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3asemiarid zones 3asoil salinity 3awater content 0aDAS 0aSWC 0aBiomass accumulation 0aDelay to flowering 0aWater-limited yield 0aLeaf ions 0aSeedling emergence 0aReproductive success1 aQuealy, John1 aStefanova, Katia1 aPang, Jiayin1 aColmer, Timothy D.1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.0 tField crops research.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 276 p.108392-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1083923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03851naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012800168300001600296520168700312592002801999650001602027650002502043650001402068650002802082650001802110650001202128650001202140650001302152650001102165650001102176650001602187650002102203650002602224650002602250650001502276650001902291650001802310650002102328650001402349650000902363650000902372650001102381650002002392650001402412650001402426650001202440650002802452650001102480650001302491650001402504650002602518650002002544650001402564650001302578650001402591650001302605650001102618650002102629650001302650650001402663650000902677651001202686653001602698653001402714653003102728653002802759653002302787700001902810700001702829773010502846856008502951852000903036655001203045IND60479958620221119053119.0160124e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047995862DNAL7 a10.1556/ABot.54.2012.3-4.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOloyede, F.

Degrowth can be either planned or autonomous based on voluntary simplicity (VS), characterized by voluntary constraints on the private consumptions. Any share of the working population is allowed to limit their private consumptions or ecological footprint. Degrowth means a lower economic growth rate as well as reductions in the usage of materials and fossil energy; however, when the economy cannot fit within the biophysical boundary despite such reductions, degrowth can also mean a deliberate transition towards lesser and cleaner production of a smaller number of goods. Taking ecological boundaries into consideration may thus switch the direction of an economy from growth to degrowth. Degrowth is consistent with economic equilibrium in the dynamic input-output model. Degrowth equilibrium results when a critical mass of the population prioritizes diminishing the ecological deficit over increasing the output levels. Green growth can take place during degrowth. While the economy gradually shrinks, the interest (profit) rate in macroeconomic equilibrium is negative due to the conservation target (excessive consumption has negative value to VS-type agents). Degrowing private consumptions implies less work, more leisure and better quality of the environment, improving social welfare. Degrowth can be advanced by adopting a more cooperative production system or by imposing high ecological taxes. The equilibrium model yields an argument for basic income as a means of supporting welfare during degrowth and of compensating for unpaid work. The open economy version of the model shows reduced scope for intra-industry trade between similar countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic development 3afossil fuels 3aincome 3alabor force 3amacroeconomics 3amodels 3asocial welfare 3ataxes 3atrade 0adegrowth 0avon Neumann model 0aDynamic equilibrium 0aInput-output models 0aEcological economics 0aVoluntary simplicity 0aRe-localization0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 251 p.119562-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1195623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015000175300001600325520114800341592002801489650000801517650000801525650002501533650001301558650002601571650001601597650002601613650002401639650001001663650002901673650002401702650001501726650001601741650001501757653003101772653002401803653000901827653002401836653002601860700001701886700002501903700001601928773010601944856008702050852000902137655001202146IND60536451220221117160905.0190409e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053645122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.03.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Silván, C.10aExploring the links between population dynamics of total and active bacteria and the variables influencing a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR)  ap. 103-114.  aLong-term dynamics of total and active bacterial populations in a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating urban wastewater were monitored during nine months by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of partial 16S-rRNA genes, amplified from community DNA and RNA templates. The bacterial community, dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, displayed the required characteristics for a successful and steady contaminant removal under real operating conditions. The evolution of population dynamics showed that a fully-stable microbial community was not developed even after technical stabilization and steady performance of the MBR were achieved. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and BIO-ENV demonstrated that the trends of the populations were often mostly explained by temperature, followed by the concentration of volatile suspended solids and C/N ratio of the influent. These variables were mainly responsible for triggering the shifts between functionally redundant populations. These conclusions contribute to the prediction of the complex profiles of adaptation and response of bacterial populations under changing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abioreactors 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3amultidimensional scaling 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3atemperature 3awastewater 0aUrban wastewater treatment 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aTGGE 0aPopulation dynamics 0aMultivariate analysis1 aArévalo, J.1 aGonzález-López, J.1 aRodelas, B.0 tBioresource technology.g2014 June, v. 162 p.103-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.03.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148242008800206245009100294300001600385520103400401592002801435596007101463650001901534650001301553650001401566650001901580650001301599650001601612650001401628650001301642650001201655650002301667700001501690700002001705700002301725700002201748773011701770856008301887852000901970655001201979IND60759270920221117015553.0211208e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075927092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00767-021-00496-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8088-140410aAktuelle und zukünftige Grundwasserversalzung in der nördlichen Elbe-Weser Region10aCurrent and future state of groundwater salinization of the northern Elbe-Weser region  ap. 343-356.  aSalinization of the upper aquifer of the northern Elbe-Weser region almost extends to the surface. Chloride content exceeds 250 mg/l and the groundwater is therefore, according to the German Drinking Water Ordinance, not suitable as drinking water. The chloride content in the aquifer originates from early flooding with seawater which occurred during the Holocene sea level rise. Depth and extent of the salinization were mapped by airborne electromagnetic surveys and validated by groundwater analyses. In the transition zone between the marshlands and geest areas, the fresh-saline groundwater interface falls to a depth of > −175 m NHN. Due to the extensive drainage of the marshlands, seepage of fresh groundwater is impeded. Instead, an upconing of the fresh-saline groundwater interface appears due to an upwardly directed hydraulic gradient. Due to climate change, chloride concentrations will increase along the coastlines. Further inland, a decrease of chloride content in near-surface groundwater will occur.  aPublisher supplied data  aInterreg North Sea Region Programme (J No 38 2460 27 15)cInterreg 3aHolocene epoch 3aaquifers 3achlorides 3aclimate change 3adrainage 3agroundwater 3asea level 3aseawater 3aseepage 3awater salinization1 aDeus, Nico1 aElbracht, Jörg1 aRahman, M.

Over two open–water seasons, acoustic telemetry was used to monitor tagged adults (n = 25) and subadults (n = 24) throughout a 9.8 km long run‐of‐the‐river reservoir located on the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. Movement and utilization patterns were examined for correlation with abiotic variables. Despite considerable individuality, the adult sample population increasingly utilized the lower sections of the reservoir when air and water temperatures were high, daylight hours were long, river flow was increasing, and flows were high. However, our hypothesis of a pronounced concentration of Lake Sturgeon occurring immediately upstream of the generating station when high flows coincided with the summer/fall period was not supported. This may be attributed to the presence of a shallow river narrows located 2.1 km upstream of the station, which appeared to restrict the extent of seasonal/flow influenced downstream movement by adults. Movements of individual subadults were also correlated to seasonal and flow variables, but directionality was not consistent and population level trends in utilization did not appear to be correlated to abiotic variables. Results suggest that in small reservoirs, adult utilization of the areas immediately upstream of hydroelectric facilities may be influenced more by seasonality than by flow conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aacoustics 3aadults 3aair 3aautumn 3arivers 3asummer 3atelemetry 3awater temperature 3aManitoba1 aBlanchfield, P.

In the past, household energy behavior was typically unknown because conventional meters only recorded the total amount of energy consumed for a household over a significant period of time. The rollout of smart meters enabled real-time household energy consumption to be recorded and analyzed. This paper uses smart meter readings from more than 5000 Irish households to identify energy behavior indicators through a cross-domain feature selection and coding approach. The idea is to extract and connect customers' features from energy domain and demography domain, i.e., smart metering data and household information. Smart metering data are characterized by typical energy spectral patterns, whereas household information is encoded as the energy behavior indicator. The results show that employment status and internet usage are highly correlated with household energy behavior in Ireland because employment status and internet usage have an important effect on lifestyle, including when to work, play, and rest, and hence yield a difference in electricity use style. The proposed approach offers a simple, transparent and effective alternative to a challenging cross-domain matching problem with massive smart metering data and energy behavior indicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aconsumers (people) 3ademography 3aemployment 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3ahouseholds 3alifestyle 3aIreland 0aHousehold energy behavior 0aDemographic factors 0aCustomer classification 0aFeature selection and coding1 aLi, Ran1 aLi, Furong1 aKang, Chongqing0 tEnergy.g2016 July 15, v. 107 p.9-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.03.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013500158300001800293500001900311520168800330592002802018650001502046650001302061650001602074650001402090650002802104650001602132650001702148650002502165650001502190650002502205700001802230700001202248700001402260700001702274700001502291700001702306700001702323700001402340700002002354700002002374700001502394773012902409856007402538852000902612655001202621IND60697229120221119074500.0200603e20200602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069722912DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm02012h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Boguang12aA conductive PEDOT/alginate porous scaffold as a platform to modulate the biological behaviors of brown adipose-derived stem cells  ap. 3173-3185.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe development of three-dimensional conductive scaffolds is vital to support the adhesion, proliferation and myocardial differentiation of stem cells in cardiac tissue engineering. Herein, we describe a facile approach for preparing a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/alginate (PEDOT/Alg) porous scaffold with a wide range of desirable properties. In the PEDOT/Alg scaffold, chemically crosslinked alginate networks are formed using adipic acid hydrazide as the crosslinker, and PEDOT is synthesized in situ in the alginate matrix simultaneously. PEDOT exists in the alginate matrix as particles and its morphology can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of PEDOT/alginate. The results also show that the swelling properties, degradation behaviors, mechanical strength and conductivity of the PEDOT/Alg scaffold can be controlled via adjusting the PEDOT/alginate ratio. The introduction of PEDOT can overcome the brittle nature of the pure alginate scaffold. Moreover, the PEDOT/Alg scaffold exhibits excellent conductivity (as high as 6 × 10⁻² S cm⁻¹). The introduction of PEDOT improves the protein absorption capacity of the alginate scaffold. To explore its potential application in cardiac tissue engineering, brown adipose-derived stem cells (BADSCs) are seeded in the prepared PEDOT/Alg porous scaffold. The results suggest that the PEDOT/Alg porous scaffold can support the attachment and proliferation of BADSCs. Moreover, it is beneficial for the cardiomyogenic differentiation of BADSCs, especially under electrical stimulation. Overall, we conclude that the PEDOT/Alg porous scaffold may represent an ideal platform to modulate the biological behaviors of BADSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3aadipic acid 3aalginates 3abiocompatible materials 3abrittleness 3acrosslinking 3aelectrical treatment 3ahydrazides 3astrength (mechanics)1 aYao, Fanglian1 aYe, Lei1 aHao, Tong1 aZhang, Yabin1 aZhang, Lei1 aDong, Dianyu1 aFang, Wancai1 aWang, Yan1 aZhang, Xiaoyang1 aWang, Changyong1 aLi, Junjie0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 June 2, v. 8, no. 11 p.3173-3185dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm02012h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245014400160300001600304520142000320592002801740650001001768650002101778650001401799650002101813650003801834650002801872650001701900650002501917650001701942650001501959650002701974650002902001650002902030650001902059650001302078650001002091650002402101653001202125653004102137653001802178653002802196653002402224700001702248700001702265700001402282700001502296700001402311700001602325700001502341700001102356700001502367700001402382700001502396773011402411856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60715968920221116184729.0211213e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071596892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, S.10aGlutathione-S-transferase A3 protein suppresses thiram-induced tibial dyschondroplasia by regulating prostaglandin-related genes expression  ap. 343-348.  aTibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is an intractable avian cartilage disease in which proximal growth plates of tibia lack blood vessels and contain nonviable cells, and it leads to the inflammatory response. Prostaglandins (PGs) genes have not been studied yet in TD chicken, and they might play role in skeletal metabolism, therefore we planned to explore the role of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase A3 (rGSTA3) protein and PG-related genes. In this study, qRT-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were used to identify the expression patterns of eight PG-related genes in the tibial growth plate of broiler chicken. The results showed that the expression of PG-related genes glutathione-S-transferase A3 (GSTA3), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), prostaglandin E2 receptor (PTGER) 3, PTGER4, prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1) and hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthases (HPGDS) expression were identified and could significantly respond to thiram-induced TD chicken. Interestingly, the expression of rate-limiting enzyme COX-2 and PGE₂ were induced after the treatment of rGSTA3 protein. These findings demonstrated that the occurrence of TD is closely related to the inhibition of PGs. Moreover, rGSTA3 protein participated in the recovery of TD by strengthening the expression of PG-related genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abroiler chickens 3acartilage 3adyschondroplasia 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglutathione transferase 3agrowth plate 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ametabolism 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandin-D synthase 3aprostaglandin-E synthase 3aprostaglandins 3aresearch 3atibia 3aveterinary medicine 0aBroiler 0aGlutathione-S-transferase A3 protein 0aProstaglandin 0aTibial dyschondroplasia 0aTibial growth plate1 aLi, Xunjing,1 aJahejo, A.R.1 aZhang, N.1 aYang, S.X.1 aJia, Y.F.1 aZhang, Y.Y.1 aTian, Z.X.1 aLi, Z.1 aNing, G.B.1 aZhang, D.1 aTian, W.X.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 Mar., v. 135 p.343-348dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009300159300001800252520108300270592002801353650001601381650001601397650001401413650001501427650001701442650001301459650001601472650001301488700002401501700001901525700003601544700001701580773014201597856007501739852000901814655001201823IND60756229120221122220417.0211111e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075622912DNAL7 a10.1039/d1tb01864g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazeer, Nauman10aAntibacterial activities of physiologically stable, self-assembled peptide nanoparticles  ap. 9041-9054.  aIn this study, we report that host defense protein-derived ten amino acid long disulfide-linked peptides self-assemble in the form of β-sheets and β-turns, and exhibit concentration-dependent self-assembly in the form of nanospheres, termed as disulfide linked nanospheres (DSNs). As expected, bare DSNs are prone to aggregation in ionic solutions and in the presence of serum proteins. To yield physiologically stable self-assembled peptide-based materials, DSNs are stabilized in the form of supramolecular assemblies using β-cyclodextrins (β-CD) and fucoidan, as delivery carriers. The inclusion complexes of DSNs with β-CD (β-CD–DSN) and electrostatic complexation of fucoidan with DSNs (FC–DSN) stabilizes the secondary structure of DSNs. Comparison of β-CD–DSNs with FC–DSNs reveals that inclusion complexes of DSNs formed in the presence of β-CD are highly stable under physiological conditions, show high cellular uptake, exhibit bacterial flocculation, and enhance antibacterial efficacies of DSNs in a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3achemistry 3adisulfides 3aflocculation 3afucoidan 3ananospheres 3apeptides1 aSimmons, Jeffrey R.1 aRainey, Jan K.1 aRodriguez-Lecompte, Juan Carlos1 aAhmed, Marya0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 9, no. 43 p.9041-9054dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1tb01864g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245014000170300001800310520080100328592002801129650002401157650002101181650001301202650002001215650001301235650001601248650001301264700002101277700002001298773012501318856007501443852000901518655001201527IND60779441620221122003557.0220608e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077944162DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc04378a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Fernandez, Adrian10aDeep eutectic solvents for the preservation of concentrated proteins: the case of lysozyme in 1 : 2 choline chloride : glycerol  ap. 4437-4442.  aThe stability and activity of a model protein, lysozyme, in 1 : 2 choline chloride : glycerol was characterised across a wide range of protein concentrations, i.e., between 4 and 143 mg ml⁻¹, where the protein is soluble and physically stable. Lysozyme folds into a globular conformation in this deep eutectic solvent like that in the native state, but with subtle variations in its internal structure. The protein remained stable even after 40 days of storage at room temperature and retrieved its native conformation and activity upon rehydration. These results show the potential of deep eutectic solvents as sustainable, non-toxic, and synthetically accessible media for the storage and preservation of proteins in a concentrated regime without the requirement of other excipients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acholine chloride 3aglycerol 3agreen chemistry 3alysozyme 3arehydration 3asolvents1 aPrevost, Sylvain1 aWahlgren, Marie0 tGreen chemistry.g2022 June 6, v. 24, no. 11 p.4437-4442dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc04378a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019700168300001600365520128900381592002801670650002001698650001901718650001601737650001101753650002401764650002501788650000901813650002001822650002001842650001901862653002101881653003301902653004101935653003101976653002202007653003402029700002502063700002202088700001602110700001702126700002002143773009002163856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60607830520221116233322.0180830e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060783052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.03.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lipeng10aMethod for reducing excess heat supply experienced in typical Chinese district heating systems by achieving hydraulic balance and improving indoor air temperature control at the building level  ap. 431-442.  aA common problem with Chinese district heating systems is that they supply more heat than the actual heat demand. The reason for this excess heat supply is the general failure to use control devices to adjust the indoor temperature and flow in the building heating systems in accordance with the actual heat demand. This results in 15–30% of the total supplied heat being lost. This paper proposes an integrated approach that aims to reduce the excess heat loss by introducing pre-set thermostatic radiator valves combined with automatic balancing valves. Those devices establish hydraulic balance, and stabilize indoor temperatures. The feasibility and the energy consumption reduction of this approach were verified by means of simulation and a field test. By moving the system from centrally planned heat delivery to demand-driven heat delivery, excess heat loss can be significantly reduced. Results show that once the hydraulic balance is achieved and indoor temperatures are controlled with this integrated approach, 17% heat savings and 42.8% pump electricity savings can be achieved. The energy savings will also have a positive environmental effect with seasonal reductions of 11 kg CO2, 0.1 kg SO2, and 0.03 kg NOx per heating square meter for a typical case in Harbin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental impact 3aheat 3aheating systems 3anitrogen oxides 3asulfur dioxide 0aDistrict heating 0aExcess heat supply reduction 0aPre-set thermostatic radiator valves 0aAutomatic balancing valves 0aHydraulic balance 0aDifferential pressure control1 aGudmundsson, Oddgeir1 aThorsen, Jan Eric1 aLi, Hongwei1 aLi, Xiaopeng1 aSvendsen, Svend0 tEnergy.g2016 July 15, v. 107 p.431-442dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.03.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245017200164500002200336520105200358592002801410650001501438650002201453650001301475650002401488650002601512650002901538650001301567650001801580650001701598650001401615653003301629653002401662653004101686653003901727700001501766700001501781700001601796700001701812700001601829700002101845700001201866773007301878856008201951852000902033655001202042IND60584463320221118024519.0171025s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058446332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lan-lan10aPerylenetetracarboxylic Acid and Carbon Quantum Dots Assembled Synergistic Electrochemiluminescence Nanomaterial for Ultra-sensitive Carcinoembryonic Antigen Detection  aPre-press version  aIt is important to design a nice electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biological nanomaterial for fabricating sensitive ECL immunosensor to detect tumor markers.

In the ECL nanomaterial, graphene was chosen as nanocarrier. Significant ECL intensity increases are seen in the ECL nanomaterial, which was interpreted with the proposed synergistic promotion ECL meachanism of PTCA and CQDs. Furthermore, this ECL nanomaterial was used to label secondary antibody and fabricate a sandwiched carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunosensor. The CEA immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity and the linear semilogarithmical range was from 0.001 fg mL-1 to 1 ng mL-1 with low detection limit 0.00026 fg mL-1. And the CEA immunosensor is also suitable for various cancers’ sample detection providing potential specific applications in diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3acarbon quantum dots 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3agraphene 3aimmunosensors 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasms 0aPerylenetetracarboxylic acid 0aCarbon quantum dots 0aSynergistic electrochemiluminescence 0aCarcinoembryonic antigen detection1 aZhang, Wei1 aShang, Lei1 aMa, Rong-na1 aJia, Li-ping1 aJia, Wen-li1 aWang, Huaisheng,1 aNiu, Li0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002300170024004000193024002500233040001800258100005700276245017800333300001200511500001500523520182700538592002802365596003202393650002502425650002302450650002502473650002802498650001902526650002302545650001402568650002402582650001802606650001902624650001502643650002002658650002302678651001602701651001902717700006002736700006202796700006002858700006002918773010802978856011403086856008303200961001303283852000903296655001203305IND60700587420221214225313.0200710e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070058742DNAL7 a3653162aris7 a10113/70058742hdl7 a10.1007/s10681-020-02644-42doi7 a3653162seq_no_1157 a6064-21000-016-00D2aris_project_no7 a4344972aris_accn_no  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Sukumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9041-982210aEffect of chromosome substitutions from Gossypium barbadense L., G. tomentosum Nutt. Ex Seem and G. mustelinum Watt into G. hirsutum L. on cottonseed protein and oil content  ap. 118.  agolden set  aCottonseed is the second-most common plant protein source after soybean, and the fifth-most common oil source after soybean, palm tree, colza and sunflower. There has been little economic incentive until recently to breed for cottonseed nutritional components. In our previous studies we used chromosome substitution (CS) lines to associate novel traits of importance with specific substituted chromosome. The objective of this research was to study the effect of chromosome or chromosome segment substitutions from Gossypium barbadense, G. tomentosum and G. mustelinum on cottonseed protein and oil content in Upland cotton (G. hirsutum). Nine euploid CS lines, TM-1, the recurrent parent line, and ‘UA48’, were experimentally compared using a randomized complete block design with four replications at each location in Florence, SC and Mississippi State, MS. Acid delinted cottonseeds were analyzed for protein and oil using near-infrared reflectance. Our overall results showed that an increase in protein percentage is normally associated with decrease in oil percentage or opposite effect in most of the CS lines. We discovered that specific chromosome or chromosome segment substitutions from the wild species of G. tomentosum and G. mustelinum were associated with altered protein and oil percentages, possibly indicating chromosomal associations with protein and oil percentage gene(s). Results revealed that CS-M08sh line had increased protein and oil percentages at MS, whereas changes in protein and oil percentages are normally in opposite directions. However, CS-M08sh line had highest oil percentage among all lines but with moderate protein percentage at SC. Novel germplasm with the gene(s) for improved protein and oil percentage was developed from wild species of Upland cotton’s primary gene pool.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-349cCotton Incorporated 3aGossypium barbadense 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aGossypium tomentosum 3achromosome substitution 3acottonseed oil 3acottonseed protein 3agene pool 3agenetic improvement 3alipid content 3aplant breeding 3apolyploidy 3aprotein content 3asubstitution lines 3aMississippi 3aSouth Carolina1 aBellaloui, Nacer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4368-60951 aJenkins, Johnie N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3586-84111 aMcCarty, Jack C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3907-82651 aStelly, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3468-41190 tEuphytica.g2020 July, v. 216, no. 7 p.118-118dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70058743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-020-02644-43Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010100167300001600268520149000284592002801774650001501802650001501817650001601832650001501848650001901863650002101882650003801903650001501941650001901956650001401975653003501989653002602024653004302050653004602093653003802139700001802177700001602195700001802211700001802229700001702247773011202264856008302376852000902459655001202468IND60584463420221118024511.0200509e20180315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058446342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwak, Bongseop10aSpiral shape microfluidic channel for selective isolating of heterogenic circulating tumor cells  ap. 311-316.  aDetecting heterogenic tumor cells that are traveling in our body through blood stream for the tumor metastasis is one way for cancer prognosis. Due to the heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), further identification of tumor cell types should be accompanied with CTCs isolation from blood cells in peripheral blood sample. Both negative enrichment and recollection of isolated CTCs are required in the downstream analysis, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and massive equipment required. To solve these limitations, we have developed a simple and disposable spiral shape microfluidic channel that can separate all CTCs from blood cells, and at the same time, can identify the types of CTCs based on epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression level. Two different types of tumor cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, both from the same origin of breast carcinoma cells, were used to demonstrate the functionality of the developed system. The spiral channel system could capture the EpCAM positive and negative CTCs with 96.3% and 81.2% purity, respectively, while both EpCAM positive and negative CTCs were differently positioned along the microfluidic channel. The average selectivity of EpCAM positive and negative CTCs is 6.1:4.8. In addition, the throughput of the system was optimized at a sample flow rate of 150µl/min. The developed system successfully demonstrated its potential to identify biomarkers, including EpCAM, for detecting the heterogenic CTCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood cells 3ablood flow 3ablood sampling 3abreast neoplasms 3aepithelial cell adhesion molecule 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aprognosis 0aCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) 0aHeterogeneity of CTCs 0aMagnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) 0aEpithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) 0aSpiral shape microfluidic channel1 aLee, Jeonghun1 aLee, Jaehun1 aKim, Hyun Soo1 aKang, Shinwon1 aLee, Yongkoo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Mar. 15, v. 101 p.311-316dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167300001700326520090000343592002801243650001801271650001601289650001001305650001601315650001001331651001001341773011801351856008201469852000901551655001201560IND60762751420221119083326.0220112e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076275142DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738210701502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidian, G.

FPPS is ubiquitous in eukaryotes and is inhibited by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BP). N-BP activity and the mechanisms of cell death as well as damage to the ultrastructure due to N-BP has not yet been investigated in Leishmania infantum and Giardia. Thus, we evaluated the effect of N-BP on cell viability and ultrastructure and then performed structural modelling and phylogenetic analysis on the FPPS enzymes of Leishmania and Giardia. METHODS: We performed multiple sequence alignment with MAFFT, phylogenetic analysis with MEGA7, and 3D structural modelling for FPPS with Modeller 9.18 and on I-Tasser server. We performed concentration curves with N-BP in Leishmania promastigotes and Giardia trophozoites to estimate the IC₅₀via the MTS/PMS viability method. The ultrastructure was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, and the mechanism of cell death by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate risedronate had stronger anti-proliferative activity in Leishmania compared to other N-BPs with an IC₅₀ of 13.8 µM, followed by ibandronate and alendronate with IC₅₀ values of 85.1 µM and 112.2 µM, respectively. The effect of N-BPs was much lower on trophozoites of Giardia than Leishmania (IC₅₀ of 311 µM for risedronate). Giardia treated with N-BP displayed concentric membranes around the nucleus and nuclear pyknosis. Leishmania had mitochondrial swelling, myelin figures, double membranes, and plasma membrane blebbing. The same population labelled with annexin-V and 7-AAD had a loss of membrane potential (TMRE), indicative of apoptosis. Multiple sequence alignments and structural alignments of FPPS proteins showed that Giardia and Leishmania FPPS display low amino acid identity but possess the conserved aspartate-rich motifs. CONCLUSIONS: Giardia and Leishmania FPPS enzymes are phylogenetically distant but display conserved protein signatures. The N-BPs effect on FPPS was more pronounced in Leishmania than Giardia. This might be due to general differences in metabolism and differences in the FPPS catalytic site.  aPublisher supplied data  aTO, 0054/13cFundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul  a025/2017cFundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGiardia 3aLeishmania infantum 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acell viability 3adolichols 3aenzymes 3aergosterol 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflow cytometry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amyelin sheath 3aphosphonates 3aphylogeny 3aplasma membrane 3apromastigotes 3aproteins 3asequence alignment 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atrophozoites 3aultrastructure1 aBrigagao, Claudia Maia1 ada Silva, Martha Barros1 aRodrigues, Aline Beatriz Mello1 aGuimarães, Ana Carolina Ramos1 aPaiva, Fernando1 aSouza, Wanderley de,1 aHenriques, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3056-19710 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.168-168dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04019-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007900171300001600250520158200266592002801848650002601876650003001902650001301932650002201945650001701967650001401984650002201998650002602020650002302046650002102069650001702090651001102107651001502118651002002133653001002153653001702163653003402180653003202214700001302246700001802259700001402277700001602291700001802307773010402325856008702429852000902516655001202525IND60593772820221119134919.0190326e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059377282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dongyang10aGlobal distribution and evolvement of urbanization and PM2.5 (1998–2015)  ap. 171-178.  aPM2.5 concentrations increased and have been one of the major social issues along with rapid urbanization in many regions of the world in recent decades. The development of urbanization differed among regions, PM2.5 pollution also presented discrepant distribution across the world. Thus, this paper aimed to grasp the profile of global distribution of urbanization and PM2.5 and their evolutionary relationships. Based on global data for the proportion of the urban population and PM2.5 concentrations in 1998–2015, this paper investigated the spatial distribution, temporal variation, and evolutionary relationships of global urbanization and PM2.5. The results showed PM2.5 presented an increasing trend along with urbanization during the study period, but there was a variety of evolutionary relationships in different countries and regions. Most countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and some African countries developed with the rapid increase in both urbanization and PM2.5. Under the impact of other socioeconomic factors, such as industry and economic growth, the development of urbanization increased PM2.5 concentrations in most Asian countries and some African countries, but decreased PM2.5 concentrations in most European and American countries. The findings of this study revealed the spatial distributions of global urbanization and PM2.5 pollution and provided an interpretation on the evolution of urbanization-PM2.5 relationships, which can contribute to urbanization policies making aimed at successful PM2.5 pollution control and abatement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3ageographical distribution 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3aparticulates 3apollution 3apollution control 3asocioeconomic factors 3atemporal variation 3aurban population 3aurbanization 3aAfrica 3aSouth Asia 3aSouth East Asia 0aPM2.5 0aUrbanization 0aBivariate spatial association 0aEnvironmental Kuznets Curve1 aYe, Chao1 aWang, Xiaomin1 aLu, Debin1 aXu, Jianhua1 aYang, Haiqing0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 June, v. 182 p.171-178dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245008800165300001600253500001500269520148100284592002801765650001201793650002201805650002101827650001201848650001201860650001901872650001301891650001301904650001001917650002101927650002201948650001001970650001101980651001701991653001002008700001902018700001602037700001702053700001902070773009202089856008502181852000902266655001202275IND4465197920221120031107.0141112e20120224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446519792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2011.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwart, P.A.10aMicropropagation of Romulea sabulosa Schltr. ex Beg. - A potential ornamental plant  ap. 151-156.  a2019-12-06  aRomulea sabulosa Schltr. ex Beg. is an endemic, attractive and rare flowering species in South Africa with horticultural potential. There is a great need to develop in vitro propagation techniques for this species for the purpose of conservation and commercialization. In this regard, the suitability of the intact seeds and embryos as explants was examined. Excised mature zygotic embryos were selected as the explant source due to a low percentage of seed germination (4.5%). Excised embryos were placed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented with different concentrations of kinetin and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Shoot clusters developed on MS medium supplemented with kinetin without 2,4-D. Multiplication was best on a MS medium supplemented with 2.5μM mTR [6-(3-hydroxybenzylamino)-9-β-d-ribofuranosylpurine]. Shoots were multiplied from selected explants on a MS medium with 23.2μM kinetin and were then used for corm induction experiments. Shoots were placed on MS media supplemented with 3, 6, or 9% sucrose, 5mgl⁻¹ activated charcoal or 23.2μM kinetin. Corm formation was observed for all treatments placed at 10, 15, and 20°C. Corm induction was significantly higher at 10 and 20°C. The heaviest corms were produced at 15°C on a MS medium supplemented with 6% sucrose. In some cases multiple corms formed from a single shoot. The findings of this study will assist in propagating R. sabulosa for commercial and conservation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3akinetin 3aornamental plants 3aseed germination 3aRomulea 3asucrose 3aembryo (plant) 3aexplants 3acharcoal 3acorms 3amicropropagation 3acommercialization 3a2,4-D 3ashoots 3aSouth Africa 0aseeds1 aKulkarni, M.G.1 aBairu, M.W.1 aFinnie, J.F.1 aVan Staden, J.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2012 Feb. 24, v. 135 p.151-156dElsevier B.V.x0304-42387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2011.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009700168300001200265520113400277592002801411650001701439650001401456650001201470650001801482650002801500650001201528650001501540650001501555650002201570650001901592650001101611650000901622650001001631651001601641700003201657773010501689856008201794852000901876655001201885IND60684762920221116150808.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068476292DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-019-00403-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDigal, Larry N.10aFactors Affecting the Adoption of Hybrid and High-Yielding Rice Varieties in the Philippines  ap. 1-8.  aThe Philippines has recently been aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in rice. Recent programs and policies have been anchored on the development and adoption of high-yielding rice varieties in order to achieve this goal. Thus, this paper aims to identify the factors that significantly affect the farmers’ adoption of high-yielding varieties such as hybrid and certified inbred rice. Using a multinomial logistic model, these factors were estimated. Results show that the age, input assistance, and collective marketing significantly affect the adoption of certified inbred rice over farmers’ recycled seeds. On the other hand, irrigation, farm size, and trainings significantly affect the adoption of hybrid over farmer’s recycled seeds. In general, there was a low adoption rate of hybrid rice. Key informant interviews revealed that several issues arise in the process of seed growing, production, and marketing. Therefore, to increase the farmers’ incentive to adopt hybrid rice, a hybrid variety that produces superior grain quality and resistance to stresses must be developed and distributed at a reasonable price.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3afarm size 3afarmers 3agrain quality 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3ahybrids 3ainterviews 3airrigation 3aissues and policy 3alogit analysis 3aprices 3arice 3aseeds 3aPhilippines1 aPlacencia, Shemaiah Gail P.0 tAgricultural research.g2020 Mar., v. 9, no. 1 p.1-8dSpringer IndiawJournal:21667x2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-019-00403-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013200170300002000302520150300322592002801825596004901853650004401902650002301946650002201969650002801991650001002019650002302029650003402052650002102086650001502107650001302122650001902135650001102154650001302165650002702178650003502205650003702240700001902277700002202296700007102318773012402389856008302513852000902596655001202605IND60732342020221121121015.0210731e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073234202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-05989-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLjubek, Gabrijela10aEnergetically efficient and electrochemically tuneable exfoliation of graphite: process monitoring and product characterization  ap. 10859-10875.  aIn this work, graphene oxide was prepared by electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in sodium dodecyl sulphate and sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate aqueous solution. Two different working electrodes were investigated: an electrode prepared from natural graphite flakes and a commercial natural graphite rod. The working electrode was polarized in a two-electrode system by using platinum counter electrode and by a multistep change of polarity or by single anodic and cathodic polarization. The voltage value ranged from 2.5 to 3.2 V. By monitoring the current transients and the colour of the resultant solutions, it was shown that the exfoliation process depends on the type of working electrode, surfactants and applied voltage value. The multistep change of polarity was more effective compared to single polarization. The ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry and Raman spectroscopy indicated the presence of defects within the graphene structure, while FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of oxygen functional groups, which is characteristic of graphene oxide (GO). Dynamic light scattering revealed that the solutions obtained in this work contained GO sheets within the size of 10–600 nm. Atomic force microscopy measurements proved that the obtained product contains multilayer sheets. The energy consumption for the process carried out in this work ranges from 0.084–0.038 kWh g⁻¹, and therefore this process is considered to be a low-energy and cost-effective process.  aPublisher supplied data  aIP-2013-11-8825cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aČapeta, Davor1 aŠrut Rakić, Iva1 aKraljić Roković, Marijana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5953-98850 tJournal of materials science.g2021 June, v. 56, no. 18 p.10859-10875dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-05989-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001700189245017000206300001100376500001900387506007600406520219200482592002802674506003702702650002302739650001802762650000902780650001102789650002002800650001402820650001502834650001602849650000902865650001302874650001902887650001502906650000902921650001102930700001602941700001502957700001802972700001702990700001903007700001903026700001803045700005403063773012903117856008303246852000903329655001203338IND60687993120221207073559.0201208e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068799312DNAL7 aPMC71328972pmcid7 a322804612pmid7 a10.1186/s40104-020-00436-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Lixin10aHigh rumen degradable starch decreased goat milk fat via trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid-mediated downregulation of lipogenesis genes, particularly, INSIG1  ap. 30.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Starch is an important substance that supplies energy to ruminants. To provide sufficient energy for high-yielding dairy ruminants, they are typically fed starch-enriched diets. However, starch-enriched diets have been proven to increase the risk of milk fat depression (MFD) in dairy cows. The starch present in ruminant diets could be divided into rumen-degradable starch (RDS) and rumen escaped starch (RES) according to their different degradation sites (rumen or intestine). Goats and cows have different sensitivities to MFD. Data regarding the potential roles of RDS in milk fat synthesis in the mammary tissue of dairy goats and in regulating the occurrence of MFD are limited. RESULTS: Eighteen Guanzhong dairy goats (day in milk = 185 ± 12 d) with similar parity, weight, and milk yield were selected and randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 6), which were fed an LRDS diet (Low RDS = 20.52%), MRDS diet (Medium RDS = 22.15%), or HRDS diet (High RDS = 24.88%) for 5 weeks. Compared with that of the LRDS group, the milk fat contents in the MRDS and HRDS groups significantly decreased. The yields of short-, medium- and long-chain fatty acids decreased in the HRDS group. Furthermore, increased RDS significantly decreased ruminal B. fibrisolvens and Pseudobutyrivibrio abundances and increased the trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and trans-10 C18:1 contents in the rumen fluid. A multiomics study revealed that the HRDS diet affected mammary lipid metabolism down-regulation of ACSS2, MVD, AGPS, SCD5, FADS2, CERCAM, SC5D, HSD17B7, HSD17B12, ATM, TP53RK, GDF1 and LOC102177400. Remarkably, the significant decrease of INSIG1, whose expression was depressed by trans-10, cis-12 CLA, could reduce the activity of SREBP and, consequently, downregulate the downstream gene expression of SREBF1. CONCLUSIONS: HRDS-induced goat MFD resulted from the downregulation of genes involved in lipogenesis, particularly, INSIG1. Specifically, even though the total starch content and the concentrate-to-fiber ratio were the same as those of the high-RDS diet, the low and medium RDS diets did not cause MFD in lactating goats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudobutyrivibrio 3abiotechnology 3adiet 3aenergy 3agene expression 3agoat milk 3aintestines 3alipogenesis 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3amultiomics 3arisk 3astarch1 aWu, Shengru1 aShen, Jing1 aHan, Xiaoying1 aJin, Chunjia1 aChen, Xiaodong1 aZhao, Shengguo1 aCao, Yangchun1 aYao, Junhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6318-65760 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2020 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.30-30dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-020-00436-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245005200176300001400228520139900242592002801641650001301669650001201682650001501694650002201709650001101731650001801742650001301760650001201773650002801785653002701813653002201840653001901862653001401881653003101895653001101926700001701937700002401954700002301978700005702001700001902058700002502077773010902102856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60543758720221116150507.0190411e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054375872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindahl, Karin Beland14aThe Swedish forestry model: More of everything?  ap. 44-55.  a“The Swedish forestry model” refers to the forest regime that evolved following the 1993 revision of the Swedish Forestry Act. It is key to Swedish forest politics and used to capture the essence of a sustainable way of managing forests. However, the ideas, institutions and practices comprising the model have not been comprehensively analyzed previously. Addressing this knowledge gap, we use frame analysis and a Pathways approach to investigate the underlying governance model, focusing on the way policy problems are addressed, goals, implementation procedures, outcomes and the resulting pathways to sustainability. We suggest that the institutionally embedded response to pressing sustainability challenges and increasing demands is expansion, inclusion and integration: more of everything. The more-of-everything pathway is influenced by ideas of ecological modernization and the optimistic view that existing resources can be increased. Our findings suggest that in effect it prioritizes the economic dimension of sustainability. While broadening out policy formulation it closes down the range of alternative outputs, a shortcoming that hampers its capacity to respond to current sustainability challenges. Consequently, there is a need for a broad public debate regarding not only the role of forests in future society, but also the operationalization of sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforestry 3aforests 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3amodernization 3apolitics 3asociety 3asustainable development 0aForest policy analysis 0aForest governance 0aFrame analysis 0aTradeoffs 0aPathways to sustainability 0aSweden1 aSténs, Anna1 aSandström, Camilla1 aJohansson, Johanna1 aLidskog, Rolf1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6735-00111 aRanius, Thomas1 aRoberge, Jean-Michel0 tForest policy and economics.g2017 Apr., v. 77 p.44-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245013800204300001600342520181100358592002802169650001302197650002002210650001602230650001602246650001502262650001302277650004302290650001502333650001602348650000902364650001102373650001002384650002302394650000902417650002002426650001202446650002102458651001002479653002902489653001002518653000902528653000802537653001002545700001802555700002102573700006702594700002002661700002502681773010402706856008602810852000902896655001202905IND60633497820221120061914.0200106e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063349782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5773-400310aSpatial prediction of groundwater potentiality using ANFIS ensembled with teaching-learning-based and biogeography-based optimization  ap. 435-448.  aGroundwater is one of the most beneficial natural resources worldwide. The main aim of the present study is the mapping of groundwater potential of the Zhangjiamao area in China using two novel hybrid data mining techniques that involve the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) ensembled with teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO). First, 93 spring locations were identified in the study area, which were randomly divided in the ratio of 70:30 to be used for building models and validation, respectively. A total of 16 spring affecting factors viz., slope aspect, altitude, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, curvature, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to rivers, rainfall, lithology, soil, NDVI, and land use/land cover, were used as input variables. The probability certainty factor (PCF) method was applied for the correlation analysis between spring occurrences and the affecting factors. Subsequently, the ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS-BBO models were generated to produce groundwater spring potential maps (GSPMs). Finally, the GSPMs were evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The results showed that the AUROC values for the ANFIS-TLBO model based on the training and validation datasets were 0.866 and 0.905, respectively. In contrast, the AUROC values for the ANFIS-BBO model based on the training and validation datasets were 0.861 and 0.887, respectively. The results of ANFIS-TLBO showed that 25.66% of the study area could be classified into the high and very high groundwater spring potential classes as compared to the ANFIS-BBO model (30.52%). The results of the present study can be useful for groundwater management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3adata collection 3afuzzy logic 3agroundwater 3aland cover 3aland use 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3aprobability 3arain 3arivers 3aroads 3asediment transport 3asoil 3asprings (water) 3astreams 3awater management 3aChina 0aGroundwater potentiality 0aANFIS 0aTLBO 0aBBO 0aChina1 aPanahi, Mahdi1 aKhosravi, Khabat1 aPourghasemi, Hamid Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5825-14221 aRezaie, Fatemeh1 aParvinnezhad, Davoud0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 May, v. 572 p.435-448dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001800159245012600177300001800303500000900321520161000330592002801940650002301968650001301991650002202004650001702026650001002043650001702053650001602070650001902086650001502105650001402120650001202134650002202146650001802168650002402186650001302210650001802223650001402241650000902255650002202264650002002286650001202306650002702318650001602345650002402361650001202385650003102397650003002428650002402458650003702482650002202519650002202541650001702563650004502580650003202625651001002657700002602667700002102693773019402714852000902908856007702917655001202994IND4400431020221121062048.0191028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440043102DNAL7 a179653792pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2007.00572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmil, Beatriz10aResponses of a Non–N-Limited Forest Plantation to the Application of Alkaline-Stabilized Dewatered Dairy Factory Sludge  ap. 1765-1774.  aepub  aAmendment of forest soils with dewatered dairy factory sludge (DDFS), characterized by low heavy metal contents and high amounts of degradable C, can prevent the depletion of soil nutrients that results from intensive harvesting in forest plantations. However, this practice involves environmental risks when N supplies exceed the demand of plants or when the strong acidity of the soil favors the mobility of trace metals. These aspects were assessed in a young radiata pine plantation growing in a sandy, acidic, and organic N-rich soil for the 7 yr after application of a DDFS. The supply of limiting nutrients (mainly P, Mg, and Ca) provided by application of the DDFS, along with control of the ground vegetation, improved the nutritional status of the stand and led to increases in timber volume of more than 60 to 100%. Increases in soil inorganic N were observed during the first months after amendment. Data from soil incubation experiments revealed that some of the additional N was immobilized and, to a lesser extent, denitrified due to the readily available organic C content of the DDFS. Leaching and increased plant uptake of N were prevented by a combination of the latter processes and the low rate of nitrification. The strong acidity of the soil enhanced the availability of Mn and Zn to plants, although the maximum concentrations did not reach levels harmful to organisms. We conclude that although application of DDFS has positive effects on tree nutrition and growth and the environmental risks are low, repeated application may favor mobility of N and availability of heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest plantations 3anitrogen 3awaste utilization 3aheavy metals 3aPinus 3aforest soils 3asandy soils 3asoil nutrients 3aphosphorus 3amagnesium 3acalcium 3aground vegetation 3aforest stands 3asoil organic carbon 3aleaching 3anitrification 3amanganese 3azinc 3auptake mechanisms 3aplant nutrition 3adairies 3afood processing wastes 2aAgriculture 2aAlkaliesxchemistry 2aBiomass 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetals, Heavyxmetabolism 2aMineralsxchemistry 2aNitrogenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutantsxchemistry 3aSpain1 aMosquera-Losada, Rosa1 aMerino, Agustín0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2007 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.1765-1774dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.00573Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02794naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011400205300001400319520135600333592002801689650002201717650002301739650001801762650001701780650001201797650002201809650002201831650001801853650002201871650003001893650002201923651001001945653002201955653002601977653002402003653003802027700001902065700001802084700001502102700001602117773010902133856008502242852000902327655001202336IND60543758820221116150527.0190411e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054375882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, M.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7210-479810aForest transition and socio-economic development in India and their implications for forest transition theory  ap. 65-71.  aThe paper provides a detailed analysis of forest transition in India, exploring the direct and underlying causes and factors that explain deforestation and forest degradation, decline in deforestation and forest degradation, and forest recovery. The paper reviews these causes and factors during the periods before India experienced forest transition and after it experienced forest transition, which happened during the 1980s. Causes and forces that caused deforestation and forest degradation were forest exploitation for timber, an increased population that sought agricultural land, economic modernization through expansion of agricultural production, forest dependence and related forest exploitation, and even forest conversion when forest land became notified and thus forest owners lost rights to derive benefits from forests. Causes and factors that reduced deforestation and forest degradation and resulted in forest recovery, included agricultural intensification, government policies, private tree and forest production and smallholder and community forestry. Multiple forest transition pathways can be signaled as having contributed to forest transition pathways in India. The case of India actually question to what extent the forest transition pathway concept is valid for contemporary forest transition in complex countries like India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acommunity forestry 3adeforestation 3aforest trees 3aforests 3aintensive farming 3aissues and policy 3amodernization 3apopulation growth 3asocioeconomic development 3atimber production 3aIndia 0aForest transition 0aStages of development 0aTransition pathways 0aSustainable management of forests1 aBhojvaid, P.P.1 aJong, Wil de,1 aAshraf, J.1 aReddy, S.R.0 tForest policy and economics.g2017 Mar., v. 76 p.65-71dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008900169300001800258520140700276592002801683650002601711650002501737650001201762650001301774650001301787650001401800650001301814650002301827650002701850650001001877700002101887700001801908773011801926856008202044990002302126852000902149655001202158IND60099834120221119120458.0141105e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009983412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahian, Mozhgan10aUnexplained neonatal jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection  ap. e487-e490.  aBACKGROUND: Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the presenting signs of bacterial infection in newborns, and the association of neonatal jaundice with urinary tract infection (UTI) has been particularly emphasized. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of UTI in asymptomatic jaundiced neonates younger than 4 weeks old. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 120 asymptomatic jaundiced and 122 healthy neonates without jaundice younger than 4 weeks old for UTI. Patients with UTI, defined as >10 000 colony-forming units of a single pathogen per milliliter urine obtained by bladder catheterization, were evaluated for sepsis. RESULTS: Of 120 asymptomatic jaundiced neonates with a mean age of 7 ± 4 days, 15 (12.5%) had a UTI. Of 122 healthy neonates, positive urine cultures from a urine bag were found in eight cases; however on reevaluation, urine cultures from bladder catheterization were negative. The most common pathogen isolated from the UTI cases was Klebsiella pneumoniae. Also, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia was detected in all jaundiced patients with UTI. CONCLUSION: UTI was found in 12.5% of the asymptomatic jaundiced neonates with the onset of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the first week of life. Therefore, we suggest that urine culture should be considered as a part of the diagnostic evaluation of jaundiced neonates older than 3 days with an unexplained etiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3abacterial infections 3abladder 3ajaundice 3aneonates 3apathogens 3apatients 3asepsis (infection) 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine1 aRashtian, Parisa1 aKalani, Mehdi0 tInternational journal of infectious diseases.g2012 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.e487-e490dElsevier Ltdx1201-97127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010600173300001600279500001500295520107800310592002801388650001701416650001601433650002401449650001801473650001801491650002401509650001201533650002401545650003301569650001301602650001801615650001001633650001701643650002501660650001901685650001801704653001801722653003901740653002001779653001701799653003201816653002501848700001801873700002301891700002401914700001901938700002201957773010001979856008702079852000902166655001202175IND60526056020221122045029.0190402e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052605602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠumić, Zdravko10aModeling and optimization of red currants vacuum drying process by response surface methodology (RSM)  ap. 465-475.  a2019-12-06  aFresh red currants were dried by vacuum drying process under different drying conditions. Box–Behnken experimental design with response surface methodology was used for optimization of drying process in terms of physical (moisture content, water activity, total color change, firmness and rehydratation power) and chemical (total phenols, total flavonoids, monomeric anthocyanins and ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity) properties of dried samples. Temperature (48–78°C), pressure (30–330mbar) and drying time (8–16h) were investigated as independent variables. Experimental results were fitted to a second-order polynomial model where regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to determine model fitness and optimal drying conditions. The optimal conditions of simultaneously optimized responses were temperature of 70.2°C, pressure of 39mbar and drying time of 8h. It could be concluded that vacuum drying provides samples with good physico-chemical properties, similar to lyophilized sample and better than conventionally dried sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3atemperature 3amathematical models 3avacuum drying 3afreeze drying 3aexperimental design 3aphenols 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3afirmness 3awater content 3acolor 3ared currants 3aantioxidant activity 3awater activity 3aascorbic acid 0aVacuum drying 0aResponse surface methodology (RSM) 0aRibes rubrum L. 0aOptimization 0aPhysico-chemical properties 0aanalysis of variance1 aVakula, Anita1 aTepić, Aleksandra1 aČakarević, Jelena1 aVitas, Jasmina1 aPavlić, Branimir0 tFood chemistry.g2016 July 15, v. 203 p.465-475dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010800169300001800277520141000295592002801705650003001733650001201763650001501775650002201790650002201812650001601834650002301850650001601873650001401889650001301903650001401916650001401930650000901944650001701953650001701970650000901987650001801996651001002014700001502024700001502039700001602054700001902070773011802089856008202207990002302289852000902312655001202321IND60099834220221119120651.0141105e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009983422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidyalakshmi, K.10aEmerging clinico-epidemiological trends in melioidosis: analysis of 95 cases from western coastal India  ap. e491-e497.  aOBJECTIVES: To study the clinico-epidemiological trends in melioidosis, an emerging disease in the western coastal region of India. METHODS: Data of 95 patients with melioidosis in the western coastal region of India were retrospectively analyzed with respect to monthly rainfall, risk factors, clinical presentations, and outcome. RESULTS: A strong linear correlation was seen between average monthly rainfall and the occurrence of cases (p=0.002). Mortality was seen only in patients with bacteremia (p<0.001). Nine (40.9%) patients with septic shock died (p<0.001). Age ≥40 years and diabetes mellitus were seen in 75.8% of cases, each. Pneumonia was the most common clinical presentation (32.6%), followed by musculoskeletal disease (20%), melioidotic lymphadenopathy (7.4%), and dental abscess (6.3%). Only 36.8% of patients had exposure to wet soil/surface water. CONCLUSIONS: Melioidosis is quite prevalent in the western coastal region of India, and is strongly associated with rainfall, age, and diabetes mellitus. Higher proportions of musculoskeletal, dental, and lymph node melioidosis were seen in this region as compared to endemic areas. Bacteremic melioidosis has a poorer prognosis than non-bacteremic melioidosis. The presence of septic shock is a strong predictor of mortality. Percutaneous inoculation may not be the main portal of entry for Burkholderia pseudomallei in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aabscess 3abacteremia 3adiabetes mellitus 3aemerging diseases 3alymph nodes 3alymphatic diseases 3amelioidosis 3amortality 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aprognosis 3arain 3arisk factors 3aseptic shock 3asoil 3asurface water 3aIndia1 aLipika, S.1 aVishal, S.1 aDamodar, S.1 aChakrapani, M.0 tInternational journal of infectious diseases.g2012 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.e491-e497dElsevier Ltdx1201-97127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245011300215300001800328506007600346520147700422592002801899506003701927650002701964650002001991650000802011650002102019650001402040650001602054650001002070650001502080650001702095650002702112650002402139653001502163653001302178653001802191653001502209700001802224773010702242856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60691218720221207133413.0200428e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069121872DNAL7 a10.1080/15476286.2016.12297322doi7 aPMC52073872pmcid7 a275925912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouri-Ze'evi, Leah10aPlastic germline reprogramming of heritable small RNAs enables maintenance or erasure of epigenetic memories  ap. 1212-1217.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Caenorhabditis elegans small RNAs can regulate genes across generations. The mysterious tendency of heritable RNA interference (RNAi) responses to terminate after 3–5 generations has been referred to as “the bottleneck to RNAi inheritance.” We have recently shown that the re-setting of epigenetic inheritance after 3–5 generations is not due to passive dilution of the original RNA trigger, but instead results from an active, multigenerational, and small RNA-mediated regulatory pathway. In this “Point of View” manuscript we suggest that the process that leads to the erasure of the ancestral small RNA-encoded memory is a specialized type of germline reprogramming mechanism, analogous to the processes that robustly remove parental DNA methylation and histone modifications early in development in different organisms. Traditionally, germline reprogramming mechanisms that re-set chromatin are thought to stand in the way of inheritance of memories of parental experiences. We found that reprogramming of heritable small RNAs takes multiple generations to complete, enabling long-term inheritance of small RNA responses. Moreover, the duration of this reprogramming process can be prolonged significantly if new heritable RNAi responses are provoked. A dedicated signaling pathway that is responsive to environmental cues can tune the epigenetic state of the RNAi inheritance system, so that inheritance of particular small RNA species can be extended.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDNA methylation 3aRNA 3aRNA interference 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahistone code 3ainheritance (genetics) 3asignal transduction 0aC. elegans 0agermline 0areprogramming 0asmall RNAs1 aRechavi, Oded0 tRNA biology.g2016 Dec. 1, v. 13, no. 12 p.1212-1217dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2016.12297323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001400189245013100203300001800334520133500352592002801687650001901715650003301734650002701767650001501794650002201809650001501831650001901846650001601865650001701881650002801898650001301926650002001939650001201959651001001971700002401981700002102005700001902026700001402045700002002059773011802079856008202197990002302279852000902302655001202311IND60099834320221119120511.0141105e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009983432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.0132doi7 aPMC33787742pmcid7 a225344732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jiang12aA mixed methods approach to identifying factors related to voluntary HIV testing among injection drug users in Shanghai, China  ap. e498-e503.  aOBJECTIVES: Injection drug use is a major route of HIV transmission in China, yet relatively little is known about why so few injection drug users utilize free HIV testing services. This study aimed to examine barriers to HIV testing and voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) service utilization among injection drug users in Shanghai, China. METHODS: Utilizing mixed methods, we analyzed data from a survey of 540 compulsory drug abuse treatment patients and data from focus groups with 70 service providers and patients. RESULTS: Only 24.4% of patients expressed willingness to be tested for HIV. Willingness to be tested was associated with younger age and more positive attitudes towards condom use. Patients reported several barriers to utilization of voluntary HIV testing services, including lack of information about these services, perceptions of no risk or low-risk for HIV infection, fear of positive results, and the stigma or discrimination that may be experienced by the patient or their family. Having limited skills related to HIV counseling was reported by service providers as the primary barrier to encouraging patients to utilize HIV testing/VCT services. CONCLUSIONS: Special intervention programs targeting injection drug users, their family members, and service providers may increase HIV testing in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aattitudes and opinions 3acounseling 3adisease diagnosis 3adrug abuse 3adrug injection 3afearfulness 3afocus groups 3apathogen identification 3apatients 3arisk perception 3asurveys 3aChina1 aLombardi, Christina1 aEvans, Elizabeth1 aJiang, Haifeng1 aZhao, Min1 aMeng, Ying-Ying0 tInternational journal of infectious diseases.g2012 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.e498-e503dElsevier Ltdx1201-97127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2012.02.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011600185300001600301520079300317592002801110650001601138650002901154650001301183650001901196650001901215650002601234650005001260650003801310650002501348650002901373650002601402650004001428650002201468650003101490650004301521650002401564650003201588650003101620650005001651650002601701773010401727856008101831852000901912655001201921IND4480236020221122035900.0141110e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448023602DNAL7 a224451902pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2012.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednarek, Paweł10aChemical warfare or modulators of defence responses – the function of secondary metabolites in plant immunity  ap. 407-414.  aIn plants, a host's responses to an attempted infection include activation of various secondary metabolite pathways, some of which are specific for particular plant phylogenetic clades. Phytochemicals that represent respective end products in plant immunity have been stereotypically linked to antimicrobial properties. However, in many cases, owing to the lack of unequivocal evidence for direct antibiotic action in planta, alternative functions of secondary metabolites should be considered. Correspondingly, recent findings have identified novel, and rather unexpected, functions of phytochemicals in plant immunity that mediate regulatory pathways for conserved defence responses. It also seems likely that these conserved responses can be regulated by clade-specific phytochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3aimmunity 3aphytochemicals 3aplant products 3asecondary metabolites 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersximmunology 2aAnti-Infective Agentsximmunology 2aBacteriaximmunology 2aBenzoxazinesximmunology 2aCell Wallximmunology 2aChemical Warfare Agentsxmetabolism 2aFungiximmunology 2aGlucosinolatesximmunology 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsximmunology 2aIndolesximmunology 2aIsothiocyanatesximmunology 2aPlant Immunityximmunology 2aPlantsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aThiazolesximmunology0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2012 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.407-414dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008700172300001600259520116100275592002801436650002901464650002201493650002801515650001801543650001801561650001501579650002101594700001701615700001401632700001901646700001801665773013801683856008701821852000901908655001201917IND60760518820221116172416.0211223e20211208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076051882DNAL7 a10.3390/agriengineering30400612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dongliang 10aResearch Progress on Remote Sensing Classification Methods for Farmland Vegetation  ap. 971-989.  aCrop planting area and spatial distribution information have important practical significance for food security, global change, and sustainable agricultural development. How to efficiently and accurately identify crops in a timely manner by remote sensing in order to determine the crop planting area and its temporal–spatial dynamic change information is a core issue of monitoring crop growth and estimating regional crop yields. Based on hundreds of relevant documents from the past 25 years, in this paper, we summarize research progress in relation to farmland vegetation identification and classification by remote sensing. The classification and identification of farmland vegetation includes classification based on vegetation index, spectral bands, multi-source data fusion, artificial intelligence learning, and drone remote sensing. Representative studies of remote sensing methods are collated, the main content of each technology is summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Current problems related to crop remote sensing identification are then identified and future development directions are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3aartificial intelligence 3afood security 3aglobal change 3avegetation 3avegetation index1 aSu, Xiaoyun 1 aWeng, Bo 1 aWang, Tianshu 1 aYang, Feiyun 0 tAgriEngineering.g2021 Dec. 08, v. 3, no. 4 p.971-989dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27129x2624-74027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering30400613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04263naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245019400162300001800356520248900374592002802863650001502891650002202906650001602928650001202944650001502956650002202971650001702993650002003010650001003030650001303040650001703053650001703070650002003087650002103107650003303128650005003161650001803211650001403229650001703243650001403260650001703274650003203291653001403323653003003337653001703367700001703384700001703401700001903418700001703437773015503454856007903609852000903688655001203697IND60580927120221118195120.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058092712DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-121062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, P.R.B.10aEffect of recombinant bovine somatotropin on leukocyte mRNA expression for genes related to cell energy metabolism, cytokine production, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and adaptive immunity  ap. 8471-8483.  aObjectives of the current experiment were to evaluate the effects of treatment of periparturient dairy cows with recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) on mRNA expression in peripheral leukocytes for genes related to the somatotropic axis, cell energy metabolism, and innate and adaptive immune responses. Cows were enrolled in the experiment at 253 ± 3 d of gestation and assigned to an untreated control group (n = 98) or to receive 125 mg of rbST weekly from −21 to 21 d relative to calving (rbST125; n = 98). Data from a subsample of cows (control = 16, rbST125 = 16) are reported herein. Hemogram and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and expression of adhesion molecules were determined weekly, from −28 ± 3 to 24 ± 3 d relative to calving. Cows were vaccinated with ovalbumin at −21 ± 3, −7 ± 3, and 7 ± 3 d relative to calving. Serum IgG anti-ovalbumin and haptoglobin optical densities were determined weekly, from −28 ± 3 to 24 ± 3 d relative to calving. Leukocytes were isolated from whole blood on d −21 ± 3, −7 ± 3, and 7 ± 3 relative to calving to determine leukocyte mRNA expression for 66 genes. Cows in the rbST125 treatment had greater concentration of granulocytes 1 wk prepartum (control = 3.7 ± 0.4 vs. rbST125 = 4.6 ± 0.4 × 109 cells/L). Expression of CD18 by PMNL during the prepartum (control = 3,262 ± 280 vs. rbST125 = 3,926 ± 260 geometric mean fluorescence intensity) and percentage of PMNL positive for phagocytosis and oxidative burst 1 wk postpartum (control = 59.2 ± 2.8 vs. rbST125 = 67.6 ± 3.1%) were increased in rbST125 cows. Postpartum IgG anti-ovalbumin optical density was higher in rbST125 cows than control cows (control = 1.5 ± 0.1 vs. rbST125 = 1.9 ± 0.1 optical density). On d −7 relative to calving, leukocyte mRNA expression of IGF1R and JAK1 tended to be downregulated and expression of DEFB3 tended to be upregulated by rbST treatment. Expression of mRNA for STAT1, RELA, and NOD2 tended to be upregulated, expression of RAC2 was downregulated, and expression of JAK3, BLK, and TNFα tended to be downregulated on d 7 relative to calving by rbST treatment. Effects of treatment of periparturient cows with 125 mg of rbST on leukocyte gene expression were minute; thus, additional experiments are necessary to elucidate how rbST-induced increases in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 concentrations may modulate the immune response of periparturient cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aadaptive immunity 3ablood serum 3acalving 3adairy cows 3aenergy metabolism 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agenes 3ageometry 3agranulocytes 3ahaptoglobins 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3amessenger RNA 3aovalbumin 3aphagocytosis 3apregnancy 3asomatotropin 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0adairy cow 0aleukocyte gene expression 0asomatotropin1 aNelson, C.D.1 aDriver, J.P.1 aThatcher, W.W.1 aChebel, R.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Oct., v. 100, no. 10 p.8471-8483dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-121063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013900174300001400313520122000327592002801547650002701575650001101602650001601613650002401629650001501653650001801668650002501686650001901711653002301730653001001753653001001763653004201773653002401815653002201839700002201861700001801883700001901901700002201920773010201942856008502044852000902129655001202138IND60546103520221120165514.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054610352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawamura, Hideyuki10aNumerical simulation on the long-term variation of radioactive cesium concentration in the North Pacific due to the Fukushima disaster  ap. 64-75.  aNumerical simulations on oceanic 134Cs and 137Cs dispersions were intensively conducted in order to assess an effect of the radioactive cesium on the North Pacific environment with a focus on the long-term variation of the radioactive cesium concentration after the Fukushima disaster that occurred in March 2011. The amounts of 134Cs and 137Cs released into the ocean were estimated using oceanic monitoring data, whereas the atmospheric deposition was calculated through atmospheric dispersion simulations. The highly accurate ocean current reanalyzed through a three-dimensional variational data assimilation enabled us to clarify the time series of the 134Cs and 137Cs concentrations in the North Pacific. It was suggested that the main radioactive cesium cloud due to the direct oceanic release reached the central part of the North Pacific, crossing 170°W one year after the Fukushima disaster. The radioactive cesium was efficiently diluted by meso-scale eddies in the Kuroshio Extension region and its concentration in the surface, intermediate, and deep layers had already been reduced to the pre-Fukushima background value in the wide area within the North Pacific 2.5 years after the Fukushima disaster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3acesium 3adispersions 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3aradionuclides 3atime series analysis 3awater currents 0aOceanic dispersion 0a134Cs 0a137Cs 0aFukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant 0aLong-term variation 0aData assimilation1 aKobayashi, Takuya1 aFuruno, Akiko1 aUsui, Norihisa1 aKamachi, Masafumi0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2014 Oct., v. 136 p.64-75dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010900176300001600285520159900301592002801900650001201928650001101940650001901951650001501970650001301985650001401998700002402012773013802036856008702174852000902261655001202270IND60760519020221116172307.0211223e20211006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076051902DNAL7 a10.3390/agriengineering30400472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHati, Anirban Jyoti10aSmart Indoor Farms: Leveraging Technological Advancements to Power a Sustainable Agricultural Revolution  ap. 728-767.  aConventional farming necessitates a large number of resources and infrastructure such as land, irrigation, manpower to manage farms, etc. Modern initiatives are required to automate conventional farms. Smart indoor farms offer the potential to remedy the shortfalls of conventional farms by providing a controlled, intelligent, and smart environment. This paper presents a three-dimensional perspective consisting of soilless farming, energy harvesting, and smart technologies, which could be considered as the three important characteristics of smart indoor farms. A six-layer smart indoor farms architecture has also been proposed, which explains how data are collected using various sensors and devices and then transmitted onto the cloud infrastructure for further analysis and control through various layers. Artificial lighting, smart nutrition management, and artificial climate control, to name a few, are some of the important requirements for smart indoor farms while considering control and service management factors. The major bottleneck in installing such systems is both the economical and the technical constraints. However, with the evolution of technology (and when they become widely available in the near future), a more favourable farming scenario may emerge. Furthermore, smart indoor farms could be viewed as a potential answer for meeting the demands of a sustainable agricultural revolution as we move closer to Agriculture 4.0. Finally, in order to adapt smart indoor farms and their study scope, our work has presented various research areas to potential researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation 3alighting 3anutrition1 aSingh, Rajiv Ranjan0 tAgriEngineering.g2021 Oct. 06, v. 3, no. 4 p.728-767dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27129x2624-74027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering30400473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011300167300001600280520109100296536031101387592002801698596011901726596009701845596008701942650002302029650002002052650002102072650001002093650001402103650004302117650001402160653002202174653001602196653001302212700001202225700001502237700001602252700001902268700001702287700001702304773011902321856008502440852000902525655001202534IND60687993620221116172040.0200406e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068799362DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2018.15337252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zhibin10aMelatonin concentrations in Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinesis) are affected by artificial photoperiods  ap. 362-372.  aMelatonin is a ubiquitous and conservative biogenic amine implicated in a variety of bio-physiological processes. Although the daily variations of melatonin concentrations have been determined in many crustacean species, results have been conflicting. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of different photoperiods on the circadian rhythms of melatonin in Eriocheir sinensis by using high performance liquid chromatography. The circadian rhythms of melatonin in the eyestalk of E. sinensis were influenced by external light stimulation. When under consistent light (24L:0D) and consistent dark (0L:24D), the melatonin rhythm in eyestalks and hemolymph was disturbed with respect to that of the control group (12L:12D). However, disturbance owing to different photoperiod treatments decreased with increasing treatment duration. Our results underscore the exquisite sensitivity of melatonin content to different photoperiods. These findings may have real-world implications in terms of the disruption of circadian rhythms induced by exposure to different photoperiods.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31502190], the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [grant number CARS-48] and the Talent Introduction Program of Shenyang Agricultural University [grant number 880416005 and 880417024].  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-48cEarmarked Fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research Systemdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009997  aCARS-48cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a880416005cShenyang Agricultural Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008527 3aEriocheir sinensis 3abiogenic amines 3acircadian rhythm 3acrabs 3ahemolymph 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amelatonin 0acircadian rhythms 0aphotoperiod 0aeyestalk1 aLi, Xin1 aXu, Weibin1 aShe, Qiuxin1 aLiang, Shudong1 aLi, Xiaodong1 aLi, Yingdong0 tBiological rhythm research.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 51, no. 3 p.362-372dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2018.15337253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245008300211300001600294520128700310592002801597650004401625650002201669650001201691650001501703650001301718650000901731650002101740650001401761650001401775650001301789650001101802650002001813650001301833650001601846653002301862653002301885653001901908653001201927700002401939700001901963700002401982773010702006856008702113852000902200655001202209IND60585920720221119142755.0190410e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058592072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRath, Swagat S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9441-468210aBiomass briquette as an alternative reductant for low grade iron ore resources  ap. 447-454.  aThe present study explores the application of biomass briquette, produced from the unutilized vegetative remnants, as an alternative reductant for the reduction roasting-magnetic separation of an iron ore slime sample assaying 56.2% Fe. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) studies indicated tridymite and quartz to be the only crystalline mineral phases present in the biomass briquettes while the Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectra identified several organic functional groups representing the biomass. Iron ore concentrates with ∼65% Fe and ∼64% weight recovery were obtained with reduction conditions such as temperature: 650–750 °C, reductant to feed ratio: 0.15, reduction time: 30–45 min and reductant size: −3+1 mm. The analysis of the statistically designed experiments suggested that temperature is the most crucial factor followed by time, reductant to feed ratio and reductant size. Magnetite and hematite were found to be the only major phases present in the magnetic fractions produced from roasting at the optimum conditions. Many feebly magnetic phases like wustite, fayalite and clinoferrosilite appeared at higher temperature and reductant to feed ratios, which was confirmed by XRD, reflected light microscopy and quantitative mineralogical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomass 3abriquettes 3ahematite 3airon 3alight microscopy 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amoieties 3aquartz 3areducing agents 3aroasting 3atemperature 0aBiomass briquettes 0aReduction roasting 0aIron ore slime 0aTaguchi1 aRao, Danda Srinivas1 aTripathy, Alok1 aBiswal, Surendra K.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Jan., v. 108 p.447-454dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006600166300001800232500001900250520058300269592002800852650002600880650002100906650001000927650001200937650002100949650001500970700001800985700005101003773012101054856008301175852000901258655001201267IND60716645520221119173809.0201106e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071664552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c032412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xianhong10aChemoselective Perfluoromethylation of Thio- and Selenoamides  ap. 8638-8642.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA chemo- and regioselective perfluoromethylation using thioamides/selenoamides (prepared one step from corresponding lactams) as starting materials has been discovered.

An ecotoxic effect of a model PAH compound (phenanthrene) toward soils microorganisms (nitrifying bacteria) was evaluated in 50 different soils. The soil samples were collected from agricultural land in four regions of Poland with varying levels of industrialization (Slaskie, Dolnoslaskie, Podlaskie, and Lubelskie voievodeships). Soils were characterized for basic physicochemical properties (texture, organic matter content, pHKCₗ, total nitrogen content, total sorption capacity) and the content of contaminants including PAHs (73–800 μg kg⁻¹), Pb (6–720 mg kg⁻¹), and Zn (9–667 mg kg⁻¹). Ecotoxicity of phenanthrene (applied at 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mg kg⁻¹) to soils microorganisms was evaluated in laboratory studies in control conditions (incubation of soils for 7 d at 20 ± 2°C). Nitrification potential was used as the ecotoxicity measurements end point. The EC₅₀ values (146−1670 mg kg⁻¹) calculated from the square root–X linear regression model differed significantly in various soils, although it was difficult to establish a causative relationship between soil physicochemical characteristic and phenanthrene toxicity. A significant factor in the assessment of soils vulnerability to the effect of phenanthrene was level of soil contamination, particularly with PAHs. Soils with previous contamination were more susceptible (mean EC₅₀, 325 mg kg⁻¹) than soils from uncontaminated, rural areas (mean EC₅₀, 603 mg kg⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pollution 3aecotoxicology 3aphenanthrenes 3aagricultural land 3anitrification 3aregression analysis 3asoil physical properties 2aChemistry, Physical 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogen Fixationxdrug effects 2aPhenanthrenesxpharmacology 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aSoil Microbiology 3aPoland 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene1 aKlimkowicz-Pawlas, Agnieszka1 aSmreczak, Bozena1 aJanusauskaite, Dalia0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2007 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.1635-1645dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.01183Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02458naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015200168300001300320520093400333592002801267650001601295650001601311650002101327650001601348650004101364650004301405650001101448650004401459650001401503650001101517650002001528650001601548650001801564650001301582653002301595653002101618653002801639653002801667653001801695700002001713700005501733773010401788856008701892852000901979655001201988IND60585920820221119142954.0190410e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058592082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Gaojin10aAlkaline oxidative cracking for effective depolymerization of biorefining lignin to mono-aromatic compounds and organic acids with molecular oxygen  ap. 7-14.  aAlkaline oxidative cracking with molecular oxygen was demonstrated as an effective method to depolymerize lignin under moderate conditions. Ammonia-extracted lignin from corn stover was depolymerized to aromatics and organic acids by the alkaline oxidation. The identified products by GC-MS, NMR, and HPLC included mono-aromatic compounds (such as vanillin, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, acetovanillone etc.) and organic acids (such as oxalic, acetic, formic acids, etc.). The overall mass yield of quantified aromatics and organic acids varied from 24% to 58% under the investigated conditions. It was found that the yields and compositions of the products were determined by the reaction conditions (temperature, reaction time, and oxygen pressure). More vanillin and organic acids were produced with oxygen under high temperature and long time, while p-coumaric acid was the primary product under oxygen deficient condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiorefining 3acorn stover 3adepolymerization 3aformic acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3ap-coumaric acid 3atemperature 3avanillic acid 3avanillin 0aAlkaline oxidation 0aMolecular oxygen 0aLignin depolymerization 0aMono-aromatic compounds 0aOrganic acids1 aYoo, Chang Geun1 aPan, Xuejun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6859-93420 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Jan., v. 108 p.7-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015800168520152600326592002801852650001201880650002101892650001401913650002301927650002101950650002201971650001901993650000702012650002802019650001302047650001702060650002502077653001502102653002902117653001702146653002002163653003302183700001602216700002002232700001402252700001602266773010402282856005102386852000902437655001202446IND60794853020221119071254.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079485302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1144142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, Yanqing14aThe calcium alginate-immobilized Co-g-C3N4 composite microspheres as an efficient mediator to activate peroxymonosulfate for degrading organic pollutants  aPoor water stability and difficult separation severely limited the application of Co-based catalysts in persulfate activation. Herein, for the first time, the calcium alginate-immobilized Co-g–C₃N₄–2 composite microspheres were prepared by a feasible method. Notably, embedding Co ion into g-C₃N₄ can improve its specific surface area and electrochemical activities. More significantly, as-prepared Co-g–C₃N₄–2 microsphere presented excellent catalytic performance in PMS activation for the degradation of TC. For the activation mechanisms of PMS over Co-g–C₃N₄–2 microspheres, the calcium alginate microspheres could mediate the direct electron transfer between TC and PMS, while both radical and nonradical pathways were involved in the activation of PMS over Co-g–C₃N₄–2. Meanwhile, SO₄•⁻, OH•, O₂•⁻ and ¹O₂ were major reactive oxygen species formed in the Co-g–C₃N₄–2 microsphere/PMS system. Proposed Co-g–C₃N₄–2 microsphere/PMS system still exhibited great degradation ability towards TC over a wide pH range, and co-existing anions had weak influence on TC degradation over Co-g–C₃N₄–2 microsphere/PMS system. Moreover, the construction of Co-g–C₃N₄–2 microspheres not only avoided the release of metal ion from catalyst, but also provided convenience for the recovery of catalyst. In short, current work shared some novel insights into the application of heterogeneous catalysis in persulfate activation for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium alginate 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3amicroparticles 3apH 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 3asurface area 3awastewater treatment 0aPersulfate 0aHeterogeneous activation 0aTetracycline 0aCo-doped g-C3N4 0aCalcium alginate microsphere1 aChen, Xiang1 aTseng, Chiu-yu,1 aZhang, Yi1 aLv, Shi-Wen0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Dec., v. 215 p.114414-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114414  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013900163300001400302520140100316592002801717650002501745650002101770650001801791650001401809650001901823650001701842650001401859650002301873650002501896650002001921650001001941650001601951650002501967650002201992650001102014650001202025650002702037650004302064650000902107650005202116650002402168650001302192650003602205650003202241650001202273653002702285653002902312653002502341653001402366700001602380700001902396700001802415773013002433856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60593773620221119135209.0190516e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059377362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2018.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Ri10aNeuroprotective effect of docosahexaenoic acid in rat traumatic brain injury model via regulation of TLR4/NF-Kappa B signaling pathway  ap. 64-71.  aThe experiments were conducted to prove that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) alleviates traumatic brain injury (TBI) through regulating TLR4/NF-Kappa B signaling pathway.Bioinformatic analysis was performed using published data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to investigate differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury rat model was built, and DHA (16 mg/kg in DMSO, once each day) was used to treat TBI rats. Neurological severity score (NSS) and beam walking test and rotarod test were used to confirm whether DHA is neuron-protective against TBI. The expression of TLR4, NF-Kappa B p65, (TNF)-α and IL-1β were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The impact of DHA on neurocyte apoptosis was validated by TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. The influence of DHA on CD11b and GFAP expression in the hippocampus was determined through immunohistochemical analysis.TLR4/NF Kappa B pathway was suggested to be closely correlated with TBI by bioinformatic analysis. DHA could improve the neurological function and learning and memory ability of rats after TBI as well as promote neurocytes from apoptosis. TLR4 expression and the expression of inflammatory mediator NF-Kappa B were also repressed by DHA treatment.DHA exerted a neuron-protective influence in a rat model of TBI via repressing TLR4/NF-Kappa B pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3abrain damage 3adatabases 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahippocampus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amemory 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awalking 0aTraumatic brain injury 0aTLR-4/NK-Kappa B pathway 0aDocosahexaenoic acid 0aRat model1 aLin, Yi-Mei1 aLiu, Hong-Xing1 aWang, Er-Song0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2018 June, v. 99 p.64-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2018.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006300168300001800231500001900249520067000268592002800938650001600966650001200982650001900994650002801013650001401041650002101055650002601076650001201102650001101114700001901125700005601144700005701200773012101257856008301378852000901461655001201470IND60716645720221119173958.0201106e20201023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071664572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c032502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkumura, Akira10aSilver-Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Fixation on Alkynylindenes  ap. 8648-8651.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe synthesis of polycyclic indene derivatives via silver-catalyzed carbon dioxide fixation on 2-alkynylindene derivatives was achieved by nucleophilic addition of the indenyl anion to carbon dioxide involving carbon–carbon bond formation and subsequent intramolecular cyclization to the alkyne part activated by a silver catalyst. This cascade process could be applied to various substrates to obtain the corresponding products in high yields. The endo/exo selectivity of the cyclization could be controlled by the steric or electronic effect of the substituents on the substrates, and 6-endo-selective cyclization was realized to afford α-pyrone-fused indenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aalkynes 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acyclization reactions 3aindenes 3asilver1 aChuang, Po-Yao1 aSaito, Kodai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5867-27131 aYamada, Tohru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4177-50190 tOrganic letters.g2020 Oct. 23, v. 22, no. 21 p.8648-8651dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c032503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01269naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009500160300001400255520018800269592002800457650002100485650001900506650001900525650001500544700001700559700001900576700001900595700001800614700002100632700001900653700001600672700002000688773011600708856007400824852000900898655001200907IND60663986020221116145024.0190910e20110809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066398602DNAL7 a10.1039/c1ra00213a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Joong Tark10aTransparent carbon nanotube patterns templated by inkjet-printed graphene oxide nanosheets  ap. 44-47.  aPartially reduced graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets served as interfacial adhesive layers for the fabrication of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) patterns on hydrophilic substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3ananosheets1 aKim, Jun Suk1 aKwak, Donghoon1 aKim, Bo Gyeong1 aJeong, Bo Hwa1 aJeong, Seung Yol1 aJeong, Hee Jin1 aCho, Kilwon1 aLee, Geon-Woong0 tRSC advances.g2011 Aug. 9, v. 1, no. 1 p.44-47dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1ra00213a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006900152245016200221300001600383520155800399592002801957650001001985650000801995650001602003650001202019650001202031650001902043650001402062650001502076650001302091650001302104650001202117650001502129650001702144650001402161650001502175650001402190650001802204650001702222650001402239650001402253650001502267650000902282650001702291650001602308650003402324650002502358650000902383651001102392651001302403700002002416700005902436700002902495700002102524773010702545856008702652852000902739655001202748IND60585921020221119142643.0190410e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058592102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoot-Handford, Matthew E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0223-955510aSimple pyrolysis experiments for the preliminary assessment of biomass feedstocks and low-cost tar cracking catalysts for downdraft gasification applications  ap. 398-414.  aThe pyrolysis behaviour of beech wood, two rice husk variants from Brazil (BRH) and Thailand (TRH) and a solid waste water treatment residue from textile manufacture (TIR) were investigated using a lab-scale, 2-stage fixed-bed reactor at 773 K. Char yields increased and volatile yields decreased with increasing ash content. The TRH released 40% less tar than the BRH which was attributed to the substantially higher potassium content of the Thai species. The combustion reactivity of the TRH char in air at 773 K was similar to the BW char and almost double the reactivity of the BRH and TIR chars. The BW and TRH chars had a greater volume of macropores indicating that char combustion occurs predominantly through the growth and extension of the macroporous pore network. A different trend was observed for the char gasification reactivity with CO2 at 1173 K. The Ca and Mg content of the chars were found to have a more important catalytic role in the char gasification reactions with CO2.The effect of exposing volatile products from beech wood pyrolysis to elevated temperatures (973–1173 K) and sand beds containing calcined limestone or dolomite in a simulated downdraft gasification environment was also investigated. Tar yields decreased after exposure to elevated temperature and calcined limestone or dolomite. Tar cracking favoured the production of CO. CO yields were between 22 and 23 wt% at 1173 K. Calcined dolomite was slightly more effective at cracking tar than calcined limestone, eliminating 98 wt% of the tar at 1173 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aair 3aash content 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3acracking 3adolomite 3afabrics 3afeedstocks 3agasification 3alimestone 3amacropores 3amagnesium 3amanufacturing 3aporous media 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3arice hulls 3asand 3asolid wastes 3atemperature 3athyrotropin-releasing hormone 3awastewater treatment 3awood 3aBrazil 3aThailand1 aVirmond, Elaine1 aFlorin, Nick H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8436-47111 aKandiyoti, R.q(Rafael),1 aFennell, Paul S.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Jan., v. 108 p.398-414dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245013900210520190700349592002802256650002002284650001302304650001902317650001202336650001902348650001102367650003402378650002702412650001402439650001802453650001302471651001802484653003002502653003102532653001102563653002402574653002502598700002602623700006202649700002702711700002402738700002702762700002502789773011902814856008502933852000903018655001203027IND60794853220221119071450.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079485322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1144182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano, Megan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4932-249210aGestational per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure and infant body mass index trajectory in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study  aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmentally persistent, potential metabolic disruptors of concern for infants. Mothers participating in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS) provided a plasma sample during pregnancy to measure concentrations of seven PFAS, and infant weight and length were abstracted from well-child visits between birth and 12 months. Sex-specific growth patterns of child body mass index (BMI) were fit using a growth mixture model (GMM) and the relative risk ratios (RRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) for the association of maternal plasma PFAS with BMI growth patterns during infancy were estimated by using multinomial logistic model for the group probabilities in the GMM. Four growth patterns were identified: Group 1) a steep increase in BMI during the first 6 months, then a leveling off; Group 2) a gradual increase in BMI across the year; Group 3) a steep increase in BMI during months 1–3, then stable BMI; and Group 4) a gradual increase in BMI with plateau around 3 months (reference group). For boys, higher maternal pregnancy perfluorooctanoate concentrations were associated with a 60% decreased chance of being in group 3 as compared to group 4, after adjusting for potential confounding variables (RRR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.9). For girls, higher maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentrations during pregnancy were associated with a higher likelihood of following the growth pattern of groups 2 (RRR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.0, 6.1) and 3 (RRR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 7.6) as compared to group 4, adjusting for potential confounding variables. In this cohort, sex-specific associations of maternal plasma PFAS concentrations during pregnancy with growth patterns during the first year of life were observed, with greater BMI growth observed among infant girls born to mothers with higher pregnancy concentrations of PFOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3achildren 3acohort studies 3ainfancy 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apregnancy 3arelative risk 3aresearch 3aNew Hampshire 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aPolyfluoroalkyl substances 0aInfant 0aGrowth trajectories 0aLongitudinal Studies1 aHeggeseth, Brianna C.1 aGallagher, Lisa G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9108-46491 aBotelho, Julianne Cook1 aCalafat, Antonia M.1 aGilbert-Diamond, Diane1 aKaragas, Margaret R.0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Dec., v. 215 p.114418-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1144183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012400170300001600294520142100310536011101731592002801842596005501870650001301925650001001938650003101948650002101979650002202000653002502022653002302047653001202070653002502082653002302107700002102130700001602151773011902167856008502286852000902371655001202380IND60687994020221116172314.0200406e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068799402DNAL7 a10.1080/09291016.2018.15337422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanabe, Kosuke10aEffects of prophylactic naps on physical fitness/exercise ability and executive function in healthy young trained males  ap. 421-440.  aThis study examined the effects of prophylactic naps on physical fitness/exercise ability and executive function. Seven healthy trained males (mean age, 21.1 ± 0.4 years) participated in four experimental conditions (counterbalanced design): 90-min sitting rest (con condition); 30-min nap (nap30 condition); 60-min nap (nap60 condition); and 90-min nap (nap90 condition). Physical fitness/exercise abilities were assessed by grip/back strength, postural control, darts task, and the Wingate test. Executive function was assessed using simple reaction time (SRT), choice reaction time (CRT), and modified flanker tasks. Changes in oxyhemoglobin levels in the prefrontal cortex during the executive function tasks were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. None of the nap conditions (30, 60, 90-min) showed improvement in physical fitness/exercise abilities compared with the con condition. The nap30 condition showed shorter reaction times (RTs) in the SRT and CRT tasks than the con condition. The nap60 condition showed improved RTs in only the SRT task. The nap90 condition showed improved RTs in all executive function tasks. Increased oxyhemoglobin levels in the nap30 and 90 conditions were matched with improvement of each executive function tasks, but not in the nap60 condition. In conclusion, 90-min nap augmented the improvement of executive function tasks and activating the prefrontal cortex.  aThis work was supported by the academic grant from the graduate school of Nippon Sport Science University.  aPublisher supplied data  cgraduate school of Nippon Sport Science University 3aexercise 3amales 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aphysical fitness 3aprefrontal cortex 0aCircasemidian rhythm 0adiurnal sleepiness 0anapping 0aphysical performance 0acognitive function1 aNakazato, Koichi1 aNoi, Shingo0 tBiological rhythm research.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 51, no. 3 p.421-440dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2018.15337423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245010900175300001400284520104900298592002801347650002101375650003601396650002001432650002401452650004601476650001801522650001501540650001501555650001201570650001401582650002801596650001601624650002601640650001101666650002301677650002501700653002401725653001001749653002101759653002201780653002201802700002101824700002201845700002601867700002401893700002401917700002901941700002301970700006401993700006102057773009802118856008702216852000902303655001202312IND60526056620221122034553.0190402e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052605662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Bruno G.10aChemical profile of mango (Mangifera indica L.) using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)  ap. 37-45.  aMangifera indica L., mango fruit, is consumed as a dietary supplement with purported health benefits; it is widely used in the food industry. Herein, the chemical profile of the Ubá mango at four distinct maturation stages was evaluated during the process of growth and maturity using negative-ion mode electrospray ionisation Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI(−)FT-ICR MS) and physicochemical characterisation analysis (total titratable acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSS), TSS/TA ratio, and total polyphenolic content). Primary (organic acids and sugars) and secondary metabolites (polyphenolic compounds) were mostly identified in the third maturation stage, thus indicating the best stage for harvesting and consuming the fruit. In addition, the potential cancer chemoprevention of the secondary metabolites (phenolic extracts obtained from mango samples) was evaluated using the induction of quinone reductase activity, concluding that fruit polyphenols have the potential for cancer chemoprevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aNAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 3achemoprevention 3adietary supplements 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afood industry 3aharvesting 3aionization 3amangoes 3aneoplasms 3aorganic acids and salts 3apolyphenols 3asecondary metabolites 3asugars 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 0aMangifera indica L. 0aMango 0aChemical profile 0aMass spectrometry 0aESI(−)FT-ICR MS1 aCosta, Helber B.1 aVentura, José A.1 aKondratyuk, Tamara P.1 aBarroso, Maria E.S.1 aCorreia, Radigya M.1 aPimentel, Elisângela F.1 aPinto, Fernanda E.1 aEndringer, Denise C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9396-20971 aRomão, Wanderson1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2254-66830 tFood chemistry.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 204 p.37-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012700178300001600305520187100321592002802192650001402220650002302234650002602257650002402283650002002307650002202327650002002349650002802369650001602397650002102413650001502434651001102449653002102460653001502481653001602496653002102512653001602533700003102549700003002580700003802610773010402648856008602752852000902838655001202847IND60633498620221120072627.0200106e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063349862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Lucas Borges10aEstimation of reference evapotranspiration in Brazil with limited meteorological data using ANN and SVM – A new approach  ap. 556-570.  aReference evapotranspiration (ETₒ) is a variable of great importance for several purposes, such as hydrological studies and irrigation scheduling. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation is recommended to estimate ETₒ given its good accuracy. However, the estimation of ETₒ poses a challenge when the availability of meteorological data is limited since the FAO-56 PM equation requires data on temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed. This study evaluates, for the first time, the performance of alternative equations, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), for the estimation of daily ETₒ across the entirety of Brazil using measured data on temperature and relative humidity or only temperature. Two strategies, not yet used in Brazil, were used to develop the ANN and SVM models: (i) the definition of groups of weather stations with similar climatic characteristics, using the K-means clustering algorithm, to develop models specific for each group; and (ii) the addition of previous meteorological data as input for the models. Data from 203 weather stations distributed across Brazil were used. The ANN and SVM models showed higher performances than the equations that were studied, even when they were calibrated. The evaluated strategies (clustering and previous days) provided considerable performance gains. For the temperature-based models, the best performance was obtained by the ANN developed with the strategy of clustering and the use of data from two previous days as input; however, due to the similar performance and greater generalization capacity, the ANN developed without clustering and with the use of data from four previous days is recommended. For the temperature- and relative humidity-based models, the ANN developed with data from four previous days was the best option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation scheduling 3ameteorological data 3aneural networks 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature 3aweather stations 3awind speed 3aBrazil 0aCluster analysis 0aIrrigation 0aLagged data 0aMachine learning 0aTime series1 ada Cunha, Fernando França1 ade Oliveira, Rubens Alves1 aFernandes Filho, Elpídio Inácio0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 May, v. 572 p.556-570dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04050naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168300001400298520184200312592002802154650002102182650001602203650001602219650001202235650002802247650002502275650001802300650001602318650002202334650001202356650002302368650000902391650001402400650001802414650002002432650003302452650002002485650001702505650001602522653000802538653000802546653001002554653000902564653000902573653000802582653000802590653001002598653000902608653000902617653000802626653000702634653000802641653000902649653000802658653000902666653001102675653000902686653000902695653001002704653002002714653002802734653003302762653002202795653001902817653002002836700001702856700001602873700002002889700001902909700001802928700001902946700001902965773013002984856008503114852000903199655001203208IND60593773820221119135115.0190516e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059377382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2018.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jung-Hak10aPeroxiredoxin 2 mediates insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscles through regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase oxidation  ap. 80-90.  aInsulin signaling is essential for regulating glucose homeostasis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect insulin signaling, and low ROS levels can act as a signal to regulate cellular function. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are highly abundant and widely expressed antioxidant enzymes. However, it is unclear whether antioxidant enzymes, such as Prx2, mediate insulin signaling. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of Prx2 deficiency on insulin signaling. Our western blot results showed that Prx2 deficiency enhanced insulin signaling and increased oxidation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with insulin. In addition, we assessed ROS levels with a Cytosol-HyPer H2O2 sensor. As a result, increased ROS levels and Akt activation were decreased by N-acetyl-cysteine (Nac), which acted as an antioxidant in Prx2-deficient MEFs. Body weight measurements and glucose tolerance test (GTT) revealed significant body weight reduction and increase in glucose clearance in Prx2-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) was significantly higher in Prx2-/- mice than in wild-type mice according to western blotting results. Western blotting also revealed that Akt phosphorylation was higher in Prx2-/- MEFs and muscle tissue than in wild-type. Together, our findings indicate that increased ROS due to Prx2 deficiency promotes insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance in skeletal muscles by increasing protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) oxidation. These results provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of insulin signaling induced by Prx2 deficiency and suggest that ROS-based therapeutic strategies can be used to suppress insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abody weight 3afibroblasts 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance tests 3aglucose transporters 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amice 3aoxidation 3aperoxiredoxin 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 3aweight loss 0aROS 0aPrx 0aPTP1B 0aPTEN 0aMEFs 0aNac 0aGTT 0aGLUT4 0aPTPs 0aT2DM 0aGPx 0aIR 0aIRS 0aPI3K 0aAkt 0aPDK4 0a2-NBDG 0aIRβ 0aMAPK 0aNOX-2 0aPeroxiredoxin 2 0aReactive oxygen species 0aProtein tyrosine phosphatase 0aInsulin signaling 0aGlucose uptake 0aSkeletal muscle1 aPark, Sun-Ji1 aChae, Unbin1 aSeong, Joongbae1 aLee, Hyun-Shik1 aLee, Sang-Rae1 aLee, Seunghoon1 aLee, Dong-Seok0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2018 June, v. 99 p.80-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2018.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011200174300001400286520125200300592002801552650001401580650001101594650002301605650002301628650000901651650001001660650001501670650002101685650001501706650002501721650002301746650001801769653002101787653004201808653001901850700002501869773009801894856008701992852000902079655001202088IND60526056720221122034508.0190402e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052605672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrink, Lillian A.14aThe utilisation of two detectors for the determination of water in honey using headspace gas chromatography  ap. 23-27.  aA headspace gas chromatography (HSGC) method was developed for the determination of water content in honey. This method was shown to work with five different honey varieties which had a range of water from 14–16%. It also utilised two different detectors, the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the barrier discharge ionisation detector (BID). This method needs no heating pretreatment step as in the current leading method, (i.e. the measurement of refractive index). The solvent-free procedure negates the possibility of solvent–compound interactions as well as solubility limitations, as is common with Karl Fischer titrations. It was also apparent that the classic loss on drying method consistently and substantially produced results that were lower than the correct values. This approach is shown to be rapid, with an analysis time of 4min when using the TCD detector and under 3min when utilising the BID detector. HSGC is feasible for the determination of water due to the new PEG-linked geminal dicationic ionic-liquid-coated GC capillary column. In addition it provides accurate and precise determinations of the water content in honey. When using the sensitive BID detector, other trace volatile compounds are observed as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetectors 3adrying 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aheat 3ahoney 3aionization 3arefractive index 3asolubility 3athermal conductivity 3avolatile compounds 3awater content 0aRefractive index 0aBarrier discharge ionisation detector 0aWater analysis1 aArmstrong, Daniel W.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 205 p.23-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.02.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245012300182300001600305520159900321592002801920650004401948650001201992650001602004650002202020650001502042650001302057650002202070650002002092650001802112650001602130650002402146650002302170650002102193650001002214653002002224653002202244653001302266653000802279653001402287700002802301700003102329700002502360700001802385700006002403773010702463856008702570852000902657655001202666IND60585921320221119144504.0190410e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058592132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Machín, Lizet10aEffect of citric acid leaching on the demineralization and thermal degradation behavior of sugarcane trash and bagasse  ap. 371-380.  aThe effect of leaching with citric acid on the ash fraction removed and the resulting changes in thermal degradation behavior of sugarcane trash (SCT) and sugarcane bagasse (SCB), was studied. A comparison between citric acid and well-known leaching agents including H2SO4, HCl and water, was made considering their effects on chemical, structural and thermal properties of the leached SCT and SCB. Demineralization and potential biomass hydrolysis was evaluated based on proximate and elemental analyses, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). For citric acid and the reference leaching solutions, the mass fraction of ash removed was in a narrow range (between 38.9 and 54.1%) regardless of biomass type and leaching conditions (temperature and time) tested. The nonparametric bifactorial analysis of results revealed that the nature of leaching solution and its interaction with contact time are of major significance when demineralizing both SCT and SCB. Interestingly, no significance of temperature and its interaction with contact time was found. In acid-treated samples, the 1730 cm−1 IR-band was sharpened while the signal at 1600 cm−1 was largely attenuated, which could be attributed to the modification of the xylan fraction and to the substitution of C=O by OH groups. These mild structural changes, caused by hydrolysis, demonstrated to be very important for subsequent thermal degradation. The later was confirmed by the disappearance of the hemicellulose decomposition peak in the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiomass 3acitric acid 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysis 3aleaching 3asugarcane bagasse 3asugarcane trash 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3axylan 0aSugarcane trash 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aLeaching 0aTGA 0aPyrolysis1 aArteaga-Pérez, Luis E.1 aPérez-Bermúdez, Raúl A.1 aCasas-Ledón, Yannay1 aPrins, Wolter1 aRonsse, Frederik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3290-91770 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Jan., v. 108 p.371-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245012600212300001400338520161100352592002801963650002001991650002102011650002002032650002302052650001102075650001202086650002602098650001902124650001402143650000902157650001202166651001102178653001002189653001602199653001202215653001602227653001002243653001902253700002202272700002202294700001902316773010502335856008702440852000902527655001202536IND60585921420221119143020.0190410e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058592142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelfeldt, Stina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2283-882X10aEffects of cutting traits and competition on performance and size hierarchy development over two cutting cycles in willow  ap. 66-73.  aTo assess if cutting traits (clone, fresh weight) in combination with strong competition from adjacent willows (planted in monoclonal stands and clonal mixtures) affected performance and size hierarchy development in willow during consecutive harvests, a field experiment was performed in central Sweden during 2008–2015. Cuttings from five Salix clones were planted in 1.8 m × 1.8 m plots, at a density of 197 500 cuttings ha−1 in monoculture and in ten mixtures using two clones (i.e. 15 combinations). Maximum height was measured each year and the experiment was harvested after the growing seasons 2012 and 2014. Larger cuttings produced stools with lower death rate, higher maximum height and larger biomass production compared to smaller cuttings. The high competition pressure resulted in 9.2% stool death at harvest 2012 and 39% stool death at harvest 2014. Tora (Salix schwerinii x Salix viminalis) showed the highest performance and Jorr (Salix viminalis) and Gudrun (Salix dasyclados) the lowest. Planting system had less effect on stool death, height development and biomass production. Tora was the only clone producing more biomass when grown in mixtures compared to monoculture. The size hierarchy between individual stools was generally kept during the experimental period in both monocultures and mixtures, even if the height correlations decreased with year. To obtain a more even establishment of willow stands and lower the risk of a size hierarchy developing leading to large stool mortality and gaps in the stand, we recommend the use of larger and more even-sized cuttings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix burjatica 3aSalix schwerinii 3aSalix viminalis 3abiomass production 3aclones 3acutting 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3amortality 3arisk 3awillows 3aSweden 0aClone 0aCompetition 0aMixture 0aMonoculture 0aSalix 0aStool survival1 aLundkvist, Anneli1 aForkman, Johannes1 aVerwijst, Theo0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2018 Jan., v. 108 p.66-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245011100175300001800286500000900304520159500313592002801908650002001936650001501956650001501971650001801986650002002004650002902024650002102053650001802074650002302092650001902115650002302134650002402157650002002181650001202201650002602213650003102239650004702270650004902317650002602366650004902392650001402441650002602455650002102481651001502502700003202517700001702549700001202566773019402578852000902772856007702781655001202858IND4400433120221118082043.0191028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440043312DNAL7 a179402682pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2007.01642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, W. C.10aBioavailability of Permethrin and Cyfluthrin in Surface Waters with Low Levels of Dissolved Organic Matter  ap. 1678-1685.  aepub  aPyrethroids are widely used insecticides in both agricultural and urban environments, and their potential movement to surface streams and toxicity to susceptible aquatic species is an emerging concern. Natural surface waters usually contain low levels of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Limited data have shown that DOM preparations can significantly alter the bioavailability and toxicity effects of pyrethroids. However, the importance of these effects in natural waters has not been investigated. In this study we measured uptake and acute toxicity of permethrin and cyfluthrin by Daphnia species in 15 surface water samples. Low levels of DOM (3–20 mg L⁻¹) inhibited cyfluthrin uptake by Daphnia magna and acute toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia in most samples. For permethrin, the effects of DOM on bioavailability and toxicity were generally not significant. The effects of DOM on bioavailability of cyfluthrin could not be explained from the DOC concentration alone, suggesting that properties of DOM were also important in regulating bioavailability. Regression of K DOC with selected DOM properties revealed significant dependence of K DOC on the carboxylic acid content of DOM. Moreover, concentrations sensed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers were well correlated with the observed changes in bioaccumulation by D. magna and acute toxicity to C. dubia Therefore, selective sampling methods such as SPME may be used for measuring the bioavailable concentrations of pyrethroids in waters with naturally occurring DOM levels and predicting the actual toxicity effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3apermethrin 3acyfluthrin 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3adissolved organic matter 3atoxicity testing 3aDaphnia magna 3aaquatic arthropods 3aacute toxicity 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3aregression analysis 3abioaccumulation 2aAnimals 2aCladoceraxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrilesxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPermethrinxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPesticidesxchemistry 2aPyrethrinsxchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSolutions 2aToxicity Tests, Acute 2aWaterxchemistry 3aCalifornia1 aHunter, William J.q(Bill),1 aSpurlock, F.1 aGan, J.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2007 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.1678-1685dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2007.01643Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02944naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245009200177520178300269592002802052650001302080650001202093650001002105650002702115650001602142650002102158650001702179650002402196650001702220650001402237650001002251700002402261700002002285700001502305700002502320773012302345856008102468852000902549655001202558IND60760519820221116172237.0211223e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076051982DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy111223692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdetunji, Ademola Emmanuel10aOxidative Stress, Ageing and Methods of Seed Invigoration: An Overview and Perspectives  aThe maintenance of seed quality during the long-term conservation of plant genetic resources is crucial for averting the projected food crises that are linked to the changing climate and rising world population. However, ageing-induced loss of seed vigour and viability during storage remains an inevitable process that compromises productivity in several orthodox-seeded crop species. Seed ageing under prolonged storage, which can occur even under optimal conditions, induces several modifications capable of causing loss of intrinsic physiological quality traits, including germination capacity and vigour, and stand establishment. The problems posed by seed ageing have motivated the development of various techniques for mitigating their detrimental effects. These invigoration techniques generally fall within one of two categories: (1) priming or pre-hydrating seeds in a solution for improved post-harvest performance, or (2) post-storage reinvigoration which often involves soaking seeds recovered from storage in a solution. Seed priming methods are generally divided into classical (hydropriming, osmopriming, redox priming, biostimulant priming, etc.) and advanced (nanopriming, magnetopriming and priming using other physical agents) techniques. With the increasing popularity of seed invigoration techniques to achieve the much-desired enhanced productivity and resilience in the face of a changing climate, there is an urgent need to explore these techniques effectively (in addition to other important practices such as plant breeding, fertilizer application, and the control of pests and diseases). This review aims to provide an overview of ageing in orthodox seeds and invigoration techniques that can enhance desirable agronomic and physiological characters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aclimate 3acrops 3afertilizer application 3agermination 3aoxidative stress 3aseed quality 3astand establishment 3astorage time 3aviability 3avigor1 aAdetunji, Tomi Lois1 aVarghese, Boby 1 aSershen,  1 aPammenter, Norman W.0 tAgronomy.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy111223693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245004700165300001400212520106100226592002801287650002001315650003301335650001201368650002301380650001101403650002201414650001301436650001701449650001901466700002101485700001201506700001701518773010701535856008601642852000901728655001201737IND60526648420221120144315.0190409e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052664842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, Z.10aAmorphous lactose crystallisation kinetics  ap. 22-28.  aAmorphous lactose crystallisation kinetics were investigated at different relative humidity and temperature combinations. Amorphous lactose was equilibrated to a water activity of 33%, then placed in sealed pans with a saturated magnesium chloride solution to maintain a constant relative humidity (33%). The temperature was raised to 10–40 °C above the glass transition temperature (Tg). The degree of crystallisation was measured using isothermal microcalorimetry. Crystallisation was shown to be an all-or-nothing event, such that direct measurement of the kinetics was not possible. This was not expected from the Avrami model. The rapid crystallisation could be an autocatalytic effect, as moisture is released during crystallisation, or a showering event as seen in highly supersaturated lactose solutions. Experiments using a blend of crystalline and amorphous lactose, produced by spray drying a lactose crystal slurry, showed crystallisation occurring at lower Tg conditions than was required for the crystallisation of 100% amorphous lactose.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aglass transition temperature 3alactose 3amagnesium chloride 3amodels 3arelative humidity 3aslurries 3aspray drying 3awater activity1 aPaterson, A.H.J.1 aJoe, R.1 aMcleod, J.S.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2016 May, v. 56 p.22-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2015.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012900163300001600292500001400308520140700322592002801729650001301757650001301770650001301783650002501796650001101821650001301832650001301845650001101858650001601869650001301885650001001898650001501908653002701923653002801950653002201978653001802000653001902018653001902037700001402056700001302070700001302083700001202096700001402108700001402122700001502136700001702151773009902168856008502267852000902352655001202361IND60715966020221116184531.0210114e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071596602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.10.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.10aStudy on the packing characteristics of a special “J” shape ceramic packed pebble bed based on discrete element modeling  ap. 362-372.  aNAL-light  aThe packing structures of a special “J” – cylinder-tours shape ceramic packed pebble beds, which might be used in the breeding zone of future fusion blanket and the other applications were numerically studied by the Discrete Element Method. The contact force and force chain distribution and the effect of the pebble diameter on the global packing factor have been investigated. Meanwhile, the analyses of radial and axial local packing factor distribution features and coordination number distribution were performed. The results showed that the global packing factor increased with decreasing pebble diameter and the cylindrical part of the packed pebble bed had a slightly higher global packing factor than the torus part. The contact force kept decreasing after a short period of rising and the force chain distribution showed a clear difference between two parts of the packed pebble bed. Both the radial and axial local packing factor exhibited oscillation behavior but a clear difference observed in two parts. The coordination number distribution was also analyzed to investigate the contact status in the packed pebble bed. The presented results of these investigations added to the understandings of the packing structure of irregular shape packed pebble beds, hence, could provide references for fusion facility design and other areas of industry such as chemical engineering research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3abreeding 3aceramics 3achemical engineering 3adesign 3adiameter 3aindustry 3amodels 3aoscillation 3aresearch 3ashape 3atechnology 0aPacking characteristic 0aDiscrete element method 0aPacked pebble bed 0aSpecial shape 0aPacking factor 0aCeramic pebble1 aLei, M.Z.1 aYang, H.1 aXu, S.L.1 aXu, Kun1 aYin, Zhou1 aLi, Cheng1 aZhao, P.H.1 aSong, Yuntao0 tPowder technology.g2021 Feb., v. 379 p.362-372dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.10.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024003600147040001800183100001900201245008800220300001600308520142100324592002801745650001001773650001801783650002601801650002801827650001101855650001701866650001301883650004601896650001201942650001501954650003901969650001302008650000902021650001602030650002302046650002202069653001102091653001102102653001302113653000902126653000902135700001802144700001702162773011602179852000902295856008302304655001202387IND2208477320221123010256.0181204e20000401enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220847732DNAL7 a108174562pmid7 a10.1258/0023677007804574822doi4 a0023-6772(20000401)34:2L.171;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBushong, D.

In Experiment 1, barrows (castrated pigs) were assigned to one of three injection treatments: (1) saline i.m. (SHAM1 n = 2); (2) 0.75 IU/kg BW ACTH in saline i.v. (ACUTE, n = 2); (3) 2.25 IU/kg BW ACTH in gel i.m. (DEPOT, n = 3). Total cortisol concentrations were determined for concurrent saliva and blood samples. Correlations between salivary and plasma cortisol within treatments were: SHAM1, r = 0.60; ACUTE, r = 0.58; DEPOT, r = 0.79. In Experiment 2, barrows were assigned to one of two injection treatments: (1) gel i.m. (SHAM2, n = 3); (2) 2.25 IU/kg BW ACTH in gel i.m. (CHRONIC, n = 4). The injections occurred every 6 h for a total of eight injections. Concurrent saliva and blood samples were obtained every 3 h for 72 h followed by an increasing sampling interval until day 6. Overall correlations between salivary and plasma cortisol were: SHAM2, r = 0.30 and CHRONIC, r = 0.61. Experiment 1 found that the relationship between salivary and plasma cortisol was stronger during longer (DEPOT) than shorter (ACUTE) ACTH stimulation. Experiment 2 found a strong relationship between the two measurements during chronic ACTH stimulation, but that relationship weakened after ACTH stimulation ceased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aswine 3acorticotropin 3aintravenous injection 3aintramuscular injection 3asaliva 3ablood plasma 3acortisol 2aAdrenocorticotropic Hormonexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCastration 2aHydrocortisonexbloodxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aOrchiectomy 2aSalivaxmetabolism 2aSwinexmetabolism 0aPLASMA 0aSALIVA 0aCORTISOL 0aACTH 0aPIGS1 aFriend, T.

Many floral honeys possess antimicrobial activity due to high sugar, low pH, and the production of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) from the activity of the bee-derived enzyme glucose oxidase. Australian jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) honey produces particularly high levels of H₂O₂ and has been found to be potently antifungal. This study characterized the activity of jarrah honey on fungal dermatophyte species. Jarrah honey inhibited dermatophytes with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1.5–3.5% (w/v), which increased to ≥25% (w/v) when catalase was added. Microscopic analysis found jarrah honey inhibited the germination of Trichophyton rubrum conidia and scanning electron microscopy of mature T. rubrum hyphae after honey treatment revealed bulging and collapsed regions. When treated hyphae were stained using REDOX fluorophores these did not detect any internal oxidative stress, suggesting jarrah honey acts largely on the hyphal surface. Although H₂O₂ appears critical for the antifungal activity of jarrah honey and its action on fungal cells, these effects persisted when H₂O₂ was eliminated and could not be replicated using synthetic honey spiked with H₂O₂, indicating jarrah honey contains agents that augment antifungal activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus marginata 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3aantifungal properties 3acatalase 3aconidia 3afluorescent dyes 3agermination 3aglucose oxidase 3ahoney 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahyphae 3akeratinophilic fungi 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3asugars1 aKrishnakumar, Krishothman 1 aCokcetin, Nural 1 aHainsworth, Steven 1 aHarry, Elizabeth 1 aCarter, Dee 0 tPathogens.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100201943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018500167300001600352520099200368592002801360650002801388650002601416650002801442650002001470650001601490650001701506650002301523650001701546650002801563650002101591650002801612650001701640650002501657650001901682650002701701650000901728650000901737650002501746650002801771650004401799653002101843653002201864653002501886653001601911653002501927653003101952653004701983653004102030653003202071653003202103653003202135653003902167653004402206653005602250653004402306653004102350653004102391700006002432700001902492700002002511773011202531856008202643852000902725655001202734IND60544141620221117101823.0190415e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054414162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZareian, Mohsen10aProduction of a wheat-based fermented rice enriched with γ-amino butyric acid using Lactobacillus plantarum MNZ and its antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 194-203.  aThis study aimed to develop and characterize a wheat-based fermented rice (dosa) with potential anti-hypertensive effects using γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing Lactobacillus plantarum. Results showed that lactic acid bacterial fermentation enhanced the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory, radical scavenging activities and the GABA content (143 mg/kg at 120 h fermentation) of the dosa. The rats in the in-vivo trial were fed experimental diets containing dosa (T1), fermented dosa (T2) or dosa + pure GABA (T3). The systolic blood pressure, aortic endoteline-1 protein, plasma norepinephrine, serum level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and superoxide dismutase activity indicated improvement upon feeding of the diets containing GABA. While, the blood chemistry variables were not significantly affected in this experiment. GABA-enriched fermented dosa could therefore be considered as a functional food with the promising blood-pressure lowering effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aanimal disease models 3aantihypertensive effect 3ablood chemistry 3ablood serum 3abutyric acid 3aexperimental diets 3afermentation 3afree radical scavengers 3afunctional foods 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3ahypertension 3alactic acid bacteria 3anorepinephrine 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arats 3arice 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asystolic blood pressure 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aFunctional foods 0aAnti-hypertension 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aIndian dosa 0aFermentation process 0aHealth-conscious consumers 0aGamma aminobutyric acid (PubChem CID: 119) 0aL-glutamic acid (PubChem CID: 33032) 0aDPPH (PubChem CID: 2735032) 0aTrolox (PubChem CID: 40634) 0aABTS (PubChem CID: 5815211) 0aNitric oxide (PubChem CID: 145068) 0aAngiotensinogen (PubChem CID: 16133225) 0a1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (PubChem CID: 23103121) 0aSuperoxide anion (PubChem CID: 5359597) 0aEndothelin-1 (PubChem CID: 56842074) 0aNorepinephrine (PubChem CID: 439260)1 aOskoueian, Ehsan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3827-73691 aForghani, Bita1 aEbrahimi, Mahdi0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 June, v. 16 p.194-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007300164300001600237520096500253592002801218650002201246650002401268650002101292650001601313653002601329653002401355653001701379653001901396653002501415700005701440700002001497700001901517700001701536773008901553856008501642852000901727655001201736IND60634638420221122215924.0191214e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063463842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Peng10aPerformance optimization of a coaxial-cylinder wave energy converter  ap. 450-459.  aTo achieve a wider frequency range where the device has a larger capture width ratio, the performance of a heaving coaxial-cylinder wave energy converter is optimized through actively controlled generator damping and stiffness using a linear frequency domain model. The generator power take-off system is modeled as a damping-spring system, and the numerical model is validated against published results. The coupled dynamics of a two-body model is analyzed to search for the optimal generator damping and stiffness leading to maximal capture width ratio. The optimization process, which can be decoupled into two independent steps, leads to an improved performance of the device, with increased frequency bandwidth and better capture width ratio. The effects of water depth, mooring stiffness, and the dimensions of the WEC on the capture width ratio are also studied, and parameter values are identified which correspond to optimal performance of the device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3awater power 0aWave energy converter 0aCapture width ratio 0aOptimization 0aActive control 0aGenerator parameters1 aZhou, Binzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0821-50331 aGöteman, Malin1 aChen, Zhongfei1 aZhang, Liang0 tEnergy.g2019 May 01, v. 174 p.450-459dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165300001600306520124900322592002801571650001201599650002301611650002101634650001601655650002201671650002501693650001501718650002301733650001301756651001201769653003301781653004301814653002301857700001701880700001201897700001901909773009101928856008202019852000902101655001202110IND60561175620221118025513.0220523e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056117562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2017.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Caiyun10aApplying time series Landsat data for vegetation change analysis in the Florida Everglades Water Conservation Area 2A during 1996–2016  ap. 214-223.  aMapping plant communities and documenting their changes is critical to the on-going Florida Everglades restoration project. In this study, a framework was designed to map dominant vegetation communities and inventory their changes in the Florida Everglades Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) using time series Landsat images spanning 1996–2016. The object-based change analysis technique was combined in the framework. A hybrid pixel/object-based change detection approach was developed to effectively collect training samples for historical images with sparse reference data. An object-based quantification approach was also developed to assess the expansion/reduction of a specific class such as cattail (an invasive species in the Everglades) from the object-based classifications of two dates of imagery. The study confirmed the results in the literature that cattail was largely expanded during 1996–2007. It also revealed that cattail expansion was constrained after 2007. Application of time series Landsat data is valuable to document vegetation changes for the WCA-2A impoundment. The digital techniques developed will benefit global wetland mapping and change analysis in general, and the Florida Everglades WCA-2A in particular.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aconservation areas 3ainvasive species 3ainventories 3aplant communities 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3awater conservation 3awetlands 3aFlorida 0aObject-based change analysis 0aVegetation mapping and change analysis 0aFlorida Everglades1 aSmith, Molly1 aLv, Jie1 aFang, Chaoyang0 tITC journal.g2017 May, v. 57 p.214-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011500176300001600291520179400307592002802101596004902129596003802178596005902216596005902275596005902334650001002393650001302403650002502416650001602441650002702457650004002484650001202524650002302536650001002559650002402569650002902593650003202622650000902654650001902663650001202682650003602694650003702730650004002767700002602807700002102833700001902854700002102873700001802894700001902912700002302931700002202954700002502976700002503001700006403026773012903090856008303219852000903302655001203311IND60674642120221120193021.0200304e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067464212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-019-03058-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitlov Uljević, Marija10aDietary DHA/EPA supplementation ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by protecting from distal tubular cell damage  ap. 301-317.  aThe aim was to explore the influence of experimental diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and potential protective/deleterious effects of different dietary n−6/n−3 PUFA ratios on renal phospholipid composition and pathological changes caused by DM1. Male Wistar rats were injected with 55 mg/kg streptozotocin or citrate buffer (control group). Control (C) and diabetic groups (STZ) were fed with n−6/n−3 ratio of ≈ 7, STZ + N6 with n−6/n−3 ratio ≈ 60 and STZ + DHA with n−6/n−3 ratio of ≈ 1 containing 16% EPA and 19% DHA. Tissues were harvested 30 days after DM1 induction. Blood and kidneys were collected and analysed for phospholipid fatty acid composition, pathohystological changes, ectopic lipid accumulation and expression of VEGF, NF-kB and special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1). Pathological changes were studied also by using transmission electron microscopy, after immunostaining for VEGF. Substantial changes in renal phospholipid fatty acid composition resulted from DM1 and dietary PUFA manipulation. Extensive vacuolization of distal tubular cells (DTCs) was found in DM1, but it was attenuated in the STZ + DHA group, in which the highest renal NF-kB expression was observed. The ectopic lipid accumulation was observed in proximal tubular cells (PTCs) of all diabetic animals, but it was worsened in the STZ + N6 group. In DM1, we found disturbance of VEGF-transporting vesicular PTCs system, which was substantially worsened in STZ + DHA and STZ + N6. Results have shown that the early phase of DN is characterized with extent damage and vacuolization of DTCs, which could be attenuated by DHA/EPA supplementation. We concluded that dietary fatty acid composition can strongly influence the outcomes of DN.  aPublisher supplied data  aIP-2014-09-8992cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost  a3163cHrvatska Zaklada za Znanost  ano numbercMinistarstvo Obrazovanja, Znanosti i Sporta  ano numbercMinistarstvo Obrazovanja, Znanosti i Sporta  ano numbercMinistarstvo Obrazovanja, Znanosti i Sporta 3ablood 3acitrates 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3atissues 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aStarčević, Kristina1 aMašek, Tomislav1 aBočina, Ivana1 aRestović, Ivana1 aKević, Nives1 aRacetin, Anita1 aKretzschmar, Genia1 aGrobe, Maximilian1 aVukojević, Katarina1 aSaraga-Babić, Mirna1 aFilipović, Natalija1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8943-41090 tCell and tissue research.g2019 Nov., v. 378, no. 2 p.301-317dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-019-03058-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011100153300002000264520104800284592002801332650001601360650001601376650001101392650001301403650001901416650002301435650002601458650002501484650002701509650001701536650001301553700001901566700001601585700001401601700002001615700001801635773012501653856007401778852000901852655001201861IND60642110420221120095842.0190506e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064211042DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07799h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ji10aSimultaneous degradation of tetracycline by a microbial fuel cell and its toxicity evaluation by zebrafish  ap. 44226-44233.  aTetracycline (TC) is the second most commonly used antibiotic despite its high toxicity and persistence. In this study, a new approach for the anaerobic biodegradation of TC in a microbial fuel cell (MFC), with glucose–TC mixtures as the substrate, under gradient acclimation conditions was explored. Within 7 days, approximately 79.1% of TC was degraded by the MFC. This value was higher than that obtained through a traditional anaerobic method (14.9%). The TC degradation rates in MFCs with a closed circuit were 31.6% higher than those in MFCs with an open circuit. Furthermore, zebrafish assessment showed that no toxicity was observed after MFC treatment. Microbial community analysis was performed on the anode of the MFCs under gradient acclimation conditions, and the results showed that TC was effectively degraded by the synergy of fermentative bacteria, acid-producing bacteria and electrogenic bacteria. This work confirmed that the anaerobic biodegradation of TC by MFCs is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacclimation 3aanodes 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acost effectiveness 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial fuel cells 3asustainable technology 3atetracycline 3atoxicity1 aHe, Ming Fang,1 aZhang, Dalu1 aRen, Ziyu1 aSong, Tian-shun1 aXie, Jingjing0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 7, no. 70 p.44226-44233dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07799h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165500002200241520111800263592002801381650001601409650001201425650001601437650001201453650001201465650002301477650001101500650002101511650001101532650002301543650001701566650001201583650001701595653001001612653002401622653002101646653001001667653000901677700001401686700002001700700006101720773008201781856008101863852000901944655001201953IND60561175720221118025313.0170607s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056117572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2016.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Zhenwei10aHepatic lipid metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in aging  aPre-press version  aAging is associated with dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Various factors that contribute to the dysregulation include both modifiable (e.g. obesity, insulin resistance) and non-modifiable risk factors (age-associated physiologic changes). Although there is no linear relationship between aging and prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, current data strongly suggests that advanced age leads to more severe histological changes and poorer clinical outcomes. Hepatic lipid accumulation could lead to significant hepatic and systemic consequences including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, impairment of systemic glucose metabolism and metabolic syndrome, thereby contributing to age-related diseases. Insulin, leptin and adiponectin are key regulators of the various physiologic processes that regulate hepatic lipid metabolism. Recent advances have expanded our understanding in this field, highlighting the role of novel mediators such as FGF 21, and mitochondria derived peptides.

Despite their prominence in AD pathogenesis, the regulation of BACE1 and APP is incompletely understood. In this study, we report that the circular RNA circular RNA sponge for miR‐7 (ciRS‐7) has an important role in regulating BACE1 and APP protein levels. Previous studies have shown that ciRS‐7, which is highly expressed in the human brain, is down‐regulated in the brain of people with AD but the relevance of this finding was not clear. We have found that ciRS‐7 is not involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 gene expression, but instead reduces the protein levels of APP and BACE1 by promoting their degradation via the proteasome and lysosome. Consequently, overexpression of ciRS‐7 reduces the generation of Aβ, indicating a potential neuroprotective role of ciRS‐7. Our data also suggest that ciRS‐7 modulates APP and BACE1 levels in a nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB)‐dependent manner: ciRS‐7 expression inhibits translation of NF‐κB and induces its cytoplasmic localization, thus derepressing expression of UCHL1, which promotes APP and BACE1 degradation. Additionally, we demonstrated that APP reduces the level of ciRS‐7, revealing a mutual regulation of ciRS‐7 and APP. Taken together, our data provide a molecular mechanism implicating reduced ciRS‐7 expression in AD, suggesting that ciRS‐7 may represent a useful target in the development of therapeutic strategies for AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aRNA 3abrain 3agene expression 3ahumans 3alysosomes 3apathogenesis 3apeople 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aChen, Ting1 aYao, Qingbin1 aZheng, Lina1 aZhang, Zhen1 aWang, Jingzhao1 aHu, Zhimei1 aCui, Hongmei1 aHan, Yawei1 aHan, Xiaohui1 aZhang, Kun1 aHong, Wei0 tFEBS journal.g2017 Apr., v. 284, no. 7 p.1096-1109dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.140453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006400176300001600240520160400256592002801860650002101888650001301909650001701922650000901939650001901948650002401967650001901991650001802010650001102028650001802039650001402057650000702071650003102078650003202109650002002141650001602161650001402177650001402191650001602205650001902221653001402240653001802254653001802272653001702290653002002307700002202327700002302349700002502372773010602397856008702503852000902590655001202599IND60553079020221119100413.0181220e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055307902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSponton, Osvaldo E.10aLinoleic acid binding properties of ovalbumin nanoparticles  ap. 219-226.  aIn the present work, ovalbumin (OVA) solutions (10g/L, 50mM NaCl, pH 7.5) were heat-treated at 75, 80 and 85°C (namely, OVA-75, OVA-80 and OVA-85, respectively), from 0 to 25min. OVA nanoparticles (OVAn) around 100nm were obtained. For 3min of heat treatment, OVAn sizes increased with temperature, but for a heating time longer than 10min, OVA-75 showed the highest size values. OVAn surface hydrophobicity increased 6–8 folds in comparison with native OVA and wavelength blue shifts of 25–30nm in maximum fluorescence intensity were registered. These results suggest that buried hydrophobic residues were exposed to the aqueous medium. Binding experiments with linoleic acid (LA) as polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) model were carried out. Firstly, binding ability of OVAn was determined from LA titration curves of intrinsic fluorescence measurements. OVA-85 at 5min presented the highest binding ability and it was used for further binding properties studies (turbidity, particle size distribution – PSD – analysis and ζ-potential measurements). Turbidity measurement and PSD analysis showed that OVAn–LA nanocomplexes were formed, avoiding LA supramolecular self-assembly formation. The union of LA to OVAn surface confers them significant lower ζ-potential and larger size. Hence, fluorescence and ζ-potential results showed that LA would bind to OVAn by mean of hydrophobic interactions. Information derived from this work could be important to potentially use OVAn as PUFA vehiculization with applications in several industrial sectors (food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, etc.).  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3acolloids 3afluorescence 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3alinoleic acid 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aovalbumin 3apH 3aparticle size distribution 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atitration 3aturbidity 3awavelengths 3azeta potential 0aOvalbumin 0aNanoparticles 0aLinoleic acid 0aFluorescence 0aBinding ability1 aPerez, Adrián A.1 aCarrara, Carlos R.1 aSantiago, Liliana G.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 128 p.219-226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245006500166300001600231520089100247592002801138650002001166650002001186650002001206650002101226650002201247650002201269650001801291650003001309650001401339650001001353650001701363650002101380653002001401653003801421653001201459700002401471773015301495856007901648852000901727655001201736IND60522808420221120113840.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052280842DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1989-9-10052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, R.

The composition of molecular species of triacylglycerols was analyzed by GC on the basis of chain length and C-57 was found to be the major species followed by C-55, C-59, C-53 and C-61. The sterol fraction constituted β-sitosterol and stigmasterol with 89.3 and 10.7% respectively. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine were the two phospholipids with 55 and 45% present in the phospholipid fraction of the beech seed oil. Oleic, linoleic and palmitic acids were found to be the major fatty acids in all the acyl lipid classes with small variations in quantities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3abeta-sitosterol 3adiacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3alipid composition 3amonoacylglycerols 3apalmitic acid 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aseed oils 3aseeds 3astigmasterol 3atriacylglycerols 0aFagus sylvatica 0aSeed Oil Composition.

In recent decades, remote-sensing techniques have been widely used to measure the qualitative parameters of waterbodies (i.e. suspended sediments, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll- a , and pollutants). A large number of different sensors on board various satellites and other platforms, such as aeroplanes, are currently used to measure the amount of radiation at various wavelengths reflected from the water’s surface. In this review article, the more commonly employed spaceborne and airborne sensors used in water quality investigations are introduced and their utility in the quantitative assessment of the quality parameters of waterbodies is discussed. Various properties (spectral, spatial and temporal, etc.) of spaceborne and airborne sensors are tabulated to be used as a sensor selection guide. These tables are helpful when designing water quality assessment studies, and can be used for the selection of appropriate sensors among many other available sensors in the market. Finally, based on the literature survey, a compilation of sensors used to measure various water quality parameters is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adissolved organic matter 3amarkets 3apollutants 3aremote sensing 3aresearchers 3asatellites 3asurface water 3asurveys 3asuspended sediment 3awater quality 3awater resources 3awavelengths1 aMelesse, Assefa M.1 aReddi, Lakshmi0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2016 July 17, v. 37, no. 14 p.3143-3180dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2016.11904773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01223naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012700156300001800283500001100301520031500312592002800627650002200655650001200677650001000689650002100699650001300720773011700733856007400850852000900924655001200933IND60588246420221118151853.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058824642DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.140042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardy, John14aThe discovery of Alzheimer‐causing mutations in the APP gene and the formulation of the “amyloid cascade hypothesis”  ap. 1040-1044.  aREVIEW  aThe cloning of APP and genetic analysis of families with Alzheimer's disease were both reported in 1987 and much present work on the disease is based upon the foundations laid at that time.

This research may herald the advent of ASC device potential application for electrical vehicles, smart power grids, and intermittent renewable energy sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarbonization 3acoprecipitation 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ananocomposites 3apaper 3asynergism1 aSun, Chengxiang1 aPan, Wenxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3723-24301 aGuo, Gengtao1 aZheng, Yuhang1 aLiu, Cheng1 aZhu, Jianhong0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 35, no. 20 p.16915-16924dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c025813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012400169300001600293520116000309592002801469650001701497650002901514650001301543650001201556650001201568650001301580650001301593650002201606650001701628650001501645650002101660650001101681653003601692653002701728653002501755653001801780700001601798700001801814700001801832700001201850700001401862700001101876700001501887700001601902773010801918856008602026852000902112655001202121IND60553079320221119100426.0170607e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055307932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaochi10aStable and efficient loading of silver nanoparticles in spherical polyelectrolyte brushes and the antibacterial effects  ap. 148-154.  aA more efficient and convenient strategy was demonstrated to immobilize silver nanoparticles (NPs) with a crystalline structure into the spherical polyelectrolyte brushes (SPB) as an antibacterial material. The SPB used for surface coating (Ag immobilized PVK–PAA SPB) consists of a poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) core and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) chain layers which are anchored onto the surface of PVK core at one end. Well-dispersed silver nanoparticles (diameter∼3.5nm) then formed and were electrostatically confined in the brush layer. Ag content is controlled by a repeated loading process. Thin film coatings were then constructed by layer-by-layer depositions of positive charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and SPB. The multilayer composites display excellent stability as well as antibacterial performance but not for simple PVK–PAA coated surface. The results show that almost complete bacteria growth including both dispersed bacterial cells and biofilms was inhibited over a period of 24h. This approach opens a novel strategy for stable and efficient immobilization of Ag NPs in fabrication of antibacterial materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abrushes 3acoatings 3acolloids 3acrystal structure 3aelectrolytes 3ananosilver 3apolyacrylic acid 3asilver 0aSpherical polyelectrolyte brush 0aPoly(N-vinylcarbazole) 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aAntibacterial1 aXu, Yisheng1 aWang, Xiaohan1 aShao, Mingfei1 aXu, Jun1 aWang, Jie1 aLi, Li1 aZhang, Rui1 aGuo, Xuhong0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 127 p.148-154dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245014500174300001600319520124200335592002801577596006701605596006701672596007001739596007101809596007101880650001801951650001601969650002001985650001402005650002402019650001602043650001002059650001602069650000902085650001602094650002502110650002002135650001802155650001602173650002102189650001702210700002502227700001502252700002202267700002002289700001702309700002102326700002002347700006202367773012902429856008302558852000902641655001202650IND60674642620221120082419.0200304e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067464262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-019-03028-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardino, Raquel L.10aKnockout of MCT1 results in total absence of spermatozoa, sex hormones dysregulation, and morphological alterations in the testicular tissue  ap. 333-339.  aLactate is a key metabolite for the normal occurrence of spermatogenesis. In the testis, lactate is produced by the Sertoli cells and transported to germline cells. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are key players in that process. Among the family of MCTs, MCT1 is at least partly responsible for lactate uptake by the germ cells. We aimed to perform a first assessment of the role of MCT1 in male reproductive potential. Mct1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were used for morphometric evaluation, testicular morphology, and sperm parameter assessment. Serum steroid hormones levels were also measured. cKO animals showed a decrease in gonadosomatic index, testis weight, and seminiferous tubular diameters. Deletion of MCT1 also causes morphological changes in the organization of the seminiferous tubules and on Sertoli cell morphology. These changes resulted in failure of spermatogenesis with depletion of germ cells and total absence of spermatozoa. MCT1 cKO animals presented also hormonal dysregulation, with a decrease in serum 17β-estradiol levels. In conclusion, MCT1 is pivotal for male reproductive potential. Absence of MCT1 results in maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia pool and compromised sperm production.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BD/103105/2014cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BD/109284/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aPTDC/BIM-MET/4712/2014cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aPTDC/MEC-AND/28691/2017cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aPTDC/BBB-BQB/ 1368/2014cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aSertoli cells 3ablood serum 3acell structures 3aestradiol 3agonadosomatic index 3alactic acid 3amales 3ametabolites 3amice 3amorphometry 3aseminiferous tubules 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3aspermatozoa 3asteroid hormones 3atransporters1 aD’Souza, Warren N.1 aRato, Luis1 aRothstein, Jay L.1 aDias, Tânia R.1 aChui, Daniel1 aWannberg, Sharon1 aAlves, Marco G.1 aOliveira, Pedro F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4989-56990 tCell and tissue research.g2019 Nov., v. 378, no. 2 p.333-339dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-019-03028-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007500171500001400246520076900260592002801029650002801057650001401085650001501099650002001114650001901134650001301153650001201166700002501178700002501203773012301228856008101351852000901432655001201441IND60729408620221119114044.0210228e20210213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072940862DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100202002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiggins, Nicole  L.10aRegulation of Latency and Reactivation by Human Cytomegalovirus miRNAs  aNAL-light  aHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes 22 mature microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate a myriad of cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and immune evasion, as well as viral gene expression. Recent evidence points to a critical role for HCMV miRNAs in mediating latency in CD34⁺ hematopoietic progenitor cells through modulation of cellular signaling pathways, including attenuation of TGFβ and EGFR signaling. Moreover, HCMV miRNAs can act in concert with, or in opposition to, viral proteins in regulating host cell functions. Here, we comprehensively review the studies of HCMV miRNAs in the context of latency and highlight the novel processes that are manipulated by the virus using these small non-coding RNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3agene expression 3aimmune evasion 3amicroRNA 3aviruses1 aSkalsky, Rebecca  L.1 aHancock, Meaghan  H.0 tPathogens.g2021 Feb. 13, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100202003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010800210300001600318520146600334592002801800650002301828650001101851650001701862650000901879650001501888650001901903650002601922650001301948650001101961650001201972650001601984650001702000653003102017653002302048653002902071653002002100700001702120700001602137700002002153700002502173700002202198773008902220856008502309852000902394655001202403IND60634639020221120094947.0191214e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063463902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlami, Abdul Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9986-432410aInvestigating various copper oxides-based counter electrodes for dye sensitized solar cell applications  ap. 526-533.  aDue to the rapid increase in their efficiencies, third generation photovoltaics rose to prominence in recent years, and became serious competitors to conventional silicon based and thin film solar cells. This work investigates various techniques to grow and/or deposit copper oxide (CuO) on a copper substrate for utilization as a counter electrode in dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. Copper has many attractive thermal, electrical and mechanical properties and is widely used in solar thermal applications, but its use is limited in solar photovoltaic cells. The experimental results reported herein have proven the success of growing an intrinsic copper oxide layer on a pure copper substrate. Among the methods, the chemical ageing process followed by heat treatment has resulted in a homogenous and adherent oxide layer that attenuated the electronic conductivity and chemical reactivity of pure, bare copper electrodes. These electrodes are incorporated into solar cells that are constructed and tested against a platinum reference cell. The cells showed comparable short circuit current to their platinum counterparts, with efficiencies of 0.2% compared with 0.5% for platinum under the same conditions. The copper counter electrode with the CuO deposition exhibited good promise, especially when comparing figures of merit (power generated/price) as a cheap and effective alternative to platinum in third generation solar cell applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3acupric oxide 3adyes 3aelectrodes 3aheat treatment 3amechanical properties 3aplatinum 3aprices 3asilicon 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 0aDye sensitized solar cells 0aCounter-electrodes 0aCopper oxides/hydroxides 0aChemical ageing1 aRajab, Bilal1 aAbed, Jehad1 aFaraj, Mohammed1 aHawili, Abdullah Abu1 aAlawadhi, Hussain0 tEnergy.g2019 May 01, v. 174 p.526-533dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009300172300001600265520095200281592002801233650001501261650001601276650001901292650001501311650001901326650001901345650001401364650001301378650001401391650001001405653002801415653001601443653001401459653001501473653002001488700001701508773011201525856008201637852000901719655001201728IND60606686320221118013250.0180727e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060668632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViswanath, Buddolla10aRecent insights into the development of nanotechnology to detect circulating tumor cells  ap. 191-198.  aCirculating tumor cells (CTCs) produced from primary tumors act as seeds for metastasis, leading to the majority of cancer-related deaths. Currently, in cancer research, these cells have attracted much attention in studying the process of metastasis. Various studies in the past decade have enlightened the role of CTCs as potential biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. As a result, the analysis of CTCs could act as a substitute for characterizing the nature of primary tumors and provide unique insights into the metastatic process. The detection of CTCs in the blood samples of a cancer patient is technically challenging because of the extremely low abundance of CTCs among a large number of other blood cells. Therefore, novel methods for the detection of CTCs are highly recommended. In this feature article, we discuss the recent progress in nanotechnology for the detection of CTCs along with perspectives on future opportunities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood cells 3ablood sampling 3ametastasis 3ananotechnology 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aseeds 0aCirculating tumor cells 0aNanosensors 0aDetection 0aMetastasis 0aClinical impact1 aKim, Sanghyo0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 82 p.191-198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245005000165300001600215520101000231592002801241650002001269650001101289650002501300650001401325650001901339650001101358650002901369650001601398653000801414653000801422653000801430653000801438653000801446653003801454653001901492653002701511653002201538653002301560700002101583700002301604773007701627856008301704852000901787655001201796IND60546212820221120214349.0160903e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054621282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Erin10aDecision frameworks and the investment in R&D  ap. 275-285.  aIn this paper we provide an overview of decision frameworks aimed at crafting an energy technology Research & Development portfolio, based on the results of three large expert elicitation studies and a large scale energy-economic model. We introduce importance sampling as a technique for integrating elicitation data and large IAMs into decision making under uncertainty models. We show that it is important to include both parts of this equation – the prospects for technological advancement and the interactions of the technologies in and with the economy. We find that investment in energy technology R&D is important even in the absence of climate policy. We illustrate the value of considering dynamic two-stage sequential decision models under uncertainty for identifying alternatives with option value. Finally, we consider two frameworks that incorporate ambiguity aversion. We suggest that these results may be best used to guide future research aimed at improving the set of elicitation data.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3aequations 3aexpert opinion 3amodels 3aresearch and development 3auncertainty 0aQ42 0aQ54 0aO33 0aD81 0aQ55 0aDecision making under uncertainty 0aClimate change 0aStabilization pathways 0aEnergy technology 0aAmbiguity aversion1 aOlaleye, Olaitan1 aAleluia Reis, Lara0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 May, v. 80 p.275-285dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012600207300001800333520101200351536012201363592002801485650002301513650003001536650002601566650001201592650001501604650001801619650001301637653002201650653001301672653001301685700001801698700002101716700002401737700001901761700001701780700001901797700001701816773012601833856008201959852000902041655001202050IND60788954720221122090754.0220818e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078895472DNAL7 a10.1177/004051752110460562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, Charles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4157-777610aFiltration efficiency and differential pressure of fabrics used in non-medical masks based on SARS COVID-19 particle size  ap. 3234-3242.  aNon-medical fabric masks, recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, are available in various fabrics. There is limited research on the overall effectiveness of fabrics used to make masks. The purpose of this study was to assess fabrics commonly used in non-medical masks against their ability to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 based on the size and throughput of aerosols and particles (<1 μm). Seven different fabrics were evaluated on filtration efficiency (FE), differential pressure (dP), and filtration quality (Q factor). Results indicate <16% FE against particles the size of COVID-19, dP <0.51 in w.c., and Q factor <0.004 Pa⁻¹. FE results are lower than previously reported research with dP and Q factors within international guidelines. Using non-medical fabric masks as the sole mitigation strategy is not effective. It is critical to combine non-medical fabric masks with physical distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19 further.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aWorld Health Organization 3adifferential pressure 3afabrics 3afiltration 3aparticle size 3aresearch 0anon-medical masks 0aCOVID-19 0atextiles1 aBurch, Reuben1 aBlack, Catherine1 aStrawderman, Lesley1 aRickert, Jaime1 aWilson, John1 aSaucier, David1 aSmith, Brian0 tTextile research journal.g2022 Sept., v. 92, no. 17-18 p.3234-3242dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/004051752110460563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012000167300001600287520124400303592002801547596005901575596005901634596007701693596007701770650002801847650002201875650001501897650001401912650001201926650001601938650002001954650003301974650001502007650002102022650001902043700002102062700002102083700001902104700002102123700001802144700006202162773012902224856008302353852000902436655001202445IND60674642720221120082246.0200304e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067464272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-019-03037-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawasaki, Yuto10aThree-dimensional architecture of pericardial nephrocytes in Drosophila melanogaster revealed by FIB/SEM tomography  ap. 289-300.  aNephrocytes are similar in structure to podocytes and play a role in the isolation of toxic substances from hemolymph in insects. Drosophila melanogaster nephrocytes have recently been used to study podocyte function and disease. However, the three-dimensional ultrastructure of nephrocytes is not clearly understood because their surrounding basement membrane makes it difficult to observe using conventional scanning electron microscopy. We reconstructed the three-dimensional ultrastructure of Drosophila pericardial nephrocytes using serial focused-ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) images. The basal surfaces were occupied by foot processes and slit-like spaces between them. The slit-like spaces corresponded to the podocyte filtration slits and were formed by longitudinal infolding/invagination of the basal plasma membrane. The basal surface between the slit-like spaces became the foot processes, which ran almost linearly, and had a “washboard-like” appearance. Both ends of the foot processes were usually anastomosed to neighboring foot processes and thus free ends were rarely observed. We demonstrated that FIB/SEM is a powerful tool to better understand the three-dimensional architecture of nephrocytes.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP15K18960cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP17K08521cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aS1311011cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  aS1101009cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abasement membrane 3afiltration 3ahemolymph 3ainsects 3apericardium 3aplasma membrane 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atomography 3atoxic substances 3aultrastructure1 aMatsumoto, Akira1 aMiyaki, Takayuki1 aKinoshita, Mui1 aKakuta, Soichiro1 aSakai, Tatsuo1 aIchimura, Koichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6590-79120 tCell and tissue research.g2019 Nov., v. 378, no. 2 p.289-300dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-019-03037-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011100165300001500276500001500291520119500306592002801501650002101529650001601550650001201566650001501578650001701593650002201610650001701632650000901649650002301658650001501681650001501696650001601711650001801727650002701745650001501772650001901787650002201806650001601828650003901844653002501883653002001908653002501928653001901953653001701972700001901989700002202008700001902030773011102049856008202160852000902242655001202251IND60544142420221117103507.0190415e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054414242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJe, Jae-Young10aAmino acid composition and in vitro antioxidant and cytoprotective activity of abalone viscera hydrolysate  ap. 94-103.  a2019-12-06  aAbalone viscera is one of the byproducts from abalone processing and is discarded as industrial waste. In this study, abalone viscera hydrolysates (AVH) were prepared using Alcalase, Flavourzyme, Neutrase, and Protamex, and their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) was evaluated. The AVH by Alcalase showed promising ORAC value, and further optimal enzyme/substrate hydrolysis condition for production of the AVH was determined. The AVH also exerted strong hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity, Fe2+ chelating activity, and reducing power. Furthermore, the AVH inhibited lipid peroxidation in a model system and protected hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage. Amino acid profiles revealed that the AVH contained 57.1% antioxidant amino acids and 44.0% hydrophobic amino acids, which contributed to its higher antioxidant activity. In addition, the AVH showed cytoprotective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity of cultured hepatocytes, and significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and membrane lipid peroxidation. Taken all together, these results suggest that the AVH might be useful as an ingredient for functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunctional foods 3ahepatocytes 3aabalone 3aDNA damage 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysates 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3abyproducts 3asubtilisin 3aamino acids 3aanimal organs 3aamino acid composition 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrial wastes 3aingredients 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAbalone viscera 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aCytoprotection 0aantioxidants1 aPark, Soo Yeon1 aHwang, Joung-Youl1 aAhn, Chang-Bum0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 June, v. 16 p.94-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007100162300001600233520059500249592002800844653002500872653002600897653002100923653002300944653000900967653001400976653002700990653003401017653002001051653002301071653000901094653001401103773010001117856008101217852000901298655001201307IND60481797620221120231549.0160210e20080707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048179762DNAL7 a10.2478/v10011-008-0013-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Sol10aImproving the Preanalytical Process: The Focus on Specimen Quality  ap. 343-347.  aTrends in clinical laboratory practice place more demands on the quality of patient specimens.

In the present study, we characterized a modular LPMO (PcAA10A), consisting of a family 10 auxiliary activity of LPMO (AA10) catalytic domain, and non-catalytic domains including a family 5 carbohydrate-binding module, two fibronectin type-3 domains, and a family 3 carbohydrate-binding module from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus B-6, which was expressed in a recombinant Escherichia coli. Comparison of activities between full-length PcAA10A and the catalytic domain polypeptide (PcAA10A_CD) indicates that the non-catalytic domains are important for the deconstruction of crystalline cellulose and complex polysaccharides contained in untreated lignocellulosic biomass. Interestingly, PcAA10A_CD acted not only on cellulose and chitin, but also on xylan, mannan, and xylan and cellulose contained in lignocellulosic biomass, which has not been reported for the AA10 family. Mutation of the key residues, Trp51 located at subsite − 2 and Phe171 located at subsite +2, in the substrate-binding site of PcAA10A_CD revealed that these residues are substantially involved in broad substrate specificity toward cellulose, xylan, and mannan, albeit with a low effect toward chitin. Furthermore, PcAA10A had a boosting effect on untreated corn hull degradation by P. curdlanolyticus B-6 endo-xylanase Xyn10D and Clostridium thermocellum endo-glucanase Cel9A. These results suggest that PcAA10A is a unique LPMO capable of cleaving and enhancing lignocellulosic biomass degradation, making it a good candidate for biotechnological applications. KEY POINTS: • PcAA10A is a novel modular LPMO family 10 from Paenibacillus curdlanolyticus. • PcAA10A showed broad substrate specificity on β-1,4 glycosidic linkage substrates. • Non-catalytic domains are important for degrading complex polysaccharides. • PcAA10A is a unique LPMO capable of enhancing lignocellulosic biomass degradation.  aPublisher supplied data  aPHD/0106/2553cThailand Research Fund 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aEscherichia coli 3aPaenibacillus curdlanolyticus 3aactive sites 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acarbohydrate binding 3acellulose 3achitin 3acorn husks 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3afibronectins 3aglycosidic linkages 3alignocellulose 3amicrobiology 3amutation 3apolypeptides 3asubstrate specificity 3asynergism 3axylan1 aPhitsuwan, Paripok1 aWaeonukul, Rattiya1 aPason, Patthra1 aTachaapaikoon, Chakrit1 aPoomputsa, Kanokwan1 aKosugi, Akihiko1 aSakka, Makiko1 aSakka, Kazuo1 aRatanakhanokchai, Khanok0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Sept., v. 104, no. 17 p.7533-7550dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10758-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013200176300001600308520093700324592002801261650004401289650003701333650001901370650001301389650002001402650001701422650001601439650001501455650002101470650004301491650001101534650001901545650001401564650001801578650001901596650001601615653002701631653001101658653001601669653001701685653003401702700001801736700003001754700002201784773010601806856008701912852000901999655001202008IND60553079620221119100441.0181220e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055307962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopel, Seda Demirel10aSynthesis and characterization of Bodipy functionalized magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for potential bioimaging applications  ap. 245-253.  aMultifunctional magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized for potential bio-imaging applications.

In case they are conjugated to the surface of colloidal nanoparticles new or improved applications are possible. An overview of the potential of such fluorophore-particle conjugates is given by means of several examples. First, using pH-sensitive fluorophores attached to particles are a helpful tool for investigating particle uptake by cells, as they can indicate whether particles are in the neutral slightly alkaline extracellular medium, or in acidic intracellular vesicles after endocytosis. Second, relating to lifetime-based methodologies, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorophores attached to quantum dots leads to longer lifetimes, improving their performance and expanding the possibilities of methods, such as lifetime imaging for in vivo applications. It also can be exploited for multiplexing approaches, in which the effective lifetime of the fluorophores can be tuned, allowing thus for the detection of several analytes based on temporal discrimination. Attention is focused to these three areas of application, because they are among the most reported in recent literature, and therefore of particular interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aendocytosis 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3ananoparticles 3aquantum dots 0aIon-sensitive fluorophores 0apH sensing 0aColloidal nanoparticles 0aQuantum dots 0aFluorescence resonance energy transfer 0aFluorescence read-out 0aParticle uptake by cells 0aEndocytosis1 aEscudero, Alberto1 aParak, Wolfgang J.0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Nov., v. 84 p.84-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245005200204500002200256520095000278592002801228650001001256650002001266650001601286650001701302650001201319650002101331650001401352650001201366653001001378653001101388653003001399653000901429653001501438653000701453653000701460653000701467653001101474653001401485653001101499653000801510653000801518653000901526653001201535653000801547653000801555653001301563653000801576653001201584653000801596653000801604653000901612653001201621653000801633653001101641653000801652700002101660773008201681856008101763852000901844655001201853IND60561176320221118025408.0170607s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056117632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWirth, Eva K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0491-994110aNeuronal effects of thyroid hormone metabolites  aPre-press version  aThyroid hormones and their metabolites are active regulators of gene expression, mitochondrial function and various other physiological actions in different organs and tissues. These actions are mediated by a spatio-temporal regulation of thyroid hormones and metabolites within a target cell. This spatio-temporal resolution as well as classical and non-classical actions of thyroid hormones and metabolites is accomplished and regulated on multiple levels as uptake, local activation and signaling of thyroid hormones. In this review, we will give an overview of the systems involved in regulating the presence and activity of thyroid hormones and their metabolites within the brain, specifically in neurons. While a wealth of data on thyroxin (T4) and 3,5,3’-triiodothyronine (T3) in the brain has been generated, research into the presence of action of other thyroid hormone metabolites is still sparse and requires further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3agene expression 3ametabolites 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3athyroid hormones 3athyroxine 3atissues 0aBrain 0aNeuron 0aThyroid hormone transport 0aMct8 0aDeiodinase 0aT4 0aT3 0aTH 0a3,5-T2 0a3,3′-T2 0a3-T1AM 0aTbg 0aTtr 0aT0AM 0aAc-T1AM 0aTA1 0aCSF 0aLC-MS/MS 0aMct 0aB-CSF-B 0aBBB 0aLat 0aOatp 0aApoB100 0aTRE 0aTetrac 0aTA41 aMeyer, Franziska0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012100168300001600289520144100305592002801746650002501774650002301799650001601822650001801838650001101856650002901867650001201896650002401908653002001932653001501952653002201967700001501989700002002004700002002024773007702044856008302121852000902204655001202213IND60546213120221122133938.0160903e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054621312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuryk, Stephen10aInvestigating preferences for dynamic electricity tariffs: The effect of environmental and system benefit disclosure  ap. 190-195.  aDynamic electricity pricing can produce efficiency gains in the electricity sector and help achieve energy policy goals such as increasing electric system reliability and supporting renewable energy deployment. Retail electric companies can offer dynamic pricing to residential electricity customers via smart meter-enabled tariffs that proxy the cost to procure electricity on the wholesale market. Current investments in the smart metering necessary to implement dynamic tariffs show policy makers’ resolve for enabling responsive demand and realizing its benefits. However, despite these benefits and the potential bill savings these tariffs can offer, adoption among residential customers remains at low levels. Using a choice experiment approach, this paper seeks to determine whether disclosing the environmental and system benefits of dynamic tariffs to residential customers can increase adoption. Although sampling and design issues preclude wide generalization, we found that our environmentally conscious respondents reduced their required discount to switch to dynamic tariffs around 10% in response to higher awareness of environmental and system benefits. The perception that shifting usage is easy to do also had a significant impact, indicating the potential importance of enabling technology. Perhaps the targeted communication strategy employed by this study is one way to increase adoption and achieve policy goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aconsumers (people) 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3atariffs 3awholesale marketing 0aDynamic pricing 0aSmart grid 0aChoice experiment1 aMead, Doug1 aMourato, Susana1 aTorriti, Jacopo0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 May, v. 80 p.190-195dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006400167300001600231520112500247592002801372653000901400653001401409653001701423653002501440653000701465653003101472653000901503653001401512653000701526653001701533653003301550653000701583653003101590773010001621856008101721852000901802655001201811IND60481797820221121015255.0160210e20080707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048179782DNAL7 a10.2478/v10011-008-0015-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanković, Ana10aDeveloping a Lean Consciousness for the Clinical Laboratory  ap. 354-359.  aThis is an overview of the principles of Lean and Six Sigma as a means of streamlining operations and improving productivity. Manufacturing sectors have employed these concepts with much success. The primary goal of a lean initiative is to deliver quality products and services the first time and every time. To accomplish this, all activities that do not add value (i.e., waste) must be eliminated or, if not feasible, reduced. The demands of today's healthcare environment warrant the integration of quality management systems such as these to meet increased workloads, staff shortages, and the demand for rapid turnaround for specimen results. This paper discusses Lean and Six Sigma strategies as well as their application for the clinical laboratory, specifically utilizing tools such as 5S, the Kaizen Blitz, process mapping, and value stream mapping. By implementing these tools to maximize process flow, eliminate waste, and recognize the variations that can hinder the delivery of high-quality services, healthcare professionals can reach their efficiency goals, reduce costs, and provide customer satisfaction.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLean 0aSix Sigma 0aKaizen Blitz 0aValue Stream Mapping 0a5S 0aSpecimen Management System 0aLean 0aSix Sigma 0a5S 0aKaizen Blitz 0aplaniranje protoka vrednosti 0a5S 0asistem upravljanja uzorkom0 tJournal of Medical Biochemistry.g2008 July 7, v. 27, no. 3 p.354-359dVersitax1452-82667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10011-008-0015-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009400175300001600269520097400285592002801259650001501287650000801302650001601310650001301326650001701339650001401356650001001370650002001380650004801400650001301448653001701461653001101478653002801489653002101517653002401538653002101562700001901583700001901602700002201621700002001643773010601663856008701769852000901856655001201865IND60553079820221119100511.0181220e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055307982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidout, Michael J.10aInteraction of transglutaminase with adsorbed and spread films of β-casein and к-casein  ap. 254-260.  aEnzymes can be used to enable a specific and controlled approach for structural modifications of protein networks in food technology.

In this work the interfacial properties of β-casein and к-casein films were investigated with a special focus on the mechanism of transglutaminase (TG) induced cross-linking at the air/water interface. The surface rheology results showed that for the enhanced interfacial strength the order and timing of TG addition matters: TG reaction was most effective when the enzyme was applied during adsorption of proteins to the interface. Differences observed between enzymatic cross-linking of β-casein and к-casein at the air/water interface verified the importance of molecular structure and close packing for formation of an elastic protein network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3abeta-casein 3acolloids 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3afoams 3afood technology 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3arheology 0aMilk protein 0aCasein 0aEnzymatic cross-linking 0aTransglutaminase 0aAir/water interface 0aSurface rheology1 aPaananen, Arja1 aMamode, Anissa1 aLinder, Markus B.1 aWilde, Peter J.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 128 p.254-260dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008500170300001600255520109800271592002801369650001401397650001201411650002601423650001501449650001901464650001401483650002201497650001201519653002001531653001201551653002101563653003001584653001701614653001301631653000801644653000801652653001001660700002201670700002101692700002001713773011201733856008201845852000901927655001201936IND60606686820221118013255.0180727e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060668682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobroff, Vladimir10aWhat can infrared spectroscopy do for characterizing organic remnant in fossils?  ap. 443-456.  aAnalytical techniques allowed describing the morphology of fossils, up the 3D level, and more recently, molecular remains are also characterized to understand evolutionary aspects of disappeared species. The preservation of original organic components in fossils is controversial, but elucidating evolutionary processes and phylogenetic relationships is invaluable. Infrared (IR) microscopy is one of the most interesting analytical technique, due to its non-destructive utilization and its sensitivity for extracting most of the inorganic and organic information in fossils. However, utilization of IR microscopy has rapidly raised controversies in paleontology, essentially because the interpretation of spectral data remains limited to experienced spectroscopists and also due to the nature of fossilized tissues, becoming mostly inorganic after the mineralization process. This review discusses the most important discoveries made by the use of IR microscopy for the analysis of fossils and provides a comprehensive IR bands database for interpreting fossil inorganic and organic contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3afossils 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amicroscopy 3amineralization 3aphylogeny 3aspectral analysis 3atissues 0aIR spectroscopy 0aFossils 0aOrganic remnants 0aOrganics characterization 0aBiomolecules 0aKerogens 0aATR 0aFAC 0aFT-IR1 aChen, Hsiang-Hsin1 aJaverzat, Sophie1 aPetibois, Cyril0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 82 p.443-456dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012600160300001800286500002000304520149300324592002801817650001501845650001701860650001301877650001901890650001501909650002101924650002601945650001201971650001101983650001301994650001902007650002202026650001602048700001802064700002102082700001902103700002102122700002402143773011702167856007402284852000902358655001202367IND60588246920221118152043.0180103e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058824692DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.140472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Miriam10aCharacterization of a novel signal transducer element intrinsic to class IIIa/b adenylate cyclases and guanylate cyclases  ap. 1204-1217.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdenylate cyclases (ACs) are signaling proteins that produce the second messenger cAMP. Class III ACs comprise four groups (class IIIa–d) of which class IIIa and IIIb ACs have been identified in bacteria and eukaryotes. Many class IIIa ACs are anchored to membranes via hexahelical domains. In eukaryotic ACs, membrane anchors are well conserved, suggesting that this region possesses important functional characteristics that are as yet unknown. To address this question, we replaced the hexahelical membrane anchor of the mycobacterial AC Rv1625c with the hexahelical quorum‐sensing receptor from Legionella, LqsS. Using this chimera, we identified a novel 19‐amino‐acid cyclase transducer element (CTE) located N‐terminally to the catalytic domain that links receptor stimulation to effector activation. Coupling of the receptor to the AC was possible at several positions distal to the membrane exit, resulting in stimulatory or inhibitory responses to the ligand Legionella autoinducer‐1. In contrast, on the AC effector side functional coupling was only successful when starting with the CTE. Bioinformatics approaches established that distinct CTEs are widely present in class IIIa and IIIb ACs and in vertebrate guanylate cyclases. The data suggest that membrane‐delimited receiver domains transduce regulatory signals to the downstream catalytic domains in an engineered AC model system. This may suggest a previously unknown mechanism for cellular cAMP regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aactive sites 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3acyclic AMP 3aeukaryotic cells 3afunctional properties 3aligands 3amodels 3aproteins 3aquorum sensing 3asecond messengers 3avertebrates1 aBassler, Jens1 aBeltz, Stephanie1 aSchultz, Anita1 aLupas, Andrei N.1 aSchultz, Joachim E.0 tFEBS journal.g2017 Apr., v. 284, no. 8 p.1204-1217dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.140473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013700167300001600304500002000320500000900340520141800349592002801767650003401795650002001829650001301849650001201862650001501874650001101889650001301900650001401913650000801927650001801935650001201953650001101965650001801976650001301994650000902007650001002016650001002026651001002036700001802046700001802064700002002082773014602102856008402248961001302332852000902345655001202354IND60666611920221121002733.0220819e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066661192DNAL7 a10.3198/jpr2016.09.0048crgs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJessup, R.

No. GS‐785, PI 680638) was identified that possesses complete seed sterility, only rare occurrences (<0.1%) of flowering, and significantly greater mean leaf number per tiller than S. halepense. Initial collection of the hybrid was made in 2009, and subsequent evaluations were made in a collaborative effort between Texas A&M University, Texas A&M AgriLife Research, and the USDA‐ARS. Winter survival of PSH09TX15 exceeded 98% at three locations in plant hardiness zones 9a, 8b, and 8a between 2012 and 2015 with no significant differences across locations. PSH09TX15 developed significantly greater leaf numbers per tiller (≥11) and shorter rhizome derived shoot (RDS) distances (−50%) than naturalized populations of S. halepense. PSH09TX15 produced annual biomass yields not significantly different than Dekalb Sudax (‘SX‐17’) forage sorghum across three seasons (2012– 2014) at three locations (College Station, Beeville, Commerce) in Texas. Effective eradication protocols were identified for PSH09TX15 to enable crop rotations. As a high biomass genotype, PSH09TX15 provides a perennial sorghum germplasm source suitable for utilization as a hay, forage, and biofuel feedstock with risk of neither seed weed invasiveness nor hybridization with cultivated S. bicolor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aSorghum bicolor 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3aforage 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ahay 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3aoverwintering 3arhizomes 3arisk 3atrade 3aweeds 3aTexas1 aBurson, B.

Innovations change practices over time and double-hitch carriages, which allow trees to be extracted horizontally, are a recent example. This makes it feasible to harvest across terrain with limited deflection, increases the recovery of biomass, and potentially reduces high-dynamic load events associated with ground contact. In this study, a standard single-hitch carriage was compared against a new double-hitch carriage under controlled conditions. Tension was measured continuously and specific elements, such as tension when the carriage was at midspan, maximum tension at breakout and inhaul, and magnitude of cyclic tension during inhaul were identified, measured and compared against payload. While payload was similar in the treatments, the additional weight of the double-hitch carriage resulted in higher skyline tensions. In both treatments, payload and skyline tension when the carriage was at midspan were strongly correlated. Cyclic tension was reduced by the double-hitch carriage system. While a number of unique high-dynamic loads were identified that were not part of the normal extraction, they represented only 6% of the cycles and the maximum tension was similar to that experienced during break-out and inhaul. This study increased the understanding of skyline tension during logging operations and the effect of carriage type. It showed that, though tension often exceeds the safe working load of the cable, it does not exceed the endurance limit for a well-designed and operated system.  aThe research leading to these results was conducted as part of the TECH4EFFECT project.

Heavy metals contamination in coastal and marine environments is becoming an increasingly serious threat to both the naturally stressed marine ecosystems and humans that rely on marine resources for food, industry and recreation. Heavy metals are introduced to coastal and marine environments through a variety of sources and activities including sewage and industrial effluents, brine discharges, coastal modifications and oil pollution. The present paper reviews heavy metal contamination in a variety of marine organisms, and sediments, and suggests measures for environmental management of heavy metal pollution in the Arabian Gulf. Most of the reviewed literature confirmed that heavy metal concentrations in marine organisms were generally within allowable concentrations and pose no threat to public health. Likewise, studies suggested that levels of heavy metals in marine sediments are similar or lower compared to other regions. However, localized hotspots of chronic metal pollution in areas influenced by industrial facilities, desalination plants, and oil refineries have been reported. Holistic spatial and temporal monitoring and comprehensive national and regional strategies are critical to combat and manage heavy metal pollution in the Arabian Gulf.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3aenvironmental management 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3aindustrial effluents 3aindustry 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amarine resources 3amarine sediments 3amonitoring 3aoils 3apublic health 3arecreation 3asewage 3awater pollution 3aPersian Gulf 0aArabian Gulf 0aMetal pollution 0aMetal management0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2013 July 15, v. 72, no. 1 p.6-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010400163500001400267520131900281592002801600650004101628650001501669650001601684650001601700650001501716650001101731650001901742650001401761650003201775650001401807650001201821651001301833700002701846700002001873700002001893700002301913773012101936856007302057852000902130655001202139IND60732256120221120235003.0210326e20210228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073225612DNAL7 a10.3390/v130303852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenkaroun, Jessica 10aIsolation of a New Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV) Variant from a Fish Farm in Scotland  aNAL-light  aThe aquatic virus, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), is known to infect various farmed fish, in particular salmonids, and is responsible for large economic losses in the aquaculture industry. Common practices to detect the virus include qPCR tests based on specific primers and serum neutralization tests for virus serotyping. Following the potential presence of IPNV viruses in a fish farm in Scotland containing vaccinated and IPNV-resistant fish, the common serotyping of the IPNV isolates was not made possible. This led us to determine the complete genome of the new IPNV isolates in order to investigate the cause of the serotyping discrepancy. Next-generation sequencing using the Illumina technology along with the sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) approach was conducted to fully characterize the new Scottish isolates. With this approach, the full genome of two isolates, V1810–4 and V1810–6, was determined and analyzed. The potential origin of the virus isolates was investigated by phylogenetic analyses along with tridimensional and secondary protein structure analyses. These revealed the emergence of a new variant from one of the main virus serotypes, probably caused by the presence of selective pressure exerted by the vaccinated IPNV-resistant farmed fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus 3aSalmonidae 3ablood serum 3afarmed fish 3afish farms 3agenome 3aneutralization 3aphylogeny 3aprotein secondary structure 3aserotypes 3aviruses 3aScotland1 aMuir, Katherine  Fiona1 aAllshire, Rosa 1 aTamer, Cüneyt 1 aWeidmann, Manfred 0 tViruses.g2021 Feb. 28, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130303853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014400174300001400318520152800332536019201860592002802052596001402080650001402094650001502108650002202123650001202145650001302157650000902170650001802179650001702197650001702214651001102231653001202242653001702254653001402271653001102285653001202296700002502308700002302333773013502356856008602491852000902577655001202586IND60756127520221120164051.0211111e20210726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075612752DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2021.19137102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpinelli, Raffaele10aRationalization of coppice management in Mediterranean Europe: the sustainability effects of changing product strategy and technology level  ap. 53-62.  aTraditional coppice stands represent a sizable proportion of the Mediterranean forests and are generally geared to the production of firewood, which is eventually fed to traditional stoves for residential heat generation. In recent years, an alternative use has developed whereby trees are chipped whole and chips are fed to centralized heating plants. This latter system allows full mechanization of all supply chain steps and is considered more suited to modern living habits; at the same time, its introduction has raised concerns about possible new impacts on sustainability. This study presents a sustainability impact analysis (SIA) of the two systems, conducted with the Tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment (ToSIA). The results indicate that the new system is generally preferable. All indicators point at the superiority of the new system over the traditional one, except for employment potential. Compared with traditional firewood systems, the innovative system requires fewer workers, but it pays better and offers much safer workplaces. While the energy efficiency of a district heating system is not much higher than that of modern firewood stoves, the larger centralized plant can be fitted with better filters and emits much less particulate matter, which makes it especially suited to support development at a local level. Even if mechanized cutting caused a 20% reduction of coppice yields – which has yet to be proven – the new system would still prove more sustainable than the traditional one.  aThis research received funding from the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 720757.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo 720757 3acoppicing 3aemployment 3aenergy efficiency 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aheat 3amechanization 3aparticulates 3asupply chain 3aEurope 0afelling 0aregeneration 0aemissions 0aenergy 0abiomass1 aMagagnotti, Natascia1 aTuomasjukka, Diana0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2021 July 26, v. 32, no.

It presents great genetic and biological variability that plays an important role in the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease. Our working hypothesis is that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi has an important impact on detection of the parasite using diagnostic techniques. The present study evaluated the diagnostic performance of parasitological, molecular, and serological techniques for detecting 27 strains of T. cruzi that belonged to discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI (11 strains), TcII (four strains), and TcIV (12 strains) that were obtained from different hosts in the states of Amazonas and Paraná, Brazil. Blood samples were taken from experimentally infected mice and analyzed by fresh blood examination, hemoculture in Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polymerase chain reaction presented the best detection of TcI, with 80.4% positivity. For all of the detection methods, the animals that were inoculated with TcII presented the highest positivity rates (94.1–100%). ELISA that was performed 7 months after inoculation presented a higher detection ability (95.4%) for TcIV. Intra-DTU comparisons showed that the reproducibility of the majority of the results that were obtained with the different methods was weak for TcI and good for TcII and TcIV. Our data indicate that the detection capability of different techniques varies with the DTUs of the parasites in mammalian blood. The implications of these findings with regard to the diagnosis of human T. cruzi infection are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aetiological agents 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aliver 3amice 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aBrazil 3aLatin America 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aMice 0aDTU 0aHemoculture 0aPCR 0aELISA1 aPaula de Abreu, Ana1 aGruendling, Ana Paula1 aBahia, Maria Terezinha1 aGomes, Mônica Lúcia1 aMarques de Araújo, Silvana1 aJean de Ornelas Toledo, Max0 tExperimental parasitology.g2016 July, v. 166 p.44-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2016.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245018300162520123800345592002801583650002601611650002701637650002701664650002601691650002901717650001001746650001701756650001901773650002701792650001601819650001901835650002301854650003701877650001001914650002501924650001901949653002401968653001801992653002002010653001202030653001402042653002802056653003402084700002002118700001702138700001502155700001702170700001802187700001802205773013002223856008402353852000902437655001202446IND60760332720221119140402.0220110e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076033272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1029022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qiao10aAntibacterial mechanisms of thyme essential oil nanoemulsions against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus: Alterations in membrane compositions and characteristics  aIn this study, the antibacterial activities of thyme essential oil nanoemulsions (TEON) prepared by ultrasonication (US) and high-pressure homogenization (HPH) were evaluated via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and time-killing curve analyses. TEON-US presented superior bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, which was found to be correlated with its better physicochemical characteristics (including smaller droplet size and higher zeta potential) compared to TEON-HPH. The underlying antibacterial mechanisms were specifically investigated targeting cell membranes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Gram-negative bacterium) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium). Thereinto, membrane disintegrations were observed followed by massive leakage of cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, the membrane dysfunctions (involving membrane potential depolarization and fluidity reduction) were likely associated with the modifications seen in the fatty acid composition upon TEONs exposure, and ultimately causing bacterial death. These results deciphered the mode of antibacterial action of TEONs, providing a critical theoretical basis for their future application in food matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3adeath 3adroplet size 3aessential oils 3afatty acid composition 3afood matrix 3ahomogenization 3amembrane potential 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3athyme 3aultrasonic treatment 3azeta potential 0aThyme essential oil 0aNanoemulsions 0aUltrasonication 0aE. coli 0aS. aureus 0aAntibacterial mechanism 0aCell membrane characteristics1 aZhang, Lianjiao1 aYang, Zhehao1 aDing, Tian1 aYe, Xingqian1 aLiu, Donghong1 aGuo, Mingming0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2022 Jan., v. 75 p.102902-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1029023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001300254520150500267592002801772650001001800650001401810650001801824650001401842650001001856650001601866650001501882650002601897650001801923650001301941650001801954650002501972651001001997651001702007653002702024653001502051653002102066653001702087653001902104653001502123700001802138700001602156700002102172700002402193700001702217700001502234773010502249856008202354852000902436655001202445IND50067813920221117181238.0190403e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006781392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2013.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Xiaoming10aManaging mepiquat chloride and plant density for optimal yield and quality of cotton  ap. 1-10.  aThe growth regulator mepiquat chloride (MC) is used in cotton production across the globe to control plant growth and maximize yield and quality of cotton. With the conversion from hand picking to mechanical harvesting in China, plant densities are increased, and more compact plants are required, leading to the need to reconsider MC application schedules. Experiments were carried out in 2009 and 2010 to identify optimal use schedules of MC at four plant densities: 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 and 7.5plantsm−2. Eleven MC schedules were compared with respect to their effect on cotton yield and quality. Application of MC at squaring stage or at both squaring and flowering stages significantly improved cotton quality parameters: fiber length (by 1.7%) and fiber strength (by 2.8%) at all tested plant densities without significant loss of yields. However, average lint yield of all MC treatments over all densities and years was decreased by 4.6% due to a decrease in boll density and lint percentage which was only partly offset by an increase in boll weight. No effects on yield were also observed if MC applications were started at flowering stage, but such later starting application schedules only slightly improved fiber quality. The results suggest that use of MC at squaring or at both squaring and flowering stages is a viable strategy to improve cotton architecture, productivity and quality at high plant density in mechanized cotton production in the Yellow River cotton growing region in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3abolls 3achlorides 3afiber quality 3aflowering 3ahands 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3amechanical harvesting 3amechanization 3amepiquat 3aplant density 3aplant growth control 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aPlant growth regulator 0aLint yield 0aYield components 0aFiber length 0aFiber strength 0aMicronaire1 aZhang, Lizhen1 aDu, Mingwei1 aEvers, Jochem B.1 avan der Werf, Wopke1 aTian, Xiaoli1 aLi, Zhaohu0 tField crops research.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 149 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012800175520098000303592002801283650002101311650001901332650001401351650001701365650001901382650001201401650001701413650001101430650001801441650001801459653001001477653001101487653002901498653002701527653002201554700002901576700003401605700002201639773013001661856008401791852000901875655001201884IND60760332920221119135928.0220110e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076033292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1029062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Fuente, Carla I.A.10aCasting and extrusion processes to produce bio-based plastics using cassava starch modified by the dry heat treatment (DHT)  aAlthough the number of studies focused on bio-based plastics is constantly rising, an important challenge to overcome is migrating from casting to extrusion, an industrially scalable method of production. In this work, we studied starch modification by dry heating treatment (DHT) and the production of cassava starch films or sheets, by casting or extrusion processes, respectively. The molecular changes promoted by the DHT process resulted in a new matrix. Furthermore, the slower drying in casting, and the faster drying in extrusion, promoted different molecular arrangements, which affected the material performance. The main results showed that DHT for 4 h in cassava starch produced bio-based plastics with increased mechanical properties and opacity while decreasing water permeability, moisture content and light transmittance. In conclusion, DHT showed to be an interesting alternative to produce biodegradable plastics with potential use in different industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acassava starch 3aextrusion 3afood science 3aheat treatment 3aopacity 3apermeability 3astarch 3atransmittance 3awater content 0aFilms 0aSheets 0aBiodegradable composites 0aBiodegradable plastics 0aBiobased plastics1 ado Val Siqueira, Larissa1 aAugusto, Pedro Esteves Duarte1 aTadini, Carmen C.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2022 Jan., v. 75 p.102906-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1029063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011700171300001600288520131000304592002801614650001901642650001501661650001501676650001501691650001601706650001601722650001001738650001501748650001101763650002301774650001801797650002001815650002101835653000801856653001001864653000801874653001001882653000801892653001001900653000801910653001001918653001501928653001501943653003101958653002001989653001302009700002102022700002302043700002402066773011202090856008402202852000902286655001202295IND60581601820221121024802.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058160182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2017.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGitelson, Anatoly10aIn situ optical properties of foliar flavonoids: Implication for non-destructive estimation of flavonoid content  ap. 258-264.  aFlavonoids are a ubiquitous multifunctional group of phenolics of paramount importance for the terrestrial plants involved in protection from biotic and abiotic stresses, color and chemical signaling and other functions. Deciphering of in situ absorption of foliar Flv is important but was thought to be impossible due to a strong overlap with other pigments, complex in situ chemistry of Flv and sophisticated leaf optics.We deduced in situ absorbance of foliar Flv and introduced a concept of specific absorbance spectrum indicative of each pigment group contribution to light absorption and provided a rationale for the choice of spectral bands for non-destructive assessment of Flv in leaves with variable content of other pigments including anthocyanins.Only a narrow band 400–430nm was suitable for Flv assessment, however the effect of other pigments remained substantial, so subtraction of their contribution was necessary. The devised leaf absorbance-based algorithm allowed estimating Flv with error below 21%.Absorption by Flv in plant tissues might extend into the blue and can be commensurate to that of chlorophylls and carotenoids. The potential capacity of Flv to shield the cell in situ from the visible light might be essential for assessments of high light stress tolerance of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aalgorithms 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aflavonoids 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant tissues 3aplants (botany) 3astress tolerance 0aAnC 0a[AnC] 0aCar 0a[Car] 0aChl 0a[Chl] 0aFlv 0a[Flv] 0aAbsorbance 0aFlavonoids 0aNon-destructive estimation 0aPhotoprotection 0aPigments1 aChivkunova, Olga1 aZhigalova, Tatiana1 aSolovchenko, Alexei0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Nov., v. 218 p.258-264dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2017.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300002000271500001900291520113500310592002801445650001401473650002201487650002601509650001601535650001301551650001401564650001701578650001301595700002201608700001901630700002201649700001601671700001701687700006001704700001701764700002701781773016901808856008301977852000902060655001202069IND60696383820221118015236.0201101e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069638382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05211-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahin, Nuzhat10aNanoparticles and its biomedical applications in health and diseases: special focus on drug delivery  ap. 19151-19168.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanotechnology is an emerging technology that deals with nanosized particles possessing crucial research roles and application. Disciplines like chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, materials science, and health sciences provide an accumulated knowledge of nanotechnology. Nonetheless, it has vast submissions precisely in biology, electronics, and medicine. Aimed at drug delivery system, nanoparticles are based on the mechanism of entrapment of the drugs or biomolecules into the interior structure of the particles; another mechanism could be that the drugs or the biomolecules can be absorbed onto the exterior surfaces of the particles. Currently, nanoparticles (NPs) are used in the delivery of drugs, proteins, genes, vaccines, polypeptides, nucleic acids, etc. In recent years, various applications of the drug delivery system via NPs have encountered an enormous position sector like pharmaceutical, medical, biological, and others.

The mode of actions were also studied by electronmicoscopy, enzyme assay, outer and inner membrane permeabilisation. The results showed that these strains were positive in the ESBL–ampC genes combination by multiplex PCR. These findings were confirmed by MICs that these strains were resistant to ceftazidime, cefepime and flomoxef at >1024, 16–24, >256μg/ml respectively, while susceptible to imipenem at 1–2μg/ml. The synergistic activity was observed at ceftazidime plus either apigenin or naringenin combinations with FIC indixes between <0.01 and <0.27 against these strains, whereas ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid or quercetin did not exhibit synergy. The modulation of ceftazidime-resistance by apigenin or narigenin significantly enhanced the activities of ceftazidime. The 5,7-OH group of A ring and one 4′-OH group of the B ring in apigenin and naringenin are important for synergistic activity. Viable counts showed that the killing of ceftazidime-resistant E. cloacae DMST 21394 (CREC) cells by 3μg/ml ceftazidime was potentiated by 3μg/ml apigenin to low levels (103cfu/ml) over 6h. Electronmicroscopy clearly showed that ceftazidime 3μg/ml in combination with 3μg/ml of apigenin also caused marked morphological damage of cell wall, cell shape and plasma membrane of this strain. Enzymes assays indicated that apigenin showed marked inhibitory activity against penicillinase type IV from E. cloacae. The results for outer membrane (OM) permeabilization in both nitrocefin (NCF) assay and crystal violet uptake showed that the combination of ceftazidime plus apigenin significantly altered OM permeabilisation of CREC compared to control or single treatment of these agents. Both o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG) uptake and release of UV-absorbing material concentrations results exhibited that ceftazidime and apigenin combination damaged CREC cytoplasmic membrane (CM) and caused subsequent leakage of intracellular constituents. From the results, it can be concluded that apigenin and naringenin have the synergistic effect with ceftazidime to reverse bacterial resistance to this cephalosporin against CREC. This activity may be involved three mechanisms of action by apigenin. The first is on the peptidoglycan synthesis inhibition. The second mechanism is inhibition the activity of certain β-lactamase enzymes. The third mode of action is alteration of OM and CM permeabilization. Apigenin and naringenin have a sufficient margin of safety for therapeutic use. For this reason, apigenin and naringenin offer for the development of a valuable adjunct to ceftazidime against CREC, which currently almost cephalosporins resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aapigenin 3abeta-lactamase 3aceftazidime 3acell walls 3aclavulanic acid 3agenes 3agentian violet 3aimipenem 3amargin of safety 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anaringenin 3apeptidoglycans 3aplasma membrane 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquercetin 3asynergism 0aApigenin 0aNaringenin 0aCeftazidime 0aCeftazidime-resistant E. cloacae 0aSynergistic activity 0aMechanism of action1 aChukrathok, Somnuk0 tPhytomedicine.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 20 p.262-269dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009600164300001600260520144800276592002801724650003101752650001501783650002601798650002001824650001701844650001401861650001601875650001101891650002201902650001001924650002001934650003701954650001401991650000902005650002102014650002002035650001902055650002202074650002402096650001302120650002602133653001002159653001402169700005702183773010702240856008302347852000902430655001202439IND60763173120221122171445.0220124s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076317312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crfs.2022.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wu-Joo10aProtocatechuic acid protects hepatocytes against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress  ap. 222-227.  aOxidative stress is a main cause of tissue damage and highly associated with incidence of human chronic diseases. Among the major target organs attacked by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the liver. Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is a phenolic compound found in green tea, acai oil and some mushroom species that possesses strong antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity and may have benefits as a natural phytochemical for prevention of human diseases. However, the protective effect of PCA on hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-induced oxidative stress specifically in the liver has not yet been investigated. The current study aims to observe if PCA possesses protective activity against H₂O₂-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 human liver cancer cells. Relative to untreated control cells, treatment of HepG2 cells with PCA reduced H₂O₂-induced cell death and mitigated H₂O₂-induced production of ROS; furthermore, it mitigated the H₂O₂-induced increase of caspase-3/7 enzyme activity, expression of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress genes including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α) and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). These findings indicate that PCA effectively protects hepatic cells from H₂O₂-induced oxidative stress and cell death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell death 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3afood science 3agreen tea 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amushrooms 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorylation 3aphytochemicals 3aprotective effect 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aresearch 3atranscription factors 0aHepG2 0aApoptosis1 aLee, Seong-Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5876-13960 tCurrent research in food science.g2022, v. 5 p.222-227dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27271x2665-92717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2022.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001600289520133900305592002801644650001201672650002301684650001101707650000901718650001101727650001501738650001401753650001801767650002201785650001801807650001101825650001901836700002101855700001901876700002101895773010101916856008102017852000902098655001202107IND60515231320221121043643.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051523132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-015-0791-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaporte, Martin10aGenetic evidence of recent migration among isolated-by-sea populations of the freshwater blenny (Salaria fluviatilis)  ap. 389-399.  aGenetic diversity is the raw material for evolutionary change, so a species’ capacity to maintain its genetic diversity is a major concern in conservation genetics. Although genetic diversity within a population is reduced through time by genetic drift, gene flow among populations can act to recover or add new genetic variants. The goal of this study was to infer potential connectivity among isolated-by-sea populations of the vulnerable freshwater blenny (Salaria fluviatilis) and to determine if gene flow could contribute to maintaining genetic diversity in connected populations. Four genetic clusters (one small at the North, one large at the South for both East and West coasts) were detected with different clustering methods (FLOCK, STUCTURE, UPGMA, AMOVA). The two larger genetic clusters with higher migration-rate estimates among localities had higher genetic diversity and allelic richness and lower relatedness between individuals, compared to isolated localities found in smaller clusters. Our results also suggest that sea currents may facilitate fish movements among neighbouring rivers. Overall, gene flow among isolated-by-sea but close rivers could maintain the evolutionary potential of freshwater blenny populations. This finding should be considered when elaborating a conservation program for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalaria 3aat-risk population 3acoasts 3afish 3aflocks 3afreshwater 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3araw materials 3arivers 3awater currents1 aPerrier, Charles1 aMagnan, Pierre1 aBerrebi, Patrick0 tConservation genetics.g2016 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.389-399dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-015-0791-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016700166300001400333520130200347592002801649650001201677650001601689650001101705650002501716650002101741650001501762650002001777650001401797650001801811650001701829653004301846653002501889653002001914653000801934653003001942700005701972700005502029773012202084856008202206852000902288655001202297IND60599854320221118174354.0180702e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059985432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Swati10aPorous glassy carbon formed by rapid pyrolysis of phenol-formaldehyde resins and its performance as electrode material for electrochemical double layer capacitors  ap. 12-18.  aIn this article, we report a modified pyrolysis technique featuring an ultra-fast pyrolysis for obtaining a new type of high surface area glassy carbon (GC) from lithographically patterned novolac type phenol-formaldehyde resin, SU8. The fast-pyrolysis chemistry of SU8 is responsible for the formation of bubbles in the carbonizing matrix, which ultimately leads to the observed morphological changes. This porous glassy carbon (PGC) pyrolyzed at a heating rate of 50°C/min has been evaluated as an electrode material for electrochemical double layer capacitors employing electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. The electrochemically available surface area of PGC electrodes is found to be ∼3 times greater compared with flat GC electrodes, and the electrode and specific capacitance improvements are 15 and 5 times, respectively. We describe possible mechanisms that may influence the enhanced capacitor performance of PGC electrodes, and compare their capacitance at five different potential scan rates ranging from 5 to 75mV/s. In addition, the effect of H2SO4 surface treatment on the electrochemistry of the thus pyrolyzed carbons is investigated. Other possible applications of the thus obtained PGC are also discussed in the concluding remarks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aphenolic resins 3apyrolysis 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 0aElectrochemical double layer capacitor 0aPorous glassy carbon 0aRapid pyrolysis 0aSU8 0aPhenol-formaldehyde resin1 aKamath, Rahul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3832-73511 aMadou, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4847-31170 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 July, v. 108 p.12-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012500180300001600305520130600321536007901627592002801706596005101734650002101785650001401806650001801820650002501838650001301863650001801876651001101894653002801905653002601933653002601959700003401985773012902019856008602148852000902234655001202243IND60756128020221120174838.0211111e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075612802DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2021.19100162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutcliffe, Thomas Edward10aDomesticating circular economy? An enquiry into Norwegian subnational authorities’ process of implementing circularity  ap. 752-765.  aThis article focuses on the introduction of the concept of circular economy into a Norwegian context by concentrating on two levels of subnational authorities against the backdrop of the national level. By drawing on recorded qualitative data collected in the region of Trøndelag and Oslo, we deploy the concept of domestication to analyse how the diffusion of CE as a political, future-oriented concept is appropriated, i.e. through symbolic, practical and cognitive dimensions. Additionally, we consider the performativity of the future as a component in the adoption of the concept. Our findings suggest that the adoption of CE at these levels of governments in Norway is an ongoing process where the co-construction of the dimensions happens concurrently. Relating to the future, the national level takes a translative approach and goes after an increased interest and activity by private actors. At the first subnational level, in the case of the Trøndelag county, the public sector operates as a channel between knowledge of best practices and private actors who can mobilise action. Meanwhile, at the third subnational level, we find at the municipality of Trondheim, a public authority that proactively changes specific practices and regulates (or normalizes) the CE through their own means.  aThis work was supported by Norges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorges Teknisk-Naturvitenskapelige Universitet 3acircular economy 3acognition 3adomestication 3aenvironmental policy 3apolitics 3apublic sector 3aNorway 0asubnational authorities 0apolicy implementation 0afuture performativity1 aOrtega Alvarado, Isaac Arturo0 tJournal of environmental policy & planning.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 23, no. 6 p.752-765dRoutledgewJournal:12207x1522-72007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2021.19100163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011100203300001800314520171000332592002802042596005902070596005902129596004702188650003702235650002802272650002602300650002502326650001702351650001902368650001702387650001002404650001202414650002402426650001702450650001402467650002002481650002902501650002302530700001702553700001702570700001602587700001202603700002102615700001602636700001502652700001602667700001702683773014602700856008102846852000902927655001202936IND60615881320221120062952.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061588132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-9295-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Zhanqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0607-424110aEstablishment of a baculovirus-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for antiviral research in transgenic silkworms  ap. 9255-9265.  aThe CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful genetic engineering technique that has been widely used in gene therapy, as well as in the development of novel antimicrobials and transgenic insects. However, several challenges, including the lack of effective host target genes and the off-target effects, limit the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in insects. To mitigate these difficulties, we established a highly efficient virus-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in transgenic silkworms. This system includes the baculovirus-inducible promoter 39K, which directs transcription of the gene encoding, the Cas9 protein, and the U6 promoter which targets the sgATAD3A site of the ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3 (ATAD3A) gene. The double-positive transgenic line sgATAD3A×39K-Cas9 (ATAD3A-KO) was obtained by hybridization; antiviral activity in this hybrid transgenic line is induced only after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. The BmNPV-inducible system significantly reduced off-target effects and did not affect the economically important characteristics of the transgenic silkworms. Most importantly, this novel system efficiently and consistently edited target genes, inhibiting BmNPV replication after the transgenic silkworms were inoculated with occlusion bodies (OBs). The suppression of BmNPV by the virus-inducible system was comparable to that of the stably expressed CRISPR/Cas9 system. Therefore, we successfully established a highly efficient BmNPV-inducible ATAD3A-KO transgenic silkworm line, with improved gene targeting specificity and antiviral efficiency. Our study thereby provides insights into the treatment of infectious diseases and into the control of insect pests.  aPublisher supplied data  a31472153cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572466cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS-18cChina Agriculture Research System 3aBombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aanti-infective agents 3aantiviral properties 3agene editing 3agene targeting 3agene therapy 3agenes 3ahybrids 3ainfectious diseases 3ainsect pests 3asilkworms 3astable isotopes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic insects1 aHuang, Liang1 aDong, Feifan1 aHu, Zhigang1 aQin, Qi1 aLong, Jiangqiong1 aCao, Mingya1 aChen, Peng1 aLü, Cheng,1 aPan, Min-Hui0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Nov., v. 102, no. 21 p.9255-9265dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9295-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245010900179300001400288520102400302592002801326650002001354650001901374650002601393650001301419650000901432650001001441650001901451650002001470650001101490650001301501650002001514653002601534653002001560653001601580653001901596653002401615700002101639700002501660700002201685700002001707700002601727773012701753856008801880852000901968655001201977IND60088599420221120124527.0190318e20130715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008859942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLerebours, Adélaïde10aAdvanced diagnostics applied to fish liver tumours: Relating pathology to underlying molecular aetiology  ap. 94-98.  aLiver tumours in flatfish have been diagnosed using histopathology for decades in order to monitor the impacts of marine pollution in coastal and estuarine environments.

This approach facilitates the use of wild flatfish as a model of environmentally-induced tumourigenesis, and has wide applicability to any disease pathology for which the underpinning molecular aetiology is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimanda limanda 3acarcinogenesis 3adiagnostic techniques 3aetiology 3afish 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3aliver neoplasms 3amodels 3asampling 3awater pollution 0aLaser microdissection 0aFrozen sections 0aFish cancer 0aTumourigenesis 0aRetinoblastoma gene1 aBignell, John P.1 aStentiford, Grant D.1 aFeist, Stephen W.1 aLyons, Brett P.1 aRotchell, Jeanette M.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2013 July 15, v. 72, no. 1 p.94-98dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245014200181300001600323520138500339592002801724650002201752650002701774650001201801650002501813650002501838650001101863650002201874650003001896650002301926650001501949650001701964650001301981650001201994650003702006653000702043653000802050653000802058653000802066653000802074653000902082653000702091653002402098653002602122653002302148653002602171653001302197700002602210700001802236700001902254700001802273700001802291700002402309773011202333856008402445852000902529655001202538IND60581602120221121024846.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058160212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2017.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel-Saz, Néstor Fernández10aRespiratory ATP cost and benefit of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis with Nicotiana tabacum at different growth stages and under salinity  ap. 243-248.  aGrowth and maintenance partly depend on both respiration and ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation in leaves. Under stress, ATP is needed to maintain the accumulated biomass. ATP production mostly proceeds from the cytochrome oxidase pathway (COP), while respiration via the alternative oxidase pathway (AOP) may decrease the production of ATP per oxygen consumed, especially under phosphorus (P) limitation and salinity conditions. Symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is reputed by their positive effect on plant growth under stress at mature stages of colonization; however, fungal colonization may decrease plant growth at early stages. Thus, the present research is based on the hypothesis that AM fungus colonization will increase both foliar respiration and ATP production at mature stages of plant growth while decreasing them both at early stages. We used the oxygen-isotope-fractionation technique to study the in vivo respiratory activities and ATP production of the COP and AOP in AM and non-AM (NM) tobacco plants grown under P-limiting and saline conditions in sand at different growth stages (14, 28 and 49days). Our results suggest that AM symbiosis represents an ATP cost detrimental for shoot growth at early stages, whilst it represents a benefit on ATP allowing for faster rates of growth at mature stages, even under salinity conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiomass 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adevelopmental stages 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxygen consumption 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3atobacco 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aAM 0aAOP 0aAOX 0aCOP 0aCOX 0amETC 0aUQ 0aAlternative oxidase 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza 0aCytochrome oxidase 0aPhosphorus deficiency 0aSalinity1 aRomero-Munar, Antonia1 aAlonso, David1 aAroca, Ricardo1 aBaraza, Elena1 aFlexas, Jaume1 aRibas-Carbo, Miquel0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2017 Nov., v. 218 p.243-248dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2017.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245011100198300001600309500002000325520164800345592002801993596006702021650002302088650001202111650001702123650001302140650000902153650001702162650001802179650002302197650000902220650001702229650001202246650001602258650001902274650001202293650000902305650002302314650002802337650002202365650001602387650001502403650001302418650000902431651001202440700002002452700002202472700001902494700002602513773015002539856007402689852000902763655001202772IND60677431620221117235559.0191128e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067743162DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.100672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnitha, Seetha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7393-548910aPotential for smart food products in rural Myanmar: use of millets and pigeonpea to fill the nutrition gap  ap. 394-400.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The present study examined the potential for ‘Smart Food’ with respect to contributing to the Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ending malnutrition by 2030, using a small‐scale capacity building case study in Oe Be Village, Myingyan district, Mandalay region, Myanmar. Within the study site, refined white rice is the major staple, followed by vegetables and animal source food in inadequate quantities. The protein intake in this particular dry zone community meets only 50% of the daily requirement and even less for those children aged less than 23 months. Therefore, to determine the acceptance and opportunity for legumes and millets which are produced locally, nutritious formulations were introduced for various age groups. In addition, a sensory evaluation of the recipes was conducted to test the acceptance of the nutritious products. RESULTS: Two weeks of the inclusion of millets and pigeonpea in the diets of children aged 6–23 months had a positive impact on wasting, stunting and underweight (P = 0.002, 0.014 and 0.023, respectively). Moreover, the acceptability of these new food products by the children was found to be high. These results indicate an unexplored opportunity for specific millets rich in iron, zinc and calcium, as well as for pigeonpea rich in protein, if prepared in a culturally acceptable way. CONCLUSION: The impact and acceptability of this small scale and short‐term intervention indicate the potential for Smart Food products in filling the nutrition gap arising from the traditional food consumption habits in the dry zones of Myanmar. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government 3aanimal-based foods 3acalcium 3acase studies 3achildren 3adiet 3adry climates 3aeating habits 3agrowth retardation 3airon 3amalnutrition 3amillets 3apigeon peas 3aprotein intake 3arecipes 3arice 3asensory evaluation 3asustainable development 3atraditional foods 3aunderweight 3avegetables 3avillages 3azinc 3aMyanmar1 aHtut, Thyn Thyn1 aTsusaka, Takuji W1 aJalagam, Ashok1 aKane‐Potaka, Joanna0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 100, no. 1 p.394-400dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.100673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245007200160300001200232520132500244592002801569650001701597650001901614650002901633650002201662650001201684650001601696650002201712650001201734700001901746700002601765700002101791700002001812700002101832700001701853700001601870700002001886773009901906856007802005852000902083655001202092IND60132736920221119104129.0150511e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013273692DNAL7 a10.1051/forest/20091072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCox, Filipa12aA leap forward in geographic scale for forest ectomycorrhizal fungi  ap. 200.  aCONCLUSION: The functionally critical role of mycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems, and the imminent threat of climate change that may act to alter mycorrhizal functional biodiversity, means there is an urgent need for a regional to continental-scale assessment of mycorrhizal distributions. Until recently, it had not been possible to cost-effectively assess mycorrhizas precisely and accurately. A large-scale survey of ICP Forests plots would be only the first stage in answering many of the questions outlined above, but it is essential if future studies are going to address these questions with hypothesis-driven research in a cohesive manner, rather than remain independent for lack of a unified approach. The chance to utilise the vast network of biomonitoring plots at this time is a remarkable opportunity because it minimises the logistics and costs associated with achieving such an enormous effort and provides a rare stable — past and future — ground for forest ecosystem scientific investigation. In the face of rapid global change, we finally have an opportunity to accurately integrate mycorrhizal distribution data with long-term environmental monitoring, providing a basic understanding of functionally crucial organisms, and at the same time creating an invaluable resource for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asurveys1 aBarsoum, Nadia1 aBidartondo, Martin I.1 aBørja, Isabella1 aLilleskov, Erik1 aNilsson, Lars O.1 aRautio, Pasi1 aTubby, Kath1 aVesterdal, Lars0 tAnnals of forest science.g2010 Jan., v. 67, no. 2 p.200-200dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest/20091073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245019300174300001600367520167300383592002802056650002702084650001202111650002302123650001202146650002502158650002002183650002202203650002602225650001502251650001902266650002702285650002102312650001402333650001102347650001002358650001002368650001302378651001102391700003902402700002902441700002902470700002702499700004102526773010102567856008102668852000902749655001202758IND60515231620221121043617.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051523162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-015-0793-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina-Macedo, Luciano10aUsing genetic diversity and mating system parameters estimated from genetic markers to determine strategies for the conservation of Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Kuntze (Araucariaceae)  ap. 413-423.  aIn order to understand the impacts of forest fragmentation on Araucaria angustifolia populations, we evaluated the genetic diversity and mating system using SSR markers and open-pollinated seeds from four populations of varying sizes and spatial isolation, in and around one of the best-conserved Araucaria Forest remnants in Southern Brazil. The four population types of A. angustifolia include: (1) a continuous forest; (2) a physically isolated cluster located 2 km from the continuous forest; (3) an open population in a field located between the cluster and continuous forest; and (4) a fragment on a private property located 5 km from the cluster. Approximately 28 seeds were collected from ten reproductive trees in each population. We found higher amounts of alleles (113) and exclusive alleles (25) in the continuous forest than in the other populations. The multilocus paternity correlation was significantly higher and effective number of pollen donors was significantly lower in the private population, decreasing the diversity and consequently the variance effective size of families sampled from that population. However, despite its isolation from the other studied fragments, the private population had the second highest number of alleles as well as unique alleles from the other populations. Therefore, strategies for A. angustifolia conservation should focus not only on larger populations, such as those found in protected areas, but also include smaller and isolated fragments on private properties as these populations are able to maintain high levels of genetic diversity and functional connectivity between isolated stands across a landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aalleles 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3amating systems 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aopen pollination 3apaternity 3apollen 3aseeds 3atrees 3avariance 3aBrazil1 ade Lacerda, André Eduardo Biscaia1 aSebbenn, Alexandre Magno1 aRibeiro, Juliana Zanetti1 aSoccol, Carlos Ricardo1 aBittencourt, Juliana Vitoria Messias0 tConservation genetics.g2016 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.413-423dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-015-0793-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245023800172300001600410500001500426520134300441592002801784650001501812650001801827650001201845650002601857650001301883650001901896650002901915650002801944653002701972700002001999700002002019773010602039856005502145852000902200655001202209IND50064391320221120112306.0130328e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006439132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01631.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkita, Risako10aPolygonum sachalinense alters the balance between capacities of regeneration and carboxylation of ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate in response to growth CO₂ increment but not the nitrogen allocation within the photosynthetic apparatus  ap. 404-412.  a2019-12-06  aThe limiting step of photosynthesis changes depending on CO₂ concentration and, in theory, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at a respective CO₂ concentration is maximized if nitrogen is redistributed from non‐limiting to limiting processes. It has been shown that some plants increase the capacity of ribulose‐1,5‐bisphoshate (RuBP) regeneration (evaluated as Jₘₐₓ) relative to the RuBP carboxylation capacity (evaluated as Vcₘₐₓ) at elevated CO₂, which is in accord with the theory. However, there is no study that tests whether this change is accompanied by redistribution of nitrogen in the photosynthetic apparatus. We raised a perennial plant, Polygonum sachalinense, at two nutrient availabilities under two CO₂ concentrations. The Jₘₐₓ to Vcₘₐₓ ratio significantly changed with CO₂ increment but the nitrogen allocation among the photosynthetic apparatus did not respond to growth CO₂. Enzymes involved in RuBP regeneration might be more activated at elevated CO₂, leading to the higher Jₘₐₓ to Vcₘₐₓ ratio. Our result suggests that nitrogen partitioning is not responsive to elevated CO₂ even in species that alters the balance between RuBP regeneration and carboxylation. Nitrogen partitioning seems to be conservative against changes in growth CO₂ concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aperennials 3acarboxylation 3aenzymes 3anutrient availability 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aReynoutria sachalinensis 3anutrient use efficiency 0aFallopia sachalinensis1 aKamiyama, Chiho1 aHikosaka, Kouki0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2012 Dec., v. 146, no. 4 p.404-412dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01631.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245014200200300001600342500002000358520146300378592002801841596008101869596005901950596008102009596007302090650001302163650001902176650003402195650002002229650001402249650001402263650002702277650000902304650001402313650001602327650000802343700002002351700002202371700001402393700001802407700001802425700002102443700001902464773015002483856007402633852000902707655001202716IND60677431720221117235711.0191128e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067743172DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.100112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Chuan‐yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9526-963X10aEvaluation of the feasibility of short‐term electrodialysis for separating naturally occurring fluoride from instant brick tea infusion  ap. 168-176.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Removing excessive naturally occurring fluoride from tea and/or infusions is difficult because the process has low efficiency and causes secondary pollution. In this study, a novel electrodialysis (ED) technology was developed. We examined the effect of crucial parameters (electrolyte concentration, operation voltage, ED duration and initial concentration of the tea infusion) on defluoridation performance using a highly efficient ion‐exchange membrane with five‐compartment cells. RESULTS: The most effective ED system results were obtained at an electrolyte concentration of 10 g kg⁻¹ and operating voltage of 20 V. Moreover, the fluoride removal capacity (10.70–66.93%) was highly dependent on the ED duration (1–15 min) and initial concentration of the tea infusion (0.5–10 g kg⁻¹). The longer the ED duration and the lower the initial concentration, the higher was the defluoridation performance. During ED, limited loss of the main inclusions (total polyphenols, catechins, caffeine and selected ions) was observed. Furthermore, the D201 anion resin‐filled ED stack (0.5–5 g) and improvement of concentrate compartment electrolyte (≥5 times the dilute compartment electrolyte) in the ED system enhanced the defluoridation rate significantly. CONCLUSION: ED is a potentially effective method that can be used for defluoridation in the deep processing of tea products. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐19cModern Agro‐industry Technology Research System in Tea Industry  a31700610cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  ayj2017‐26cScientific Research Foundation of Anhui Agricultural University  a18030801104cScience and Technology Major projects of Anhui Province 3acaffeine 3adefluoridation 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodialysis 3aflavanols 3afluorides 3aion-exchange membranes 3aions 3apollution 3apolyphenols 3atea1 aLiu, Hai‐feng1 aQiao, Huan‐huan1 aLuo, Jing1 aLiu, Xi‐min1 aHou, Ru‐yan1 aWan, Xiao‐chun1 aCai, Hui‐mei0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 100, no. 1 p.168-176dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.100113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012000175300001600295520090700311592002801218650002501246650002001271650001401291650000901305650001501314651001101329653002001340653002001360653001001380653001801390653002001408700001801428700002101446773012901467856008601596852000901682655001201691IND60756128320221120161622.0211111e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075612832DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2021.19100212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrmerod, Kerri Jean14aThe geography of trust: understanding differences in perceptions of risk, water resources, and regional development  ap. 766-780.  aThis article draws on cultural theory of risk to explore public perceptions of trust in groups that provide information about water in the Reno-Sparks region of northern Nevada, USA. We survey 474 respondents, and using mixed-methods analysis, critically examine perceptions of trust in 12 sources to provide accurate information about water resources. Factor analysis reveals that respondents shared similar values of trust in several sources, which we categorize as: elected local officials, ancillary safeguards, local water and sanitation utilities, and supplemental sources. We then explored subregional variation in trust and local context, gleaned from open-ended responses. In conclusion, we find in the Reno-Sparks region as a whole there is general mistrust in elected local officials, however these perceptions are complicated by local context with some subregions more trusting than others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental policy 3afactor analysis 3ageography 3arisk 3asanitation 3aNevada 0aCultural theory 0arisk perception 0atrust 0amixed-methods 0areclaimed water1 aKelley, Scott1 aRedman, Samantha0 tJournal of environmental policy & planning.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 23, no. 6 p.766-780dRoutledgewJournal:12207x1522-72007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2021.19100213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011400169300001600283520142700299592002801726650000801754650001801762650002001780650001501800650003701815650002201852650001401874650001501888650001601903650002701919650001401946650001401960651002301974651001701997651001702014651001202031700002502043700002502068700002402093700002502117700002102142700002302163773010102186856008102287852000902368655001202377IND60515231720221121043729.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051523172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-015-0790-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuarez, Rebeca L.10aAssessing temporal genetic variation in a cougar population: influence of harvest and neighboring populations  ap. 379-388.  aThe geography of the Black Hills region of South Dakota and Wyoming may limit connectivity for many species. For species with large energetic demands and large home ranges or species at low densities this can create viability concerns. Carnivores in this region, such as cougars (Puma concolor), have the additive effect of natural and human-induced mortality; this may act to decrease long-term viability. In this study we set out to explore genetic diversity among cougar populations in the Black Hills and surrounding areas. Specifically, our objectives were to first compare genetic variation and effective number of breeders of cougars in the Black Hills during three harvest regimes: pre (2003–2006), moderate (2007–2010), and heavy (2011–2013), to determine if harvest impacted genetic variation. Second, we compared genetic structure of the Black Hills cougar population with cougar populations in neighboring eastern Wyoming and North Dakota. Using 20 microsatellite loci, we conducted genetic analysis on DNA samples from cougars in the Black Hills (n = 675), North Dakota (n = 113), and eastern Wyoming (n = 62) collected from 2001–2013. Here we report that the Black Hills cougar population maintained genetic variation over the three time periods. Our substructure analysis suggests that the maintenance of genetic variation was due to immigration from eastern Wyoming and possibly North Dakota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPuma concolor 3aadditive effect 3acarnivores 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ageography 3ahome range 3aimmigration 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amortality 3aviability 3aBlack Hills region 3aNorth Dakota 3aSouth Dakota 3aWyoming1 aSchwartz, Michael K.1 aPilgrim, Kristine L.1 aThompson, Daniel J.1 aTucker, Stephanie A.1 aSmith, Joshua B.1 aJenks, Jonathan A.0 tConservation genetics.g2016 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.379-388dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-015-0790-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245013200169300001300301520115600314592002801470650001301498650001201511650001201523650001801535650001101553650001801564650001301582650001301595653002601608653002001634653001701654653001401671653001201685653001601697773010501713856008001818852000901898655001201907IND60598410620221117164102.0180629e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059841062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGargallo, Raimundo10aHard/Soft hybrid modeling of temperature-induced unfolding processes involving G-quadruplex and i-motif nucleic acid structures  ap. 4-15.  aA mathematical procedure is proposed for the analysis of multivariate data recorded during spectroscopically monitored melting experiments of biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. The method is based on hard/soft hybrid modeling in which one part of the observed variance is explained in terms of a physicochemical model (hard modeling), whereas the other part of the observed variance is explained in terms of soft modeling. The physicochemical model is applied to all of the components related to the unfolding of the biomolecules studied and provides thermodynamic values associated with the unfolding process such as the change in enthalpy, entropy, and melting temperature. The soft modeling term explains the contribution of artifacts not related to the unfolding process such as baseline drifts and nonlinearities. Here the method is applied to the analysis of simulated and experimental data corresponding to the unfolding equilibria of intramolecular structures such as i-motif and G-quadruplex. Overall, the method provides better results than the commonly used univariate approach and also better results than pure hard modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3amelting 3amelting point 3amodels 3anucleic acids 3aproteins 3avariance 0aMultivariate analysis 0aHybrid modeling 0aSpectroscopy 0aUnfolding 0ai-Motif 0aG-quadruple0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 466 p.4-15dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011800164500001400282520139600296592002801692650005201720650001401772650001101786650001901797651001201816651001201828651001301840651001001853700002501863700002701888700002401915700002301939773012101962856007302083852000902156655001202165IND60732257020221120224828.0210326e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073225702DNAL7 a10.3390/v130303922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabowski, Frederic 10aSARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 Has about Twofold Replicative Advantage and Acquires Concerning Mutations  aNAL-light  aThe novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC)-202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7), first collected in United Kingdom on 20 September 2020, is a rapidly growing lineage that in January 2021 constituted 86% of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in England. The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83–2.18 [95% CI: 1.71–2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65–1.72 [95% CI: 1.46–2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a fast growing VOC substrain. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary). These mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aevolution 3agenome 3aseroprevalence 3aDenmark 3aEngland 3aScotland 3aWales1 aPreibisch, Grzegorz 1 aGiziński, Stanisław,1 aKochańczyk, Marek 1 aLipniacki, Tomasz 0 tViruses.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130303923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012600170300001400296520113200310592002801442650001101470650000901481650002001490650001801510650001601528650001201544650001401556650001201570650001901582650001701601650001201618650001201630651001001642700002101652773008701673856008401760852000901844655001201853IND60097554920221119180642.0141104e20130314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009755492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakano, Masashi10aOverview of rehabilitation schemes for farmlands contaminated with radioactive cesium released from Fukushima power plant  ap. 87-93.  aSchemes for rehabilitation of farmlands contaminated with radioactive cesium are discussed based on the various pieces of information obtained to date from a series of validation trials in Fukushima, Japan. Decontamination of affected farmlands is to be achieved by scraper-removal of the very highly contaminated shallow top soil layer. In areas with very low contamination, the plans are to implement in-situ burial of the scraper-removed contaminated topsoil at depths greater than 2 m — meaning that the affected areas will be the burial sites. For disposal of the contaminated top-soils removed in the very highly contaminated areas, there will be a two-step procedure: (a) volume reduction and decontamination of the contaminated soil, and (b) disposal in a mulch barrier landfill system with encapsulating clay liners at selected sites. Volume reduction and decontamination of the contaminated soils will involve removal of the finer soil fractions through washing with water. For implementation of the schemes for rehabilitation, science-based verification of safety and public acceptance of the schemes are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium 3aclay 3adecontamination 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3ageology 3alandfills 3amulches 3apolluted soils 3apower plants 3atopsoil 3awashing 3aJapan1 aYong, Raymond N.0 tEngineering geology.g2013 Mar. 14, v. 155 p.87-93dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012200168300001400290520135700304592002801661650001801689650001201707650002401719650001901743650001701762650002201779650001201801650002001813650002301833650001001856650001901866650001501885650001801900650002201918650001401940651001301954653002701967653001401994653000902008653002102017653001402038653001302052700003302065700002602098773011402124856008502238852000902323655001202332IND60568646320221123000525.0190403e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056864632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDejene, Tatek10aFungal community succession and sporocarp production following fire occurrence in Dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia  ap. 37-47.  aFire is among the main threats to forest ecosystems in Ethiopia and is affecting the forest biodiversity, including fungal communities. This study was aimed to examine the effects of fire on macrofungal taxa richness, diversity and sporocarp production in the Dry Afromontane forests in Ethiopia. Sporocarps were collected from nine plots (100m2) established in one- and ten-year-old burned stands, and in an unburned stands. The data were used to quantify fungal richness and sporocarp fresh weights. Morphological and molecular analyses were used to identify the fungi. Composite soil samples were also collected from each stand and used to determine main edaphic explanatory variables for taxa composition. A total of 61 fungal taxa, belonging to Basidiomycota division were reported, of which 22 were edible. Fungal diversity, richness and sporocarp production were affected just after the fire. Fungal community composition was significantly correlated with Organic matter, P and Ca. Generally, the result is encouraging from the point of view of fungal conservation. It provides novelty information about the macrofungal communities in Ethiopian dry Afromontane forests, likely including many taxa are still unknown to science as well as several edible species which could supply complementary incomes for the rural populations in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3acalcium 3acommunity structure 3aedible species 3afire ecology 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3afruiting bodies 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3asoil sampling 3aspecies diversity 3awildfires 3aEthiopia 0aDry Afromontane forest 0aDiversity 0aFire 0aFungal community 0aMushrooms 0aRichness1 aOria de Rueda, Juan Andrés,1 aPinto, Pablo Martín,0 tForest ecology and management.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 398 p.37-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024004000131040001800171100001800189245010900207300001600316506007600332506003100408520134300439592002801782596008301810596004401893506003701937650001101974650001401985650001501999650001502014650001302029650001802042650002502060650001202085650001002097650001902107650001302126651001702139653001502156653001302171653002202184653001602206653001602222653001602238700002402254700002102278700001702299700002102316700001802337773009502355856008402450852000902534655001202543IND60581602520221207115855.0190410e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058160252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2017.09.0092doi7 a10.1016/j.appet.2017.09.0092chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallon, Megan10aSelf-reported and observed feeding practices of Rhode Island Head Start teachers: Knowing what not to do  ap. 310-317.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThrough their feeding practices, adult caregivers play an important role in shaping children's eating behaviors. However, the feeding practices of child care teachers have received little attention. The purpose of this study was to compare child care teachers' self-reported feeding practices and observed feeding practices during a preschool meal.Rhode Island Head Start teachers (n = 85) were observed during breakfast and lunch where feeding practices were coded using a tool adapted from the Environmental Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) tool. Teachers completed a questionnaire adapted from the EPAO Self-Report to capture self-reported feeding practices. Agreement between reported and observed was compared by percent agreement.Teachers were predominantly White (89%) and female (98%). There was a higher level of agreement among self-reported and observed controlling feeding practices (78.8-97.6% agreement) compared to healthful feeding practices (11.8-20.0% agreement).Although self-report measures are typically used to capture feeding practices, there are inconsistencies between self-report and observation measures. The inconsistencies found among healthful self-reported and observed feeding practices have implications for future research protocols, measurement refinement, and training of child care teachers.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNIHdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000020 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abreakfast 3acaregivers 3achild care 3achildren 3aeating habits 3aenvironmental policy 3afemales 3alunch 3aquestionnaires 3ateachers 3aRhode Island 0aChild care 0aTeachers 0aFeeding practices 0aMeasurement 0aSelf-report 0aObservation1 aHalloran, Katherine1 aGorman, Kathleen1 aWard, Dianne1 aGreene, Geoffrey1 aTovar, Alison0 tAppetite.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 120 p.310-317dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03922naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002000172245010900192300001600301520215600317592002802473650001502501650002002516650001402536650001502550650002302565650001602588650001402604650001202618650002202630650002002652650001902672650001902691650001002710650000902720650001302729650001802742650001002760650005102770650006002821650002002881650005402901650002502955650002602980700002203006700001803028700001903046700002203065700002603087700001903113700001903132773008303151856008903234852000903323655001203332IND4466436920221120092809.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446643692DNAL7 a215247792pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.03.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaicedo, Pamela10aDetermination of lindane leachability in soil–biosolid systems and its bioavailability in wheat plants  ap. 397-402.  aThe leachability of lindane from different biosolid amended soils was determined and compared to its bioavailability. Sand, soil, and a mixture of soil–sand (1:1 w/w) were spiked with lindane, blended with different amounts of biosolids, and subjected to a leaching process with water that lasted for 1–28d. This procedure is in accordance with ISO/TS 21268-1: 2007. After these batch tests, lindane was extracted from the leachates using three different solvent-free microextraction techniques, including solid phase microextraction (SPME), stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), and silicone rod extraction (SRE). The amount of lindane was determined with thermal desorption and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The efficiencies of the three microextraction techniques were statistically different, and the efficiency could be related to the amount of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in each extraction device. However, all of the techniques provide data that shows that the leachability of lindane is dependent on the amount of organic matter contained in the matrix. The results of the lindane leachability assay were compared to the bioavailability of lindane, which was determined by measuring the amount of lindane that accumulated in the roots of wheat plants grown in similar soil–biosolid systems. It was confirmed that the amount of organic matter in the matrix is a determining factor for lindane immobilization. The presence of biosolids decreases the mobility of lindane in all of the systems under study. Similarly, increasing biosolid concentrations in the soil significantly decreased the bioavailability of lindane and, consequently, plant absorption. The good correlation (R²=0.997) between the leachability of lindane from the matrix and plant absorption of lindane indicates that the proposed biomimetic methodology can predict the bioavailability of lindane in a time period as short as 7d. The results of this work confirm that amending contaminated soils with biosolids is beneficial for immobilizing lindane and helps prevent the percolation of lindane through the soil profile and into groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3abiosolids 3adesorption 3agas chromatography 3agroundwater 3aleachates 3alindane 3amass spectrometry 3amicroextraction 3aorganic matter 3apolluted soils 3aroots 3asand 3asilicone 3asoil profiles 3awheat 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHexachlorocyclohexanexanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTriticumxmetabolism 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid1 aSchröder, Andrea1 aUlrich, Nadin1 aSchröter, Uwe1 aPaschke, Albrecht1 aSchüürmann, Gerrit,1 aAhumada, Inés1 aRichter, Pablo0 tChemosphere.g2011 July, v. 84, no. 4 p.397-402dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.03.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006400165300001800229500001100247520115700258592002801415596006701443650001001510650001901520650002401539650001701563650001701580650001001597650000901607650001301616650002501629650001501654650001201669650002601681650000901707700001701716700002001733700002201753700001801775773014601793856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60615881820221120063045.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061588182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-9329-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Mahendra10aMarine-derived Phoma—the gold mine of bioactive compounds  ap. 9053-9066.  aReview  aThe genus Phoma contains several species ubiquitously present in soil, water, and environment. There are two major groups of Phoma, viz., terrestrial and marine. After 1981 researchers all over the world have focused on marine-derived Phoma for their bioactive compounds. The marine Phoma are very rich sources for novel bioactive secondary metabolites, which could potentially be used as drugs. Recently, a large number of structurally unique metabolites with potential biological and pharmacological activities have been isolated from the marine Phoma species particularly Phoma herbarum, P. sorghina, and P. tropica. These metabolites mainly include diterpenes, enolides, lactones, quinine, phthalate, and anthraquinone. Most of these compounds possess antimicrobial, anticancer, radical scavenging, and cytotoxic properties. The present review has been focused on the general background of Phoma, current approaches used for its identification and their limitations, difference between terrestrial and marine Phoma species. In addition, this review summarizes the novel bioactive compounds derived from marine Phoma and their biological activities.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.18-1/2011(BSR)cUGC BSR Faculty Fellowship, New Delhi, India 3aPhoma 3aanthraquinones 3abioactive compounds 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3adrugs 3agold 3alactones 3amedicinal properties 3aphthalates 3aquinine 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil1 aGade, Aniket1 aZimowska, Beata1 aIngle, Avinash P.1 aIngle, Pramod0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Nov., v. 102, no. 21 p.9053-9066dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9329-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144242014600170245011600316300001200432520151700444592002801961650002501989650001702014650001202031650001202043650001002055650003302065650003002098650001902128650004802147650001002195651001102205700002002216700001802236700003302254773009902287856007802386852000902464655001202473IND60132737320221119103922.0150511e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013273732DNAL7 a10.1051/forest/20091052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMougou-Hamdane, Amira10aDistribution spatiale de lignées d’oïdium des chênes en France analysée à l’aide d’outils rapides de caractérisation moléculaire10aSpatial distribution of lineages of oak powdery mildew fungi in France, using quick molecular detection methods  ap. 212.  a• Powdery mildew is a major fungal disease of oaks in Europe. Recent studies using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences suggested the presence of four different lineages (putative species). The objective of the study was to investigate the spatial distribution of these lineages/species and, in particular, to test the hypothesis of a spatial differentiation, at various scales: regional (France), altitudinal (a Pyrenean transect) and local (within a forest plot). • Detection methods for the four ITS types were developed: (1) single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP); (2) PCR amplifications, for which specific primers were designed. SSCP proved to be efficient for the detection of Erysiphe alphitoides and E. quercicola types. In contrast, the rarer ITS types corresponding to E. hypophylla and Phyllactinia guttata (sensu lato) were only detected by specific amplification. • The study confirmed the strong predominance of the ITS sequence associated with E. alphitoides at all spatial scales (with a frequency higher than 80%). Isolates presumably belonging to E. quercicola (i.e. with same ITS type), a recently described species not yet recorded in Europe, were also found in all French regions at a significant frequency (15% at national level). • No pattern of spatial differentiation between the putative species could be demonstrated: E. alphitoides was often found in association with different ITS types in the same region, the same tree, and even in the same lesion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErysiphe alphitoides 3aPhyllactinia 3aQuercus 3aforests 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3atrees 3aFrance1 aGiresse, Xavier1 aDutech, Cyril1 aDesprez-Loustau, Marie-Laure0 tAnnals of forest science.g2010 Jan., v. 67, no. 2 p.212-212dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest/20091053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013600170300001600306520106000322592002801382650002301410650002801433650004101461650002301502650001201525650001401537650001001551653001401561653001601575653001601591653002601607653002301633700001901656700002201675700001801697700002001715700001901735773012501754856008201879852000901961655001201970IND60599854920221118174359.0180702e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059985492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathsack, Philipp10aAnalysis of pyrolysis liquids from scrap tires using comprehensive gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and unsupervised learning  ap. 234-243.  aDuring the pyrolysis of scrap tires a complex mixtures of organic compounds is liberated and can be condensed as liquid product. In this study comprehensive gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC×GC–MS) and headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) are used to unravel the complex nature of pyrolysis liquids from scrap tires produced by means of an inductively heated batch reactor. Two strategies were employed. On the one hand a set of reference compounds was used for quantification, on the other hand unsupervised learning (c-means clustering) was used to deduce compound classes and assignment of compound class structural features from MS data. The clustering finally allowed the evaluation of the influence of time and heating rate on observable peak areas. It could be shown, that peak area of saturated and partially unsaturated (hydroaromatic) compounds decreased during the time course of experiments and with increasing heating rate, whereas aromatic compounds increased during the course and were favorably liberated at high heating rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3aartificial intelligence 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aliquids 3apyrolysis 3atires 0aPyrolysis 0aScrap tires 0aGC×GC–MS 0aUnsupervised learning 0ac-means clustering1 aRieger, André1 aHaseneder, Roland1 aGerlach, Dirk1 aRepke, Jens-Uwe1 aOtto, Matthias0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Sept., v. 109 p.234-243dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009700176300001400273520112500287592002801412650002301440650001901463650001501482650001601497650002201513650003801535650001101573650001101584650002001595650001701615650001201632650001801644650002101662650001901683650001801702650001401720650001101734653002301745653002801768653000901796653000901805653001401814653001001828700001401838700001501852700001701867700001601884700001701900773010401917856008502021852000902106655001202115IND60566482020221121160623.0190403e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056648202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Álvarez, M.R.10aImmunogenicity of phospholipase A2 toxins and their role in Streptococcus equi pathogenicity  ap. 15-19.  aStreptococcus equi subsp. equi (S. equi) is the causative agent of strangles, one of the most frequently diagnosed infectious diseases of horses worldwide. Phospholipase A2 toxins (PLA2) cleave phospholipid molecules at position sn-2 contributing to the production of leukotrienes that are important inflammatory mediators. Two homologous phospholipases, SlaA and SlaB are encoded by the S. equi genome suggesting that PLA2 toxins may contribute to its pathogenicity. Here we report the immunogenicity and role of PLA2 toxins during natural and experimental infection of horses with S. equi. The levels of anti-PLA2 specific antibodies in serum from horses naturally exposed to S. equi or without exposure were measured by indirect ELISA. Furthermore, the importance of PLA2 was determined during experimental infection of Welsh Mountain ponies with a mutant strain of S. equi lacking slaA and slaB. Our results show that PLA2 toxins are immunogenic, which supports their production during natural S. equi infection, but that these toxins are not essential for the development of strangles in a susceptible natural host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus equi 3aWelsh Mountain 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3achemical elements 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenome 3ahorses 3aimmune response 3aleukotrienes 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipases 3aphospholipids 3astrangles 3atoxins 0aStreptococcus equi 0aPhospholipase A2 toxins 0aSlaA 0aSlaB 0aStrangles 0aHorse1 aSalze, M.1 aCenier, A.1 aRobinson, C.1 aPaillot, R.1 aWaller, A.S.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 May, v. 204 p.15-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245012700169300001600296500002000312520140100332592002801733650001401761650002101775650001501796650002201811650000901833650001001842650001201852650001801864650003101882650001301913650003301926650001501959650001801974650001201992650001402004650001102018650001602029651001302045651001502058651001002073700003302083700002102116700001502137700006002152773015002212856007402362852000902436655001202445IND60677432020221117235427.0191128e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067743202DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.100222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobrino‐Gregorio, Lara10aUsing an automatic pulse voltammetric electronic tongue to verify the origin of honey from Spain, Honduras, and Mozambique  ap. 212-217.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The growing need to classify the origin of honey in a simple way is leading to the development of affordable analytical equipment that is in‐line and manageable, enabling rapid on‐site screening. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate whether an electronic tongue (made of four metallic electrodes: Ir, Rh, Pt, Au), based on potential multistep pulse voltammetry with electrochemical polishing, is able to differentiate between honey samples from Spain, Honduras, and Mozambique. RESULTS: It was demonstrated, for the first time, that automatic pulse voltammetry, in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) statistical analysis, was able to differentiate honey samples from these three countries. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis predicted the level of certain physicochemical parameters, the best results being for conductivity and moisture with correlation coefficients of 0.948 and 0.879, whereas the weakest correlation was for the sugars. CONCLUSION: The tool proposed in this study could be applied to identify the country origin of the three types of multifloral honey considered here. It also offers promising perspectives for expanding knowledge of the provenance of honey.

Among other organs, our brain and hippocampus in specific, is the region where effect of any environmental perturbation is most pronounced. So, this study was aimed to examine changes in major parameters (oxidative stress, level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones, and contextual fear conditioning) which are linked to hippocampus directly or indirectly, upon exposure to mobile phone radiofrequency electromagnetic field (MP-RF-EMF) radiation. Exposure was performed on young adult male Wistar rats for 16 weeks continuously (2 h/day) with MP-RF-EMF radiation having frequency, power density, and specific absorption rate (SAR) of 1966.1 MHz, 4.0 mW/cm², and 0.36 W/kg, respectively. Another set of animals kept in similar conditions without any radiation exposure serves as control. Towards the end of exposure period, animals were tested for fear memory and then euthanized to measure hippocampal oxidative stress, level of circulatory PICs, and stress hormones. We observed significant increase in hippocampal oxidative stress (p < 0.05) and elevated level of circulatory PICs viz. IL-1beta (p < 0.01), IL-6 (p < 0.05), and TNF-alpha (p < 0.001) in experimental animals upon exposure to MP-RF-EMF radiation. Adrenal gland weight (p < 0.001) and level of stress hormones viz. adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (p < 0.01) and corticosterone (CORT) (p < 0.05) were also found to increase significantly in MP-RF-EMF radiation-exposed animals as compared with control. However, alteration in contextual fear memory was not significant enough. In conclusion, current study shows that chronic exposure to MP-RF-EMF radiation emitted from mobile phones may induce oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and HPA axis deregulation. However, changes in hippocampal functionality depend on the complex interplay of several opposing factors that got affected upon MP-RF-EMF exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadrenal glands 3achronic exposure 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3aelectromagnetic field 3afearfulness 3ahippocampus 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alifestyle 3amales 3amemory 3amobile telephones 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aradio waves 3arats 3aresearch 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ayoung adults1 aGautam, Rohit1 aMeena, Ramovtar1 aNirala, Jay Prakash1 aJha, Sushil Kumar1 aRajamani, Paulraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4922-90280 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 June, v. 27, no. 16 p.19340-19351dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07916-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012900167300001800296520102100314592002801335650001001363650002001373650001701393650004301410650002501453650001801478650001601496651001001512700001801522700001401540700001701554773009201571856008601663852000901749655001201758IND50067580220221120115611.0141111e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006758022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ting10aDetermination of formaldehyde in beer based on cloud point extraction using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as derivative reagent  ap. 1577-1582.  aA cloud point extraction method was developed for extraction of formaldehyde in beer prior to high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The formaldehyde was taken into complex with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in aqueous nonionic surfactant Triton X-114 medium and concentrated in the surfactant-rich phase by bringing the solution to the temperature of 60°C. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection of formaldehyde is 0.7ngmL⁻¹. The intra- and inter-day precisions expressed as relative standard deviations are 4.2% and 5.5%, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for determination of formaldehyde in various beer samples. The contents of formaldehyde in these samples are in the range of 172–385ngmL⁻¹. The results were in agreement with those obtained by the state standard method (steam-distillation and spectrophotometry analysis) used in China. The developed method was demonstrated to be rapid and sensitive for extraction and determination of formaldehyde in beer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3adetection limit 3aformaldehyde 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anonionic surfactants 3arapid methods 3atemperature 3aChina1 aGao, Xiaoling1 aTong, Jia1 aChen, Ligang0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 131, no. 4 p.1577-1582dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245022700210520152600437592002801963650001501991650001502006650001602021650004602037650002002083650001702103650001302120650002602133650001502159650002302174650002702197650001802224650003802242650001802280650002902298650001002327653001402337653004102351653005102392653002502443653001902468700002302487700001902510700002002529700001702549700005902566773011102625856008602736852000902822655001202831IND60760334020221119140339.0220124e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076033402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamy, Constance1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0311-803110aQuantification of succinic acid levels, linked to succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) dysfunctions, by an automated and fully validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method suitable for multi-matrix applications  aThe hallmarks of cancer include metabolism with deregulating cellular energetics. Dysfunctions in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) metabolic enzyme activity, leading to an abnormal accumulation of succinic acid has been described in solid tumors but also in inflammation and ischemia reperfusion injury. Succinic acid is a potential biomarker of SDH related pathologies for diagnostic, evaluation of treatment response and follow-up of the disease. We developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method allowing a rapid, accurate and precise quantification of succinic acid levels in clinical (serum, urine) and preclinical (cellular pellets, supernatants) samples. ¹³C₄ succinic acid disodium salt was used as internal standard and added to samples before a solid phase extraction (SPE) on Phenomenex STRATAᵀᴹ XL-A (200 mg – 3 mL) 33 µm cartridges. This method is automated by a Freedom EVO® platform from TECAN and succinic acid is separated on a C18 column combined to a Xevo® TQ-S micro Waters mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI) source. This biomedical analysis allows standard curves to be linear over the range 1.0–135.5 µM with r² values > 0.999 and low matrix effects (<9.1 %). This method, which is validated according updated European Medicine Agency (EMA) guidelines, is accurate between-run (<11.0 %) and within-run (<7.8 %), precise between-run (<14.4 CV %) and within-run (<3.7 CV %), and is suitable for clinical and preclinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenzyme activity 3ainflammation 3aischemia 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3areperfusion injury 3asolid phase extraction 3aspectrometers 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3asuccinic acid 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine 0aBiomarker 0aSuccinate dehydrogenase dysfunctions 0aLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 0aEndogenous compounds 0aOncometabolite1 aMansard, Clémence1 aBlondel, Louis1 aMercier, Lionel1 aPaci, Angelo1 aBroutin, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6333-36360 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 1189 p.123085-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017000154300001800324500001900342520169800361592002802059650000802087650001502095650002402110650001202134650001202146650002402158650002402182650004902206650004002255700001902295700001602314700002002330700002002350773012302370856007402493852000902567655001202576IND60730433020221119082744.0210310e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073043302DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra10106k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wook10aConsidering both small and large scale motions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is crucial for reliably predicting its binding affinities to DNA aptamers  ap. 9315-9326.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF₁₆₅), a predominant isoform of VEGF signal proteins, is an ideal target for developing drugs against various diseases. It is composed of a heparin binding domain (HBD) and a receptor binding domain (RBD), which are connected by a flexible linker. Among the two domains, RBD is utilized in binding with the signal transduction protein, the VEGF receptor (VEGFR). None the less for its pharmaceutical importance, structure-based studies for developing drugs has been severely hindered by the lack of its whole structure determination, mainly owing to the existence of the flexible linker. Fortunately, the utilization of computer simulation methods can offer a possibility to circumvent this difficult issue. Here, we employ ensemble docking in combination with the anisotropic network model analysis to examine the interactions between DNA aptamers and VEGF₁₆₅. We model three-dimensional structures of aptamer variants based on their sequence information and perform docking calculations with the whole VEGF₁₆₅ structure. Indeed, we show that we can closely reproduce the experimental binding affinity order among different DNA aptamer variants by inclusively considering the flexible nature of VEGF. In addition, we address how DNA aptamer that binds to HBD of VEGF₁₆₅ impedes the interaction between VEGFR and VEGF₁₆₅ through RBD, even though HBD and RBD are rather distant. The present study illustrates that the flexible docking scheme employed here can be applied to tricky cases that involve flexible proteins with undetermined structures, toward effectively predicting ligand binding affinities to such proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanisotropy 3acomputer simulation 3aheparin 3aligands 3anucleotide aptamers 3asignal transduction 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptors 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aPark, Jae Whee1 aGo, Yeon Ju1 aKim, Wŏn-jong,1 aRhee, Young Min0 tRSC advances.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 11, no. 16 p.9315-9326dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra10106k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245012000205520173700325592002802062653007802090653005502168653003102223653002202254653001702276653002602293653003802319653003502357700005702392700006202449700006102511700006702572700001802639700001802657700006302675700005802738700003202796700006202828700005702890700005902947700006103006700005803067773011403125856008503239852000903324655001203333IND60763174220221122235640.0220205s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076317422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crviro.2022.1000192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurer, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2137-457610aIdentification of broad anti-coronavirus chemical agents for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern  aEndemic human coronaviruses (hCoVs) 229E and OC43 cause respiratory disease with recurrent infections, while severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 spreads across the world with impact on health and societies. Here, we report an image-based multicycle infection procedure with α-coronavirus hCoV-229E-eGFP in an arrayed chemical library screen of 5440 clinical and preclinical compounds. Toxicity counter selection and challenge with the β-coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in tissue culture and human airway epithelial explant cultures (HAEEC) identified four FDA-approved compounds with oral availability. Methylene blue (MB, used for the treatment of methemoglobinemia), Mycophenolic acid (MPA, used in organ transplantation) and the anti-fungal agent Posaconazole (POS) had the broadest anti-CoV spectrum. They inhibited the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and variants-of-concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) from HAEEC in either pre- or post exposure regimens at clinically relevant concentrations. Co-treatment of cultured cells with MB and the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 RNA-polymerase inhibitor Remdesivir reduced the effective anti-viral concentrations of MB by 2-fold, and Remdesivir by 4 to 10-fold, indicated by BLISS independence synergy modelling. Neither MB, nor MPA, nor POS affected the cell delivery of SARS-CoV-2 or OC43 (+)sense RNA, but blocked subsequent viral RNA accumulation in cells. Unlike Remdesivir, MB, MPA or POS did not reduce the release of viral RNA in post exposure regimen, thus indicating infection inhibition at a post-replicating step as well. In summary, the data emphasize the power of unbiased, full cycle compound screens to identify and repurpose broadly acting drugs against coronaviruses.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHuman coronavirus drug screen at single cell resolution in arrayed format 0aHuman explant nasal and bronchial epithelial cells 0aRepurposing methylene blue 0aMycophenolic acid 0aPosaconazole 0aDrug synergy in vitro 0aPost-entry coronavirus inhibition 0aSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern1 aVolle, Romain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4442-46521 aAndriasyan, Vardan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9619-66551 aPetkidis, Anthony1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4135-95761 aGomez-Gonzalez, Alfonso1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1478-35631 aYang, Liliane1 aMeili, Nicole1 aSuomalainen, Maarit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3276-30081 aBauer, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8156-46031 aPolicarpo Sequeira, Daniela1 aOlszewski, Dominik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5389-40341 aGeorgi, Fanny1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4803-50991 aKuttler, Fabien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2575-19891 aTurcatti, Gerardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0139-223X1 aGreber, Urs F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2278-120X0 tCurrent research in virological science.g2022, v. 3 p.100019-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28185x2666-478X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crviro.2022.1000193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245010500215300001800320500001100338506007600349520167100425592002802096596002402124506003702148650001402185650002702199650001702226650002802243650001502271650002102286650001102307650003002318650001502348650001702363650001002380650002502390650001102415700001702426700003102443700006402474773014602538856008102684852000902765655001202774IND60615882020221207112737.0181015e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061588202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-9343-42doi7 aPMC62089672pmcid7 a301963292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordberg Karlsson, Eva10aEndo-xylanases as tools for production of substituted xylooligosaccharides with prebiotic properties  ap. 9081-9088.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aXylan has a main chain consisting of β-1,4-linked xylose residues with diverse substituents. Endoxylanases cleave the xylan chain at cleavage sites determined by the substitution pattern and thus give different oligosaccharide product patterns. Most known endoxylanases belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 10 and 11. These enzymes work well on unsubstituted xylan but accept substituents in certain subsites. The GH11 enzymes are more restricted by substituents, but on the other hand, they are normally more active than the GH10 enzymes on insoluble substrates, because of their smaller size. GH5 endoxylanases accept arabinose substituents in several subsites and require it in the − 1 subsite. This specificity makes the GH5 endoxylanases very useful for degradation of highly arabinose-substituted xylans and for the selective production of arabinoxylooligosaccharides, without formation of unsubstituted xylooligosaccharides. The GH30 endoxylanases have a related type of specificity in that they require a uronic acid substituent in the − 2 subsite, which makes them very useful for the production of uronic acid substituted oligosaccharides. The ability of dietary xylooligosaccharides to function as prebiotics in humans is governed by their substitution patterns. Endoxylanases are thus excellent tools to tailor prebiotic oligosaccharides to stimulate various types of intestinal bacteria and to cause fermentation in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Continuously increasing knowledge on the function of the gut microbiota and discoveries of novel endoxylanases increase the possibilities to achieve health-promoting effects.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017-02713cVINNOVA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarabinose 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3afermentation 3agastrointestinal system 3aglycosides 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aprebiotics 3auronic acids 3axylan 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose1 aSchmitz, Eva1 aLinares-Pastén, Javier A.1 aAdlercreutz, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9923-33970 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Nov., v. 102, no. 21 p.9081-9088dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9343-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002000190245013500210300001600345506007600361520213600437592002802573506003702601650002702638650001402665650001202679650002402691650001502715650001502730650001502745650001202760650001702772650001802789650002502807650000902832650001602841651001202857653003002869653001602899653001602915653001502931653002502946653002402971700002402995700001903019700001603038700002403054773009503078856008403173852000903257655001203266IND60581602820221207115423.0190410e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058160282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.0312doi7 aPMC56891352pmcid7 a288642592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantzari, Eleni10aPerceived impact of smaller compared with larger-sized bottles of sugar-sweetened beverages on consumption: A qualitative analysis  ap. 171-180.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption increases obesity risk and is linked to adverse health consequences. Large packages increase food consumption, but most evidence comes from studies comparing larger with standard packages, resulting in uncertainty regarding the impact of smaller packages. There is also little research on beverages. This qualitative study explores the experiences of consuming cola from smaller compared with larger bottles, to inform intervention strategies.Sixteen households in Cambridge, England, participating in a feasibility study assessing the impact of bottle size on in-home SSB consumption, received a set amount of cola each week for four weeks in one of four bottle sizes: 1500 ml, 1000 ml, 500 ml, or 250 ml, in random order. At the study end, household representatives were interviewed about their experiences of using each bottle, including perceptions of i) consumption level; ii) consumption-related behaviours; and iii) factors affecting consumption. Interviews were semi-structured and data analysed using the Framework approach. The present analysis focuses specifically on experiences relating to use of the smaller bottles.The smallest bottles were described as increasing drinking occasion frequency and encouraging consumption of numerous bottles in succession. Factors described as facilitating their consumption were: i) convenience and portability; ii) greater numbers of bottles available, which hindered consumption monitoring and control; iii) perceived insufficient quantity per bottle; and iv) positive attitudes. In a minority of cases the smallest bottles were perceived to have reduced consumption, but this was related to practical issues with the bottles that resulted in dislike.The perception of greater consumption and qualitative reports of drinking habits associated with the smallest bottles raise the possibility that the ‘portion size effect’ has a lower threshold, beyond which smaller portions and packages may increase consumption. This reinforces the need for empirical evidence to assess the in-home impact of smaller bottles on SSB consumption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeverages 3abottles 3afeasibility studies 3ahouseholds 3ainterviews 3amonitoring 3aobesity 3aportion size 3apublic health 3aqualitative analysis 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aEngland 0aSugar-sweetened beverages 0aConsumption 0aBottle size 0aInterviews 0aQualitative analysis 0aPortion size effect1 aHollands, Gareth J.1 aPechey, Rachel1 aJebb, Susan1 aMarteau, Theresa M.0 tAppetite.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 120 p.171-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013800168300001600306520181400322592002802136650001202164650002302176650001602199650001702215650001902232650001902251650002102270650002502291650001102316650003002327650002002357650001102377650001302388650002302401650002302424650002502447650001602472650002902488650001702517651001002534653000902544653001802553653002502571653002402596653001802620700002902638700002802667700002502695700002402720773011302744856008402857852000902941655001202950IND60566482320221121125514.0190403e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056648232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgea, Gregorio10aAssessing a crop water stress index derived from aerial thermal imaging and infrared thermometry in super-high density olive orchards  ap. 210-221.  aCharacterization of the spatio-temporal variability of tree water status is a prerequisite to conducting precise irrigation management in fruit tree orchards. This study assessed the suitability of a crop water stress index (CWSI) derived from high-resolution aerial thermal imagery for estimating tree water status variability in super high density (SHD) olive orchards. The experiment was conducted at a commercial SHD olive orchard near Seville (southwestern Spain), with drip irrigated trees under three irrigation treatments (four plots per treatment in a randomized block design): a full irrigation treatment to replace the crop water needs (ETc) and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments to replace ca. 45% of ETc. Meteorological variables, soil moisture content, leaf water potential, stem water potential and leaf gas exchange measurements were performed along the irrigation season. Infrared temperature sensors (IRTs) installed approximately 1m above the canopies were used to derive the required Non-Water-Stressed Baselines (NWSBs) for CWSI calculation. NWSBs were not common during the growing season, although the seasonal effect could be partly explained with solar angle variations. A thermal camera installed on a mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) allowed for the recording of high-resolution thermal images on 5 representative dates during the irrigation season. The CWSI values derived from aerial thermal imagery were sensitive to the imposed variations in tree water status within the SHD olive orchard. Among the recorded variables, maximum stomatal conductance showed the tightest correlation with CWSI. We concluded that high-resolution thermal imagery captured from a mini RPAS is a suitable tool for defining tree water status variability within SHD olive orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3adeficit irrigation 3afruit trees 3agas exchange 3agrowing season 3aimage analysis 3airrigation rates 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3ameteorological parameters 3amicroirrigation 3aolives 3aorchards 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water content 3astomatal conductance 3atemperature 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awater stress 3aSpain 0aCWSI 0aOlea europaea 0aPrecision irrigation 0aSpatial variability 0aTranspiration1 aPadilla-Díaz, Carmen M.1 aMartinez-Guanter, Jorge1 aFernández, José E.1 aPérez-Ruiz, Manuel0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 June, v. 187 p.210-221dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245007500205300001400280500001100294520117800305592002801483650001001511650001201521650001301533650001501546650001601561650001401577650001601591650001601607650001101623650001101634650001701645650000901662650001401671650001401685650001201699650001901711650001801730650001301748650001501761650001701776650001401793650002401807650001501831650001701846650002201863650001101885650000901896700002001905700003101925773014901956856007402105852000902179655001202188IND60677432320221117235345.0191128e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067743232DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.100042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahedi, Seyed Morteza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7766-878714aThe use of nanotechnology to increase quality and yield of fruit crops  ap. 25-31.  aREVIEW  aNanotechnology is currently being widely employed in agriculture and horticulture. The most widely investigated and developed factor related to fruit trees is nanofertilizers (NFs), which play very important roles in increasing vegetative growth, improving reproductive growth and flowering, thereby increasing productivity, product quality and ultimately increasing shelf‐life and decreasing fruit waste. These nanomaterials, which are generally sprayed at low concentrations on trees at different time intervals and in frequent sessions, are also considered as growth stimulants. Macro‐ and micro‐scale NFs such as zinc, boron, chitosan, and fertilizer nanocomposites such as ZnFeMnB (zinc, iron, manganese, boron), NPKMg (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium), and calcite have been shown to significantly improve the vegetative and reproductive traits of fruit trees such as pomegranate, strawberry, mango, date, coffee and grape. Knowledge on the effects of NFs on fruit trees and biological reasons for their effects on different traits is incomplete and there is an urgent need for extensive research on these topics. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3acalcite 3achitosan 3acrop yield 3afertilizers 3aflowering 3afruit crops 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agrapes 3ahorticulture 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amangoes 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apomegranates 3apotassium 3areproductive traits 3ashelf life 3astrawberries 3avegetative growth 3awastes 3azinc1 aKarimi, Mahdieh1 aTeixeira da Silva, Jaime A0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 100, no. 1 p.25-31dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.100043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245008000195300001600275520134700291592002801638650001201666650001101678650001801689650001801707650001101725650001301736650002101749650002101770650002501791650001201816650002401828650001001852650000901862650001201871650002301883650001301906650002301919650002501942650005601967650004502023651001202068700002202080773010002102856005502202852000902257655001202266IND4468776420221120081613.0120503e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446877642DNAL7 a224637132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04123.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValentine, Harry T.10aModeling forest stand dynamics from optimal balances of carbon and nitrogen  ap. 961-971.  a• We formulate a dynamic evolutionary optimization problem to predict the optimal pattern by which carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are co‐allocated to fine‐root, leaf, and wood production, with the objective of maximizing height growth rate, year by year, in an even‐aged stand. • Height growth is maximized with respect to two adaptive traits, leaf N concentration and the ratio of fine‐root mass to sapwood cross‐sectional area. Constraints on the optimization include pipe‐model structure, the C cost of N acquisition, and agreement between the C and N balances. The latter is determined by two models of height growth rate, one derived from the C balance and the other from the N balance; agreement is defined by identical growth rates. • Predicted time‐courses of maximized height growth rate accord with general observations. Across an N gradient, higher N availability leads to greater N utilization and net primary productivity, larger trees, and greater stocks of leaf and live wood biomass, with declining gains as a result of saturation effects at high N availability. Fine‐root biomass is greatest at intermediate N availability. • Predicted leaf and fine‐root stocks agree with data from coniferous stands across Finland. Optimal C‐allocation patterns agree with published observations and model analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aforest stands 3agrowth models 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3anitrogen content 3aprimary productivity 3asapwood 3asystem optimization 3atrees 3awood 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aForestry 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPinus sylvestrisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 3aFinland1 aMäkelä, Annikki0 tnew phytologist.g2012 June, v. 194, no. 4 p.961-971dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04123.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016800167300001600335520164800351592002801999650000802027650001902035650002402054650002002078650002302098650001002121650002402131650001602155650001402171650001202185650001402197650001902211650001302230650001202243651001802255651002602273700001602299700002102315700002202336700001902358700002102377700002002398700002102418773010102439856008102540852000902621655001202630IND60515232520221121054038.0160312e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051523252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-015-0783-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKearns, Anna M.10aNorfolk Island Robins are a distinct endangered species: ancient DNA unlocks surprising relationships and phenotypic discordance within the Australo-Pacific Robins  ap. 321-335.  aUncertain taxonomy hinders the effective prioritization of taxa for conservation. This problem is acute for understudied island populations in the southwest Pacific Ocean, which are increasingly threatened by habitat loss, predation and climate change. Here, we offer the first test of taxonomic limits and phylogenetic affinities of the iconic Pacific Robin radiation (Petroica multicolor) in order to prioritize the conservation of its nominotypical subspecies, the endangered Norfolk Island Robin (P. m. multicolor). We integrate phylogenetic analyses of ancient DNA and quantitative measures of plumage and morphometric variation to show that the Norfolk Island Robin should be recognized as a distinct species. Phenotypic and genetic datasets contradict the longstanding treatment of Pacific Robins (including Norfolk Island Robins) and Scarlet Robins (P. boodang) as a single species. Instead, we show that Norfolk Island Robins are deeply divergent from Scarlet Robins and have more genetic similarity to Red-capped Robins (P. goodenovii) than to other Pacific Robins. This finding is unrepresentative of the current taxonomic and conservation status of the Norfolk Island Robin, which we propose should be recognised as an endemic endangered species. Our study clearly shows that in the absence of contemporary tissues, ancient DNA approaches using historical museum specimens can address taxonomic questions that morphological traits are unable to resolve. Further, it highlights the need for similar studies of other threatened Norfolk fauna with uncertain taxonomic status in order to ensure appropriate conservation prioritization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aclimate change 3aconservation status 3adata collection 3aendangered species 3afauna 3ahabitat destruction 3amorphometry 3aphylogeny 3aplumage 3apredation 3aprioritization 3ataxonomy 3atissues 3aPacific Ocean 3aPacific Ocean Islands1 aJoseph, Leo1 aWhite, Lauren C.1 aAustin, Jeremy J.1 aBaker, Caitlin1 aDriskell, Amy C.1 aMalloy, John F.1 aOmland, Kevin E.0 tConservation genetics.g2016 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.321-335dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-015-0783-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018600166300001600352520050200368592002800870650000800898650002300906650001200929650001400941650002000955650001900975650004200994650000901036650002701045651001401072700001401086700001201100773010501112856008101217852000901298655001201307IND60132777620221123031853.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013277762DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-014-0391-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukagoshi, H.10aIsolation and characterization of eighteen polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci from masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) using next-generation sequencing and cross-species amplification  ap. 441-443.  aA total of 18 novel microsatellite markers in masu salmon, an important fisheries resource around the Far East, were isolated using a next-generation sequencing approach.

But the compatibility between BC and iPP is poor. The esterification modified BC (CO) and addition of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) as a compatibilizer were both used to improve interfacial compatibility of iPP and BC to prepare iPP/BC composites, and the non-isothermal crystallization behavior of isotactic polypropylene/bacterial cellulose composites was discussed. The results showed that with the addition of CO or MAPP, the compatibility of iPP/BC composites greatly improved. Moreover, BC addition was found to enhance iPP crystallization due to homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation effects. In non-isothermal crystallization kinetics, it was found that the Jeziorny method and ϕ–t analysis are more accurate to describe non-isothermal crystallization behavior of iPP/BC composites. The results showed that the non-isothermal crystallization rates increase in the order of iPP/BC2, iPP, iPP/CO2, and M-iPP/BC3, indicating that the compatibility of iPP/BC composites. Moreover, the cooling rate have greatly influence on non-isothermal crystallization behavior of iPP/BC composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3aesterification 3amaleic anhydrides 3amechanical properties 3apolypropylenes1 aZhang, Hai-Rong1 aHuang, Chao1 aXiong, Lian1 aLuo, Jun1 aChen, Xin-de0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 30, v. 7, no. 67 p.42113-42122dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07731a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245014400177300001600321500001500337520103800352592002801390650003001418650002701448650001201475650000901487650002201496650003001518650004201548650002201590650002001612651001801632653002301650700002301673700002201696700002501718773010501743856008101848852000901929655001201938IND60132777720221123003700.0150511e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013277772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-014-0392-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouanani, Mohand Ameziane10aDevelopment of 18 novel polymorphic microsatellites from Coccinella septempunctata and cross-species amplification in Coccinellidae species  ap. 445-449.  a2019-12-04  aThe seven spot ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata), a widely spread coccinellid in the Palearctic region, introduced in USA where it is recently identified as invasive, is used as biological control agent. Its taxonomic status, with peripheral populations phenotypically distinct, is not well defined. Understanding its population genetic structure is crucial to investigate its evolutionary history, local adaptation in peripheral populations, dispersal and invasion dynamics. In this context, we isolated and characterised, from microsatellite enrichment and next-generation sequencing, 18 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Genetic variation was assessed from four geographically distant populations. The number of alleles ranges from two to 15 per locus and per population and the observed and expected heterozygosities are similar whatever the population (0.53 and 0.640, respectively). High successful cross-amplification in additional 21 species, belonging to five coccinellid subfamilies, suggests their broad application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aloci 3aPalearctic region 3abiological control agents 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3agenetic variation 3agenetic markers 3aUnited States 0aPalaearctic region1 aMagné, Frédéric1 aLecompte, Émilie1 aCrouau-Roy, Brigitte0 tConservation genetics resources.g2015 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.445-449dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-014-0392-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245003700164300001400201520073400215592002800949650001100977650004400988650002001032650001901052653002001071653001601091653003401107653003101141653003001172653001301202653001801215653001701233653002901250653001801279700001601297700002101313700002201334700002101356773010901377856008201486852000901568655001201577IND60606683920221118013234.0180727e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060668392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, Klas10aProcess control with compact NMR  ap. 39-52.  aCompact nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instruments make NMR spectroscopy and relaxometry accessible in industrial and harsh environments for reaction and process control.

The modes of food competition within and between families were investigated following the principles proposed by the “ecological model” using 3 years of field data from seven fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) families. The major food resources were identified from year-round feeding observations and the strength and mode of competition were inferred from differences in physical condition. The most important food resource of fork-marked lemurs were tree exudates which occurred in small, defendable food patches, characterized by fast depletion and rapid renewal. These characteristics led to strong within-group contest and scramble competition, which were found to yield a positive dominance effect and a negative group-size effect on female net energy gain. Differential physical condition, however, did not translate directly into differential reproductive success. Low female fertility was best predicted by large family size associated with delayed dispersal by previous offspring. Although there is no obvious benefit from full-grown offspring in their territory, adults tolerate delayed natal dispersal, probably because dispersal poses extraordinary costs for the offspring. These costs are likely to accrue from decreased foraging efficiency in unfamiliar habitats because exudate feeding requires very rigid feeding itineraries. In conclusion, the presented evidence for group-size effects on reproductive success in pair-living females opens a new area for research on the costs and benefits of delayed dispersal and female reproductive decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLemur 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3abreeding 3aenergy 3afamily size 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3aforaging 3agroup size 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aprogeny 3atrees0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2003 Nov., v. 55, no. 1 p.11-21dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-003-0676-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011500186300001800301520170000319592002802019650001302047650002602060650002002086650001102106650001502117650001302132650001802145650002002163650001202183650000902195650002202204650001602226650004402242650001202286650002802298650004902326650004602375650003002421650002402451650003402475650003802509650000902547650000902556650002102565650002302586651001002609700002202619700001602641700001802657700002102675700001802696700002302714773008502737856008102822852000902903655001202912IND50069086020221120064331.0141112e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006908602DNAL7 a240120882pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuasa, Masahiro10aConsumption of a low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet (the ketogenic diet) exaggerates biotin deficiency in mice  ap. 1266-1270.  aOBJECTIVE: Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as a cofactor for several carboxylases. The ketogenic diet, a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, is used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and promote weight loss. In Japan, the infant version of the ketogenic diet is known as the “ketone formula.” However, as the special infant formulas used in Japan, including the ketone formula, do not contain sufficient amounts of biotin, biotin deficiency can develop in infants who consume the ketone formula. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the ketogenic diet on biotin status in mice. METHODS: Male mice (N = 32) were divided into the following groups: control diet group, biotin-deficient (BD) diet group, ketogenic control diet group, and ketogenic biotin-deficient (KBD) diet group. Eight mice were used in each group. RESULTS: At 9 wk, the typical symptoms of biotin deficiency such as hair loss and dermatitis had only developed in the KBD diet group. The total protein expression level of biotin-dependent carboxylases and the total tissue biotin content were significantly decreased in the KBD and BD diet groups. However, these changes were more severe in the KBD diet group. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that the ketogenic diet increases biotin bioavailability and consumption, and hence, promotes energy production by gluconeogenesis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism, which results in exaggerated biotin deficiency in biotin-deficient mice. Therefore, biotin supplementation is important for mice that consume the ketogenic diet. It is suggested that individuals that consume the ketogenic diet have an increased biotin requirement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalopecia 3aamino acid metabolism 3abioavailability 3abiotin 3adermatitis 3aepilepsy 3ahigh fat diet 3ainfant formulas 3ainfants 3amice 3aprotein synthesis 3aweight loss 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBiotinxbloodxdeficiencyxpharmacokinetics. 2aBiotinidase Deficiencyxbloodxpathology. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDietary Supplements 2aGluconeogenesisxdrug effects 2aDiet, Ketogenicxadverse effects. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aNutritional Status 3aJapan1 aMatsui, Tomoyoshi1 aAndo, Saori1 aIshii, Yoshie1 aSawamura, Hiromi1 aEbara, Shuhei1 aWatanabe, Toshiaki0 tNutrition.g2013 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.1266-1270dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007400160300001600234520097800250592002801228650001201256650002001268650002901288650001301317650001601330650002101346650002101367650002101388650001201409650001401421650001201435650002201447653000801469653000801477653000801485653000901493653000801502653001101510653000801521653000901529653001101538653000801549653000801557653000801565653000801573653000901581653001201590653001001602653001101612653000801623653001001631653002901641653001601670653001701686653003001703700001701733700002301750700001801773700001501791700001801806700001401824773012501838856008201963852000902045655001202054IND60544139520221123012523.0190415e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054413952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bo10aReview of the roles of conjugated linoleic acid in health and disease  ap. 314-325.  aDietary fatty acids (FA) are increasingly recognized as major biologic regulators and have properties that relate to health outcomes and disease. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a generic term denoting a group of isomers of linoleic acid (C18:2, n-6) with a conjugated double bond. CLA has attracted increased research interest because of its health-promoting benefits and biological functions. In a variety of studies, CLA has been shown to impact immune function and has protective effects against cancer, obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis in animal studies and in different human cell lines. Studies investigating the mechanisms involved in the biological functions of CLA are emerging with results from both in vivo and in vitro studies. Most of the biological effects have been attributed to the c9,t11-CLA and t10,c12-CLA isomers. The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of CLA on health and disease and the possible mechanisms for CLA activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aatherosclerosis 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adiabetes 3adietary fat 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman cell lines 3ain vitro studies 3aisomers 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3aprotective effect 0aCLA 0aLOX 0aCOX 0aPGE2 0aTB2 0aNF-κB 0aIKK 0aPPAR 0aTNF-α 0aLPS 0aSCD 0aRXR 0aLDL 0aVLDL 0aTFG-β1 0aUCP-2 0a5-HETE 0aIGF 0aNAG-1 0aConjugated linoleic acid 0aAnti-cancer 0aAnti-obesity 0aHealth-promoting benefits1 aChen, Haiqin1 aStanton, Catherine1 aRoss, R.

It is suggested that the cell metabolic activity has induced local pH drop and as a result increased the alloy degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abiodegradation 3acalcium 3acolloids 3aelectrochemistry 3afetal bovine serum 3amagnesium 3apH 0aMagnesium 0aBiomaterials 0aDegradation 0aL929 cells1 aYamamoto, A.1 aKhakbaz, Hadis0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.603-606dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2015.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245018000187300001600367500001500383520165000398592002802048650001302076650002802089650001002117650001402127650002602141650001602167650002202183650002102205650001802226650001002244650001002254650002502264650001902289650001202308650001802320650001502338650002102353650001102374650002202385650002802407650002302435650002702458650004102485650001002526651001302536651001002549651001002559653002402569700001902593700001802612700001602630773010702646856004802753852000902801655001202810IND4479274220221123015218.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447927422DNAL7 a222701112pmid7 a10.1007/s10493-012-9511-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalagnini, Valeria10aDifferences between sympatric populations of Eotetranychus carpini collected from Vitis vinifera and Carpinus betulus: insights from host-switch experiments and molecular data  ap. 209-219.  a2019-12-06  aEotetranychus carpini (Oudemans) is an important pest of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) in southern Europe. This mite is also found on a number of different plants, including Carpinus betulus L., which commonly occurs in stands and hedgerows bordering vineyards, where it may serve as a potential mite reservoir. The economic importance of this pest has motivated a number of studies aimed at investigating whether the mites found on V. vinifera and C. betulus are conspecific. The results obtained to date have been inconclusive. In this study, we used biological and molecular approaches to investigate this issue. First, we conducted host-switch experiments to test the ability of E. carpini to develop on an alternative host plant, using mite populations originally collected on either C. betulus or V. vinifera plants from the same area. Second, we investigated DNA-based differentiation using nucleotide sequences of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of the ribosomal DNA of individual E. carpini from the populations examined in our host-plant experiments. We also analyzed sequences of individuals collected in other regions (Italy and Slovenia) to estimate species variation. The results from our host-switch experiments suggest the differentiation of mites collected on the two hosts. Mites collected from C. betulus did not survive and reproduce on V. vinifera and vice versa. Our molecular work revealed significant genetic differentiation between the mites collected from the two hosts, but no evidence of genetic variation among specimens collected from the same host species. Our results indicate the existence of host races of E. carpini.  aPublisher supplied data 3asympatry 3ainterspecific variation 3araces 3avineyards 3aEotetranychus carpini 3ahost plants 3agenetic variation 3aCarpinus betulus 3aribosomal DNA 3amites 3apests 3anucleotide sequences 3aVitis vinifera 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBetulaceae 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTetranychidaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aVitis 3aSlovenia 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aspecies differences1 aNavajas, Maria1 aMigeon, Alain1 aDuso, Carlo0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2012 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.209-219dSpringer-Verlagx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-012-9511-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016900170300001600339520136700355592002801722650001201750650001901762650003201781650001901813650001101832650002401843650001201867650002901879650002101908650001601929650001401945650001301959650002201972650001301994650001002007650001902017650002502036653003102061653002302092653001802115653002502133653002502158653000902183700001402192700005302206773009002259856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60634636420221120074817.0191220e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063463642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoiket, Md.I.H.14aThe development of a process simulation model for energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of a vapor solvent-based oil sands extraction and recovery process  ap. 799-808.  aThe solvent extraction process (SEP) is a promising technology for bitumen production from oil sands. This paper investigates the energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a propane-based super-heated vapor solvent extraction process as an alternative to in situ techniques, steam assisted gravity drainage, and cyclic steam simulation. A vapor solvent-based extraction model of 25,000 barrels per day of bitumen was developed to evaluate energy and GHG emissions. The energy- and emissions-intensive units were identified and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the impact of key operating parameters on the plant's overall emissions. Uncertainty analysis was performed on the most sensitive parameters. The results show that SEP natural gas and electricity consumption are 60.5–89.9 MJ/barrel and 19.7–19.9 kWh/barrel of bitumen, respectively. The GHG emissions range from 24.8 to 29.1 kg CO2 eq./barrel of bitumen. The demethanizer unit, responsible for more than 90% of the electrical energy, is the most GHG emissions-intensive unit. GHG emissions are mostly influenced by the solvent-to-oil ratio. On the whole, the SEP emissions footprint is promising; however, the results must be extended to upgrading and refining emissions in order to understand the full life cycle GHG emissions of the transportation fuels produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3agravity 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3anatural gas 3aoil sands 3arefining 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3asteam 3atransportation 3auncertainty analysis 0aSolvent extraction process 0aEnergy consumption 0aGHG emissions 0aSolvent-to-oil ratio 0aUncertainty analysis 0aSAGD1 aOni, A.O.1 aKumar, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1746-71390 tEnergy.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 173 p.799-808dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008300159500001900242520099700261592002801258650001501286650001701301650001901318650001601337650003101353650001601384650001201400650001201412650001701424650001601441700002501457700002501482700002301507700002301530700002801553700003101581773012201612856007401734852000901808655001201817IND60729406220221122225050.0210228e20210126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072940622DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130203732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Piotr 10aWhat Role Does the Endocannabinoid System Play in the Pathogenesis of Obesity?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an endogenous signaling system formed by specific receptors (cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 (CB₁ and CB₂)), their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation. The ECS, centrally and peripherally, is involved in various physiological processes, including regulation of energy balance, promotion of metabolic process, food intake, weight gain, promotion of fat accumulation in adipocytes, and regulation of body homeostasis; thus, its overactivity may be related to obesity. In this review, we try to explain the role of the ECS and the impact of genetic factors on endocannabinoid system modulation in the pathogenesis of obesity, which is a global and civilizational problem affecting the entire world population regardless of age. We also emphasize that the search for potential new targets for health assessment, treatment, and the development of possible therapies in obesity is of great importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3acannabinoids 3aenergy balance 3afood intake 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahomeostasis 3aligands 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3aweight gain1 aHryhorowicz, Szymon 1 aRychter, Anna  Maria1 aZawada, Agnieszka 1 aSłomski, Ryszard 1 aDobrowolska, Agnieszka 1 aKrela-Kaźmierczak, Iwona 0 tNutrients.g2021 Jan. 26, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130203733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008500166300001500251520129100266592002801557650000901585650001801594650001601612650001801628650003001646650001201676650001701688650001101705650001801716650002901734650001001763650001801773651001001791653001901801653002501820653001701845653002901862653001001891700001701901773007701918856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60546210620221122100013.0160903e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054621062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Sizhong10aR&D status and the performance of domestic firms in China's coal mining industry  ap. 99-103.  aCoal use accounts for a very large proportion of electricity production in China. Using a recently developed coarsened exact matching (CEM) technique, this paper examines the impact of research and development (R&D) activities on the performance of firms in China's coal mining industry. Our empirical results reveal that firms in China's coal industry that conduct R&D are more productive and their sales are higher. However, as far as the firm profitability and market shares are concerned, whether or not a firm in China's coal industry conducts R&D makes no difference. We find that foreign direct investment in China's coal mining industry leads to a significant decrease in the market share of domestic firms and its impact on productivity, sales and profitability of domestic firms is insignificant. The empirical results presented in this paper suggest that policies that encourage domestic firms in China's coal mining industries to conduct R&D can increase domestic production thereby reducing reliance on imports. Furthermore, productivity gains arising from R&D activities can also help Chinese mining firms to improve their competitive position in the international market. However, there is a need for restricting foreign direct investment in China's coal mining industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acoal industry 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3aforeign direct investment 3aimports 3amarket share 3amining 3aprofitability 3aresearch and development 3asales 3aworld markets 3aChina 0aR&D activities 0aCoal mining industry 0aProductivity 0aCoarsened exact matching 0aChina1 aAnwar, Sajid0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 Apr., v. 79 p.99-103dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008900169300001600258520127100274592002801545650002001573650001501593650002601608650001401634650001201648650001301660650001701673650001601690653002601706653004501732653002701777653002601804653001301830700001401843700001901857773009001876856008501966852000902051655001202060IND60634636520221120074632.0191220e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063463652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahebjamei, M.10aNumerical analysis of radial and angular stratification in turbulent swirling flames  ap. 523-539.  aIn this work, a numerical approach is used to investigate the effects of level and type of stratification on turbulent methane-air stratified combustion. Two different scenarios are followed to create stratified conditions. In the first scenario, the Cambridge-Sandia flames which involve inhomogeneity in the radial direction are investigated. In the second scenario, a modification is applied to the inlet of the reference burner to study the effect of adding small- and large-scale non-homogeneities in the angular direction in addition to the radial one. The impacts of radial/angular stratified combustion on various flow fields such as velocity, temperature, H2, CO, and OH mass fractions are scrutinized. More importantly, the effects of radial/angular stratification on a series of global objective parameters, including combustion efficiency, maximum flame temperature, NO formation, CO and UHC emissions, entropy generation, and pattern factor at the outlet of the combustor are examined. It is manifested that adding a moderate level of small-scale angular stratification to the radial one would be beneficial in terms of combustion efficiency (42% increase with respect to the homogeneously premixed case) and pattern factor at the outlet of a combustor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3aemissions 3aentropy 3ahydrogen 3anitric oxide 3atemperature 0aStratified combustion 0aCambridge-Sandia stratified swirl burner 0aAngular stratification 0aCombustion efficiency 0aEmission1 aAmani, E.1 aNobari, M.R.H.0 tEnergy.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 173 p.523-539dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.02.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245008900180300001500269520112200284592002801406650001501434650001901449650002601468650001201494650001301506650001801519653001801537653001801555653002601573653004301599653002201642653002101664653000801685653001301693653001101706653001301717653000901730653000901739653000701748653001101755653001001766653000801776653001001784653000701794653000801801653000801809653001101817653000901828653000801837653001101845653000901856653001001865653000901875653000801884653001001892700002101902773011001923856008202033852000902115655001202124IND60606684220221118013347.0180727e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060668422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Lorente, Ángela I.,10aRecent advances on the characterization of nanoparticles using infrared spectroscopy  ap. 97-106.  aInfrared (IR) spectroscopy provides highly discriminatory information due to the excitation of inherently specific fundamental vibrational transitions characteristic of molecular species. Nanoparticles of diverse nature have been characterized and determined using different spectroscopic techniques in the infrared range. Nanoparticles with inherent infrared absorptions or functional groups present at their surface may thus be directly characterized via infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, different ligands attached to nanoparticles may readily be identified according to their vibrational signatures in a rapid, precise, and non-destructive way. Next to the direct characterization of such materials, some nanostructures modify the local optical field, thereby yielding enhanced IR signals facilitating advanced infrared imaging procedures for nanoparticles. In this review, recent examples for the characterization of nanoparticles and their surface functionalization via IR spectroscopy are discussed, and exemplary application examples including toxicological studies and adsorption processes are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aimage analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aligands 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 0aNanoparticles 0aNanomaterials 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aSurface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy 0aFunctionalization 0aInfrared imaging 0aCDs 0aDR-FTNIR 0aDRIFTS 0aEC-IRRAS 0aFTIR 0aGQDs 0aIR 0aIR-ATR 0aIRRAS 0aMIR 0aMWNTs 0aNC 0aNIR 0aNPs 0aSEIRAS 0aSERS 0aSFG 0as-SNOM 0aSWIR 0aSWNTs 0aTERS 0aVCD 0a2D-IR1 aMizaikoff, Boris0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Nov., v. 84 p.97-106dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245021600159300002000375520054700395592002800942650002400970650001400994650001101008700001601019700002001035700001701055700002201072773012401094856007401218852000901292655001201301IND60642108520221118170415.0190506e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064210852DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07738f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKupwade, R.

Some of the key processes are water uptake and root respiration. We have developed a novel method for measuring the real-time distribution of water and oxygen concentration in the rhizosphere as a biogeochemical interface in soil. This enables understanding where and when roots are active in respect to root respiration and water uptake and how the soil responds to it. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used glass containers (15 × 15 × 1 cm), which were filled with a quartz sand mixture. Sensor foils for fluorescence dye imaging of O2 were installed on the inner side of the containers. A lupine plant was grown in each container for 2 weeks under controlled conditions. Then we took time series of fluorescence images for time-lapsed visualization of oxygen depletion caused by root respiration. Changing water content was mapped in parallel by non-invasive neutron radiography, which yields water content distributions in high spatial resolution. Also it can detect the root system of the lupine plants. By this combined imaging of the samples, a range of water contents and different oxygen concentration levels, both induced by root activities, could be assessed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We monitored the dynamics of these vital parameters induced by roots during a period of several hours. We observed that for high water saturation, the oxygen concentration decreased in parts of the container. The accompanying neutron radiographies gave us the information that these locations are spatially correlated to roots. Therefore, it can be concluded that the observed oxygen deficits close to the roots result from root respiration and show up while re-aeration from atmosphere by gas phase transport is restricted by the high water saturation. CONCLUSIONS: Our coupled imaging setup was able to monitor the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of oxygen and water content in a night and day cycle. This reflects complex plant activities such as photosynthesis, transpiration, and metabolic activities impacting the root–soil interface. Our experimental setup provides the possibility to non-invasively visualize these parameters with high resolution. The particular oxygen imaging method as well as the combination with simultaneously mapping the water content by neutron radiography is a novelty.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoil 3asand 3awater uptake 3aroots 3arhizosphere 3afluorescence 3atranspiration 3aphotosynthesis 3aoxygen 3acontainer-grown plants 3aimage analysis 3aradiography 3aglass 3asoil 3awater content 3afluorescent dyes 3aroot systems 3aquartz 3atime series analysis 3acontainers 0amethodology 0aatmosphere 0anew methods1 aEsser, Hanna G.1 aCarminati, Andrea1 aMoradi, Ahmad B.1 aHilger, André1 aKardjilov, Nikolay1 aNagl, Stefan1 aOswald, Sascha E.0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2012 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.63-74dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-011-0407-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013600170300001600306520127700322592002801599650001901627650001901646650001101665650001801676650001901694650001201713650001101725650003601736650001801772650001701790650001601807651001801823653002301841653001501864653002301879653001801902653001501920700002301935700001401958700002201972773007701994856008302071852000902154655001202163IND60546210820221122095957.0160903e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054621082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerdolini, Elena14aThe effects of expert selection, elicitation design, and R&D assumptions on experts' estimates of the future costs of photovoltaics  ap. 233-243.  aExpert elicitations of future energy technology costs can improve energy policy design by explicitly characterizing uncertainty. However, the recent proliferation of expert elicitation studies raises questions about the reliability and comparability of the results. In this paper, we standardize disparate expert elicitation data from five EU and US studies, involving 65 experts, of the future costs of photovoltaics (PV) and evaluate the impact of expert and study characteristics on the elicited metrics. The results for PV suggest that in-person elicitations are associated with more optimistic 2030 PV cost estimates and in some models with a larger range of uncertainty than online elicitations. Unlike in previous results on nuclear power, expert affiliation type and nationality do not affect central estimates. Some specifications suggest that EU experts are more optimistic about breakthroughs, but they are also less confident in that they provide larger ranges of estimates than do US experts. Higher R&D investment is associated with lower future costs. Rather than increasing confidence, high R&D increases uncertainty about future costs, mainly because it improves the base case (low cost) outcomes more than it improves the worst case (high cost) outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acost estimates 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anuclear power 3asolar energy 3auncertainty 3aUnited States 0aPhotovoltaic costs 0aEnergy R&D 0aExpert elicitation 0aSurvey design 0aHeuristics1 aAnadon, Laura Diaz1 aLu, Jiaqi1 aNemet, Gregory F.0 tEnergy Policy.g2015 May, v. 80 p.233-243dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245011100206300001600317506007600333520060100409592002801010506003701038650001801075650001201093650001901105650001101124650002501135650000901160650001101169650001901180650001201199651001701211653001801228653002301246653002801269653002601297700001701323773017601340856008101516852000901597655001201606IND60559931520221207055103.0180905e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055993152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjm.2016.06.0152doi7 aPMC54703432pmcid7 a279320822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Vikas10aDraft genome sequence of phenol degrading Acinetobacter sp.

However, the efficiency of the HDR pathway is limited in nondividing cells, which encompass most of the cells in the body. Therefore, the HDR-mediated genome-editing approach has limited in vivo applicability. Here, we discuss a mutation type-oriented viewpoint of strategies devised over the past few years to circumvent this problem, along with their possible applications and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene editing 3agenome 3amutation 3anucleases 3atranscription (genetics) 3azinc finger motif 0agene editing 0anon-dividing cells 0ain vivo 0ahomology directed repair 0anon-homologous end joining1 aBasiri, Mohsen1 aSatarian, Leila1 aCurtiss, Cameron1 aBaharvand, Hossein1 aVerfaillie, Catherine0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.770-786dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl35011x0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2018.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06166naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005000149245015900199520369900358592002804057596005604085596005104141596008904192596009404281596014004375596006004515596007804575650001904653650002304672650001504695650001404710650002304724650001404747650001004761650001404771650002704785650001404812650001404826650000904840650001904849650001404868651001004882651001304892653002104905653002404926653001704950653003504967653002305002700003305025700001805058700001505076700001705091700001805108700001705126700002305143700004305166700005505209700001505264773013205279856008405411852000905495655001205504IND60764122220221118125806.0220125e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076412222DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-21-0796-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5732-721010aFirst Report of Hemileia vastatrix (Coffee Leaf Rust) Physiological Races Emergent in Coffee Germplasm Collections in the Coffee-Cropping Regions of China  aCoffee leaf rust (CLR), caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Hemileia vastatrix, is a devastating disease worldwide leading to severe reductions in yield and economic losses in coffee plantations, especially of Coffea arabica L. (Talhinhas et al. 2017). The frequent emergence of new H. vastatrix races is a major constraint on coffee production due to continuous exertion of selective pressure on the pathogen from pathogen-resistant cultivars under the coevolutionary “arms race” (Silva et al. 2018). More than 50 physiological races of H. vastatrix have been described globally (Várzea and Marques 2005), and at least 16 H. vastatrix races have been detected in China (Bai et al. 2018; Chen 1998; Zhang et al. 2014) . Coffee is an important cash crop in China (Yan et al. 2019). The majority of coffee germplasm collections in China are located in the main coffee-cropping regions, although documentation on the prevalent H. vastatrix races is lacking. A total of 57 CLR samples (each sample contained multiple leaves with 20 to 30 pustules of coffee rust) were collected from four germplasm fields situated in the main coffee-cropping regions during the high seasonal incidence of CLR in 2018 to 2019: field 1, Coffee Germplasm Collection of Malipo County, Wenshan (23°11′ N, 104°55′ E, 550 m); field 2, Coffee Germplasm Collection I in Puer (22°47′45″ N, 100°58′59″ E, 1,320 m); field 3, Coffee Germplasm Collection II in Puer (22°37′36″ N, 100°59′50″ E, 1,010 m); and field 4, Coffee Germplasm Collection in Ruili (24°01′ N, 97°51′ E, 1,260 m). Urediniospores were recovered on susceptible genotypes 849/1 Matari and 19/1 Caturra and were tested on a set of coffee differentials at the CIFC (Oeiras, Portugal) following a standard race-typing procedure (Várzea and Marques 2005). The coffee trees where the rusts were isolated were used to verify. The infection type criteria determining virulence and avirulence were based on the classification standards for disease resistance (Várzea and Marques 2005). Twenty-seven pure-cultured H. vastatrix isolates were derived from single rust pustules taken from distinct sample groups. The predominant race XXXVII (v₂,₅,₆,₇,₉) was present in fields 1, 2, and 3 at high frequency (74.04%) separately derived from the genotypes Catuaí, Arabica-Catimor Derivatives, T2, CCC 24, Typica, T8667 Catimor HW 26/5 (F2), and Sarchimor. Race XXXIV (v₂,₅,₇,₉) was detected in field 4 (3.70%). Races XXXVII and XXXIV had emerged in China during 2011–2015 (Bai et al. 2017, 2018). A new race (v₂,₅,₆,₇) (7.41%) was isolated from the host DTART 316 and was able to infect the differentiators of physiologic groups D, E, R, 4, 6, 12, and a. Based on its pathological and genetic characteristics, H. vastatrix with high evolutionary potential has inevitably overcome the resistance of released coffee cultivars with increase virulence, thereby adapting to new hosts (McCook and Vandermeer 2015; Silva et al. 2018; Talhinhas et al. 2017; Zambolim 2016). The results obtained in this work corroborate the evidence that the emergence of new H. vastatrix races occurs preferentially at germplasm fields due to the multiselection pressures from various hosts. Our findings are of considerable importance given the potential of the coffee germplasm collections in coffee regions to promote evolution of new races. The continued emergence of new H. vastatrix races places the current commercial cultivars at risk from a loss of resistance. Monitoring the occurrence, dissemination, distribution, and pathogenicity of new races is essential for targeted resistance breeding and CLR control.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0201100cNational Key R & D Program of China  a20380cFAO/IAEA Collaborative Research Project  a320QN263cYouth Fund Project of Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province, China  a12200031cJoint Research and Technical Exchange on Coffee Rust between China and Portugal  a1630042017021cCentral Public-Interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences  aHyb2017-11cHainan Province Graduate Innovation Project  aUID/AGR/04129/2020cFoundation for Science and Technology (FCT) UNIT LEAF 3aCoffea arabica 3aHemileia vastatrix 3acash crops 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aevolution 3afungi 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aleaf rust 3apathogens 3arisk 3aurediniospores 3avirulence 3aChina 3aPortugal 0acoffee leaf rust 0aphysiological races 0aepidemiology 0adisease development and spread 0adisease management1 aVárzea, Vítor Manuel Pinto1 aXia, Qianfeng1 aXiang, Wei1 aTang, Tianle1 aZhu, Mengfeng1 aHe, Chunping1 aPereira, Ana Paula1 aLavado da Silva, Maria do Céu Machado1 aWu, Weihuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0198-84311 aYi, Kexian0 tPlant disease.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 105, no. 12 p.4162-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-21-0796-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009800171300001600269520061800285592002800903650002700931650001600958650001100974650002200985650001601007650001901023650001101042653002701053653002301080653001101103653001801114653001601132700001901148773009501167856005101262852000901313655001201322IND50087755420221119145847.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008775542DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2010.5476772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuccarini, Paolo10aTwo aquatic macrophytes as bioindicators for medium-high copper concentrations in freshwaters  ap. 503-506.  aPlant scions of Ceratophyllum demersum L. and Potamogeton natans L. were exposed in controlled conditions to different concentrations of copper during approximately 2 weeks; Fv/Fm was monitored at regular intervals and relative growth rate (RGR) was calculated at the end of the trial.

Purine intake has shown the biggest dietary impact on uric acid. To manage this situation, data on the purine content of foods are needed. To assess availability and quality of purine data and identify research gaps, we obtained data for four purine bases (adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine) in foods, alcoholic beverages, and dietary supplements. Data were predominantly from Japan, and very little from the United States. Data quality was examined using a modified version of the USDA Data Quality Evaluation System. Purine values in 298 foods/19 food groups, 15 alcoholic beverages, and 13 dietary supplements were reported. Mean hypoxanthine (mg/100 g) in the soups/sauces group was 112 and mean adenine in poultry organs was 62.4, which were the highest among all groups. Regular beer had the highest adenine (1.63 mg/100 mL) and hypoxanthine (0.96 mg/100 mL) among alcoholic beverages reported. Overall, purine was highest in animal-based products and beer. Data were limited in scope, food descriptions, and quality. Additional studies on purine content in U.S. foods may support gout management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aadenine 3abeers 3adata quality 3adietary supplements 3aeating habits 3afood groups 3agout 3aguanine 3ahypoxanthine 3alifestyle 3aobesity 3apoultry 3asauces 3asoups 3auric acid 3axanthine 3aJapan 3aUnited States1 aRoseland, Janet M.1 aHaytowitz, David B.1 aPehrsson, Pamela R.1 aErshow, Abby G.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2019 Aug. 07, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009400171500002200265520142600287592002801713650002901741650002501770650002201795650001701817650001701834650002401851650002401875650001401899650001801913650002101931650002301952650001301975650001901988650001102007651001702018651001202035653001802047653001002065653001202075653001102087653002402098653002502122653001402147700003302161700002202194700001902216700002402235773011202259856008202371852000902453655001202462IND60657061820221118154441.0190819e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065706182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, M.

Non-flavonoid compounds, such as hydroxycinnamic derivatives were identified in yacon, purple sweet potato and melloco samples, accounting for 100, 26 and 15% of the total of phenolic compounds, respectively. Mashua sample revealed the presence of flavan-3-ol monomers that were not found in the other samples, being (-)-epicatechin the most abundant (9.22 µg/g DM). Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (40.6 µg/g DM), kaempferol-O-dirhamnosil-hexoside (29.5 µg/g DM) and kaempferol-O-dihexoside (46.22 µg/g DM) were the main flavonols present in mashua, melloco and purple sweet potato, respectively, being this last specie which presented the highest concentration in flavonols (89.32 µg/g DM). Purple sweet potato also had anthocyanins (157.16 µg/g DM), not detected in the other samples. The presence of these compounds and the consideration of the total phenolic content suggest the use of these Andean tubers as promising sources of natural antioxidants of wide use in the food industry. Therefore, these tubers could be considered as novel and inexpensive sources of bioactive compounds for their potential use in functional foods and nutraceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSmallanthus sonchifolius 3aTropaeolum tuberosum 3aUllucus tuberosus 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3adietary supplements 3aflavonols 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3aphenolic compounds 3apotatoes 3asweet potatoes 3atubers 3aAndes region 3aEcuador 0aAndean tubers 0ayacon 0amelloco 0amashua 0apurple sweet potato 0aHPLC–DAD–ESI/MSn 0aflavonoid1 aEscribano-Bailón, M.

(2n = 4x = 32) can improve breeding gains. An exclusion analysis-based paternity testing SAS code, amenable to genotyping errors, is presented for autotetraploid species utilizing co-dominant molecular markers with ambiguous dosage. To demonstrate the paternity testing SAS code, 19 SSR loci were genotyped and analyzed on 1,107 progeny from a commercial, isolated, clonally replicated, 16-parent alfalfa breeding polycross which was pollinated by leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata F.). Paternal assignment success rate was over 90 %. Among typed progeny, 45 % were the result of self-fertilization. Significant differences were detected between the 15 parents that produced seed and were observed as fathers for (1) total fertilizing pollen contribution (% deviation from expectation), (2) self-fertilization rates (%), and (3) outcrossing fertilizing pollen contribution (% deviation from expectation). Physical within-cage distance between parental plants was correlated with outcrossing fertilizing pollen frequency (negative power function). Parental seed yield was positively correlated with total fertilizing pollen contribution, particularly with self-fertilization rates (42 % self-fertilization and 17 % outcrossing). These correlations suggest that selecting for increased seed yield may result in indirect selection for increased self-fertilization rates. Parental total fertilizing pollen contribution was 62 % determined by outcrossing and 35 % by self-fertilization. This study cautions alfalfa breeders that heretofore unconsidered sources of inbreeding could be present in some breeding materials. This study also provides cost effective and easy to use molecular genetic tools for detecting, managing, and/or selecting against (through breeding) those sources of inbreeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aMegachile rotundata 3aalfalfa 3acorrelation 3agenetic markers 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoutcrossing 3aparents 3apaternity 3apollen 3aprogeny 3aseed yield 3aselfing1 aJohnson, David W.1 aHeyduk, Karolina1 aRaasch, John A.1 aDarling, Mark E.1 aSandman, Jay M.0 tEuphytica.g2013 Dec., v. 194, no. 3 p.335-349dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-013-0938-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008800174300001600262500001500278520102100293592002801314650002301342650002201365650002601387650001501413650001601428650001101444650003801455650001101493650002101504653002001525700002201545700002201567700001901589700002301608700002001631773011901651856008201770852000901852655001201861IND60589173020221117192051.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058917302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-017-2450-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkošová, Kristína10aCloning and upscale production of monoamine oxidase N (MAO-N D5) by Pichia pastoris  ap. 127-133.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: To clone monoamine oxidase N, that catalyses the selective oxidative deamination or deracemisation of amines into imines, in Pichia pastoris and prove the importance of choosing the proper expression system for its recombinant production. RESULTS: Monoamine oxidase, originating from Aspergillus niger and subjected to directed evolution (MAO-N D5), was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris CBS7435 MutS strain for the first time. Various transformants were screened at microscale level. The production of the clone expressing the most active enzyme was scaled-up to a 1.5 l fermenter and preparation of MAO-N D5 as a crude enzyme extract was optimised. The obstacles in the production of the enzyme in both expression systems, Escherichia coli and P. pastoris, are discussed and demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: There was an improvement in specific productivity, which was 83 times higher in P. pastoris, clearly proving the importance of choosing the right expression host system for the specific enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adirected evolution 3aAspergillus niger 3aKomagataella pastoris 3afermenters 3adeamination 3aimines 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3aamines 3aEscherichia coli 0aPichia pastoris1 aCamattari, Andrea1 aRosenberg, Michal1 aGlieder, Anton1 aTurner, NicholasJ.1 aRebroš, Martin0 tBiotechnology letters.g2018 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.127-133dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-017-2450-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015500172500002200327520096100349592002801310650002501338650001901363650001301382650001401395650002701409650001601436650001501452650001101467650002001478650001801498650002101516650001801537650003201555651001001587653003601597653000901633653000901642653001001651653001901661700002601680700001901706700003301725700001701758700002601775773011201801856008201913852000901995655001202004IND60657061920221118154441.0190819e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065706192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2019.1032942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreu-Coll, Lucía10aFatty acid profile of fruits (pulp and peel) and cladodes (young and old) of prickly pear [Opuntia ficus-indica (L.)

Nine fatty acids were identified in fruit peel and young cladodes, eight in fruit pulp, and seven in old cladodes. Linoleic acid (C18:2), which is an essential fatty acid, was the main compound in the profile of the old cladodes, fruit peel and pulp. However, young cladodes had palmitic acid (C16:0) as the major compound. Old cladodes showed higher percentages of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids than young cladodes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were the prevailing group of fatty acids in fruits. These results suggested that prickly pear fruits have a good nutritional profile of fatty acids, rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aanimal feeding 3acladodes 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3afruit peels 3afruit pulp 3afruits 3ahuman nutrition 3alinoleic acid 3anutrient content 3apalmitic acid 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aSpain 0aOpuntia ficus-indica (L.)

Powdered Au/Ti-SiO₂ catalyst pressed into a disc was used as a membrane contactor, allowing different feeding of the reactants and providing resistance to their direct contact. The optimization of this reactor concept was performed by screening different propene, oxygen and hydrogen feeding strategies on the catalyst in order to maximize the hydrogen efficiency (propene oxide/water formation ratio). Several membrane configurations were tested and it was found that the optimal configuration was obtained by feeding propene and oxygen separately from hydrogen. The system was operated as a membrane contactor where propene and oxygen flows were forced through the catalytic membrane and the hydrogen had to reach the catalyst by counter diffusion, thereby being the limiting reactant. This creates a favorable concentration profile of the reactants that enhances the performance of the membrane reactor. The membrane thickness and resistance (porosity-tortuosity) were experimentally found to be influential on the hydrogen efficiency. The experimental results were evaluated using a comprehensive reactor model. A membrane thickness of 0.2 mm was determined to be the minimum value needed to ensure a positive effect of the membrane reactor on the hydrogen efficiency. This value can be influenced by changing the resistance of the reactants through the catalytic membrane. The combination of experimental and theoretical information leads to the optimized membrane reactor design where an excess of propene is coupled with a controlled hydrogen supply by diffusion along the catalytic membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adirect contact 3aengineering 3aepoxidation reactions 3afeeding methods 3agases 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apropylene 3ascreening1 aPerez Ferrandez, Dulce

B.10aSelf-Destructing “Mothership” Capsules for Timed Release of Encapsulated Contents  ap. 7993-7998.  aWe describe a new class of hierarchical containers that are formed via single-step assembly and, at a later time, self-destruct because of their packaged contents. These containers are spherical capsules formed by electrostatic complexation of the anionic biopolymer, gellan gum, with the cationic biopolymer, chitosan. The capsules are termed “motherships” and are engineered to carry a cargo of much smaller containers (e.g., nanoscale liposomes (“babyships”)), within their lumen. Additionally, we package an enzyme, chitosanase, in the capsule that is capable of degrading polymeric chitosan into short oligomers. Thereby, we create motherships that self-destruct, liberating their cargo of babyships into the external solution. The time scale for self-destruction can be engineered based on the internal concentration of enzyme. The motherships are stable when stored in a freeze-dried form and can be readily dispersed into water or buffer solutions at a later time, whereupon their “internal clock” for self-destruction is initiated. The above concept could be useful for the triggered release of a variety of payloads including drugs, biological therapeutics, cosmetics, and flavor ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3achitosanase 3acontainers 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aflavor 3afreeze drying 3agellan gum 3aingredients 3atherapeutics1 aBagal, Anand S.1 aRaghavan, Srinivasa R.0 tLangmuir.g2013 June 25, v. 29, no. 25 p.7993-7998dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla400883k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011600163300001600279520150000295592002801795650000801823650001801831650001201849650002001861650002201881650003001903650002901933650001101962650002301973653002201996653002002018653002302038653002302061653001902084700001702103700001502120700002302135773015302158856008202311852000902393655001202402IND60764080420221122051439.0220315e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076408042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2022.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Fushu10aIndustrial robots and air environment: A moderated mediation model of population density and energy consumption  ap. 870-888.  aThe relationship between new digital manufacturing technologies (also known as Industry 4.0) and environmental performance has become a subject of interest for both academia and policymakers. An analysis of the impact of robot usage on air environment mediated by energy consumption and moderated by population density is developed and tested using a longitudinal dataset from 74 countries and regions worldwide during 1993–2019. We find the use of robots exacerbates air pollution and climate warming because enhanced productivity and energy efficiency in light of robot usage offer an incentive to expand production and consumption, and thus increase total energy consumption that finally leads to air deterioration. By decomposing the total effect into the direct and the indirect effect, we find that, though industrial robots weakly contribute to reduction in greenhouse gas emission, the indirect adverse impact dominates the direct benefit. In addition, the nexus between robot usage and air environment is conditional on population density which, at large, mitigates the direct effect while amplifies the indirect effect of the adoption of robots on air environment. This study emphasizes the importance of energy consumption and population density in understanding the mechanisms underlying the relationship between robot usage and air environment, which provides both theoretical and practical implications for the balance of industrial intelligentization and ecological environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental performance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3apopulation density 0aIndustrial robots 0aAir environment 0aEnergy consumption 0aPopulation density 0aRebound effect1 aYang, Xinhui1 aChen, Yang1 aRegis, Paulo José0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2022 Mar., v. 30 p.870-888dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245014800168300001600316520158500332592002801917650001201945650001101957650001501968650002301983650002402006650001202030650001502042650002402057650002302081650002102104650002202125650001702147650001302164650003002177650002202207650001802229650001002247650001902257650002202276650000902298651001002307700001702317700002002334700001402354700001602368773009902384856008502483852000902568655001202577IND4446254220221120084651.0141112e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444625422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlguacil, M.M.10aPlant type differently promote the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biodiversity in the rhizosphere after revegetation of a degraded, semiarid land  ap. 167-173.  aIt is suggested that the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and their association with distinct plants species are crucial in the early stages of revegetation procedures since the AMF roots colonisation plays an important role improving plant establishment and growth. We carried out a study where we analyse the AMF community composition in the roots of Ephedra fragilis, Rhamnus lycioides, Pistacia lentiscus and Retama sphaerocarpa fourteen months after revegetation in a Mediterranean semiarid degraded area of southeast Spain in order to verify whether different plant species can variably promote the diversity of AM fungi in their rhizospheres after planted. We analysed a portion of approximately 795 bases pairs of the small-subunit ribosomal DNA by means of nested PCR, cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. Eight fungal sequence types belonging to Glomus group A and B and to the genus Paraglomus were identified. The different plant species had different AM fungal community composition. Thus, R. lycioides harboured the highest number of four fungal sequence types while from E. fragilis only two types could be characterized that were specific for this plant species. P. lentiscus and R. sphaerocarpa harboured each one three sequence types and two of them were shared. All AMF sequence types were found in the natural soil. These results show that one effective way of restoring degraded lands is to increase the number of plant species used, which would increase the AMF diversity in the soil and thus the below-ground, positive interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphedra 3aGlomus 3aParaglomus 3aPistacia lentiscus 3aRetama sphaerocarpa 3aRhamnus 3aarid lands 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3aland restoration 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere fungi 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3asemiarid zones 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3aSpain1 aTorres, M.P.1 aTorrecillas, E.1 aDíaz, G.1 aRoldán, A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.167-173dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008400165300001600249520097400265592002801239650002201267650001301289650004301302650002401345650001201369650002801381650003001409650002601439650001101465650001201476700001601488700001201504700001201516700001301528773011901541856008201660852000901742655001201751IND60589173220221117192004.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058917322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-017-2453-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanhong10aImprovement of uridine production in Bacillus subtilis by metabolic engineering  ap. 151-155.  aOBJECTIVES: To construct a Bacillus subtilis strain for improved uridine production. RESULTS: The AAG₂₈₄₆–₂₈₄₈ fragment of the pyrAB gene, encoding carbamoylphosphate synthetase, was deleted in B. subtilis TD246 leading to a 245% increase of uridine production and the conversion from glucose to uridine increased by 10.5%. Overexpression of the pyr operon increased the production of uridine by a further 31% and the conversion rate of glucose to uridine was increased by 18%.

Currently there is lack of rapid detection methods to sensitively and accurately analyze contaminations of hexavalent chromium in soil due to the challenge of complex sample pretreatment or expensive instrumentation. Here we report a rapid accurate detection platform for quantifying hexavalent chromium in soil and groundwater with ultrasensitivity. The platform consists of a novel sensor of microProbing beads and a portable microscope. Each microProbing bead was a nanoliter reactor to selectively sequestrate Cr (VI) with the enrichment factor up to 150 ×. The microProbing beads presented the signal uniformity of ~97% for the statistical colorimetric imaging analysis. Combined with a miniaturized microscope, the microProbing beads allowed for detecting aqueous Cr (VI) and soluble Cr (VI) in soil within 45 min. The platform achieved high sensitivity with the detection limits of 0.003 ppb for aqueous Cr (VI) and 0.07 ppm for soil Cr (VI). It accurately detected soil and groundwater samples from a chromium contaminated land in Yangtze River Basin of China. The consistency to the laboratory standard methods was achieved with the low cost of ~0.20 US dollar per test. The microProbing imaging platform with the operational simplicity and device portability is highly promising for the field analysis of Cr (VI) in contaminated lands.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3acolorimetry 3aenvironmental quality 3agroundwater 3ainstrumentation 3arapid methods 3arisk 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aRapid ultrasensitive detection 0aHexavalent chromium 0aMicroProbing imaging platform 0aContaminated lands 0aSoil and groundwater1 aTang, Yuchen1 aZhao, Rumeng1 aGao, Tingjuan1 aZhang, Lizhi0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 05, v. 433 p.128809-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012500163300002000288520125500308592002801563650002701591650002001618650001201638650002101650650001501671650002201686650001701708650002101725650000901746650001201755650001301767650001801780700001601798700002001814700002601834773012401860856007401984852000902058655001202067IND60666982220221122063307.0190919e20141020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066698222DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra11353e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaewtong, Chatthai10aReversible sensing of aqueous mercury using a rhodamine-appended polyterthiophene network on indium tin oxide substrates  ap. 52235-52240.  aHerein we report the synthesis, and optical and electrochemical properties of a rhodamine-appended polyterthiophene network thin film which demonstrates ion selective potentiometric, chromic and fluorescent responses. The rhodamine-appended terthiophene monomer (RhoT) was electropolymerized and deposited on an ITO electrode. Ion selective potentiometric studies have shown that the potentials of the conducting polymer films decreased upon adding Hg²⁺ because interactions of Hg²⁺ with the rhodamine-appended conducting polymer film may increase charge carrier transport properties on a conjugated polymer through rhodamine-bound Hg²⁺, reduce the doping states by interfering with ions through ion–ion interactions, and perturb the π-extended conjugated polymer through π–π interactions. Moreover, the lower detection limit of the ultrathin film sensor toward Hg²⁺ (0.10 μM) was less than that obtained from RhoT (1.34 μM), and the response time was less than 30 seconds. Reusability was evaluated by repeating dipping and rinsing cycles in aqueous Hg²⁺ and EDTA solutions. This approach may provide an easily measurable and inherently sensitive method for Hg²⁺ ion detection in environmental and biological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3adetection limit 3adipping 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescence 3aindium tin oxide 3aions 3amercury 3apolymers 3aterthiophenes1 aNiamsa, Noi1 aPulpoka, Buncha1 aTuntulani, Thawatchai0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 4, no. 94 p.52235-52240dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra11353e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015000158300002000308520098400328592002801312650001501340650001601355650001201371650001401383650002101397650001601418650001401434650001801448650001101466650003301477650001001510650001801520650001901538650001601557700002001573700001401593700001401607773013601621856007501757852000901832655001201841IND60538182020221119010909.0160815e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053818202DNAL7 a10.1021/ie502578q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xingwen10aExperimental and Theoretical Study on the Corrosion Inhibition of Mild Steel by 1-Octyl-3-methylimidazolium l-Prolinate in Sulfuric Acid Solution  ap. 16349-16358.  aA newly amino acid ionic liquid, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium l-prolinate ([Omim]Lpro), was investigated as the inhibitor for mild steel in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ solution using weight loss method, electrochemical measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and quantum chemical calculation. The obtained results revealed that [Omim]Lpro was a mixed-type inhibitor with a predominantly cathodic action for mild steel in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ solution, and inhibition efficiency reached nearly 80% at the concentration of 10 mM, in which the Omim cation played a major role in the corrosion inhibition of [Omim]Lpro. The adsorption of [Omim]Lpro on the mild steel surface was found to obey the El-Awady thermodynamic-kinetic model and Flory–Huggins isotherm equations; thus the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the adsorption process were calculated and discussed. Moreover, quantum chemical calculation gave further insight into the mechanism of inhibition of [Omim]Lpro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3acations 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3aengineering 3aequations 3aionic liquids 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asteel 3asulfuric acid 3athermodynamics 3aweight loss1 aZhang, Shengtao1 aGong, Min1 aLi, Wenpo0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 53, no. 42 p.16349-16358dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502578q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015800154300001800312500002000330520141700350592002801767650002001795650002501815650002601840650001301866650001801879650001601897650001601913650000901929650002001938650002001958650000901978650002001987650001502007650001302022650001402035650002002049650000902069650002002078650002202098650002502120700001602145700002002161700001902181700002502200773012202225856007302347852000902420655001202429IND60587876120221119135034.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058787612DNAL7 a10.1111/are.132822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, Esin10aPre‐challenge and post‐challenge haemato‐immunological changes in Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) fed argan oil against Lactococcus garvieae  ap. 4563-4572.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study investigated the effects of argan oil, obtained from Argania spinosa, on pre‐ and post‐challenge immuno‐haematological and biochemical responses of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. For this purpose, the fish were fed diets containing 0, 0.5%, 1% or 2% argan oil for 45 days. Following 45 days of feeding, fish were challenged with Lactococcus garvieae and mortality was recorded for 15 days. During the pre‐challenge period, significantly higher respiratory burst activity, total white blood cell (WBC), serum lysozyme activity and myeloperoxidase activity were determined in the argan oil‐fed groups. The serum glucose and cholesterol levels decreased whilst total protein and albumin did not change in the groups fed with argan oil‐supplemented diets. After challenge with Lactococcus garvieae, the percentage survival (%) was found to be the highest in the 1% and 2% argan oil‐supplemented feeding groups. Also, there was a significant increase in weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio in those fish fed argan oil. The results of this study indicated that after the supplementation of fish diets with argan oil, especially at 1% and 2% concentrations, the immunological, haematological and biochemical values remained similar in both the pre‐ and post‐challenge periods and the immune response against L. garvieae in Nile tilapia was modulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgania spinosa 3aLactococcus garvieae 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aalbumins 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afish 3aimmune response 3aleukocytes 3alysozyme 3amortality 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoils 3aprotein content 3arespiratory burst 3aspecific growth rate1 aAcar, Ümit1 aYılmaz, Sevdan1 aÖntaş, Canan1 aKesbiç, Osman Sabri0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.4563-4572dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.132823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011200171300001600283520131600299592002801615650001301643650001901656650001401675650001501689650001601704650002101720650001301741650001501754650001301769650001101782650001201793650002201805650001701827651001601844653001701860653001601877653002701893653002901920653001301949700001501962700002001977700001601997700002002013700002302033700002202056700002102078700001602099773012302115856008802238852000902326655001202335IND60584721120221119203748.0201111e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058472112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKloppmann, W.10aMassive arrival of desalinated seawater in a regional urban water cycle: A multi-isotope study (B, S, O, H)  ap. 272-280.  a“Man-made” or unconventional freshwater, like desalinated seawater or reclaimed effluents, is increasingly introduced into regional water cycles in arid or semi-arid countries. We show that the breakthrough of reverse osmosis-derived freshwater in the largely engineered water cycle of the greater Tel Aviv region (Dan Region) has profoundly changed previous isotope fingerprints. This new component can be traced throughout the system, from the drinking water supply, through sewage, treated effluents, and artificially recharged groundwater at the largest Soil-Aquifer Treatment system in the Middle East (Shafdan) collecting all the Dan region sewage. The arrival of the new water type (desalinated seawater) in 2007 and its predominance since 2010 constitutes an unplanned, large-scale, long-term tracer test and the monitoring of the breakthrough of desalination-specific fingerprints in the aquifer system of Shafdan allowed to get new insights on the water and solute flow and behavior in engineered groundwater systems. Our approach provides an investigation tool for the urban water cycle, allowing estimating the contribution of diverse freshwater sources, and an environmental tracing method for better constraining the long-term behavior and confinement of aquifer systems with managed recharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrinking water 3aeffluents 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic cycle 3aisotopes 3amonitoring 3aseawater 3asewage 3asolutes 3atracer techniques 3awater supply 3aMiddle East 0aDesalination 0aUrban water 0aSoil-Aquifer Treatment 0aManaged aquifer recharge 0aIsotopes1 aNegev, Ido1 aGuttman, Joseph1 aGoren, Orly1 aGavrieli, Ittai1 aGuerrot, Catherine1 aFlehoc, Christine1 aPettenati, Marie1 aBurg, Avihu0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 619-620 p.272-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05414naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005200149245010500201520356300306592002803869596007103897596003603968596004704004596005404051596005404105650000804159650001404167650001804181650001204199650001804211650001804229650001204247650002004259650001104279650001004290650001804300650001604318650001304334650001304347650001104360650001404371650001104385650001404396650001404410650001704424650001704441651001004458651001304468651001104481653002604492653003504518653001604553700001804569773013204587856008404719852000904803655001204812IND60764122920221118125945.0220125e20211230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076412292DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-21-0862-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4184-729710aFirst Report of Leaf Spot Caused by Ramularia sphaeroidea on Vicia villosa var. glabrescens in China  aHairy vetch (Vicia villosa) is widely grown in southwestern China for green manure and forage. In December 2019, a leaf disease occurred on 80% plants of V. villosa var. glabrescens in an area representing greater than 6 ha (total area planted was 8 ha) located in Qujing City (N 25°28′12″, E 103°36′22″), Yunnan Province, China. Its symptoms were irregular, brown to dark brown leaf spots with white mold. Twenty diseased leaves from five plants (four leaves per plant) were randomly collected from the field. Its pathogen was observed under a microscope and isolated from diseased leaves sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s and 1% NaClO for 1 min 15 s, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, dried between sterile filter paper, and placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). The isolates obtained were purified by transferring 1- to 2-mm emerging hyphal tips onto fresh PDA plates and grew slowly at a rate of 0.7 mm/day at 20°C for 4 weeks. A diseased plant specimen and three isolates were deposited at the Mycological Herbarium of Lanzhou University (MHLZU), under the accessions MHLZU19326 and YN1931401, YN1931402, and YN1931403, respectively. Conidia of this fungus cultured on PDA were hyaline, spherical, smooth, aseptate, and 2.13 to 3.67 × 4.56 to 5.77 μm (n = 50), and conidiophores were hyaline, smooth, and straight. DNA of purified isolates was extracted, and the ITS, tef1-α, his3, and gapdh genes were amplified and sequenced with primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF2 (Carbone and Kohn 1999; O’Donnell et al. 1998), CylH3F/CylH3R (Crous et al. 2004), and gpd1/gpd2 (Berbee et al. 1999), respectively. DNA sequences of the strains YN1931401, YN1931402, and YN1931403 were deposited in GenBank for the ITS (GenBank accession nos. MW092181, MW332205, and MW332206), tef1-α (MW448172 to MW448174), his3 (MW448175 to MW448177), and gapdh (MW448178 to MW448180). These regions showed similarities with other sequences of Ramularia sphaeroidea in GenBank of 99% (514/516, 515/517, and 514/517 base pairs) for the ITS, 99% (402/403, 403/405, and 405/405 base pairs) for tef1-α, 99% (377/378, 378/378, and 376/378 base pairs) for his3, and 100% (558/557, 557/559, and 561/565 base pairs) for gapdh. These sequences were used for constructing a phylogenetic tree. The fungus was morphologically and molecularly identified as R. sphaeroidea. Infection experiments were carried out with 50 plants of this plant species in 10 pots (five seedlings per pot). A conidial suspension from YN1931401 was prepared by adding sterile distilled water and scraping the cultures with a sterile scalpel. The leaves of 25 healthy plants were sprayed with a conidial suspension of 1.0 × 10⁶ conidia/ml with 0.01% Tween 80; control plants consisted of 25 plants that received a sterile water spray. All plants were covered with clear polyethylene bags for 3 days to maintain high humidity and kept in a greenhouse at day (18°C, 18-h light) and night (22°C, 6-h dark). Ten days postinoculation, the inoculated plants exhibited brown lesions similar to symptoms in the fields, whereas no symptoms appeared on the control plants. The same fungus was reisolated and identified as outlined above. To our knowledge, R. sphaeroidea has also occurred on V. fabae and V. sativa in Ethiopia and Israel (Braun 1998), and it is also reported on V. cracca in China (Zhang et al. 2006), but not on V. villosa in China yet. Therefore, this is the first report of R. sphaeroidea causing leaf spot on hairy vetch (V. villosa) in China.  aPublisher supplied data  a19ZD2NA002cGansu Provincial Science and Technology Major Projects  cProgram for Changjiang Scholars  aCARS-34cChina Agriculture Research System  aIRT_17R50cInnovative Research Team in University  a2018IC074cAcademician Workstation of Zhibiao Nan 3aDNA 3aRamularia 3aVicia villosa 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3aculture media 3aethanol 3afoliar diseases 3aforage 3afungi 3agreen manures 3agreenhouses 3aherbaria 3ahumidity 3ahyphae 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolyethylene 3apolysorbates 3aChina 3aEthiopia 3aIsrael 0aRamularia sphaeroidea 0aVicia villosa var. glabrescens 0ahairy vetch1 aLi, Yan Zhong0 tPlant disease.g2021 Dec. 30, v. 105, no. 12 p.4159-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-04-21-0862-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04132naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010800176300001600284506002800300520280500328592002803133506003703161650001403198650000903212650001103221650001403232650001403246650000903260650001003269651001003279651001403289651001003303651001403313653001503327653002003342653001503362653001503377700002103392773018603413856009003599852000903689655001203698IND60739760120221207103948.0200116e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073976012DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2019-2-124-1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoskutova, N.

The first, the longest and the only pre-war expedition to Indonesia and Ceylon was undertaken by Prof. V. V. Markovich; it lasted three years (1926–1928). He explored Java, Singapore and Ceylon, where he collected 772 germplasm samples. In 1957, D. V. Ter-Avanesyan, who worked as an agricultural attaché at the USSR Embassy in India, familiarized himself in every detail with plant resources and agriculture in Nepal. The late 1960s were marked by intensification of plant genetic resources introduction and new opportunities to organize regular collecting missions. In the period from 1960 to 1991, there were five plant exploration trips to Indonesia, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and Nepal. In 1960, D. V. Ter-Avanesyan visited scientific institutions in Java, got acquainted with the main trends in agriculture, and collected 302 plant samples. In 1974, A. G. Lyakhovkin took part in a specialized collecting mission launched to study and collect wild forms and cultivars of rice and various other crops from Nepal. The team visited 16 experiment stations and farms and collected 1170 accessions. In 1985, an expedition team led by E. F. Molchanov collected and studied wild and cultivated forms of subtropical plants in Sri Lanka. The team visited 5 institutes and experiment stations, 3 botanical gardens, and collected 370 accessions. In 1988, another collecting team led by L. A. Burmistrov, whose task was to study the system of nation-wide projects on crop improvement, traveled over four provinces, visited 11 scientific and academic institutions of Nepal, and collected 766 germplasm samples. The last collecting trip to Indonesia was led by N. G. Musatenko in 1991. The team collected 95 varieties and wild forms. In total, the Institute’s collecting and exploration activities in Indonesia, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and Nepal added 3496 accessions to its collections. In addition to direct collecting in Indonesia, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and Nepal, VIR has always been replenishing its holdings by seed requests. During the whole pre-war period, from 1925 through 1941, 256 germplasm accessions were added. All in all, from 1948 through 2018, 104 accessions were introduced from Indonesia, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and Nepal. The greatest number of accessions received by the Institute represented groat crops (over 1400), followed by wheat and barley (458), and industrial crops (627).

That is why the characteristics of biofilm generated naturally in Seriola lalandi culture cages were analysed, their potential benefit to the growth of larvae was studied, and their controlled use for improving the larval viability and as a vector to improve incorporation of previously studied probiotic bacteria was tested. According to biodiversity results, these biofilms are composed of a diatom–bacteria mix showing a decrease in biodiversity in laboratory culture conditions being dominated by Navicula phyllepta and bacteria of the family Rhodobacteraceae. This can be produced on mesh substrates incorporated in bioreactors with rapid growth rate and adhesiveness. Preliminary results from the addition of substrates with this specific biofilm in larvae culture systems showed that it is consumed by the larvae without negative effects, while positive effects on the viability of larvae in combination with probiotics were observed. Considering preliminary results, the addition of these specific substrates with diatom–bacteria biofilms could be a good improvement for aquaculture systems and together with the use of probiotics can contribute to maintaining a stable and controlled system improving the viability of the larval fish culture in its early stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNavicula 3aRhodobacteraceae 3aSeriola lalandi 3aadhesion 3aaquaculture systems 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3afish culture 3afish larvae 3amicroalgae 3aprobiotics 3aviability1 aLuza, Maria Francisca1 aRiquelme, Carlos E0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Aug., v. 48, no. 8 p.4308-4320dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.132533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017500167520143500342592002801777650001901805650001901824650002101843650001601864650001001880650001901890650001901909650001501928650001401943650001401957650001101971650001901982650001902001650001902020650001502039653002302054653002902077653002802106653002302134653001602157700001702173700001602190700001402206700001302220700001602233700001802249700001702267700001302284773011402297856008602411852000902497655001202506IND60772453920221120095904.0220614e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077245392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haidong10aComplete mineralization of phenolic compounds in visible-light-driven photocatalytic ozonation with single-crystal WO3 nanosheets: Performance and mechanism investigation  aComplete mineralization of phenolic compounds into CO₂ and H₂O is desirable for removing them in wastewater, but it is challenging due to the generated recalcitrant intermediates, which requires highly effective advanced oxidation process with proper catalysts. Herein, we found that single-crystal WO₃ nanosheets (NSs)-based photocatalytic ozonation (PCO) can realize complete mineralization of phenols (phenol and 2-chlorophenol) under visible light irradiation. Almost 100% mineralization ratio of phenols was achieved through WO₃ NSs-based PCO system within short time. By comparing their performances with those of polycrystalline WO₃ nanoparticles, detecting and analyzing the intermediates, identifying the dominant radicals and conducting some electrochemical characterizations, the origin of superior catalytic activity of WO₃ NSs was uncovered, the mineralization pathways and the overall mechanism were proposed. The excellent PCO performance of WO₃ NSs was contributed to their nanosheet morphology with single-crystal microstructure and good dispersion, which can provide continuous interior channels for the photogenerated charge transport from the bulk to surface of WO₃ NSs and enough active sites for the surface reactions triggered by these charges. This work puts forwards new ideas to design highly active photocatalysts for PCO and helps deepen understanding of the catalytic mechanism of PCO.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-chlorophenol 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3airradiation 3alight 3amicrostructure 3amineralization 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atungsten oxide 3awastewater 0aSingle-crystal WO3 0aPhotocatalytic ozonation 0aComplete mineralization 0aPhenolic compounds 0aOxalic acid1 aWang, Mingxi1 aYan, Jiabao1 aDang, Hui1 aZhu, Hui1 aLiu, Yuejin1 aWen, Meicheng1 aLi, Guisheng1 aWu, Ling0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 05, v. 433 p.128811-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03733naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012400161520175300285592002802038650002502066650003402091650001702125650001402142650002302156650001602179650001302195650001002208650001502218650001402233650001702247650001602264650001702280650002302297650001302320650001002333650002102343650002102364650001302385650001302398653001502411653003402426653002202460653001902482653001402501653000702515653000702522653000802529653000702537653000802544653000902552653000702561653001102568653000802579653001002587653001002597653000702607653000902614653000902623653000702632653000702639653000802646653000802654653000902662653000802671653000802679700001302687700001402700700001802714773011602732856008202848852000902930655001202939IND60729039920221121220306.0220606e20210612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072903992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRan, Deng10aProperties and molecular mechanisms underlying geniposide-mediated therapeutic effects in chronic inflammatory diseases  aGeniposide (GE) is ubiquitous in nearly 40 species of plants, among which Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis has the highest content, and has been used ethnopharmacologically to treat chronic inflammatory diseases. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis has a long history of usage in detumescence and sedation, liver protection and cholestasis, hypotension and hemostasis. It is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, jaundice hepatitis, sprain and contusion. As a type of iridoid glycosides extracted from Gardenia jasminoides J. Ellis, GE has many pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenesic, anti-oxidative, etc. In this article, we reviewed the sources, traditional usage, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and therapeutic effect of GE on chronic inflammatory diseases, and discussed its potential regulatory mechanisms and clinical application. GE is a common iridoid glycoside in medicinal plants, which has strong activity in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. A large number of in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that GE has certain therapeutic value for a variety of chronic inflammation disease. Its mechanism of function is mainly based on its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, neuroprotective properties, as well as regulation of apoptotsis. GE plays a role in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, realizing the dynamic balance of pro/anti-inflammatory factors, improving the state of oxidative stress, and restoring abnormally expressed inflammation-related pathways. According to its extensive pharmacological effects, GE is a promising drug for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGardenia jasminoides 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acholestasis 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3ahemostasis 3ahepatitis 3ahypertension 3ahypotension 3ainflammation 3airidoid glycosides 3ajaundice 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3asedation 3atoxicity 0aGeniposide 0aChronic inflammatory diseases 0aAnti-Inflammatory 0aAnti-oxidation 0aApoptosis 0aAA 0aAD 0aALI 0aAS 0aCIA 0aFLSs 0aGE 0aGLP-1R 0aI/R 0aMAPKs 0aMLNLs 0aOA 0aPBLs 0aPI3K 0aPK 0aRA 0aROS 0aS1P 0aT2DM 0aTCM 0aTLR1 aHong, Wu1 aYan, Wang1 aMengdie, Wang0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 June 12, v. 273 p.113958-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013100158300002000289500001500309520144300324592002801767650001901795650001701814650003301831650004401864650001701908650002001925650002301945650002801968650001201996650001302008653002302021700001502044700001602059700001502075700001402090700001702104700001602121773012402137856007402261852000902335655001202344IND60618568620221120042146.0181030e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061856862DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02550a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jingwei10aApplication of electrodialysis to extract 5′-ribonucleotides from hydrolysate: efficient decolorization and membrane fouling  ap. 29115-29128.  a2019-12-06  aIn order to simplify the process of extracting 5′-ribonucleotides from hydrolysate in industry in an environmentally friendly manner, electrodialysis was introduced as an alternative route. The feasibility of electrodialysis for the separation of 5′-ribonucleotides from hydrolysate was investigated using a series of membranes under different conditions. The results of the lab-scale experiments indicate that ChemJoy membranes are most suitable for the separation of 5′-ribonucleotides. At a current density of 13.2 A m⁻² or constant voltage of 30 V in batch operation, the yield of 5′-ribonucleotides reaches 97.2% and 95.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the decolorization ratio of 91.6% indicates that most pigments are blocked by the membranes and the current efficiency reaches 70% for guanosine 5′-monophosphate (GMP) production. Remarkably, the 5′-ribonucleotides are 1.3-times more concentrated. Finally, membrane fouling was investigated via SEM and ATR-FTIR, and the TingRun, ChemJoy and Astom cationic membranes showed the same membrane fouling resistance. However, among the anionic membranes, ChemJoy showed the best fouling resistance. The total energy cost of the pilot-scale operation was estimated to be 155.44 $ per t 5′-ribonucleotides. This process integrates preliminary purification, decolorization and concentration, providing a simple, cost-effective and green way to produce 5′-ribonucleotides.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecolorization 3ahydrolysates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aenergy costs 3aelectrodialysis 3acost effectiveness 3aguanosine monophosphate 3afouling 3apigments 0aelectric potential1 aKuang, Han1 aZhuang, Wei1 aChen, Yong1 aLiu, Dong1 aYing, Hanjie1 aWu, Jinglan0 tRSC advances.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 8, no. 51 p.29115-29128dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02550a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002000172245005400192300001600246520194300262592002802205650002702233650001502260650001402275650001302289650001802302650001902320650002102339650000702360650001502367650002802382650002802410650004902438650002002487650002302507650003402530650003002564700002502594700002002619700002002639773011902659856008902778852000902867655001202876IND4468482520221120143305.0141111e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446848252DNAL7 a222808882pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMytilinaios, I.10aGrowth curve prediction from optical density data  ap. 169-176.  aA fundamental aspect of predictive microbiology is the shape of the microbial growth curve and many models are used to fit microbial count data, the modified Gompertz and Baranyi equation being two of the most widely used. Rapid, automated methods such as turbidimetry have been widely used to obtain growth parameters, but do not directly give the microbial growth curve. Optical density (OD) data can be used to obtain the specific growth rate and if used in conjunction with the known initial inocula, the maximum population data and knowledge of the microbial number at a predefined OD at a known time then all the information required for the reconstruction of a standard growth curve can be obtained. Using multiple initial inocula the times to detection (TTD) at a given standard OD were obtained from which the specific growth rate was calculated. The modified logistic, modified Gompertz, 3-phase linear, Baranyi and the classical logistic model (with or without lag) were fitted to the TTD data. In all cases the modified logistic and modified Gompertz failed to reproduce the observed linear plots of the log initial inocula against TTD using the known parameters (initial inoculum, MPD and growth rate). The 3 phase linear model (3PLM), Baranyi and classical logistic models fitted the observed data and were able to reproduce elements of the OD incubation-time curves. Using a calibration curve relating OD and microbial numbers, the Baranyi equation was able to reproduce OD data obtained for Listeria monocytogenes at 37 and 30°C as well as data on the effect of pH (range 7.05 to 3.46) at 30°C. The Baranyi model was found to be the most capable primary model of those examined (in the absence of lag it defaults to the classic logistic model). The results suggested that the modified logistic and the modified Gompertz models should not be used as Primary models for TTD data as they cannot reproduce the observed data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aabsorbance 3aequations 3ainoculum 3alinear models 3alogit analysis 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3aprediction 3apredictive microbiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aLogistic Models 2aModels, Biological 2aNephelometry and Turbidimetry 2aPredictive Value of Tests1 aSoliḣ, Muḣammad,1 aSchofield, H.K.1 aLambert, R.J.W.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 154, no. 3 p.169-176dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015200169520161200321592002801933650002201961650001801983650001402001650001402015650001402029650001402043650001702057650001402074650002402088650001702112650001802129650001002147650001002157650001002167650002102177650001702198650001202215650001302227650002502240650001102265651001102276651000902287653001702296653002202313653002102335653001702356653001402373653002002387653001002407653000902417700002002426700002302446700002502469700001802494700006302512700001702575773011502592856008202707852000902789655001202798IND60729040020221119235110.0220606e20210523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072904002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKianpour, Fatemeh14aThe protective effects of Ziziphora tenuior L. against chlorpyrifos induced toxicity: Involvement of inflammatory and cell death signaling pathways  aZiziphora tenuior L. is used as a medicinal plant in treatment of various diseases such as gastric disorders, stomach ache, dysentery, uterus infection, gut inflammation and menstruation. Aim of the study: In the present study, the protective effects of Ziziphora tenuior extract against chlorpyrifos (CPF), the most commonly or popularly used insecticide in Asia and Africa were investigated in liver and lung tissues with emphasis in apoptotic and inflammatory pathways in rat model. Materials and methods: The experiments were performed by gavage of male rats for 8 weeks. The extract of Z. tenuior was administrated at three different doses (40, 80, 160 mg/kg). 6.75 mg/kg CPF was administrated as the maximum tolerable dose based on our previous study. Results: Our data indicated that CPF can increase the expression of some inflammatory genes (IL-6, TLR-2, IL-1β, TNF-α, and NLPR3) and apoptosis genes (Caspase 3, Caspase 9, Caspase 8 and Bax). On the other hand, it can down regulate Bcl-2 gene expression. Post-treatment of Z. tenuior extract in CPF- treated rats showed significant decrease in apoptotic and inflammatory gene expression in the liver and lung due to its anti-apoptotic effects which confirmed by Bcl-2 gene overexpression. Conclusion: The present study suggested that Z. tenuior extract, as a traditional treatment can be able to moderate CPF toxicity via significant effect on inflammatory and apoptotic cell death signaling pathway. Also, based on our preliminary data, it is suggested that Z. tenuior extract can prevent the adverse effects of CPF in liver and lung tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphora tenuior 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3achlorpyrifos 3adysentery 3agene overexpression 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3alungs 3amales 3amedicinal plants 3amenstruation 3astomach 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3auterus 3aAfrica 3aAsia 0aChlorpyrifos 0aZiziphora tenuior 0aOxidative stress 0aInflammation 0aApoptosis 0aGene expression 0aLiver 0aLung1 aMohseni, Mahtab1 aBeigmohamadi, Mina1 aYazdinezhad, Alireza1 aRamazani, Ali1 aHosseini, Mir-Jamal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4469-94881 aSharafi, Ali0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 May 23, v. 272 p.113959-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1139593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010700177300001400284520100300298592002801301650001401329650001201343650001201355650000901367650002201376650001901398650001801417650001501435650002001450650002201470650002501492650000901517653001801526653001901544653002001563653001201583700003001595700001701625773009801642856008701740852000901827655001201836IND60628505620221121190610.0190402e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062850562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinakawa, Alyne F.K.10aSimple ultrasound method to obtain starch micro- and nanoparticles from cassava, corn and yam starches  ap. 11-18.  aStarch nanoparticles (SNP) were produced employing a simple ultrasound method without chemical additives from cassava, corn, and yam starches, which contain 18%, 25% and 30% amylose, respectively.

Nevertheless, not all patients benefit from such treatment, suggesting that their tumors may be resistant to PI3K inhibitors. The investigation of the underlying mechanisms and efficacious personalized treatment remain a large unmet need. In this study, we revealed an IL6-STAT3 positive feedback loop that mediated the resistance to PI3K inhibitors. We found that breast cancer cells with acquired resistance to PI3K inhibitors displayed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) features and an highly enriched cancer stem cells (CSCs), secreting ∼1000-fold more IL6 than parental cells. Further studies elucidated that activation of the IL6-STAT3 signaling effectively triggered EMT action, expanded the CSCs population, and reduced sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 disrupted the IL6-STAT3 signaling and overcome resistance to PI3K inhibitors partially due to increased apoptosis induction. Taken together, our results demonstrated that feedback activation of the IL6-STAT3 loop lead to acquired resistance to PI3K inhibitors by promoting EMT and CSC-like features, and suggested that targeting this loop may be an efficient strategy to overcome resistance to PI3K inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3aclinical trials 3ahumans 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3astem cells 0aPIK3CA 0aPI3K inhibitor 0aResistance 0aEpithelial–mesenchymal transition 0aCancer stem cell 0aBreast cancer1 aHan, Siqi1 aSun, Yong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Oct. 24, v. 453 p.582-587dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.09.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245013800182300001600320520109300336592002801429650001701457650002501474650001201499650002601511650002601537650001301563773008601576856008101662852000901743655001201752IND60554644020221119035639.0161024e20151225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2014.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFessner, W.-D.q(Wolf-Dieter),10aSystems Biocatalysis: Development and engineering of cell-free “artificial metabolisms” for preparative multi-enzymatic synthesis  ap. 658-664.  aSystems Biocatalysis is an emerging concept of organizing enzymes in vitro to construct complex reaction cascades for an efficient, sustainable synthesis of valuable chemical products. The strategy merges the synthetic focus of chemistry with the modular design of biological systems, which is similar to metabolic engineering of cellular production systems but can be realized at a far lower level of complexity from a true reductionist approach. Such operations are free from material erosion by competing metabolic pathways, from kinetic restrictions by physical barriers and regulating circuits, and from toxicity problems with reactive foreign substrates, which are notorious problems in whole-cell systems. A particular advantage of cell-free concepts arises from the inherent opportunity to construct novel biocatalytic reaction systems for the efficient synthesis of non-natural products (“artificial metabolisms”) by using enzymes specifically chosen or engineered for non-natural substrate promiscuity. Examples illustrating the technology from our laboratory are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzymes 3ametabolic engineering 3aproduction technology 3atoxicity0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Dec. 25, v. 32 p.658-664dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2014.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012900167500001900296520172100315592002802036650001102064650002202075650001002097650002202107650001202129653002502141653004202166653001902208653001902227653001302246653001802259700002202277700001402299773011102313856008802424852000902512655001202521IND60729040420221119234818.0210401e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072904042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.1107402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, A.13aAn evaluation of the Acsádi and Nemeskéri Complex Method of adult age estimation in a modern South African skeletal sample  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Acsádi and Nemeskéri Complex Method is a multifactorial adult age estimation method that makes use of weighting systems. The Complex Method employs the use of four skeletal elements in assessing age, including the degree of endocranial suture closure, age-related changes to the pubic symphyseal surface, and the internal structural changes observable in the proximal humerus and femur. Acsádi and Nemeskéri reported a very optimistic error margin of ±2.5 years when all four skeletal elements were used. Despite these promising results, the Complex Method’s effectiveness has been questioned, suggesting that it results in a constant over- and underestimation of age in younger and older groups, respectively. In this study, the Complex Method was tested on a modern South African skeletal sample (n = 313) with individuals of known age-at-death. Results from this study to some extent justify the critique levelled against the Complex Method’s tendency to over- and underestimate age. Nevertheless, the Complex Method still performed surprisingly well for certain skeletal element combinations. Contrary to Acsádi and Nemeskéri’s findings, the use of all four skeletal elements did not provide more accurate age estimates. For the most part, combinations making use of three or two skeletal elements outperformed the use of all four skeletal indicators. Results from this study indicate caution in using a blanket approach when it comes to deciding on the best combination of skeletal elements used in multifactorial methods. It is suggested that the Complex Method may be optimised by making use of sex- and population-specific skeletal element combinations and weighting systems in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aage determination 3afemur 3aforensic sciences 3ahumerus 0aAdult age estimation 0aForensic anthropology population data 0aComplex Method 0aMultifactorial 0aSkeletal 0aSouth African1 avan der Merwe, AE1 aSteyn, M.0 tForensic science international.g2021 Apr., v. 321 p.110740-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.1107403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008200162300001600244500002000260520212400280592002802404650001502432650001802447650002302465650001302488650002202501650001702523650001302540650002002553650001302573650002402586650002202610650002202632650001002654700002102664700002102685700001902706700002102725700002002746700002802766700002302794773013302817856007802950852000903028655001203037IND60586798920180209000000.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058679892DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2017000462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRotter, Pavel10aIs glomalin an appropriate indicator of forest soil reactive nitrogen status?  ap. 694-704.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this paper we address total glomalin‐related soil protein (T‐GRSP) as a possible indicator of differences in forest soils related to reactive nitrogen and forest composition. We focused especially on the relationship between T‐GRSP (g kg⁻¹), soil organic carbon (SOC), and reactive nitrogen (Nᵣ) availability among different categories of temperate forests and different horizons. Our study included 105 sampling sites divided into 5 categories, which vary in elevation and tree species composition (coniferous, deciduous, mixed). We detected significantly higher T‐GRSP and SOC in the F+H horizon under conifers. We assume that this observation might be attributed to suppression of decomposition of T‐GRSP and SOC by nature of coniferous litter. The lack of significant differences in T‐GRSP/SOC among the categories and the positive correlations between T‐GRSP and SOC in most of the categories confirmed the strong relationship of T‐GRSP with SOC. We found a significantly higher content of T‐GRSP in the F+H horizon for all studied forest categories. However, the contribution of T‐GRSP to SOC is significantly higher in the A horizon, which might be caused by stabilization of glomalin by mineral fraction, including clay minerals or by the belowground origin of glomalin. We found the increase of SOC with increasing Nᵣ in the A horizon for most categories of forest. T‐GRSP follows this trend in the case of deciduous forests (decid), mixed forest (mixed), and mountain forests (mount). On the other hand, we detected a decrease of T‐GRSP with increasing Nᵣ in the F+H horizon of coniferous forests (conif). Moreover the T‐GRSP/SOC decreases with the increase of Nᵣ in the A horizon of conif, mixed and mount, which points to the higher sensitivity of forest with prevalence of coniferous trees. Our observations have confirmed an ecosystem‐specific relationship between T‐GRSP, SOC and Nᵣ. We concluded that T‐GRSP in combination with T‐GRSP/SOC has the potential to reveal qualitative changes in soil organic matter (SOM) connected with increasing Nᵣ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aclay minerals 3aconiferous forests 3aconifers 3adeciduous forests 3aforest soils 3aglomalin 3amontane forests 3anitrogen 3asoil organic carbon 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate forests 3atrees1 aMaly, Stanislav,1 aSáňka, Ondřej1 aSáňka, Milan1 aČižmár, David1 aZbíral, Jiří1 aČechmánková, Jarmila1 aKalábová, Tereza0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2017 Dec., v. 180, no. 6 p.694-704dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.2017000463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245008600177300001400263520107800277592002801355650003101383650001501414650002001429650001601449650001101465650002301476650001801499650001801517650002001535650001701555653001701572653003101589653002301620653001201643653003301655700001901688700002201707700002301729700005801752773012001810856009001930852000902020655001202029IND60539196820221120074238.0190214e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053919682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroenewald, Wilma10aDifferential spontaneous folding of mycolic acids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis  ap. 15-22.  aMycolic acids are structural components of the mycobacterial cell wall that have been implicated in the pathogenicity and drug resistance of certain mycobacterial species. They also offer potential in areas such as rapid serodiagnosis of human and animal tuberculosis. It is increasingly recognized that conformational behavior of mycolic acids is very important in understanding all aspects of their function. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, in vacuo, of stereochemically defined Mycobacterium tuberculosis mycolic acids show that they fold spontaneously into reproducible conformational groupings. One of the three characteristic mycolate types, the keto-mycolic acids, behaves very differently from either α-mycolic acids or methoxy-mycolic acids, suggesting a distinct biological role. However, subtle conformational behavioral differences between all the three mycolic acid types indicate that cooperative interplay of individual mycolic acids may be important in the biophysical properties of the mycobacterial cell envelope and therefore in pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3acell walls 3adrug resistance 3afatty acids 3ahumans 3amolecular dynamics 3apathogenicity 3aserodiagnosis 3astereochemistry 3atuberculosis 0aMycolic acid 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis 0aMolecular dynamics 0aFolding 0aPrinciple component analysis1 aBaird, Mark S.1 aVerschoor, Jan A.1 aMinnikin, David E.1 aCroft, Anna K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5330-150X0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2014 May, v. 180 p.15-22dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:jnl20199x0009-30847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2013.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245010000166300001400266500001500280520094100295592002801236650001901264650002501283650002301308650002001331650001101351650003001362650002401392650001801416653000801434653002701442653001601469653002001485653001301505653001801518700002201536700001801558700002001576773011701596852000901713856008101722655001201803IND4416490820221117220249.0181020e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441649082DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080904882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerkhoff, Kirsten10aDevelopment of a DNA-analytical Method for the Identification of Animal Hair Fibers in Textiles  ap. 69-75.  a2019-12-04  aDuring the last several years, the demand of animal natural fibers for the production of high-quality textiles has increased worldwide, especially in Europe, Japan and North America. Due to the restricted availability and the high prices, adulteration and false declaration are common. Usually, fiber analysis is done by scanning electron microscopy, but this method is very time-consuming and expensive, and results strongly depend on processing stage and expertise of the microscopist. For these reasons, reliable methods are required to determine the composition and the proportion of distinct animal fibers in yarns, fabrics and garments, irrespective of their processing conditions. In this study, a DNA-analytical method is presented to unequivocally identify cashmere/cashgora, fine wool, yak and camel hair (Bactrian camel, dromedary) in untreated and treated (washed, bleached, dyed) fibers samples, as well as in fiber blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3atextile fibers 3aproduct authenticity 3aCamelus bactrianus 3aanimal taxonomy 3acamels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aCamelus dromedarius 3acashmere wool 0aPCR 0aspecies identification 0adromedaries 0aBactrian camels 0acashmere 0aanimal fibers1 aCescutti, Gabriel1 aKruse, Lothar1 aMüssig, Jörg,0 tTextile research journal.g2009 Jan., v. 79, no. 1 p.69-75dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080904883Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02715naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013800155300001800293520153300311592002801844650002301872650002201895650001301917650001401930650001701944650002201961650001501983650001701998650001102015650001102026700002002037700002402057700003602081773014102117856007402258852000902332655001202341IND60641913620221119035912.0190506e20170221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064191362DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta09035d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yanuo10aMicro-solid state energy conversion membranes: influence of doping and strain on oxygen ion transport and near order for electrolytes  ap. 3900-3908.  aEnhancing the efficiency of micro-energy conversion devices through engineering of the structure–transport relationship is a prerequisite toward next generation micro-electrolysers and fuel cells. Here, oxygen ion conducting free-standing thin films are key elements, forming buckled and strained membranes for gas exchange and energy conversion. The electro-chemo-mechanics of free-standing membranes vs. substrate-supported films are investigated as model device structures to study the factors influencing the ionic transport, and answer the fundamental question: how strongly does solid solution doping vs. lattice strain affect the defect-induced oxygen ion transport in buckled electrolyte membrane films for solid state micro-devices? Importantly, we demonstrate that tuning the electro-chemo-mechanics of doped ceria films can influence the ionic transport through the effect of opposed strained volumes altering the clustering of oxygen vacancy defects. Strain is studied by comparing flat substrate-supported films to compressive buckled membrane devices and observing subsequent changes in atomistic near order via Raman spectroscopy. The buckling resulted in a significant increase of the activation energy for ionic transport, greater than classical extrinsic doping. The power of electro-chemo-mechanic engineering of ceramic films is demonstrated in finding the best strategy for optimizing ionic conduction and thereby enhancing future performance in thin film electrolytes for micro-energy conversion devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aceramics 3achemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3afuel cells 3agas exchange 3amodels 3aoxygen1 aGarbayo, Iñigo1 aMuralt, P.q(Paul),1 aMarguerite Rupp, Jennifer Lilia0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Feb. 21, v. 5, no. 8 p.3900-3908dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta09035d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245011400203300001800317500002000335520135900355592002801714650001101742650001701753650001101770650001301781650001401794650001401808650001101822650001601833650001001849650001501859700001601874700001801890700001401908700001601922700001801938700001601956700001201972700001501984700001501999700001802014700001902032700001302051773012502064856007902189852000902268655001202277IND60744257720221120210622.0210712e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074425772DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.157962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haipeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7163-094510aComparative analysis of volatile and carotenoid metabolites and mineral elements in the flesh of 17 kiwifruit  ap. 3023-3032.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKiwifruit contains abundant nutritive compounds and is highly favored by the consumers worldwide. Therefore, detailed metabolic profiling is important to provide theoretic basis for the improvement of kiwifruit quality. In this study, the levels of volatiles, carotenoids, and mineral elements in the flesh of 17 kiwifruit accessions were evaluated. Acids and esters were the main volatiles in kiwifruit. During these 17 kiwifruit accessions, “Chenhong,” three “Jinyan,” and two “Guichang” germplasms were specifically rich in aromatic esters, which might be associated with their special taste. The main carotenoids were lutein, β‐carotene, and zeaxanthin, and their levels were also genotype specific, with the green‐fleshed “Guichang” having the highest level of carotenoids, and red‐fleshed “Fuhong” and “Chenhong” being rich in zeaxanthin. Partial correlation analysis showed that the contents of some mineral elements were significantly correlated with those of specific volatiles and carotenoids, indicating the impacts of mineral elements on the accumulation of volatiles and carotenoids in the kiwifruit flesh. These results indicated that the contents of carotenoids and volatiles seemed to be affected by mineral elements and also provided a new potential method for improving fruit flavor quality in production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflavor 3afood science 3afruits 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3akiwifruit 3alutein 3ametabolites 3ataste 3azeaxanthin1 aMo, Xiaoqin1 aTang, Dongmei1 aMa, Yuhua1 aXie, Yunxia1 aYang, Hongbin1 aShi, Meiyan1 aLi, Lin1 aLi, Wenyun1 aYan, Fuhua1 aZhang, Yajuan1 aZhang, Hongyan1 aXu, Juan0 tJournal of food science.g2021 July, v. 86, no. 7 p.3023-3032dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.157963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002100144245007600165300001600241500001500257520150200272592002801774650001901802650002001821650002401841650002701865650002001892650001701912653002501929653002601954653002301980653002602003653002702029653001502056653002102071700001702092700001802109700002202127700001802149773011902167852000902286856008102295655001202376IND4416490620221117220219.0181020e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441649062DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175080934182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Oudiani, Asma10aElastic Recovery and Viscoelastic Behavior of Agave americana L. Fibers  ap. 166-178.  a2019-12-04  aThe aims of this work were to study the viscoelastic behavior and the elastic recovery of Agave americana L. fibers. The results were considered in the context of an earlier study examining the mechanical properties of this natural fiber. Comparative investigations among three types of fiber extraction were made: raw fibers manually extracted, fibers extracted in distilled water, and fibers extracted in seawater. Two different approaches were used. The first approach considered structural effects by studying the changes of structure at different levels. In this case, atomic and molecular effects were taken into account. To further characterize the mechanical behavior of Agave americana L. fibers, a rheological constitutive model was developed using data from axial tension tests. The best model to explain the viscoelastic behavior of Agave americana L. fibers was the modified generalized Maxwell model. The values obtained for elastic recovery were influenced by the test conditions such as studied in this work: type of extraction, relative humidity, time for which the specimen was held at constant strain. The recovery curves of raw fibers and distilled water extracted fibers were very close to each other, while seawater extracted fibers had the best elastic recovery of any of the fibers tested. The study of the surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy contributed to a greater understanding of the fibers' mechanical behavior and in particular their elastic recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3atextile fibers 3aviscoelasticity 3amathematical models 3aelasticity (mechanics) 3aAgave americana 3aplant fibers 0arheological modeling 0aviscoelastic behavior 0aAgave americana L. 0amechanical properties 0arheological properties 0aextraction 0aelastic recovery1 aSghaier, Ben1 aM'sahli, Slah1 aChaabouni, Yassin1 aSakli, Faouzi0 tTextile research journal.g2009 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.166-178dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080934183Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03039naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008700165300001800252500001100270520195700281592002802238650002402266650002402290650001502314650001302329650001502342650002202357650002402379650001902403650002402422700002102446700001902467773010302486856007902589852000902668655001202677IND60580818120221119111412.0171002e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058081812DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.129052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarios, Loralee10aIncorporating the effects of generalist seed predators into plant community theory  ap. 1856-1867.  aREVIEW  aPost‐dispersal seed predators contribute substantially to seed loss across many ecosystems. Most research has focused on understanding sources of variation in seed loss, without appreciating the implications of seed predation for plant coexistence, community assembly and broader community theory. Meanwhile, research aimed at understanding coexistence and community assembly processes in plant communities has focused on axes of dispersal and resource competition and the traits influencing these processes, without accounting for the role of generalist seed predators. We review the unique features of post‐dispersal seed predation and assess the implications of seed loss on three critical components of plant community organization – coexistence, community structure and plant invasions – pointing to both important gaps in theory and empirical knowledge. We highlight how understanding fundamental controls on plant recruitment is central to determining how seed predation affects plant recruitment and coexistence. We discuss how accounting for seed predator foraging strategies may shift trait‐based inferences of community assembly. Synthesis. We argue that seed predation by generalist consumers, which is pervasive in temperate communities, should be better incorporated into plant community theory. Experiments that specifically incorporate the presence and attributes of the seed predator community and that follow seed fate would fill important knowledge gaps. Particularly needed are studies focused on strengthening the connections between seed removal and plant establishment and linking selective and density‐dependent foraging strategies to plant traits. Advancing our understanding of the processes regulating plant coexistence and community assembly requires that future research not only acknowledge but also incorporate generalist consumers’ effects on plant communities.

In this work, we applied the same procedure to a complex of MDM2 protein and the transactivation domain of p53 protein (TAD-p53), the latter of which is known to be very flexible in the unbound state. Using 30 independent MD simulations in PaCS-MD, we successfully generated 25 dissociation pathways of the complex, which showed complete or partial unfolding of the helical region of TAD-p53 during the dissociation process within an average simulation time of 154.8 ± 46.4 ns. The standard binding free energy obtained in combination with one-dimensional-, three-dimensional (3D)- or Cα-MSM was in good agreement with those determined experimentally. Using 3D-MSM based on the center of mass position of TAD-p53 relative to MDM2, the dissociation rate constant was calculated, which was comparable to those measured experimentally. Cα-MSM based on all Cα coordinates of TAD-p53 reproduced the experimentally measured standard binding free energy, and dissociation and association rate constants. We conclude that the combination of PaCS-MD and MSM offers an efficient computational procedure to calculate binding free energies and kinetic rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3adissociation 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3atranscriptional activation1 aKitao, Akio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5221-08060 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 123, no. 11 p.2469-2478dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b103093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010100156300002000257520104900277592002801326650002201354650000901376650001501385650001401400650001801414650001301432650001401445650002201459650002101481700001901502700002001521700001701541773012401558856007401682852000901756655001201765IND60618569320221120042330.0181030e20180621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061856932DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra02618a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yingjie10aNon-isothermal TGA study on the combustion reaction kinetics and mechanism of low-rank coal char  ap. 22909-22916.  aIn this paper, the combustion reaction kinetics of pyrolysis char of low-rank coal is studied by thermal analysis technology. For the combustion process of the char at different heating rates, the reaction kinetic parameters were calculated by three common mode-free methods (FWO method, KAS method and Starink method); the reaction model was determined by Malek method and Popescu method. Research shows that activation energy Eα of char combustion calculated by the three methods was 110.66–70.31 kJ mol⁻¹, 104.35–59.60 kJ mol⁻¹ and 104.34–59.99 kJ mol⁻¹, respectively, and the activation energy decreased with increasing conversion rates. There is a compensation effect between the activation energy and pre-exponential factor of char combustion. Results of the kinetic analysis by Malek method and Popescu method both indicated that the Avrami–Erofeev equation (n = 3/2) (f(α) = 3/2(1 − α)[−ln(1 − α)]¹/³) controlled by nucleation and nuclei growth models is the most probable reaction model of char combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acoal 3acombustion 3aequations 3agrowth models 3akinetics 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3athermal analysis1 aWang, Zhiqiang1 aCheng, Xingxing1 aMa, Chunyuan0 tRSC advances.g2018 June 21, v. 8, no. 41 p.22909-22916dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra02618a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016400166300001200330520171000342592002802052650002502080650002002105650001902125650002802144650001202172650001202184650001102196650002502207650001302232650001602245650001102261650001502272650001502287650001302302650002102315650001302336650002302349650002402372650003102396650002002427650001302447650001602460650002002476650001502496651001002511653001602521653001602537653002002553653002502573653001702598700001402615700001602629700001602645700001502661773008302676856008502759852000902844655001202853IND60624980520221121065508.0210105e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062498052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Z.H.12aA four year study in a desert land area on the effect of irrigated, cultivated land and abandoned cropland on soil biological, chemical and physical properties  ap. 1-8.  aDesert lands occupy vast areas in northwest China and have been undergoing intensive changes in land use. As land uses are considered key drivers of biogeochemical cycles in desert lands, we questioned what effects these changes are having on the biological, physical and chemical properties of the soil. We examined five different land use schemes: (1) natural desert land; (2) abandoned land that was formerly cultivated; (3) barley cultivated land; (4) alfalfa (Medicago sativa) cultivated land; and (5) Astragalus adsurgens cultivated land. The three cultivated lands were irrigated and received fertilizer. Measurements were made after 4 years of annual planting and harvesting or 4 years of cropland abandonment. In previous studies, equivocal results have been reported when examining the effect of land cultivation and land abandonment on soil properties. In the present study, total soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents increased significantly in the cultivated lands; whereas, they declined in the abandoned cropland when compared to the natural desert land. We concluded that the increase in these parameters in the cultivated fields was most likely due to the irrigation practice, which enhanced the growth of microorganisms and of plants and increased carbon sequestration. The decrease in the abandoned field was most likely due, at least in part, to the relatively short period between the land abandonment and measurements. More time was required for vegetation regrowth and increased carbon sequestration. It is recommended to consider the costs and benefits of carbon sequestration when planning agricultural management practices like growing annual crops and legume forage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus laxmannii 3aMedicago sativa 3aabandoned land 3aagricultural management 3aalfalfa 3aannuals 3abarley 3acarbon sequestration 3acropland 3afertilizers 3afields 3aharvesting 3airrigation 3aland use 3amicrobial growth 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus content 3aphysical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplants (botany) 3aregrowth 3asoil carbon 3asoil properties 3avegetation 3aChina 0aDesert land 0aCultivation 0aLegume planting 0aCarbon sequestration 0aSoil quality1 aCao, J.J.1 aDegen, A.A.1 aZhang, D.W.1 aLong, R.J.0 tCatena.g2019 Apr., v. 175 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245008800174300001400262520154200276592002801818596003801846650002101884650002901905650001301934650002501947650001801972650001301990650001302003650002202016650001102038650001702049650001202066650001902078650001102097651001102108700002002119700002002139700001902159773013202178856008202310852000902392655001202401IND60657957420221118000747.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065795742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-019-10009-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussenes, Aina Lundon10aEffects of nitrogen split application on seasonal N2O emissions in southeast Norway  ap. 41-56.  aNitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from cultivated soils correlate positively with the amount of N-fertilizer applied, but a large proportion of the annual N₂O emission occurs outside the cropping season, potentially blurring this correlation. We measured the effect of split-N application (total N addition varying from 0 to 220 kg N ha⁻¹) on N₂O emissions in a spring wheat plot trial in SE Norway from the time of split-N application until harvest, and during the following winter and spring thaw period. N₂O emissions were largest in the two highest N-levels, whereas yield-scaled emission (N₂O intensity) was highest in the 0 N treatment. Nitrogen yield increased by 23% when adding 80 kg N ha⁻¹ compared to adding 40 kg N ha⁻¹ as split application, while corresponding N₂O emissions were reduced by 16%. No differences in measured emissions between the N-fertilization levels were observed during the winter period or during spring thaw. Measurements of soil air composition below the snow pack revealed that N₂O production continued throughout winter as the concentration in the soil air increased from 0.37 to 30.0 µL L⁻¹ N₂O over the 3 months period with continuous snow cover. However, only 7–28% of the N₂O emitted during spring thaw could be ascribed to accumulated N₂O, indicating de novo production of N₂O in the thawing soil. The direct effect of split-N fertilizer rate on N₂O emissions in sub-boreal cereal cropping was limited to the first 15–21 days after N-addition.  aPublisher supplied data  aNFR 207829cNorges Forskningsråd 3afertilizer rates 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3asnowpack 3asoil air 3asplit application 3aspring 3aspring wheat 3athawing 3atotal nitrogen 3awinter 3aNorway1 aKorsaeth, Audun1 aBakken, Lars R.1 aDörsch, Peter0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2019 Sept., v. 115, no. 1 p.41-56dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-019-10009-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245006300211300001600274506007600290520126500366592002801631506003701659650001501696650001801711650002001729650002201749650001501771650001901786650001501805650002201820700001701842773008601859856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60554644720221207062114.0161024e20151225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2014.12.0092doi7 aPMC45719922pmcid7 a255791922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradley, Robert W.10aDesigner cell signal processing circuits for biotechnology  ap. 635-643.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroorganisms are able to respond effectively to diverse signals from their environment and internal metabolism owing to their inherent sophisticated information processing capacity. A central aim of synthetic biology is to control and reprogramme the signal processing pathways within living cells so as to realise repurposed, beneficial applications ranging from disease diagnosis and environmental sensing to chemical bioproduction. To date most examples of synthetic biological signal processing have been built based on digital information flow, though analogue computing is being developed to cope with more complex operations and larger sets of variables. Great progress has been made in expanding the categories of characterised biological components that can be used for cellular signal manipulation, thereby allowing synthetic biologists to more rationally programme increasingly complex behaviours into living cells. Here we present a current overview of the components and strategies that exist for designer cell signal processing and decision making, discuss how these have been implemented in prototype systems for therapeutic, environmental, and industrial biotechnological applications, and examine emerging challenges in this promising field.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiologists 3abiotechnology 3adecision making 3adisease diagnosis 3ametabolism 3amicroorganisms 3aprototypes 3asynthetic biology1 aWang, Baojun0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Dec. 25, v. 32 p.635-643dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2014.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245013300211300001800344506007600362520169300438592002802131506003702159650002202196650002102218650001602239650002002255650001902275650001102294650001302305650003002318650001202348650001102360650001402371650002002385650001202405650002202417653001402439653002002453653003302473653002002506653001202526700002302538700002302561700002302584700002102607700002302628700002802651700002502679700002502704700001602729700002402745773019102769856007902960852000903039655001203048IND60230476320221207053650.0150614e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023047632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14129841122doi7 aPMC42992122pmcid7 a255481722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarissimo, Guillaume10aAntiviral immunity of Anopheles gambiae is highly compartmentalized, with distinct roles for RNA interference and gut microbiota  ap. E176-E185.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArboviruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and other arthropods to humans and animals. The risk associated with these viruses is increasing worldwide, including new emergence in Europe and the Americas. Anopheline mosquitoes are vectors of human malaria but are believed to transmit one known arbovirus, o’nyong-nyong virus, whereas Aedes mosquitoes transmit many. Anopheles interactions with viruses have been little studied, and the initial antiviral response in the midgut has not been examined. Here, we determine the antiviral immune pathways of the Anopheles gambiae midgut, the initial site of viral infection after an infective blood meal. We compare them with the responses of the post-midgut systemic compartment, which is the site of the subsequent disseminated viral infection. Normal viral infection of the midgut requires bacterial flora and is inhibited by the activities of immune deficiency (Imd), JAK/STAT, and Leu-rich repeat immune factors. We show that the exogenous siRNA pathway, thought of as the canonical mosquito antiviral pathway, plays no detectable role in antiviral defense in the midgut but only protects later in the systemic compartment. These results alter the prevailing antiviral paradigm by describing distinct protective mechanisms in different body compartments and infection stages. Importantly, the presence of the midgut bacterial flora is required for full viral infectivity to Anopheles , in contrast to malaria infection, where the presence of the midgut bacterial flora is required for protection against infection. Thus, the enteric flora controls a reciprocal protection tradeoff in the vector for resistance to different human pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aRNA interference 3aarboviruses 3adisease vectors 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amalaria 3amidgut 3apathogens 3arisk assessment 3atissues 3avirus replication 0aarbovirus 0ainsect immunity 0ahost–pathogen interactions 0ainnate immunity 0amalaria1 aPondeville, Emilie1 aMcFarlane, Melanie1 aDietrich, Isabelle1 aMitri, Christian1 aBischoff, Emmanuel1 aAntoniewski, Christophe1 aBourgouin, Catherine1 aFailloux, Anna-Bella1 aKohl, Alain1 aVernick, Kenneth D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Jan. 13, v. 112, no. 2 p.E176-E185dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14129841123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006200138245012100200300001800321500002000339520209900359592002802458650002302486650001202509650001502521650001102536650001502547650002202562700002102584700002002605700002102625700002302646700001902669700002102688700002802709773010802737856007302845852000902918655001202927IND60593549920221117222937.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059354992DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.22162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoscher, Christiane1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9301-790910aOrigin context of trait data matters for predictions of community performance in a grassland biodiversity experiment  ap. 1214-1226.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant functional traits may explain the positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning, but species‐level trait variation in response to growth conditions is often ignored in trait‐based predictions of community performance. In a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), we measured traits on plants grown as solitary individuals, in monocultures or in mixtures. We calculated two measures of community‐level trait composition, i.e., community‐weighted mean traits (CWM) and trait diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy; FD) based on different contexts in which traits were measured (trait origins). CWM and FD values of the different measurement origins were then compared regarding their power to predict community biomass production and biodiversity effects quantified with the additive partitioning method. Irrespective of trait origin, models combining CWM and FD values as predictors best explained community biomass and biodiversity effects. CWM values based on monoculture, mixture‐mean or community‐specific trait data were similarly powerful predictors, but predictions became worse when trait values originated from solitary‐grown individuals. FD values based on monoculture traits were the best predictors of community biomass and net biodiversity effects, while FD values based on community‐specific traits were the best predictors for complementarity and selection effects. Traits chosen as best CWM predictors were not strongly affected by trait origin but traits chosen as best FD predictors varied strongly dependent on trait origin and altered the predictability of community performance. We conclude that by adjusting their functional traits to species richness and even specific community compositions, plants can change community‐level trait compositions, thereby also changing community biomass production and biodiversity effects. Incorporation of these plastic trait adjustments of plants in trait‐based ecology can improve its predictive power in explaining biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3aentropy 3agrasslands 3amodels 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity1 aSchumacher, Jens1 aGubsch, Marlén1 aLipowsky, Annett1 aWeigelt, Alexandra1 aBuchmann, Nina1 aSchmid, Bernhard1 aSchulze, Ernst‐Detlef0 tEcology.g2018 May, v. 99, no. 5 p.1214-1226dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.22163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015600172300001600328520135900344592002801703650001701731650001901748650001001767650001601777650002401793650001001817650001701827650001601844650003101860650000901891650001101900650001301911650002301924650004001947653002701987653002402014653001702038653001102055653001202066653000902078700002102087700002002108700002302128700001802151700002202169773012102191856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60533083320221119073130.0160728e20141024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053308332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.09.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshikawa, Noritada10aDown-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor by HEXIM1 attenuates myocardial angiogenesis in hypoxic mice  ap. 600-605.  aPulmonary hypertension (PH) sustains elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and ultimately leads to right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and failure and death. Recently, proangiogenic factors hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been known to promote left ventricular myocardial angiogenesis and lead to cardiac hypertrophy, and this would be involved in RV hypertrophy of PH patients. Previously, we revealed that overexpression of HEXIM1 prevents endothelin-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and hypertrophic genes expression, and that cardiomyocyte-specific HEXIM1 transgenic mice ameliorates RV hypertrophy in hypoxia-induced PH model. Given these results, here we analyzed the effect of HEXIM1 on the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF and on myocardial angiogenesis of RV in PH. We revealed that overexpression of HEXIM1 prevented hypoxia-induced expression of HIF-1α protein and its target genes including VEGF in the cultured cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, and that cardiomyocyte-specific HEXIM1 transgenic mice repressed RV myocardial angiogenesis in hypoxia-induced PH model. Thus, we conclude that HEXIM1 could prevent RV hypertrophy, at least in part, via suppression of myocardial angiogenesis through down-regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF in the myocardium under hypoxic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acardiomyocytes 3adeath 3afibroblasts 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahypertension 3ahypertrophy 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3amice 3amodels 3apatients 3atransgenic animals 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aPulmonary hypertension 0aCardiac hypertrophy 0aAngiogenesis 0aHEXIM1 0aHIF-1α 0aVEGF1 aShimizu, Noriaki1 aOjima, Hidenori1 aKobayashi, Hiroshi1 aHosono, Osamu1 aTanaka, Hirotoshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Oct. 24, v. 453 p.600-605dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.09.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015200172300001400324520165100338592002801989596006502017650002302082650002102105650001202126650001302138650001202151650001202163650002102175650001502196650001702211650001902228650001402247650001402261650002102275650002502296650001402321650002202335650001602357650000902373651003102382700002202413700001902435700002302454700002602477773013202503856008202635852000902717655001202726IND60657957520221118000744.0190816e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065795752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-019-10011-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Cabrera, Joel10aAmending marginal sandy soils with biochar and lignocellulosic fermentation residual sustains fertility in elephantgrass bioenergy cropping systems  ap. 69-83.  aPerennial grasses offer potential for high lignocellulosic biomass yields on marginal land that can be used for conversion to biofuels. However, fertilizer nutrient inputs are often required to maintain high yields. This study evaluated biochar and fermentation residuals as alternative supplemental nutrient sources for elephantgrass (Pennisetum purpureum (L.) Schum.) feedstock production. Treatments were (1) 50 kg N ha⁻¹ (E50); (2) 50 kg N ha⁻¹ + fermentation residual (E50FR); (3) 50 kg N ha⁻¹ + biochar (E50BC); and (4) 250 kg N ha⁻¹ (E250). The E50 treatment was not enough to sustain elephantgrass yields over time, as E250 biomass yields were greater in years 3 and 4 compared with E50. Residual amendments had little effect on yield. Plant N concentration in E250 (7.5 g kg⁻¹) was twofold greater compared with all other treatments along with generally greater N removal. Residuals were largely unable to supply additional N, as they did not increase tissue N concentrations or N removal compared with E50. Across years, soil P and Ca levels were 59 and 46% lower, respectively, for E50 and E250 than for E50FR and E50BC, which maintained nearly constant levels throughout the study. Application of biochar (E50BC) increased soil concentrations of Mg, B, Zn, and Mn. Supplemental nutrients are needed to sustain long-term elephantgrass productivity on marginal land of the southeastern U.S. Bioenergy residuals may fill this role when combined with low fertilizer N and possibly K inputs. Identifying optimal amendment application rates will be important to prevent excess accumulation of some elements.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012-67009-19596cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acropping systems 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3alignocellulose 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrients 3aperennial grasses 3asandy soils 3azinc 3aSoutheastern United States1 aErickson, John E.1 aLeon, Ramon G.1 aSilveira, Maria L.1 aSollenberger, Lynn E.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2019 Sept., v. 115, no. 1 p.69-83dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-019-10011-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245008700213300001600300520084600316592002801162650002201190650001301212650001301225650001101238650002201249650002501271650001701296650002001313650002901333650001301362650002001375650001301395650002101408650001801429650001801447650001301465651001101478700006001489700003301549700002601582700002401608700002701632773008601659856008101745852000901826655001201835IND60554644920221119035534.0161024e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCremonez, Paulo André1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4454-810210aEnvironmental, economic and social impact of aviation biofuel production in Brazil  ap. 263-271.  aThe Brazilian aviation industry is currently developing biofuel technologies that can maintain the operational and energy demands of the sector, while reducing the dependence on fossil fuels (mainly kerosene) and greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite the great potential of these fuels, there is a significant need for improved routes of production and specifically for lower production costs of these materials. In addition, the productive chains of raw materials for obtaining these bioenergetics can be linked to environmental impacts by NOx emissions, extensive use of agricultural land, loss of wildlife and intensive water use, as well as economic, social and political impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aaviation 3abiofuels 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aenvironmental impact 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3akerosene 3anitrogen oxides 3apolitics 3aproduction costs 3araw materials 3asocial impact 3awildlife 3aBrazil1 aFeroldi, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9190-76761 ade Oliveira, Carlos de Jesus1 aTeleken, Joel Gustavo1 aAlves, Helton José1 aSampaio, Silvio Cézar0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Mar. 25, v. 32 p.263-271dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03650naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006000187245007700247300001800324506007600342520184100418592002802259506003702287650003702324650002402361650001702385650002102402650001102423650001902434650002102453650001302474650000902487650000902496650001402505650001102519650001302530650001802543650001302561650002102574650001302595650001102608650000702619700001902626700005902645700005802704700001802762700002002780700005802800773013602858856008102994852000903075655001203084IND60633709420221207100515.0190604e20190228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063370942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b119942doi7 aPMC67273792pmcid7 a308137312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalomäki, Mikko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6190-207310aPolydopamine Nanoparticles Prepared Using Redox-Active Transition Metals  ap. 2513-2524.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAutoxidation of dopamine to polydopamine by dissolved oxygen is a slow process that requires highly alkaline conditions. Polydopamine can be formed rapidly also in mildly acidic and neutral solutions by using redox-active transition-metal ions. We present a comparative study of polydopamine nanoparticles formed by autoxidation and aerobic or anaerobic oxidation in the presence of Ce(IV), Fe(III), Cu(II), and Mn(VII). The UV–vis spectra of the purified nanoparticles are similar, and dopaminechrome is an early intermediate species. At low pH, Cu(II) requires the presence of oxygen and chloride ions to produce polydopamine at a reasonable rate. The changes in dispersibility and surface charge take place at around pH 4, which indicates the presence of ionizable groups, especially carboxylic acids, on their surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the presence of three different classes of carbons, and the carbonyl/carboxylate carbons amount to 5–15 atom %. The N 1s spectra show the presence of protonated free amino groups, suggesting that these groups may interact with the π-electrons of the intact aromatic dihydroxyindole moieties, especially in the metal-induced samples. The autoxidized and Mn(VII)-induced samples do not contain metals, but the metal content is 1–2 atom % in samples prepared with Ce(IV) or Cu(II), and ca. 20 atom % in polydopamine prepared in the presence of Fe(III). These differences in the metal content can be explained by the oxidation and complexation properties of the metals using the general model developed. In addition, the nitrogen content is lower in the metal-induced samples. All of the metal oxidants studied can be used to rapidly prepare polydopamine at room temperature, but the possible influence of the metal content and nitrogen loss should be taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aautoxidation 3acarboxylic acids 3acopper 3adispersibility 3adissolved oxygen 3adopamine 3aions 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3apH1 aOuvinen, Tuomo1 aMarttila, Lauri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8221-09541 aKivelä, Henri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1414-88931 aLeiro, Jarkko1 aMäkilä, Ermei1 aLukkari, Jukka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9409-79950 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 123, no. 11 p.2513-2524dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b119943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245009600206300001800302520149700320592002801817650002201845650001201867650002101879650001001900650001201910650002301922700001901945700001801964700001901982700006102001773013602062856008002198852000902278655001202287IND60633709520221121011645.0190321e20190226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063370952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b124192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekker, Gert-Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8385-569310aDynamic Docking of a Medium-Sized Molecule to Its Receptor by Multicanonical MD Simulations  ap. 2479-2490.  aA medium-sized and highly flexible inhibitor to the enzyme β-secretase 1 (BACE), which produces the amyloid β-peptide by cleavage of its precursor protein, was dynamically docked into the large and wide catalytic cleft of BACE that binds to the amyloid-precursor by employing multicanonical molecular dynamics (McMD) simulations. We applied our method to predict the native binding configuration and sample the intermediary structures connecting this natively bound state to the unbound one. Representative structures located at free energy minima obtained from McMD were taken and subjected to canonical simulations to refine and validate them, reproducing the native complex structure in agreement with the experimental data in the most stable structure, i.e., the one at the global minimum. In addition, the binding free energy was estimated by umbrella sampling (US) simulations along representative pathways obtained from the McMD ensemble, followed by weighted histogram analysis to estimate the affinity, which also reproduced the experimental inhibitory affinity. Interestingly, the loss of interactions between the two molecules along the pathway was clearly shown in the free energy landscape, reiterating the fundamental importance of atomistic interactions to the binding affinity between receptor and drug compound. The sampled ensemble by the US simulations smoothly connected the bound and unbound states, refining the binding pathway while staying true to the McMD ensemble.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aamyloid 3abinding capacity 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3amolecular dynamics1 aAraki, Mitsugu1 aOshima, Kanji1 aOkuno, Yasushi1 aKamiya, Narutoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0527-69680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 26, v. 123, no. 11 p.2479-2490dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b124193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520117700293592002801470650001601498650002401514650002401538650001601562650001701578650001401595650002201609650001301631650002001644650003101664650001001695650002501705650001201730650001801742650002201760650001401782650004301796650005201839650002401891650002401915700001601939700001801955700001801973700001701991700001902008700001902027773008602046856008102132852000902213655001202222IND60554645020221119035505.0161024e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Wanjun10aMolecular cloning and characterization of a β-1,3-glucan recognition protein from Plutella xylostella (L.)  ap. 290-299.  aThe β-glucan recognition proteins (βGRPs) play a significant role as important pattern recognition proteins (PRPs) for recognizing conserved surface determinants of pathogens and trigger complex signaling pathways in invertebrates. In the present study, a full-length cDNA 1793bp encoding 479 amino acids and βGRP1 was obtained from Plutella xylostella by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (designed as P×βGRP1) which showed significant similarities with other insect's βGRPs. The transcription level was constitutively expressed and upregulated by microbial induction in all life stages of P. xylostella. Tissue distribution showed P×βGRP1 to be mainly expressed in fat body as detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Subsequent to knock down the P×βGRP1 expression and the transcripts of Toll-like receptor, cecropin 1 and cecropin 2 decreased in P. xylostella. Meanwhile, the bacterial colonies increased and the expression of four AMP genes decreased on injection of anti-P×βGRP1 into Bombyx mori.

While it proved to be a good biological control agent, its rapid spread and buildup of large populations made it a nuisance, since it overwinters in homes, emits unpleasant odors, stains fabrics, occasionally bites humans and feeds on apples, pears and grapes. Aside from the above, the ravenous appetite of H. axyridis results in their consumption of harmless native insects, including even other ladybird beetles. A study of the natural enemies of H. axyridis in Denmark revealed the presence of nematodes. The present study describes this nematode parasite and discusses aspects of its development and ecology. METHODS: Adult harlequin ladybird beetles were collected from March to November from four localities in Copenhagen on different plant species. In addition, groups of last-instar larvae and pupae (n = 50) were examined for the presence of nematodes. Living and recently dead nematodes were removed from adult H. axyridis in 0.5% saline solution, the nematodes were then heat killed (at 75C), fixed in 5% formalin and transferred to glycerin on slides for further examination and measurements. RESULTS: A new species of Allantonematidae (Tylenchida), Parasitylenchus bifurcatus n. sp., is described from adults of the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis in Denmark. The new species is characterized by a straight stylet lacking basal thickenings, a bursa and a forked tail tip in the vermiform (infective) females and juvenile males. The new species is compared with P. coccinellinae previously described from ladybird beetles in France. Parasitism resulted in depletion of the fat body and partial or complete atrophy of the reproductive organs of the beetles. Infections occurred throughout the year with rates of parasitism reaching up to 35%. The rate increased to 60% when field-collected ladybirds were incubated for 30 days in the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: The production of subsequent generations within the host with only the fertilized females (not the males) leaving the hosts and the absence of parasitism of the larvae and pupae is an impressive developmental modification of P. bifurcatus. It is proposed that the vermiform (infective) females pass from one adult host to another when the beetles are hibernating or in assemblage groups. Rates of parasitism show that P. bifurcatus could be a significant biological control agent of H. axyridis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aparasites 3aapples 3afeeds 3agrapes 3apupae 3aodors 3aadults 3aparasitism 3abiological control agents 3aatrophy 3amales 3aHarmonia axyridis 3afat body 3apears 3aformalin 3anew species 3afemales 3aParasitylenchus 3ahumans 3ahosts 3aappetite 3aheat 3atail 3afabrics 3alarvae 3aAphidoidea 3astylets 3aindigenous species 3anatural enemies 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxparasitology. 2aFemale 2aLarvaxparasitology 2aMale 2aMicroscopy 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aTylenchidaxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxisolation & purification. 3aFrance 3aDenmark 0aDenmark 0aTylenchida1 aSteenberg, Tove0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.218-218dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-2183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011300163300001600276520216600292592002802458650003202486650002302518650001502541650001602556650001002572650002002582650001202602650001302614650002402627650002002651650002002671650001502691700002802706700002002734700001602754773008602770856008102856852000902937655001202946IND60554645120221119035551.0161024e20150325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xueqing10aRemoval of carbamazepine and naproxen by immobilized Phanerochaete chrysosporium under non-sterile condition  ap. 282-289.  aThis study explored the utilization of a white-rot fungus (WRF), Phanerochaete chrysosporium, immobilized in wood chips, to remove carbamazepine and naproxen under non-sterile condition. The removal efficiencies for both pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in artificially contaminated water were improved by 4% for naproxen and 30% for carbamazepine in seven days, compared to without wood chips. Although adsorption was crucial at the early stage, bioremoval was found to be the main removal mechanism for both PhACs. The extracellular enzymes played important roles in the naproxen removal, while the intracellular enzyme system was responsible for the carbamazepine removal. The increased of intracellular enzyme activity through the immobilization of WRF cells may contribute to the significantly enhanced removal efficiency for carbamazepine. In addition, the removal of naproxen or carbamazepine slightly increased when both compounds coexisted, compared to the system where the two pharmaceuticals existed separately. Based on the batch experimental results, a fixed-bed bioreactor packed with a mixture of WRF mycelia pellets and wood chips was developed and operated with the intermittent feeding and continuous aerating mode for 28 days under non-sterile condition, with naproxen and carbamazepine spiked into the influent at 1.0mgL−1. Almost complete removal of naproxen and 60-80% removal of carbamazepine were obtained in the first two weeks. However, the removal efficiencies for both compounds suddenly dropped to as low as less than 20% by the 14th day, possibly due to the contamination by other microorganisms in the reactor. After the addition of 8.25% sodium hypochlorite at the ratio of 1:100 (v/v) into the influent tank on both Day 20 and Day 25, a rapid recovery (higher than 95%) was achieved in the naproxen removal, by effectively inhibiting contamination in the reactor. In comparison, the same rebounding phenomenon was not observed for carbamazepine and this difference may be associated to the various enzyme-working systems. A longer hydraulic retention time (HRT) was conducive to improve the removal of both compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aactive ingredients 3aadsorption 3abioreactors 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3amycelium 3asodium hypochlorite 3awater pollution 3awhite-rot fungi 3awood chips1 ade Toledo, Renata Alves1 aWang, Shengpeng1 aShim, Hojae0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Mar. 25, v. 32 p.282-289dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007000171300001800241520152900259592002801788650001901816650001501835650001901850650001701869650001601886650001801902650002301920650002001943650001901963650001101982650002501993650001202018650001902030650001802049650000902067650001302076650002602089650001902115650001302134650004302147653000802190653001002198653000902208653000902217653000702226653000802233653000702241653000702248653000802255653000702263653000802270653001502278653001302293653002002306653001002326653001802336700001702354700001402371773009202385856008402477852000902561655001202570IND60111987020221120074701.0161020e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011198702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaojiao,10aOverexpression of human Argonaute2 inhibits cell and tumor growth  ap. 2553-2561.  aArgonaute (Ago) proteins are essential for the biogenesis and function of ~20–30 nucleotide long RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Ago expression increases or decreases under various physiological conditions, although the functional consequences are unknown. In addition, while reduced global miRNA production was shown to enhance cellular transformation and tumorigenesis, how Ago proteins contribute to human diseases has not been reported.Ago2, an essential Ago isoform in mammals, was stably expressed in 293T, the human embryonic kidney cell line, and H1299, the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. miRNA and mRNA expression was investigated by quantitative PCR and microarray profiling. Cell proliferation and migration was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and scratch assay in the cell cultures, respectively. How Ago2 affected cell growth in vivo was determined by H1299 xenograft tumor growth in mice. Changes in Ago2 expression in human lung cancer samples were investigated by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry.Stable Ago2 overexpression elicited specific changes in miRNA and mRNA expression in both 293T and H1299 cells. It also inhibited cell proliferation and migration in cell cultures as well as xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Ago2 expression was lower in human lung adenocarcinomas than in the paired, non-cancerous tissues.We concluded that changes in Ago2 expression might have significant physiological and pathological consequences in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3abiogenesis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell culture 3acell growth 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3agene expression 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aAgo 0amiRNA 0aGSEA 0aqPCR 0aCq 0aMTT 0aWT 0aMT 0aFDR 0aES 0aNES 0aArgonaute2 0amicroRNA 0aGene expression 0alet-7 0aTumorigenesis1 aGraves, Paul1 aZeng, Yan0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2013 Mar., v. 1830 p.2553-2561dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003700132024001100169040001800180100002000198245010800218300001300326506017300339520166600512592002802178650002602206650001002232650001802242650001602260650001702276650002402293650001202317650001402329650001102343650002402354650001502378650002402393650002702417650001002444650002202454650001402476650001002490650001602500651001002516653001802526653001302544653001402557653001102571653002402582700001502606700001802621700002302639700002002662700002102682773012702703856008402830856011202914956013103026961001303157852000903170655001203179IND60006185620221214225319.0190412e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000618562DNAL7 a3207902aris7 a10113/618562hdl7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2016.01.0102doi8 ans8988  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJondiko, Tom O.10aPrediction of wheat tortilla quality using multivariate modeling of kernel, flour, and dough properties  ap. 9-15.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aTraditional wheat quality methods for bread have poor predictive power for flatbread quality, which impedes genetic improvement of wheat for the growing market. We used a multivariate discriminant analysis to predict tortilla quality using a set of 16 variables derived from kernel properties, flour composition, and dough rheological properties of 187 experimental hard wheat samples grown across Texas. A discriminant rule (suitability for tortillas=diameter>165mm+day 16 flexibility score>3.0) was used to classify samples. Multivariate normal distribution of the data was established (Shapiro–Wilk p>0.05). Logistic regression and stepwise variable selection identified an optimum model comprising kernel weight, glutenin–gliadin ratio, insoluble polymeric proteins, and dough extensibility and stress relaxation parameters, as the most important variables. Cross-validation indicated 83% model prediction efficiency. This work provides important insight on potential targets for wheat quality genetic improvement for tortillas and specialty product market.Tortillas and other flatbread manufacturers currently use wheat developed for other commodities and rely on trial and error, and use of various additives to optimize product quality. Genetic development of wheat for these markets is impeded by lack of knowledge of specific grain quality parameters to target. With the growing demand for clean label and healthy offerings by consumers, the industry is looking for natural ingredients with improved functionality. This work provides the first insight into the specific wheat composition and functional parameters that can predict tortilla quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiscriminant analysis 3adough 3aextensibility 3aflat breads 3afood quality 3agenetic improvement 3agliadin 3aglutenins 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arheological properties 3aseeds 3astress relaxation 3atortillas 3awheat 3awheat flour 3aTexas 0aWheat quality 0aTortilla 0aFlatbread 0aGluten 0aGenetic improvement1 aYang, Liyi1 aHays, Dirk B.1 aIbrahim, Amir M.H.1 aTilley, Michael1 aAwika, Joseph M.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2016 Apr., v. 34 p.9-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2016.01.0103Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/618563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Journal%20-%20320790%20-%20Tilley%20-%20Publication.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011000171300001600281520100800297592002801305650001501333650001501348650001901363650002901382650001201411650000701423650001501430650003701445650001501482650002001497700003101517700002101548773008601569856008101655852000901736655001201745IND60554645320221119035631.0161024e20151225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055464532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarco-Urrea, Ernest10aPotential of non-ligninolytic fungi in bioremediation of chlorinated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ap. 620-628.  aIn previous decades, white-rot fungi as bioremediation agents have been the subjects of scientific research due to the potential use of their unspecific oxidative enzymes. However, some non-white-rot fungi, mainly belonging to the Ascomycota and Zygomycota phylum, have demonstrated their potential in the enzymatic transformation of environmental pollutants, thus overcoming some of the limitations observed in white-rot fungi with respect to growth in neutral pH, resistance to adverse conditions and the capacity to surpass autochthonous microorganisms. Despite their presence in so many soil and water environments, little information exists on the enzymatic mechanisms and degradation pathways involved in the transformation of hydrocarbons by these fungi. This review describes the bioremediation potential of non-ligninolytic fungi with respect to chlorinated hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and also shows known conversion pathways and the prospects for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscomycota 3aZygomycota 3abioremediation 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3aenzymes 3apH 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil water 3awhite-rot fungi1 aGarcía-Romera, Inmaculada1 aAranda, Elisabet0 tNew biotechnology.g2015 Dec. 25, v. 32 p.620-628dElsevier B.V.x1871-67847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2015.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245004200204300001800246520107700264592002801341650002201369650002501391650001601416650001801432650001901450650002301469650001401492700001801506700006101524700002001585700005801605700001801663700001701681700006201698700005901760700005701819773013601876856008002012852000902092655001202101IND60633709820190422000000.0190321e20190211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063370982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b008872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahara, Shinya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3979-313510aUltrafast Dynamics of Heliorhodopsins  ap. 2507-2512.  aHeliorhodopsins (HeR) constitute a new rhodopsin family and show only <15% sequence identities with type-1 and type-2 rhodopsins. The large difference in amino acid sequence between HeRs and other rhodopsins raises a question whether their biological function is triggered by efficient and rapid photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore as in the case of other rhodopsins. We performed femtosecond time-resolved absorption measurements of two HeRs, HeR 48C12 and HeR from Thermoplasmatales archaeon SG8-52-1. Both HeRs exhibit excited-state absorption around 480 nm and stimulated emission in the >650 nm region, and these transient signals decay concomitantly with appearance of photoproduct absorption on a subpicosecond time scale. The observed spectral change indicates that ultrafast retinal photoisomerization proceeds in the femtosecond time region. The transient spectra and dynamics of HeRs are surprisingly similar to those of type-1 rhodopsins, despite remarkable differences in amino acid arrangement in the hydrophobic region of the retinal binding site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThermoplasmatales 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abinding sites 3ahydrophobicity 3aphotoisomerization 3arhodopsin1 aSingh, Manish1 aKuramochi, Hikaru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5666-38801 aShihoya, Wataru1 aInoue, Keiichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6898-43471 aNureki, Osamu1 aBéjà, Oded1 aMizutani, Yasuhisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3754-57201 aKandori, Hideki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4922-13441 aTahara, Tahei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6340-85350 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 11, v. 123, no. 11 p.2507-2512dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b008873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009100173300001600264520206100280592002802341650001502369650001602384650001902400650001702419650000802436650002002444650001202464650001502476650001902491650000902510650002002519651001502539651001802554653001102572653001502583653003102598653001602629653001502645653003002660700002002690700001802710773020702728856008802935852000903023655001203032IND60624981020221121061004.0181208e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062498102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2018.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuovinen, Pirjo10aRemote sensing of albedo-reducing snow algae and impurities in the Maritime Antarctica  ap. 507-517.  aSnow algae have been proposed to play a key role in climate change as they can reduce albedo (“bioalbedo”) and thus accelerate the melting of snow and ice fields. Although satellite-derived data has opened opportunities for larger scale observations, remote sensing of snow algae has been scarce and is methodologically challenging due to the presence of other light-absorbing impurities (LAIs). So far the studies on the role of LAIs in reducing albedo and increasing melting have been strongly focused on the Arctic ice sheets. The aims of the present study were to compare the relative impact of microalgae and other LAIs in reducing albedo in the snow of Fildes Peninsula, King George Island, Maritime Antarctica, using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), which allows mapping sub-pixel fractions of multiple components in mixed pixels from satellite-derived data (Sentinel-2A). Also, the applicability of band ratios previously proposed for classifying snow algae (Red-Green band ratio) and impurities (Snow Darkening Index (SDI)) was tested and compared with SMA. Ground validation was made by characterizing the composition of snow algae (through chlorophyll a fluorescence) and by measurements of spectral absorption of solar radiation in red and green snow. SMA resulted a reliable method to classify snow algae and impurities with low amount of false positives (user accuracy 92–93%). However, omission error derived from dominant type (>50% abundance) confusion matrix was higher (producer accuracy for algae 63% and impurity 53%). In contrast, classification with band ratios resulted in large number of false positives (user accuracy for SDI 36%, for R/G 46%), and even higher omission error for R/G (producer accuracy 36%), whereas SDI had better producer accuracy (68%). SMA provided higher precision in separating dominant LAIs than the band ratios, which resulted in widely overlapping signals. Reduced albedo could be related with SMA-derived snow algae and impurity abundancies at albedo levels >45% for algae and >30% for impurities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3afluorescence 3aice 3aleaf area index 3amelting 3amicroalgae 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asolar radiation 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region 0aAlbedo 0aAntarctica 0aLight-absorbing impurities 0aSentinel-2A 0aSnow algae 0aSpectral mixture analysis1 aRamirez, Jaime,1 aGómez, Iván0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2018 Dec., v. 146 p.507-517dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, over time, drug resistance develops, leaving few treatment options. Here we show that platelet-derived growth factor α receptor (PDGF α receptor)-mediated signaling plays a key role in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (c-Met) upregulation, which in turn is thought to play an important role in chemotherapy resistance. PDGF α receptor inhibition eliminates cisplatin-dependent Met expression in cervical cancer cell lines. PDGF α receptor inhibitors are widely used in clinical settings, suggesting that the clinical translation of our findings could reduce the suffering of people from drug resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3aplatinum 3adrug therapy 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3adrugs 3apeople 3adrug resistance 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCisplatinxpharmacology 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasm 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-metxgenetics 2aReceptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alphaxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aUp-Regulationxdrug effects 2aUterine Cervical Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxpathology. 0achemotherapy1 aPhonaphonh, Thongsavanh1 aLiang, Feixin1 aGuang, Hai,1 aArasaki, Akira1 aArakaki, Keiichi1 aNakasone, Toshiyuki1 aSunakawa, Hajime0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 699, no. 1-3 p.227-232dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245015000204300001600354506007600370520171100446592002802157506003702185650003102222650002102253650001602274650001002290650002902300650001302329650002602342653001502368653000902383653002502392653000902417700002102426700002402447700001902471700002202490700002502512773018902537856007902726852000902805655001202814IND60230476820221207053658.0150614e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023047682DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14132911122doi7 aPMC42992132pmcid7 a255481732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodec, Jernej10aInducible RNAi in vivo reveals that the transcription factor BATF is required to initiate but not maintain CD8⁺ T-cell effector differentiation  ap. 512-517.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe differentiation of effector CD8 ⁺ T cells is critical for the development of protective responses to pathogens and for effective vaccines. In the first few hours after activation, naive CD8 ⁺ T cells initiate a transcriptional program that leads to the formation of effector and memory T cells, but the regulation of this process is poorly understood. Investigating the role of specific transcription factors (TFs) in determining CD8 ⁺ effector T-cell fate by gene knockdown with RNAi is challenging because naive T cells are refractory to transduction with viral vectors without extensive ex vivo stimulation, which obscures the earliest events in effector differentiation. To overcome this obstacle, we developed a novel strategy to test the function of genes in naive CD8 ⁺ T cells in vivo by creating bone marrow chimera from hematopoietic progenitors transduced with an inducible shRNA construct. Following hematopoietic reconstitution, this approach allowed inducible in vivo gene knockdown in any cell type that developed from this transduced progenitor pool. We demonstrated that lentivirus-transduced progenitor cells could reconstitute normal hematopoiesis and develop into naive CD8 ⁺ T cells that were indistinguishable from wild-type naive T cells. This experimental system enabled induction of efficient gene knockdown in vivo without subsequent manipulation. We applied this strategy to show that the TF BATF is essential for initial commitment of naive CD8 ⁺ T cells to effector development but becomes dispensable by 72h. This approach makes possible the study of gene function in vivo in unperturbed cells of hematopoietic origin that are refractory to viral transduction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aRNA interference 3abone marrow 3agenes 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3aimmunity 3atranscription factors 0aCD8 T cell 0aRNAi 0atranscription factor 0aBATF1 aCowley, Glenn S.1 aBarnitz, R.

We assessed the performance of a suite of spatial-pattern metrics selected to quantify the condition of the ridge-slough landscape in the Everglades (South Florida, USA). Spatial pattern metrics (n=14) that describe landscape composition, geometry and hydrologic connectivity were enumerated from vegetation maps of twenty-five 2×2km primary sampling units (PSUs) that span a gradient of hydrologic and ecological condition across the greater Everglades ecosystem. Metrics were assessed in comparison with field measurements from each PSU of landscape condition obtained from regional surveys of soil elevation, which have previously been shown to capture dramatic differences between conserved and degraded locations. Elevation-based measures of landscape condition included soil elevation bi-modality (BISE), a binary measure of landscape condition, and also the standard deviation of soil elevation (SDSE), a continuous measure of condition. Metric performance was assessed based on the strength (sensitivity) and shape (leading vs. lagging) of the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and these elevation-based measures. We observed significant logistic regression slopes with BISE for only 4 metrics (slough width, ridge density, directional connectivity index – DCI, and least flow cost – LFC). More significant relationships (n=8 metrics) were observed with SDSE, with the strongest associations for slough density, mean ridge width, and the average length of straight flow, as well as for a suite of hydrologic connectivity metrics (DCI, LFC and landscape discharge competence – LDC). Leading vs. lagging performance, inferred from the curvature of the association obtained from the exponent of fitted power functions, suggest that only DCI was a leading metric of the loss of soil elevation variation; most metrics were indeterminate, though some were clearly lagging. Our findings support the contention that soil elevation changes from altered peat accretion dynamics precede changes in landscape pattern, and offer insights that will enable efficient monitoring of the ridge-slough landscape as part of the ongoing Everglades restoration effort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ageometry 3ahydrology 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apeat 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil surveys 3avegetation 3aFlorida 0aPattern metrics 0aEarly warning indicators 0aRidge and slough 0aSoil elevation variation 0aEverglades1 aCohen, Matthew J.0 tEcological indicators.g2017 Mar., v. 74 p.427-440dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245012100207300001800328506007600346520162900422592002802051506003702079650001802116650001902134650002902153650001002182650001102192650001702203650002002220650000902240650001302249650000902262650001102271650001202282700002102294700002202315700002202337700002002359700002202379700002202401700002202423773017302445856007902618852000902697655001202706IND60178523920221207114830.0150604e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017852392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12225701102doi7 aPMC35819642pmcid7 a233822232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGostissa, Monica10aConditional inactivation of p53 in mature B cells promotes generation of nongerminal center-derived B-cell lymphomas  ap. 2934-2939.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe p53 tumor suppressor exerts a central role in protecting cells from oncogenic transformation. Accordingly, the p53 gene is mutated in a large number of human cancers. In mice, germ-line inactivation of p53 confers strong predisposition to development of different types of malignancies, but the early onset of thymic lymphomas in the majority of the animals prevents detailed studies of tumorigenesis in other tissues. Here, we use the Cre/Lox approach to inactivate p53 in mature B cells in mice (referred to as “CP” B cells) and find that such p53 inactivation results in the routine development of IgM-positive CP peripheral B-cell lymphomas. The CP lymphomas generally appear to arise, even in mice subjected to immunization protocols to activate germinal center reaction, from naive B cells that had not undergone immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene class switching or somatic hypermutation. In contrast to thymic lymphomas that arise in p53-deficient mice, which generally lack clonal translocations, nearly all analyzed CP B-cell tumors carried clonal translocations. However, in contrast to spontaneous translocations in other mouse B-cell tumor models, CP B-cell tumor translocations were not recurrent and did not involve Ig loci. Therefore, CP tumors might provide models for human lymphomas lacking Ig translocations, such as splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma or Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Our studies indicate that deletion of p53 is sufficient to trigger transformation of mature B cells and support the notion that p53 deficiency may allow accumulation of oncogenic translocations in B cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3acarcinogenesis 3achromosome translocation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulins 3aloci 3alymphoma 3amice 3amodels 3atissues1 aBianco, Julia M.1 aMalkin, Daniel J.1 aKutok, Jeffery L.1 aRodig, Scott J.1 aMorse, Herbert C.1 aBassing, Craig H.1 aAlt, Frederick W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 110, no. 8 p.2934-2939dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12225701103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100007100149245008400220300001400304520103700318592002801355650002301383650001301406650002601419650002601445653003001471653003401501653002501535653002601560700005801586700007101644700002601715700002201741700002101763700002301784700001501807773011301822856008401935852000902019655001202028IND60605308720221118133836.0190628e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060530872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2018.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Timermans, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7052-161610aLabel-free Raman characterization of bacteria calls for standardized procedures  ap. 69-75.  aRaman spectroscopy has gained relevance in single-cell microbiology for its ability to detect bacterial (sub)populations in a non-destructive and label-free way. However, the Raman spectrum of a bacterium can be heavily affected by abiotic factors, which may influence the interpretation of experimental results. Additionally, there is no publicly available standard for the annotation of metadata describing sample preparation and acquisition of Raman spectra. This article explores the importance of sample manipulations when measuring bacterial subpopulations using Raman spectroscopy. Based on the results of this study and previous findings in literature we propose a Raman metadata standard that incorporates the minimum information that is required to be reported in order to correctly interpret data from Raman spectroscopy experiments. Its aim is twofold: 1) mitigate technical noise due to sample preparation and manipulation and 2) improve reproducibility in Raman spectroscopy experiments studying microbial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abacteria 3aenvironmental factors 3amicrobial communities 0aPhenotypic identification 0aLabel-free Raman spectroscopy 0aSingle-cell analysis 0aRaman standardization1 aRubbens, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5595-47581 aKerckhof, Frederiek-Maarten1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4472-68101 aBuysschaert, Benjamin1 aKhalenkow, Dmitry1 aWaegeman, Willem1 aSkirtach, Andre G.1 aBoon, Nico0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Aug., v. 151 p.69-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245013500170300001800305520130900323592002801632650002701660650001101687650002001698650000901718650001201727650001501739650002601754653001601780653002501796653001801821653002701839653001101866700001201877700001901889700001201908700001701920700005601937773009301993856009002086852000902176655001202185IND60584718220221120124814.0201202e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058471822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Chao10aEfficient removal of EDTA-complexed Cu(II) by a combined Fe(III)/UV/alkaline precipitation process: Performance and role of Fe(II)  ap. 1235-1242.  aEfficient removal of heavy metal-EDTA complexes from water remains a challenge because of their good solubility and chemical stability. Herein, we employed a proprietary process, i.e., the Fe(III) displacement/UV irradiation/alkaline precipitation (denoted as Fe(III)/UV/OH), to enable an efficient removal of Cu(II)-EDTA complex from 19.2 mg Cu(II)/L to <1 mg Cu(II)/L. The combined process includes Fe(III) replacement with the complexed Cu(II) to form Fe(III)-EDTA and release the free Cu(II), UV-mediated catalytic decarboxylation of EDTA to form amine ligands and reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), and the final removal of Cu(II) through precipitation. The in situ formed Fe(II) is crucial to the final Cu(II) removal because it tends to form stable complexes with amine ligands (EDTA and its decarboxylation products), thereby inhibiting their re-complexation with the released Cu(II) and facilitating the formation of copper precipitates. Consequently, the methods capable of prolonging the life of Fe(II), e.g., increasing the Fe(III) addition or direct addition of Fe(II) into the Cu(II)-EDTA solution and deoxygenating the solution, could dramatically enhance the final Cu(II) removal. We also optimized the operational conditions of the process at the initial Cu(II)-EDTA of 19.2 mg Cu(II)/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3acopper 3adecarboxylation 3airon 3aligands 3asolubility 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCu(II)-EDTA 0aFe(III) displacement 0aUV photolysis 0aAlkaline precipitation 0aFe(II)1 aXu, Zhe1 aZhang, Xiaolin1 aXu, You1 aGao, Guandao1 aPan, Bingcai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3626-15390 tChemosphere.g2018 Feb., v. 193 p.1235-1242dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008800171506002800259520249100287592002802778506003702806650002902843650001002872650002702882650001502909650001102924650001902935650001602954650001402970650001302984650001102997650001003008650001303018650002303031650001603054650001003070650001103080700002203091700001903113700002303132700001803155773009503173856008303268852000903351655001203360IND60739755620221207084318.0150706s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073975562DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201505010062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmin, Schüttler10aImpact of grape cluster defoliation on TDN potential in cool climate Riesling wines  aResource is Open Access  aMany cool climate grape vine growing regions are and will be affected by the global climate change. It is likely that increasing temperatures, as well as changing precipitation pattern will impact the wines’ composition and wine styles. In the last decades the sensory concept of German Riesling wines was considered to represent fresh and fruity notes. However, aged wines of this variety are characterized by petrol like aroma, which is not appreciated in modern Riesling wines. The C13-norisoprenoid 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (TDN) is considered to be the marker compound for this undesired sensory impression. The biogenesis of this compound is impacted by grape vine growth conditions. Wines made from Riesling grapes grown in warmer climates have higher concentrations of TDN. Therefore “TDN management” will be one of the most challenging tasks in viticulture in Riesling growing regions in general and particularly in cool climate regions. Two approaches considered are the canopy management of the grape vines as well as an appropriate selection of yeast strain for alcoholic fermentation. Therefore, the aim of this project was to study the impact of grape zone defoliation on potential TDN concentrations in grapes, must and finished wines under cool climate conditions, in example of regional conditions of the landmark Hessische Bergstraße, in com- bination with the usage of two commercially available yeast strains during alcoholic fermentation. The experiment consisted of four treatments in a balanced incomplete block design, grape zone defoliation at berry set on the eastern side of the canopy, grape zone defoliation at berry set on eastern and western side of the canopy, grape zone defoliation at veraison on eastern and western side of the canopy, and a non-defoliated treatment. The treatments and repetitions were harvested separately, pressed, and then fermented with two different commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Grape juice samples, pressed musts and wines were analysed for potential TDN using GC–MS. Furthermore, the wines were submitted to sensory analysis. Significant differences were shown for TDN potential in grape musts and finished wines of defoliation treatments. Moreover, sensory differences were also shown for young wines. The results demonstrate that canopy management as well as yeast strains are impacting factors on “TDN management” and are considered to be tools for avoiding undesired aging notes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aVitis 3aalcoholic fermentation 3abiogenesis 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3adefoliation 3afruit set 3agasoline 3agrapes 3aodors 3aripening 3asensory evaluation 3aviticulture 3awines 3ayeasts1 aCaroline, Guthier1 aManfred, Stoll1 aPhillippe, Darriet1 aDoris, Rauhut0 tBIO web of conferences.g2015, v. 5 p.01006-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201505010063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245012000168300001600288520125900304592002801563650002001591650002201611650001901633650001701652650002001669650000901689650002701698650001101725650001601736700001901752700001801771773014101789856007901930852000902009655001202018IND60643960720221119101011.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064396072DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2017-01652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarruthers, Thomas10aAccounting for uncertainty due to data processing in virtual population analysis using Bayesian multiple imputation  ap. 883-896.  aVirtual population analysis (VPA) is used in many stock assessment settings and requires a total catch-at-age data set where an age is assigned to each fish that has been caught. These data sets are typically constructed using ad hoc methods that rely on numerous assumptions. Although approaches are available to account for observation error in these data, no statistically rigorous methods have been developed to account for uncertainty from data processing. To address this, we investigated a Bayesian multiple imputation approach to filling missing size data. Using Atlantic yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) as case studies, we evaluated the hypothesis that data processing is as important in determining management reference points in stock assessments as conventional sources of uncertainty. Size imputation models accounting for location, season, and year provided good predictive capacity. Uncertainty from data processing could be large; however, the circumstances for this were unpredictable and varied depending on the stock. These results indicate that VPA assessments should attempt to account for uncertainty in data processing to avoid potentially large compression of uncertainty in assessment results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aThunnus albacares 3aThunnus obesus 3acase studies 3adata collection 3afish 3ainformation processing 3amodels 3auncertainty1 aKell, Laurence1 aPalma, Carlos0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2018, v. 75, no. 6 p.883-896dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-01653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008200165300001400247520157300261592002801834650002101862650002901883650002501912650002901937650003001966650002901996650002202025650001102047650001102058650001202069651001002081653002902091653003002120653002902150653002002179653002802199653002102227700001302248700001902261700001602280773009802296856008602394852000902480655001202489IND60559929420221116151157.0190412e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055992942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Xuan10aEnvironmental Performance Index at the Provincial Level for China 2006–2011  ap. 48-56.  aIn recent years, China has experienced rapid economic development and thousands of people escaped from poverty. However, this high-speed development has also led to increased pressure on the environment. Although the Chinese government has focused on solving environmental problems for the past few decades, it appears to have had little effect. Environmental performance evaluation (EPE) is a quantifiable environmental management tool that can evaluate environmental protection effects and provide guidance to improve government efficiency. We use EPE to evaluate China’s environmental performance at the provincial level between 2006 and 2011. In this study, the theme framework and driver force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework models are used to build the composite index (CI) for environmental performance. This index includes 39 indicators in four categories that were selected based on data that can be acquired from China’s Statistical Bureau. The results indicate that the environmental performance index (EPI) of 30 provincial administrative regions (PARs) from 2006 to 2011 ranges from 44.12 (Shanxi, 2006) to 80.87 (Beijing, 2010), from poor to good, respectively. To help develop more effective policies to improve China’s regional environmental performance, cluster analysis (CLA) is applied to divide the 30 PARs into 3 sub-regions. Recommendations for improving the environmental performance of different sub-regions are made to help guide the Chinese government to adjust environmental governance approaches to local conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental governance 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental protection 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apeople 3apoverty 3aChina 0aEnvironmental management 0aEnvironmental performance 0aEnvironmental evaluation 0aComposite index 0aPerformance improvement 0aCluster analysis1 aHua, Hui1 aDong, Zhanfeng1 aHao, Chunxu0 tEcological indicators.g2017 Apr., v. 75 p.48-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009700160300001800257520120200275592002801477650000901505650001301514650001301527650001801540650003401558650001701592700002201609700001601631700001901647773009901666856007501765852000901840655001201849IND60576786020221117172402.0170806e20130618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057678602DNAL7 a10.1021/la400177u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakarova, Marina10aOrdered Monomolecular Layers as a Template for the Regular Arrangement of Gold Nanoparticles  ap. 7334-7343.  aOrdered arrays of metal nanoparticles are important for nanoelectronic and nanophotonic applications. Here, we report the formation of self-assembled arrays of gold nanoparticles on molecular layers of diacetylene compounds on a MoS₂(0001) substrate. The arrangement of gold nanoparticles is observed using scanning tunneling microscopy. When gold is deposited on a self-assembled monolayer of 10,12-nonacosadiynoic acid or 10,12-octadecadiynoic acid on a MoS₂(0001) substrate, the ordered array of diacetylene moieties in the molecular layer serves as a template for the formation of ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles. In contrast, when gold is deposited on a pristine MoS₂(0001) surface or on a molecular layer of stearic acid, the gold nanoparticles are randomly distributed on the surface. It is found that the arrangement of gold nanoparticles is largely determined by the deposition rate; faster deposition results in more ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles. Our observations confirm the role of unsaturated π systems in molecules acting as a template for the regular arrangement of gold nanoparticles; this work will open up new possibilities for interfacial nanoarchitectonics.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3amoieties 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3astearic acid1 aMandal, Swapan K.1 aOkawa, Yuji1 aAono, Masakazu0 tLangmuir.g2013 June 18, v. 29, no. 24 p.7334-7343dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla400177u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100006300196245007900259500002200338506007600360520173900436592002802175506003702203650001502240650001602255650001902271650001602290650002002306650001602326650001002342650001602352650002102368650002302389650001402412650002202426650001402448650001002462650002202472650001602494650000902510650001202519650001302531650000902544650000902553650002202562650002102584650001102605653003102616653001902647653001602666653002302682653002302705653003002728700006102758700002402819700006202843773005602905856008902961852000903050655001203059IND60584718420221207134539.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058471842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.1222doi7 aPMC56960502pmcid7 a290917962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnudsen, Gabriel A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7208-645110aTBBPA disposition and kinetics in pregnant and nursing Wistar Han IGS rats  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) is a brominated flame retardant (BFR) commonly used in electronics to meet fire safety standards and has the largest worldwide production of any BFR. TBBPA has been detected in human breast milk and maternal/cord serum, indicating exposure to mothers, fetuses, and breastfeeding newborns although exposure to fetuses and newborns is poorly understood. Pregnant or nursing Wistar Han IGS rats were administered [14C]-TBBPA in a single dose (25 mg/kg, 2.5 μCi/kg) and euthanized between 0.5&24 h post dose to determine disposition in pregnant and nursing rats and their pups. Systemic exposure was largely unchanged between 1&8 h post dose in pregnant rats; [14C]-radioactivity in blood varied only slightly between 0.5&8 h (2.6 ± 0.6 → 2.6 ± 0.8 nmol-eq/mL) but was below the limit of detection at 24 h with an absorption half-life of 16min and elimination half-life of 17 h. Cmax was observed at 30min in lactating rats and concentrations fell steadily through 8 h. Plasma from pregnant rats contained a mixture of TBBPA and TBBPA-conjugates at 30min but only metabolites in subsequent samples. TBBPA was not detected in lactating dam plasma in this study. Placental concentrations increased through 8 h while whole-fetus Cmax occurred at 2 h post dose. In lactating animals, liver, uterus, and mammary time-concentration curves lagged slightly behind blood-concentration curves. It was clear from these studies that TBBPA is available to both the developing fetus and nursing pup following maternal exposure, and nursing pups are continuously exposed via contaminated milk produced by their mother.

The spat collection at the site selected allowed the establishment of four cohorts of A. ater and six cohorts of Ch. chorus after 131 days. These cohorts were transported 250 km south for further growth, resulting in 290 ropes of Ch. chorus and 30 ropes of A. ater with an average of 900 specimens with a 13.5 mm mean size. After 29 months of cultivation, the yield was 623.7 ± 62.2 specimens of A. ater and 575.3 ± 49.3 specimens of Ch. chorus per rope of 3.5 m long. The growth attained during this period indicated values of L∞ = 136 mm and k = 0.58 for Ch. chorus and L∞ = 107 mm and k = 0.66 for A. ater. The Ch. chorus specimens reached greater lengths at month 15 than the A. ater specimens with the same age. For the total length–weight ratio and the soft part length–weight ratio for specimens above 60 mm in length, A. ater presented higher weights at the same lengths than Ch. chorus. We established that Ch. chorus reached its optimum soft part weight after 19 months and at a size of 82 mm, whereas this optimum was reached by A. ater after 18 months and at 68 mm. We concluded that farming both species in northern Chile was viable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3amussels 3aropes 3aChile1 aCantillánez, Marcela1 aGonzález, Jorge,0 tAquaculture research.g2017 July, v. 48, no. 7 p.3556-3567dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.131813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03874naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016300170500002200333520196000355592002802315650003002343650003102373650000802404650002702412650001402439650001102453650001802464650001902482650001802501650001302519650001302532650001002545650001202555650001802567650001002585650002602595650001902621650000902640650001902649650001702668650001402685650003102699650001402730650004402744650001902788650002202807650001202829653002402841653002302865653002702888653002102915700002202936700002102958700001902979700001802998700002303016773009003039856008603129852000903215655001203224IND60657059220221117042553.0190815e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065705922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Bruno10aAntigenic relationship between Caprine alphaherpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) and Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and experimental CpHV-1 infection of kids and calves  aPre-press version  aCaprine alphaherpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) is a worldwide pathogen of goats and is closely related to Bovine alphaherpevirus 1 (BoHV-1). We herein studied the antigenic relationships of CpHV-1 with BoHV-1 and investigated the pathogenesis of CpHV-1 in kids and calves. Monoclonal antibody reactivity revealed that CpHV-1 and BoHV-1 share immunogenic epitopes in the major envelope glycoproteins gB, gC and gD. The antigenic relationship was further demonstrated by virus-neutralizing assays, in which CpHV-1 and BoHV-1 antisera presented varied degrees of cross-neutralization against the heterologous virus. Although cross-neutralization was observed between both viruses and the heterologous antisera, BoHV-1 antisera neutralized CpHV-1 with higher efficiency than CpHV-1 antisera neutralized BoHV-1. The antigenic cross-reactivity between CpHV-1 and BoHV-1 should be considered upon serologic testing of goats and cattle in regions where the two viruses co-circulate. Intranasal (IN) inoculation of CpHV-1 (WI13-46 isolate) in seven seronegative kids resulted in efficient viral replication in the respiratory tract. Additionally, mild to moderate systemic and respiratory signs were observed, including apathy, hyperthermia, nasal discharge and respiratory distress. Dexamethasone administration to the inoculated kids between days 36 and 40 pi did not result in virus shedding in nasal secretions. However, latent infection had been established, as evidenced by the detection of CpHV-1 DNA in trigeminal ganglia and olfactory bulbs of kids euthanized at day 67 pi. Contrasting with the outcome of infection in kids, IN inoculation of CpHV-1 in calves did not result in productive infection as no virus replication or shedding were detected, and the animals did not develop clinical signs nor seroconverted. The animal experiments demonstrated that CpHV-1 was able to produce respiratory disease in kids, but did not replicate to detectable levels in calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aCaprine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aDNA 3aanimal experimentation 3aantiserum 3acalves 3acarrier state 3across reaction 3adexamethasone 3adistress 3aepitopes 3afever 3aganglia 3aglycoproteins 3agoats 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralization 3anose 3aolfactory bulb 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asecretion 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aviral shedding 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aCaprine herpesvirus 0aBovine herpesvirus 0aAntigenic relationship 0aLatent infection1 aEbling, Rafael C.1 aMartins, Mathias1 aDiel, Diego G.1 aWeiblen, Rudi1 aFlores, Eduardo F.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 Aug. 09, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245007600204300001800280506007600298520113000374592002801504506003701532650001001569650000901579650002101588650002301609650001101632650002001643650002101663650001501684650001601699653001901715653001101734653002201745700002701767773017301794856007901967852000902046655001202055IND60178524120221207130012.0150604e20130219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017852412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12226181102doi7 aPMC35818992pmcid7 a233822412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaremi, Saeed10aHierarchical model of natural images and the origin of scale invariance  ap. 3071-3076.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe study of natural images and how our brain processes them has been an area of intense research in neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. We introduced a unique approach to studying natural images by decomposing images into a hierarchy of layers at different logarithmic intensity scales and mapping them to a quasi-2D magnet. The layers were in different phases: “cold” and ordered at large-intensity scales, “hot” and disordered at small-intensity scales, and going through a second-order phase transition at intermediate scales. There was a single “critical” layer in the hierarchy that exhibited long-range correlation similar to that found in the 2D Ising model of ferromagnetism at the critical temperature. We also determined the interactions between layers mapped from natural images and found mutual inhibition that generated locally “frustrated” antiferromagnetic states. Almost all information in natural images was concentrated in a few layers near the phase transition, which has biological implications and also points to the hierarchical origin of scale invariance in natural images.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acold 3acomputer science 3amagnetic materials 3amodels 3aneurophysiology 3aphase transition 3apsychology 3atemperature 0acritical point 0avision 0agenerative models1 aSejnowski, Terrence J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Feb. 19, v. 110, no. 8 p.3071-3076dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12226181103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008000165300001400245520133400259592002801593650001301621650001301634650002001647650001501667650001101682650001701693650001001710650001701720650001301737650001601750650001901766650000901785650001001794650001701804650001001821653002301831653002601854653002601880653001801906653002401924653001601948700001801964700001601982700001901998773009302017856005102110852000902161655001202170IND50087753020221119151725.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008775302DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2010.5141302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRewald, B.10aInfluence of salinity on root hydraulic properties of three olive varieties  ap. 12-22.  aThree varieties of olive, Barnea, Arbequina and Proline, varying in salt tolerance, were examined to check the sensitivity of their root system hydraulic properties to salinity. Up to three levels of saline water (EC = 1.2, 4.2 and 7.5 dS m⁻¹) were used for long-term irrigation of mature trees. Specific conductivities and embolism rates of roots and branches were estimated by low-pressure conductivity measurement; variability and plasticity of root and branch axial conductivities were calculated. Cross-sections of roots were analysed with respect to xylem anatomy. Barnea, and to a minor degree Arbequina, were found to be more salt-resistant than Proline. Axial root hydraulics under salt stress reacted in a more plastic fashion than branch conductivities. Increased specific conductivities of roots, different plasticities of root hydraulics and modifications in mean conduit diameters can be dismissed as foremost reasons of the observed differences in salt resistance. Instead, a high within-population variability in root conductivity, as found in the salt-tolerant Barnea and Arbequina varieties, coming to full effect in high conductivity roots of Barnea trees, and an increased bimodal distribution of conduit sizes may represent favourable traits to enhance water uptake in soils with heterogeneous salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3aembolism 3afluid mechanics 3airrigation 3aolives 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asoil 3atrees 3awater uptake 3axylem 0aAxial conductivity 0afine and coarse roots 0ahydraulic variability 0aOlea europaea 0aphotosynthetic rate 0asalt stress1 aLeuschner, C.1 aWiesman, Z.1 aEphrath, J.

We previously demonstrated that a primitive single-celled amoeba (a plasmodial slime mold), which exhibits complex spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics and sophisticated computing capabilities, can be used to search for a solution to a very hard combinatorial optimization problem. We successfully extracted the essential spatiotemporal dynamics by which the amoeba solves the problem. This amoeba-inspired computing paradigm can be implemented by various physical systems that exhibit suitable spatiotemporal dynamics resembling the amoeba’s problem-solving process. In this Article, we demonstrate that photoexcitation transfer phenomena in certain quantum nanostructures mediated by optical near-field interactions generate the amoebalike spatiotemporal dynamics and can be used to solve the satisfiability problem (SAT), which is the problem of judging whether a given logical proposition (a Boolean formula) is self-consistent. SAT is related to diverse application problems in artificial intelligence, information security, and bioinformatics and is a crucially important nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete problem, which is believed to become intractable for conventional digital computers when the problem size increases. We show that our amoeba-inspired computing paradigm dramatically outperforms a conventional stochastic search method. These results indicate the potential for developing highly versatile nanoarchitectonic computers that realize powerful solution searching with low energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3abioinformatics 3acomputers 3aenergy 3ananomaterials 3aproblem solving 3asystem optimization1 aNaruse, Makoto1 aKim, Sŏng-ju,1 aWakabayashi, Masamitsu1 aHori, Hirokazu1 aOhtsu, Motoichi1 aHara, Masahiko0 tLangmuir.g2013 June 18, v. 29, no. 24 p.7557-7564dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla400301p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245013500179300001200314506002800326520136600354592002801720506003701748650002001785650001201805650001301817650001301830650001101843650001301854650001601867650001501883650002801898650001601926650001701942650002301959650001601982651001101998653002002009653002802029653002502057653001702082700002402099700002302123700002602146700001802172700002002190700002202210700001902232700002302251700002102274700002202295700002102317700001902338773012902357856008902486852000902575655001202584IND60739755920221215143602.0180530e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073975592DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2017.51.4.18612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell-Sills, Hugo10aTwo different Oenococcus oeni lineages are associated to either red or white wines in Burgundy: genomics and metabolomics insights  ap. 309.  aResource is Open Access  aOenococcus oeni is the bacterium most often associated with spontaneous malolactic fermentation (MLF) of wine. During MLF, malic acid is transformed into lactic acid and several metabolites are modified, modulating wine’s total acidity and improving its sensory properties. Previous works have suggested that certain genetic groups of O. oeni strains are associated to different kinds of products. In the present study we have spotted two groups of strains isolated mainly from Burgundy wines, one associated to red wines and the other to white wines. Sequencing 14 genomes of red and white wine strains revealed that they share a common ancestor that probably colonised two different substrates –red and white wine-associated environments–, diverging over time and disseminating to various regions. Their capacity to perform MLF and modify the volatile profile of wine was determined by fermenting a chardonnay wine and analysing its volatile fraction with a non-targeted metabolomics approach by GC-MS. The strains had a different impact on the volatile composition depending on their group of origin. These results show for the first time a correspondence between the product of origin of the strains and the volatile profile of the wines they produce. Furthermore, the genetic features that might be implied in these different phenotypes are examined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOenococcus oeni 3aacidity 3aancestry 3abacteria 3agenome 3agenomics 3alactic acid 3amalic acid 3amalolactic fermentation 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3avolatile compounds 3awhite wines 3aFrance 0aOenococcus oeni 0amalolactic fermentation 0acomparative genomics 0ametabolomics1 aKhoury, Mariette El1 aGammacurta, Marine1 aMiot-Sertier, Cécile1 aDutilh, Lucie1 aVestner, Jochen1 aCapozzi, Vittorio1 aSherman, David1 aHubert, Christophe1 aClaisse, Olivier1 aSpanò, Giuseppe,1 aRevel, Gilles de1 aLucas, Patrick0 tOENO One.g2017 Sept., v. 51, no. 3 p.309-309dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2017.51.4.18613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012500173520142300298592002801721650002801749650002901777650002901806650002001835650001601855650003101871650003201902650002001934650002001954650003001974650002402004650001902028650001202047650001902059650002402078650002902102650001402131653001502145653001702160653003002177653002102207653003802228700002002266700001802286700002202304700002702326773009302353856008602446852000902532655001202541IND60657059320221117041549.0190815e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065705932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChevée, Victoria14aThe peptidoglycan recognition protein PGRP-LE regulates the Drosophila immune response against the pathogen Photorhabdus  aPhotorhabdus bacteria are potent pathogens of insects and humans. To elucidate the infection strategies Photorhabdus employs to subvert the host innate immune response, it is critical to use model organisms that permit the genetic dissection of the dynamics involved in host-pathogen interactions. Here, we employed the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to interrogate the role of the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway receptor peptidoglycan recognition protein LE (PGRP-LE) in the regulation of the fly's response to the insect pathogen Photorhabdus luminescens and the insect/human pathogen P. asymbiotica. We show that PGRP-LE is upregulated in response to injection of Photorhabdus bacteria in background control flies, and that loss-of-function PGRP-LE mutant flies are more sensitive specifically to P. luminescens infection and harbor a higher bacterial burden of this species compared to background controls. Also, our results indicate that the absence of functional PGRP-LE alters the transcriptional pathway activity of Imd and Jnk signaling upon infection with P. asymbiotica, while infection with P. luminescens modifies the activity of Jak/Stat signaling. These findings denote the participation of the PGRP-LE receptor in the response of D. melanogaster to Photorhabdus challenge and contribute to a better understanding of pathogen detection and host immune regulation against virulent microbial invaders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aPhotorhabdus asymbiotica 3aPhotorhabdus luminescens 3aentomopathogens 3afruit flies 3agene expression regulation 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amicrobial detection 3amicrobial load 3amutants 3apeptidoglycans 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 0aDrosophila 0aPhotorhabdus 0aEntomopathogenic bacteria 0aImmune signaling 0aPeptidoglycan recognition protein1 aSachar, Upasana1 aYadav, Shruti1 aHeryanto, Christa1 aEleftherianos, Ioannis0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2019 Nov., v. 136dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2019.1036643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010200165300001400267520137500281592002801656650001101684650001001695650002401705650001201729650001301741650001701754650000901771650001401780650001201794650002101806650000701827650001701834650000901851650001801860650001001878650002001888650000901908651001101917653001801928653002401946653001201970653001801982700002802000700001902028700002102047773009302068856005102161852000902212655001202221IND50087753120221119151712.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008775312DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2010.5228032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalera, H.10aEncroachment of forest species into operating and abandoned railway areas in north-eastern Poland  ap. 23-36.  aFloristic investigations concerning vascular plants, supplemented by a determination of the basic soil parameters and concentration of four heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe), were carried out in 12 railway areas located in north-eastern Poland (eight located on tracks withdrawn from use, four located on operating tracks). The vegetation types of the areas in the immediate vicinity of the selected sites differed (forest, grassland or meadow, ruderal). The soil samples exhibited considerable uniformity with respect to their pH values, and, although the nutrient levels varied, the concentration of the latter did not seem to be a factor limiting plant growth. The concentration of heavy metals did not hinder plant growth. Although the chemical features of the soil were within limits that did not make plant growth difficult, the process of plant regeneration proceeded differently, depending on the accessibility of diaspores from the surrounding areas. The decreasing rate of therophytes, especially aliens, manifested a stage of succession on abandoned tracks. In the case of ground flora, gradual “preparation” of the habitat (shadow factor on the track) was very important. The degree of advancement of forest regeneration on abandoned tracks was more strongly evidenced by the constant return of ground flora species, and not by trees as was commonly thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aflora 3aforest regeneration 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3ameadows 3anutrient content 3apH 3aplant growth 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atrees 3avascular plants 3azinc 3aPoland 0aForest plants 0aforest regeneration 0arailway 0asoil features1 aSudnik-Wójcikowska, B.1 aWierzbicka, M.1 aWiłkomirski, B.0 tPlant biosystems.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 145, no. 1 p.23-36dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2010.522803  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013100166300001800297520130500315592002801620650001401648650001501662650001101677650001301688650001801701650001101719650001101730650001201741651002101753700002201774773014401796856007901940852000902019655001202028IND60643961020221119101249.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064396102DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2017-01702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCienciala, Piotr10aSpatial linkages between geomorphic and hydraulic conditions and invertebrate drift characteristics in a small mountain stream  ap. 1823-1835.  aAlthough invertebrate drift plays a fundamental role in river ecosystems, spatial linkages between its characteristics and hydrogeomorphic conditions remain poorly understood. This study, conducted in a small stream in British Columbia, provides insight into such relationships. Most notably, drift concentration was positively correlated with bed scour, and mean body size was negatively correlated with bed fill. Although correlational design precludes inference regarding mechanisms, these results are consistent with protracted effects of flood-related bed disturbances on spatial pattern of drift characteristics under low flow conditions. We detected no robust associations between drift and flow characteristics that could not be explained by bed disturbances. Because of high spatial variability, drift characteristics were statistically distinct only in few habitat types. Compared with middepth, invertebrate drift concentration was higher near water surface, and mean body size was larger near the bed. Mean body size was also statistically smaller in riffle–pool transitions, which experienced largest bed fill. Possible legacy effects of bed disturbances could have broader implications for drift-related energy and nutrient fluxes in river corridors and for quantitative drift models.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody size 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3arivers 3astreams 3aBritish Columbia1 aHassan, Marwan A.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2018, v. 75, no. 11 p.1823-1835dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-01703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03819naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245015000173300001400323506002800337520233300365592002802698506003702726650001102763650001702774650002602791650002202817650002602839650001102865650001102876650001402887650001802901650001902919650002602938650001902964650000902983653002702992653002503019653002803044700001903072773018203091856009103273852000903364655001203373IND60739756120221207084227.0190819e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073975612DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2016.55.6.73-782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYudin, A.

It varies geographically: in terms of technological development, the volume of production and willingness to innovate. The innovative development of agriculture of the Northern region of Komi Republic is characterized by low level of innovative activity at significant scientific potential. The objective necessity of intensification of innovation processes is evidenced by the fact that for 20132015 the pace of decline in physical volume of machinery and equipment intensified; energy consumption decreased by 5%; primitive methods and technologies is dominated in agriculture; outdated varieties and breeds of cattle, imperfect forms of organization and management are used. The regulatory framework is not resolved until the end for innovation in agriculture of the Republic; there are no scientific-production association, innovation centers and agrotechnopark. Scientific-production association in the agricultural sector should be organized on the basis of Agricultural research institute of Republic of Komi. For innovative development of the Republic of Komi it is necessary to implement the strategy of innovative development of agribusiness. Firstly, used information-analytical system should be built on the basis of GIS technologies and digital maps componentwise: geomorphological, climatic, soil, farmland and derivatives thereof. Also, the set of digital maps is necessary that characterize the social conditions of agricultural production and consumption of agricultural products, infrastructure, power, process industry. This information-analytical system should provide the ability to perform scenario forecasts, and update data from different sources. Secondly, in the Strategy of economic and social development of Republic of Komi till 2020 agriculture is considered as an industry, development of which governs the economic and social welfare of the region as a whole. One of the most important tasks of development of the industry is the sharp increase in the volumes of production, which is possible through the expansion of cultivated land and parallel introduction of more advanced technologies. Thirdly, it is necessary to take into account the need for innovation of the area of main settlement and peripheral regions of the Republic of Komi.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3aagribusiness 3aagricultural industry 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural research 3acattle 3aenergy 3aequipment 3ageomorphology 3ainfrastructure 3aresearch institutions 3asocial welfare 3asoil 0ainnovative development 0ainnovative potential 0aagro-industrial complex1 aOblizov, A.

Our study evaluated the mobility of As in creeks that traverse a gold mineralization area in Paracatu, Brazil. The results relate As mobility in water draining actively mined areas to season, wet and dry, and to the impact of in-stream channels lined with limestone that are used to neutralize acid mine drainage. Passage of the creek water through channels lined with limestone decreased soluble As to concentrations below the drinking water threshold in 13 out of 31 samples (10 μg.L⁻¹). The soluble As concentrations were generally higher during the wet season. Arsenic speciation in water was mainly influenced by the season and by the proximity to mineralization zones in the areas that are actively mined. The organic arsenic species DMA (dimethylarsinate) was detected near the mineralized area during the wet season. Sediment-associated As varied with season and with sampling site, but was consistently high at one headwater spring; the highest observed value was 8750 mg As kg⁻¹. We applied selective sequential extraction techniques to assess the portioning of As in the creek sediments. Two of the most mobile fractions of sediment-associated As, the adsorbed and very poorly crystalline fractions, showed a strong seasonal dependence which supported mobilization of As during the wet season. The amorphous Fe oxide fraction followed the same trend but contributed less As, and As associated with the crystalline Fe oxide fraction showed little fluctuation with season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aarsenic 3adrinking water 3ageochemistry 3agold 3airon oxides 3alimestone 3amineralization 3aneutralization 3apyrite 3asediments 3aspring 3astreams 3awater 3awet season 3aBrazil 0aArsenic speciation 0aSediments 0aLimestone drains 0aFe oxides 0aSequential extraction 0aWater treatment1 aMello, Jaime Wilson Vargas de1 aAbrahão, Walter Antônio Pereira1 aGlasauer, Susan0 tApplied geochemistry.g2019 Oct., v. 109 p.104390-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.1043903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012700159300001800286520030700304592002800611650001600639650001400655650002100669650001700690700002100707700002300728700002000751700001400771700002000785700002300805700001800828700002400846773009900870856007500969852000901044655001201053IND60576786420221117172414.0170806e20130618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057678642DNAL7 a10.1021/la40073722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandwana, Vikas10aEngineering the Nanoscale Morphology of a Quantum Dot–Fullerene Assembly via Complementary Hydrogen Bonding Interactions  ap. 7534-7537.  aWe have demonstrated controlled assembly between CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and a fullerene (C60) derivative via complementary three-point hydrogen bonding interactions.

In March 2017, leaf spot was observed on maize cv. Kanchan during a survey of the Ballia district, with disease severity ranging from 1 to 20% (26.08°N, 83.71°E) in Uttar Pradesh, India. The upper mid canopy of symptomatic plants showed elliptical light brown spots (0.25 to 2.5 mm diameter) surrounded by chlorotic halo lesions with dark margins. Five plants showing leaf spots were collected and the symptomatic tissue was cut into pieces (4 mm²), surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, then rinsed three times with distilled water, plated on potato dextrose agar medium amended with streptomycin sulfate (125 ppm), and incubated at 26°C with a 12-h light period. After 5 days of incubation, five pure cultures were obtained using the hyphal tip technique and incubated at 28°C for 15 days. The upper surface of the colony was dark grayish black and the reverse colony was dark brown. Conidiophores on the apex were geniculate, unbranched, and septate. Conidia were spindle to elliptical in shape, light brown, with 3 to 4 septa with an enlarged central cell. Conidial size ranged from 10.0 to 14.1 μm wide and 19.3 to 26.2 μm long (n = 35). Based on morphology, the fungus was tentatively identified as Curvularia geniculata (Tracy & Earle) Boedijn (Hosokawa et al. 2003). Later, genomic DNA was extracted from the E29 isolate using the nucleopore GDNA Fungus Kit (Genetix Brand, India). ITS (White et al. 1990), LSU (Vilgalys and Hester 1990), D1 and D2 region of LSU (O’Donnell 1993), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) (Berbee et al. 1999) loci were amplified for molecular identification (Manamgoda et al. 2012). The amplicons were bidirectionally sequenced using the Sanger sequencing method. BLASTn analysis of different gene sequences of isolate E29 showed 99 to 100% similarity with sequences of C. geniculata. The gene sequences were submitted to GenBank, and accession numbers were assigned (ITS, MT524330; gpd, LC552684; LSU, MT516309; and D1 and D2 region of LSU, MT533847). The similarity index for ITS, gpd, LSU, and D1 and D2 region of LSU sequences of E29 showed high similarity with isolates of C. geniculata: 99.81% with MH856584 (CBS187.50), 99.52% with KM083609 (CBS187.50), 100% with MH868092 (CBS187.50), and 100% with MH868533 (CBS220.52), respectively. Pathogenicity of the isolate E29 was confirmed by inoculating 25-day-old maize cv. Kanchan (n = 10) with a spore suspension (10⁶ spores/ml) prepared from 15-day-old cultures. Using a hand atomizer, the spore suspension was sprayed onto leaves until runoff and the noninoculated plants (n = 10) were sprayed with sterile distilled water. The plants were maintained in a glasshouse at 26 ± 2°C and humidity ≥90%. After 10 days, elliptical spots with chlorotic halo were observed on inoculated plants similar to those observed in the field, but no symptoms developed on noninoculated plants. C. geniculata was reisolated from symptomatic leaves, and its identity was confirmed by morphological observations. The pathogenicity tests were repeated twice. The disease appears not to be yield limiting; however, it has caused several stakeholder concerns, and anecdotal evidence suggests that maize hybrids may differ in susceptibility. To our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot of maize caused by C. geniculata in India, which extends the known agents of maize leaf spot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurvularia geniculata 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3acorn 3aculture media 3adisease severity 3afungi 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3ahyphae 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aphotophase 3arunoff 3asodium hypochlorite 3astakeholders 3astreptomycin 3asulfates 3asurveys 3aIndia 0amaize 0apathogen detection1 aKashyap, A.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on these landowners to encapsulate a current lay of the land in terms of what we know about these landowners and move the dialogue on this topic forward. Eighty-one articles are identified in our search of empirical literature. For each of the landowner types, we discuss their demographics and the three primary themes that emerged related to land management: participation in land management decisions, attitudes regarding land use and ownership, and resource needs in working with these landowners. For agricultural non-operating landowners, we find limited participation in land management decisions, particularly among women, a variety of individual and social factors play a role in involvement, and while they have pro-conservation attitudes, implementation of conservation practices is more limited. Absentee forest landowners we find are more willing to use management plans, yet less willing to engage in active management and risk reduction. These landowners have a range of attitudes regarding land use, with studies highlighting recreation, conservation, and profit motivations. Our review concludes with identifying specific needs for more research and outreach on these landowners.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademographic statistics 3aenvironmental management 3aforests 3aland use 3aoutreach 3aownership 3arecreation 3arisk reduction 3aEurope 0aAbsentee 0aAgriculture 0aConservation 0aForest 0aLandowner 0aNon-operating landowner1 aUlrich-Schad, Jessica D.1 aPetrzelka, Peggy1 aMa, Zhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9103-39960 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 July 01, v. 313 p.114991-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1149913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006800157300001800225520051400243592002800757650001300785650002600798650002200824650001800846650001700864650001700881700002700898773009900925856007501024852000901099655001201108IND60576786520171218000000.0170806e20130618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057678652DNAL7 a10.1021/la40146192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKujawa, Piotr10aInnovation in Nanomedicine through Materials Nanoarchitectonics  ap. 7354-7361.  aMaterials nanoarchitectonics has led to important innovations in the design and construction of systems in nanoelectronics, nanomachinery, and energy conversion.

If the specific amplicon is present in the sample, a coloured band, with an intensity proportional to the amplicon concentration, will develop on the LFD strip in addition to the control band.Species-specific primers for M. phaseolina based on the rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) were developed and their specificity was checked and confirmed using 20 isolates of M. phaseolina and other 16 non-target fungi.A DNA extraction protocol based on a bead-beating technique using silica beads, skimmed milk and PVP was also developed.The M. phaseolina specific primers MP102F/MP102R, 5′ labelled with biotin and FITC respectively, were used in the PCR-NALFIA assay to identify the pathogen starting from mycelium or microsclerotia. Microsclerotia of M. phaseolina (1, 10, 100 and 200) were manipulated under a stereomicroscope and their DNA was extracted using microsclerotia alone or mixed with different types of soil. The resulting DNA, used for the PCR-NALFIA assay, provided positive results for all the samples tested. A semi-quantitative grey-scale reference card based on the PCR-NALFIA assay using intervals corresponding to microsclerotia soil number was developed. For this purpose, the normalized pixel grey volumes obtained after a densitometric analysis of the test line intensity generated by the LFD dipsticks were used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3abiotin 3acolor 3adensitometry 3aelectrophoresis 3aimmunoassays 3aintergenic DNA 3amycelium 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asclerotia 3asequence analysis 3asilica 3asoil 0aBotryosphaeriaceae 0aMolecular diagnosis 0aNucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay (NALFIA) 0aPCR 0aSoil-borne pathogen 0arDNA-IGS region1 aDa Lio, Daniele0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Aug., v. 151 p.118-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159300002000261520098300281592002801264650001501292650001001307650001301317650002201330650001801352650001301370650001701383650001101400650002201411700002001433700001901453700001801472700001101490700001401501700001201515773012401527856007401651852000901725655001201734IND60666979520221120235912.0190919e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066697952DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra11302k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Meng-xiang10aStereoselective adsorption utilizing l-phenylalanine imprinting chiral ordered mesoporous silica  ap. 54998-55002.  al-Phenylalanine imprinting chiral ordered mesoporous silica (l-Phe-COMS) was facilely synthesized in the presence of phenylalanine amino acid by combining tetraethyl orthosilicate and quaternized aminosilane silica sources. The obtained COMS was comparable with a MCM-41-type structure, with narrow pore size distribution, and high specific surface area characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and N₂ adsorption experiments. The imprinting chirality of COMS was disclosed by mixed and separate l- and d-phenylalanine adsorption on the l-Phe-COMS with a stereoselective adsorption capacity of up to 3.24. In addition, six racemic mixtures including amino acids and drugs were explored to test the stereoselective adsorption capacity of l-Phe-COMS. The imprinting chiral ordered mesoporous silica presents the advantages of straightforward synthesis approach and robust stereoselective adsorption capacity, making it a promising candidate for chiral adsorption and separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adrugs 3anitrogen 3aoptical isomerism 3aphenylalanine 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asilica 3astereoselectivity1 aLiu, Zhong-ying1 aChen, Jin-long1 aCheng, Li-fei1 aLi, Bo1 aYan, Fang1 aDi, Bin0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 28, v. 4, no. 98 p.54998-55002dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra11302k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245008400212506010400296506007600400520162700476592002802103506003702131650001602168650002402184650001302208650002902221650002002250650001102270650001502281650001402296650000902310650001902319650001902338650001502357650001302372653002102385653002602406653002002432653001702452653001402469653001102483700002002494700002102514700002302535700002002558773011802578856008602696852000902782655001202791IND60772451220221207122253.0220606e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077245122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1149922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhardwaj, Manisha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7769-084510aUngulates and trains – Factors influencing flight responses and detectability  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWildlife-train collisions can have deleterious effects on local wildlife populations and come with high socio-economic costs, such as damages, delays, and psychological distress. In this study, we explored two major components of wildlife-train collisions: the response of wildlife to oncoming trains and the detection of wildlife by drivers. Using dashboard cameras, we explored the flight response of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and moose (Alces alces) to oncoming trains and explored which factors, such as lighting and physical obstructions, affect their detection by drivers. In a majority of cases, roe deer and moose fled from an oncoming train, at an average flight initiation distance (FID) of 78 m and 79 m respectively. Warning horns had unexpected influences on flight behaviour. While roe deer initiated flight, on average, 44 m further away from the train when warned, they usually fled towards the tracks, in the direction of danger. FID of moose, however, was unaffected by the use of a warning horn. As train speed increased, moose had a lower FID, but roe deer FID did not change. Finally, detection of wildlife was obstructed by the presence of vegetation and uneven terrain in the rail-side verge, which could increase the risk of collisions. Our results indicate the need for early detection and warning of wildlife to reduce the risk of collisions. We propose that detection systems should include thermal cameras to allow detection behind vegetation and in the dark, and warning systems should use cues early to warn of oncoming trains and allow wildlife to escape the railway corridor safely.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlces alces 3aCapreolus capreolus 3adistress 3aenvironmental management 3aescape behavior 3aflight 3alandscapes 3arailroads 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asocioeconomics 3avegetation 3awildlife 0aAnimal behaviour 0aLinear infrastructure 0aRailway ecology 0aRoad ecology 0aDetection 0aFlight1 aOlsson, Mattias1 aHåkansson, Emma1 aSöderström, Pär1 aSeiler, Andreas0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 July 01, v. 313 p.114992-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1149923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017700172300001500349520197000364592002802334650001802362650000802380650000802388650002102396650002702417650002502444650002202469650001802491650001802509650001402527650001402541650002402555650002202579650001902601650001202620650001302632650001402645650001602659650002102675650001702696650002002713650002202733650001602755650001002771650000902781650003902790650002202829650002502851650001102876653002102887653002102908653001802929653000902947653002102956653001602977653001902993700002203012700002103034700002003055700002103075773010003096856008503196852000903281655001203290IND60767801220221117065857.0220321e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076780122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2022.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdestani, Hassan10aIn silico and in vivo approaches to recombinant multi-epitope immunogen of GroEL provides efficient cross protection against S.

HSP families recognize as protective antigens in a wide range of bacteria because they have been conserved through evolution. Due to their homology as well as antigenicity they are competent for applying in cross-protection against bacterial diseases. In the present study, bioinformatics approaches utilized to design epitope-based construction of Hsp60 (or GroEL) protein. In this regard, potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes except for allergenic sequences were selected by immunoinformatic tools. The structural and functional aspects of the DNA, RNA, and protein levels were assessed by bioinformatics software. Following in silico investigations, recombinant GroEL multi-epitope of Salmonella typhi was expressed, purified, and validated. Mouse groups were immunized with recombinant protein and humoral immune response was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Animal challenge against Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Shigella dysenteriae was evaluated. recombinant protein expression and purification with 14.3 kilodaltons (kDa) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. After animal administration, the immunoglobulins evaluated increase after each immunization. Immunized antisera exhibited 80%, 40%, and 40% protection against the lethal dose infection by S. Typhimurium, S. flexneri, and S. dysenteriae respectively. Passive immunization conferred 50%, 30%, and 30% protection in mice against S. Typhimurium, S. flexneri and S. dysentery respectively. In addition, bacterial organ load had exhibited a significant decrease in colony forming unit (CFU) in the liver and spleen of the immunized mice compared to the control. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of S. Typhi recombinant GroEL multi-epitope to consider as a universal immunogen candidate versus multiple bacterial pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aShigella dysenteriae 3aShigella flexneri 3aT-lymphocytes 3aallergenicity 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acomputer simulation 3acomputer software 3across immunity 3aenzymes 3aepitopes 3aevolution 3aheat stress 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunoinformatics 3alethal dose 3aliver 3amice 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3aspleen 0aIn silico design 0aSalmonella typhi 0aMulti-epitope 0aHSPs 0aCross protection 0aS. flexneri 0aS. dysenteriae1 aNazarian, Shahram1 aHajizadeh, Abbas1 aSadeghi, Davoud1 aKordbacheh, Emad0 tMolecular immunology.g2022 Apr., v. 144 p.96-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2022.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002500187245004800212300001600260506007600276520078700352592002801139506003701167650002801204650001901232650001501251650002301266650002201289650001501311650001901326650001801345650001101363650001701374650001601391650001301407650001101420650001201431650001401443650001701457650001701474653001401491653001901505653000801524653001201532653001601544653001001560653001301570700002401583700001901607700002501626773010801651856008101759852000901840655001201849IND60559930120221207054933.0180905e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055993012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pt.2016.11.0082doi7 aPMC53765082pmcid7 a280074062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanowitz, Herbert B.10aAdipose Tissue: A Safe Haven for Parasites?  ap. 276-284.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdipose tissue (AT) is no longer regarded as an inert lipid storage, but as an important central regulator in energy homeostasis and immunity.

In AT, T. cruzi resides inside adipocytes, T. brucei is found in the interstitial spaces between adipocytes, while Plasmodium spp. infect red blood cells, which may adhere to the blood vessels supplying AT.

K.10aInhibitors of Monoethanolamine Oxidation in CO2 Capture Processes  ap. 16222-16228.  aAqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) is a good solvent for postcombustion CO₂ capture; however, it is prone to oxidative degradation. The initial test conditions mimicked those found in the absorber of a commercial system: MEA was degraded in the presence of CO₂, with high oxygen mass transfer, and with dissolved metals, at absorber temperatures. In later experiments, high temperature cycling was incorporated into the apparatus to better represent a real system. These cycling results suggest that the unadditized 7 m MEA in a real system contacted with 5% oxygen in the absorber and with the stripper operated at 120 °C would experience close to 5% amine loss per week. Inhibitors such as inhibitor A (Inh A), 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid (HEDP), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) reduced MEA oxidation at low temperature by more than 90%. Results of the screening study also confirmed the reliability of ammonia production as an accurate indicator of MEA oxidation under all test conditions, allowing for rapid and accurate screening of new additives. Unfortunately, none of the additives screened at low temperature significantly reduced oxidation with high temperature cycling; thus they are not recommended at this point for use in a commercial CO₂ capture system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3aengineering 3aethanolamine 3amass transfer 3ametals 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3ascreening 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aRochelle, Gary T.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 53, no. 42 p.16222-16228dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie500996z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245010100175300001400276506002800290520234000318592002802658506003702686650001302723650000902736650001402745650001502759650001202774650001202786650000902798650001902807653004702826653002202873653004702895653000902942653003202951773016102983856009103144852000903235655001203244IND60739756620221207080604.0210112e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073975662DNAL7 a10.22314/2073-7599-2020-14-2-67-762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorokin, K.

They reasoned the relevance of scientific research on the development and design of technological lines using modular equipment for the humic and complex fertilizers production. A technical problem unresolved from a scientific point of view was revealed – the lack of industrial production of specialized equipment for humic fertilizers obtained on the basis of deep processing of organic raw materials.(Research purpose) To determine the optimal composition of modular equipment using digital technologies for the design of industrial processing lines for the organic raw materials processing (peat, sapropel, brown coal and biohumus) based on the technical specifications of the customer and the results of the experimental production lines.(Materials and methods) The authors studied the efficiency of the technological lines based on their technical capabilities. They studied the practical results of checking the dependence of the obtained products quality on the parameters and operating modes of individual units and assemblies. They used well-known private methods developed on their basis.(Results and discussion) The authors revealed some technical and technological deviations in the equipment operation: low level of organic raw materials purification when the vibratory separator was 85-90 percent, insufficient power of the disassembler – 3.5 kilowatts; fertilizers dispersion after the reactor exceeded 140 micrometers; the content of the ballast after filtration – 5-8 percent; the level of humic salts was low – from 5 to 10 grams per liter; trace element dosing system was not perfect. The authors suggested continuing the search for technical solutions for production without ballast humates using modular equipment. They identified the need to increase the productivity of technological lines from 1 to 2.5 tons per shift.(Conclusions) Based on practical experience in modernizing production lines, the authors suggested optimizing the composition of modular equipment purchased in the market for engineering products. They determined the basic principles of the modular design of technological lines that allowed using the Internet portal to increase production efficiency and obtain a product of demanded quality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3acoal 3aequipment 3afiltration 3ahumates 3amarkets 3apeat 3atrace elements 0aindustrial production of humic fertilizers 0amodular equipment 0adesign of an industrial technological line 0apeat 0acomplex organic fertilizers0 tSelʹskohozâjstvennye mašiny i tehnologii.g2020 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.67-76dFederal Scientific Agroengineering Centre VIMwJournal:27913x2618-67487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22314/2073-7599-2020-14-2-67-763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245013400205506011700339506007600456520177500532592002802307506003702335650001102372650002002383650001402403650001102417650001102428650001402439650001402453653001002467653001602477653002002493653000802513653001702521653001602538653001602554653001402570700001402584700001602598700005602614700005702670773009402727856008202821852000902903655001202912IND60764078120221207073913.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076407812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2022.1078632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhernovaia, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9696-552214aThe PaleoArchiNeo (PAN) human brain atlas: A dataset on a standard neuroanatomical MRI template following a phylogenetic approach  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCortical atlases provide consistent divisions of the human cortex into areas that have common structural as well as meaningful and distinctive functional characteristics. They constitute a fundamental tool to study and quantify changes in healthy and pathological states. Historically, the most widely used atlases follow the cytoarchitecture described by Brodmann and/or the myeloarchitectonic characteristics described by Vogt-Vogt. These histological approaches have since been combined to the standard anatomical nomenclature of gyri and sulci, referring to the corresponding cytoarchitectonic area(s) present in a gyrus, when applicable or necessary (e.g. area 4 of Brodmann in the pre-central gyrus). More recently, common functional features depicted by resting state functional MRI have guided the division of the cortex into functional regions of interest. However, to date, there are no human MRI atlases that divide the cortex considering the common evolutionary changes experienced by the mammalian cortex. Hence, the present dataset describes the PaleoArchiNeo (PAN) Human Brain, a voxel-based atlas that divides the human cortex into five regions of interest (ROIs) following a phylogenetic approach: 1- archicortex, 2- paleocortex, 3- peri-archicortex, 4- proisocortex, 5- neocortex, and thirty neocortical sub-ROIs that follow the gyral Terminologia Anatomica.The masks of the ROIs and sub-ROIs were segmented on the T1-weighted MNI ICBM 152 2009c symmetric average brain MRI model, the latest version of the most widely used standard brain template. The segmentations have been performed manually by anatomist experts, following the MRI anatomical landmarks that have been previously described, correlated, and validated with histology by other groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acortex 3adata collection 3ahistology 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneocortex 3aphylogeny 0aAtlas 0aHuman brain 0aCerebral cortex 0aMRI 0aPhylogenetic 0aPaleocortex 0aArchicortex 0aNeocortex1 aDadar, M.1 aMahmoud, S.1 aZeighami, Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0583-58111 aMaranzano, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9696-55220 tData in Brief.g2022 Apr., v. 41 p.107863-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.1078633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012200171300001600293520091000309592002801219650002201247650001301269650001901282650002201301650001201323650001001335650002401345650002601369650001601395650001201411650001301423650003001436650002701466653002201493653002701515653001901542653002201561653002001583653004001603700001901643700001801662700002301680700006801703773011501771856008401886852000901970655001201979IND60605309520221118132145.0190628e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060530952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2018.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandelwal, Rohit10aDeletion of pyruvate decarboxylase gene in Zymomonas mobilis by recombineering through bacteriophage lambda red genes  ap. 111-117.  aZymomonas mobilis ZM4 is a gram negative ethanologenic bacterium used in several biotechnological applications. Metabolic engineering in this bacterium is limited because of the available genome engineering tools. In the present study, we report genome engineering in this bacterium using bacteriophage lambda Red genes. Stability of plasmid replicons RK2 (pSIM9) and pBBR1 (pSIM7) containing the lambda Red genes was found to be 78% and 74%, respectively. We demonstrate successful deletion of pyruvate decarboxylase gene by recombineering in Z. mobilis. The deletion was confirmed by PCR and by estimating the metabolites formed. Ethanol, which was the main product in wild type cells, was formed in almost negligible amount in the pdc-deleted mutant. The developed Δpdc Z. mobilis cells can be exploited for production of desired bioproducts by expression of suitable enzymes that can regenerate NAD+.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZymomonas mobilis 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3abiobased products 3aethanol 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolites 3amutants 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apyruvate decarboxylase 0aZymomonas mobilis 0aPyruvate decarboxylase 0aRecombineering 0aPlasmid stability 0aElectroporation 0aSouthern blotting and hybridization1 aAgrawal, Sonal1 aSinghi, Divya1 aSrivastava, Preeti1 aBisaria, Virendra Swarup1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3717-71200 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2018 Aug., v. 151 p.111-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2018.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245016700165300002000332520096100352592002801313650001401341650002101355650001401376650002501390650001601415650002001431650001501451650002101466650001201487650001401499650001301513650003701526700001801563700002001581700002301601700002601624700002501650773013601675856007501811852000901886655001201895IND60538179820221118142123.0160815e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053817982DNAL7 a10.1021/ie50136182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatravale, Ajinkya

The effect of sequential addition of the components in the configuration of the desired product has been studied by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The synthetic method obeys most of the green chemistry principles in regard to high atom economy and greener, nontoxic, and noncarcinogenic solvent system (water–ethanol). The selected synthesized compounds have been screened against the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, human colon cancer cell line HT29, and normal viro monkey cell line, out of which 2-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5H-indeno[1,2-d]pyrimidin-5-one showed significant potency toward human breast cancer cell line (MCF7).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abreast neoplasms 3achemistry 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aengineering 3agreen chemistry 3aguanidines 3ahuman cell lines 3amonkeys 3ascreening 3asolvents 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aGore, Anil H.1 aPatil, Dipti R.1 aKolekar, Govind B.1 aDeshmukh, Madhukar

Fresh juice may have nutrients and phytonutrients that differ from pasteurized or processed juice. RESULTS: ‘Hamlin’ and ‘Valencia’ oranges were extracted using a commercial food service juicer, pasteurized or not, resulting in fresh‐commercial juice (FCJ) or pasteurized FCJ (FCPJ) for comparison with pasteurized processed juice (PPJ) in 2009, and gently hand‐squeezed ‘Valencia’ juice (HSJ) in 2010 for nutrient and phytonutrient content. Regardless of pasteurization, FCJ/FCPJ contained 25–49% lower insoluble solids than the PPJ, while in HSJ the insoluble solids content was between that of FCJ and PPJ. The major orange juice flavonoid glycosides were twofold higher in PPJ than in FCJ/FCPJ and HSJ, indicating that the extraction and finishing process led to more peel tissue in the juice than fresh juice extraction methods. The total phenolic content (TPC) in the juices followed a similar pattern to the flavonoid glycoside content. The polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), associated with peel oil, occurred at the highest levels in the FCJ/FCPJ and lowest in HSJ. Limonoids and alkaloids occurred at higher levels in PPJ and HSJ than in FCJ/FCPJ. CONCLUSION: The high peel oil content of FCJ/FCPJ resulted in higher PMF levels compared to PPJ and HSJ, while flavonoid glycosides, limonoids and alkaloids, which occur at high concentrations in the inner peel albedo, occurred at higher concentrations in PPJ.

Supercritical CO₂ with O₂ and SO₂ impurities (0.16 and 2% respectively) was reacted with core from the Precipice Sandstone, Evergreen Formation, and Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin, Australia. The Precipice Sandstone is a low salinity target reservoir for CO₂ storage, where the Evergreen Formation would be the overlying cap-rock, and the Hutton Sandstone is an overlying aquifer. High and low water regimes were investigated with core sections either submerged in bulk gas saturated water, or suspended in the water saturated supercritical gas head at reservoir in situ conditions of 60 °C and 12 MPa. During O₂–SO₂–CO₂ water rock reactions in bulk solution, a low solution pH (~1–2) was measured owing to the relatively high gas impurity concentrations used. Dissolution of reactive minerals from the core including Fe-chlorite, ankerite, siderite, and plagioclase was directly observed. The Evergreen Formation cap-rock and Hutton Sandstone cores reacted here contained ~ 5–10 times higher total concentrations of elements such as Fe, Al, Ti, Ba than the Precipice Sandstone core. Several cations were mobilised to solution including Mn, Co, Zn, Sr, Si, and Mg. Increasing dissolved concentrations of Mn, and Co were strongly correlated with Fe (R² = 0.99) during reaction of the Precipice Sandstone core. Dissolved Co and Sr were strongly correlated with Fe during reaction of the Evergreen Formation core. Dissolved Mn was somewhat correlated with Fe (R² = 0.99) from reaction of the Hutton Sandstone core, from both carbonate and chlorite dissolution. During gas-water reaction with the Hutton Sandstone core, dissolved element concentrations subsequently decreased, by incorporation into newly formed Fe oxide precipitates observed with Cr and Ni signatures. Geochemical models were built and validated with good agreement attained with experiments, predicting Fe-chlorite and minor carbonate minerals were the main minerals dissolving. Reactive surface areas initially estimated by a modified geometric method needed substantial increases for example in the case of chlorite (up to 2000x), and decreases for carbonates (2–10x) to match experimental data. A 30 year simulation of reservoir rock reactivity showed that the lowered pH was buffered by mineral dissolution. Compared to previously published pure CO₂-water-rock reactions, the concentrations of ions such as Si generally were initially higher through reaction of more silicate minerals at the lower generated pH, and the oxidation of sulphides. Compared to SO₂–CO₂-water reactions, the concentrations of cations were similar, but with O₂ present dissolved Fe subsequently decreased as Fe-oxide, sulphate and clay minerals precipitated. Cap-rock showed reactivity to wet supercritical O₂–SO₂–CO₂ fluid in the supercritical gas headspace. Corrosion of minerals including ankerite and Fe-chlorite were observed, along with precipitation of oxide, sulphate and silicate minerals on rock surfaces. These results have implications for impacts in CO₂ storage sites where gas impurities may be co-injected with CO₂ and accumulate in the near wellbore region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaquifers 3abarium 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acations 3acement 3achromium 3aclay minerals 3acoal 3acobalt 3acorrosion 3ageochemistry 3ageometry 3aheadspace analysis 3airon 3airon oxides 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amodels 3anickel 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aplagioclase 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asandstone 3asiderite 3asilicon 3asteel 3astreams 3astrontium 3asulfates 3asulfides 3asulfur dioxide 3azinc 3aAustralia 0aCO2 geosequestration 0aOxygen and sulphur dioxide impurity 0aPrecipice sandstone 0aEvergreen formation 0aHutton sandstone1 aKirste, Dirk M.1 aDawson, Grant K.W.1 aRudolph, Victor1 aGolding, Suzanne D.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2019 Oct., v. 109 p.104400-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.1044003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008500165300001600250520112400266592002801390650002301418650001201441650001901453650002101472650001001493650002301503650001301526650001101539650001201550650001301562650002201575651001601597700002501613700002101638773014101659856007901800852000901879655001201888IND60643961720221119101249.0190514s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064396172DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2017-01952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCann, Erin L.10aCorresponding long-term shifts in stream temperature and invasive fish migration  ap. 772-778.  aBy investigating historic trapping records of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) throughout tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes, we found that upstream spawning migration timing was highly correlated with stream temperatures over large spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, several streams in our study exceeded a critical spring thermal threshold (i.e., 15 °C) and experienced peak spawning migration up to 30 days earlier than in the 1980s, whereas others were relatively unchanged. Streams exhibiting warming trends and earlier migration were spatially clustered and generally found on the leeward side of the Great Lakes where the lakes most affect local climate. These findings highlight that all streams are not equally impacted by climate change and represent, to our knowledge, the first observation linking long-term changes in stream temperatures to shifts in migration timing of an invasive fish. Earlier sea lamprey migration in Great Lakes tributaries may improve young of the year growth and survival but not limit their spatial distribution, making sea lamprey control more challenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetromyzon marinus 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amigratory behavior 3aspawning 3aspring 3astreams 3atrapping 3awater temperature 3aGreat Lakes1 aJohnson, Nicholas S.1 aPangle, Kevin L.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2018, v. 75, no. 5 p.772-778dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-01953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245018300169300001800352500002000370520165600390592002802046650002002074650001002094650000902104650001502113650002002128650002302148650002002171650001502191650002702206650002802233650002302261650002102284650002002305650002002325650001102345650001302356650002102369650001002390650001502400650002202415650002502437650001002462650001602472700003102488700002002519700002802539700002002567700002302587773012202610856007302732852000902805655001202814IND60587874220221119133347.0180102e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058787422DNAL7 a10.1111/are.131562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoseinifar, Seyed Hossein10aComparative study on immunomodulatory and growth enhancing effects of three prebiotics (galactooligosaccharide, fructooligosaccharide and inulin) in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 3298-3307.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study investigated the effects of different prebiotics, including galactooligosaccharide (GOS), fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and inulin (INL), on skin mucosal immune parameters, humoral immune responses as well as performance of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Two hundred and forty specimens (13.85 ± 0.85 g) were stocked in 12 fibreglass tanks assigned into three treatments and a control group. The experimental diets were formulated to have equal level (2%) of the prebiotics. At the end of the feeding trial, the highest skin mucus lysozyme activities and total immunoglobulin (total Ig) were observed in GOS‐fed group (P < 0.05). However, skin mucus protease activity showed no significant difference among different dietary groups (P < 0.05). Blood respiratory burst activity was significantly increased in all prebiotic‐fed fish compared to the control group (P < 0.05); the highest activity was observed in GOS treatment. Furthermore, evaluation of humoral immune response revealed that feeding with GOS‐supplemented diet significantly increased lysozyme and alternative complement (ACH50) activity as well as total Ig compared to the control and other prebiotic groups. While no significant difference was observed between FOS and INL groups, common carps fed GOS‐supplemented displayed improved (P < 0.05) growth performance, including final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the control treatment. These results revealed that different prebiotics modulate carp growth and immune response in different manner, and GOS seems to be the most suitable prebiotic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3ablood 3acarp 3acomplement 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afiberglass 3afructooligosaccharides 3agalactooligosaccharides 3agrowth performance 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainulin 3alysozyme 3amucosal immunity 3amucus 3aprebiotics 3arespiratory burst 3aspecific growth rate 3atanks 3aweight gain1 aAḥmadī, ʻAlī Riz̤ā,1 aRaeisi, Mojtaba1 aHoseini, Seyyed Morteza1 aKhalili, Mohsen1 aBehnampour, Nasser0 tAquaculture research.g2017 July, v. 48, no. 7 p.3298-3307dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.131563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245015500161300002000316520110100336592002801437650001401465650001301479650002101492650001201513650001501525650001701540650002001557650001601577650002001593650001601613650001401629650002101643650002001664650002201684650001201706650001401718700001601732700001801748700002001766700002401786700002201810773013401832856007801966852000902044655001202053IND60586034320180904000000.0171115e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058603432DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b061412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Changhao10aSynthesis of All Possible Canonical (3′–5′-Linked) Cyclic Dinucleotides and Evaluation of Riboswitch Interactions and Immune-Stimulatory Effects  ap. 16154-16160.  aThe cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP, and c-AMP-GMP are widely utilized as second messengers in bacteria, where they signal lifestyle changes such as motility and biofilm formation, cell wall and membrane homeostasis, virulence, and exo-electrogenesis. For all known bacterial CDNs, specific riboswitches have been identified that alter gene expression in response to the second messengers. In addition, bacterial CDNs trigger potent immune responses, making them attractive as adjuvants in immune therapies. Besides the three naturally occurring CDNs, seven further CDNs containing canonical 3′–5′-linkages are possible by combining the four natural ribonucleotides. Herein, we have synthesized all ten possible combinations of 3′–5′-linked CDNs. The binding affinity of novel CDNs and GEMM riboswitch variants was assessed utilizing a spinach aptamer fluorescence assay and in-line probing assays. The immune-stimulatory effect of CDNs was evaluated by induction of type I interferons (IFNs), and a novel CDN c-AMP-CMP was identified as a new immune-stimulatory agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3abacteria 3abinding capacity 3abiofilm 3acell walls 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3ainterferons 3alifestyle 3aoligonucleotides 3aribonucleotides 3asecond messengers 3aspinach 3avirulence1 aSinn, Malte1 aStifel, Julia1 aHeiler, Anna C.1 aSommershof, Annette1 aHartig, Jörg S.,0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 139, no. 45 p.16154-16160dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b061413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245009500175300001600270520115500286592002801441650000801469650001201477650001001489650001401499650001601513650002501529650000901554650002001563650001401583650001901597650002701616650001201643650001201655650002301667650001801690650001101708700002401719700001601743700001501759700001401774700001501788700001701803700001701820773010901837856004001946852000901986655001201995IND50089331220221119030007.0140505e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008933122DNAL7 a247352232pmid7 a10.1111/rda.123182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzczerbal, I12aA Case of Leucocyte Chimerism (78,XX/78,XY) in a Dog with a Disorder of Sexual Development  ap. e31-e34.  aA 1‐year‐old Shih Tzu dog was presented for examination because of abnormal external genitalia. A residual penis with a prepuce was located in a position typical of a male. The dog had no palpable testicles or scrotum. The ultrasound examination revealed the presence of the prostate, but the gonads remained undetectable. Cytogenetic analysis performed on chromosome preparations obtained from lymphocyte culture showed two cell lines – 78,XX and 78,XY. Molecular analysis of 14 polymorphic microsatellite markers allowed us to distinguish leucocyte chimerism from whole body chimerism. The presence of 3 or 4 alleles was confirmed in DNA isolated from blood, while in DNA isolated from hair follicles only 1 or 2 alleles were detected. The case was classified as leucocyte 78,XX/78,XY chimerism. Our study showed that XX/XY leucocyte chimerism might be associated with disorder of sexual development in dogs. Furthermore, it is emphasized that the use of cytogenetic study, in combination with analysis of polymorphic markers in DNA isolated from different somatic cells, facilitates distinguishing between leucocyte and whole body chimerism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalleles 3ablood 3achimerism 3achromosomes 3acytogenetic analysis 3adogs 3agenetic markers 3agenitalia 3ahair follicles 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprepuce 3ascrotum 3asexual development 3asomatic cells 3atestes1 aNowacka‐Woszuk, J1 aNizanski, W1 aSalamon, S1 aOchota, M1 aDzimira, S1 aAtamaniuk, W1 aSwitonski, M0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 June, v. 49, no. 3 p.e31-e34dBlackwell Sciencex0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.12318  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010400164300001800268520188100286592002802167650001202195650001102207650001902218650002002237650001402257650001502271650001502286650001202301650001902313650001302332650002402345650001202369650001102381650002902392650002102421650002102442650001102463650001802474700002002492700001902512700002602531773010402557856007502661852000902736655001202745IND60534013020221116185612.0160802e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053401302DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300653b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerguson, Thomas E.,10aNovel Approach to Hydrogen Production with Suppressed COx Generation from a Model Biomass Feedstock  ap. 4486-4496.  aThe alkaline thermal treatment of biomass has recently been proposed as a novel method for producing high purity H₂ with suppressed COₓ formation under moderate reaction conditions (i.e., 523 K and ambient pressure). This technology has a great potential for sustainable bioenergy production because it can handle a wide range of feedstocks including biomass and biogenic wastes with high water content. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the reactions involved, the alkaline thermal treatment of biomass is still poorly understood. In this study, using a model biomass system of glucose, a series of noncatalytic kinetic and mechanistic studies was performed to investigate the effects of reaction temperature and reactant ratios in terms of H₂ conversion, purity, and formation rates of H₂ as well as gaseous products such as CH₄, CO, and CO₂. The CO concentration is one of the important factors for the utilization of the product gas because CO is generally poisonous to catalytic systems such as those found in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Thus, high CO concentration would require additional gas cleanup processes. This study found that NaOH does play an important role in suppressing CO and CO₂ formation while facilitating H₂ production and promoting CH₄ formation. The noncatalytic alkaline thermal treatment of glucose resulted in a maximum H₂ conversion of about 27% at 523 K with a stoichiometric mixture of NaOH and glucose. While the H₂ conversion was limited in the absence of catalyst, the moderate reaction conditions, low COₓ concentration, and solid–solid reaction scheme give advantages over conventional biomass conversion technologies. The solids analysis confirmed the presence of Na₂CO₃ in the solid product, indicating the inherent carbon management potential of the alkaline thermal treatment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3afeedstocks 3afuel cells 3aglucose 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3asodium carbonate 3asodium hydroxide 3awastes 3awater content1 aPark, Youngjune1 aPetit, Camille1 aPark, Ah-Hyung Alissa0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 July 19, v. 26, no. 7 p.4486-4496dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef300653b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01571naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007900167300001600246520041200262592002800674650002100702650002200723650002500745650001900770650002300789650002200812650001900834650000900853651000900862653002400871653003000895653001300925653001800938700001600956700002400972773011700996856005101113852000901164655001201173IND50087183520221119162111.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008718352DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2013.7940412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAghassi, Ali10aChemical Composition of the Essential Oil of Cyperus rotundus L. from Iran  ap. 382-386.  aThe chemical composition of essential oil of Cyperus rotundus L. grown in Iran was studied by hydrodistillation and GC and GC-MS.

Side-chain packing is a sub-problem of protein folding and its computational complexity has been shown to be NP-hard. We investigated the capabilities of a hybrid (genetic algorithm/simulated annealing) technique for side-chain packing and for the generation of an ensemble of low energy side-chain conformations. Our method first relies on obtaining a near-optimal low energy protein conformation by optimizing its amino-acid side-chains. Upon convergence, the genetic algorithm is allowed to undergo forward and “backward” evolution by alternating selection pressures between minimal and higher energy setpoints. We show that this technique is very efficient for obtaining distributions of solutions centered at any desired energy from the minimum. We outline the general concepts of our evolutionary sampling methodology using three different alternating selective pressure schemes. Quality of the method was assessed by using it for protein pK(a) prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3aprediction 3aprotein folding 3aproteins1 aVassiliev, Sergei1 aHoughten, Sheridan1 aBruce, Doug0 tBioSystems.g2011 Sept., v. 105, no. 3 p.263-270dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011400206300001800320520120700338592002801545650001101573650001101584650001301595650001901608650001001627650001201637650001001649650002401659650001401683650001401697650001201711650001101723650002201734651001201756700002001768700002201788773013101810856008201941852000902023655001202032IND60676915120221122054715.0191122e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067691512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-019-01682-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPöysä, Hannu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1585-237510aBreeding sex ratios in two declining diving duck species: between-year variation and changes over six decades  ap. 1015-1023.  aSex ratio variation has important consequences for population dynamics and viability. Adult sex ratio is male biased in many duck species, and data from wintering areas suggest male bias has been increasing in some European duck species. However, the reasons for changes in sex ratios remain poorly understood, and information on sex ratio variation among breeding ducks is limited. We studied long-term changes in breeding sex ratios and breeding numbers in Common Pochard Aythya ferina and Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula in southern Finland, the former species being currently assessed as critically endangered and the latter as endangered in Finland. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that between-year variation in breeding sex ratios is affected by the severity of weather conditions in the wintering areas. The proportion of females among breeding Tufted Ducks decreased from 42.9% in 1951–1970 to 36.9% in 1996–2015, while no statistically significant change was observed in Common Pochard (41.8% and 39.5%, respectively). Both species showed a decline in breeding numbers over the same period. Severity of the preceding winter did not affect the proportion of females in the breeding area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAythya 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aducks 3afemales 3amales 3apopulation dynamics 3asex ratio 3aviability 3aweather 3awinter 3awintering grounds 3aFinland1 aLinkola, Pentti1 aPaasivaara, Antti0 tJournal of ornithology.g2019 Oct., v. 160, no. 4 p.1015-1023dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-019-01682-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013300176520190300309592002802212650001302240650001902253650001002272650001402282650001802296650001502314650002002329650002102349650001702370650000902387650002102396650001102417650001702428651001102445653002202456653000802478653001302486653002102499653002302520653002702543700002002570700002102590700002502611700003602636773013302672856008502805852000902890655001202899IND60715959120221120151223.0220726e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071595912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Luiz Gustavo10aMultivariate taphonomic analysis of mollusk shell concentrations in Holocene deposits of southern Brazil: An integrated approach  aShell concentrations are one of the most distinctive features of the Holocene coastal stratigraphy in the southern portion of Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. In this paper, we integrated stratigraphic, geochronological, geophysical, and taphonomic data to discuss the processes involved in the genesis of shell concentrations in a siliciclastic and subtropical setting, a useful analogy for ancient shell concentrations in semi-closed environments affected by storms. The data indicated the succession of three facies associations (FA): bay, lagoon, and back-barrier. This succession implies a grain size fining-upward trend that is representative of a gradual shallowing. Interpretation of GPR sections revealed that the passage from the bay to lagoonal deposits occurred by forming a laterally continuous, high-amplitude surface overlain by sigmoidal reflections, which characterized the progressive basinward backstepping of the lagoonal margin. Shell concentrations in bay deposits are an allochthonous product of storm flows in shallow waters. In contrast, accumulations of the bivalve Anomalocardia brasiliana had their valves reworked in the lagoonal margins and transported to the bottom, characterizing a parautochthonous accumulation. In this study, the correlation of taphonomy and grain size indicates that in bay FA, the loss of periostracum is correlated with increased gradients of fine sand, and part of the shell samples correlates to corrosion and abrasion in increased gradients of medium sand and decreased ones of fine sand. Additionally, in the lagoon FA, the loss of periostracum depends on the decrease in mud-enriched sediments and the increase in fine and medium sand, whereas brightness loss and color alteration are related to the increase in fine and medium sand, as well as margin modification. Corrosion was positively correlated to the mud-dominated fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aHolocene epoch 3acolor 3acorrosion 3ageochronology 3ageophysics 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3asand 3ashell (molluscs) 3astorms 3astratigraphy 3aBrazil 0aActuopaleontology 0aGPR 0aHolocene 0aCoastal dynamics 0aRelative sea-level 0aSiliciclastic deposits1 aFornari, Milene1 aErthal, Fernando1 aLeme, Juliana Moraes1 aGiannini, Paulo César Fonseca,0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 562 p.110085-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012900201300001800330500002000348520132700368592002801695596009101723596004401814596009801858650002101956650001801977650001901995650001302014650002302027650001402050650001302064650001102077700002402088700003002112700002002142773010902162856007302271852000902344655001202353IND60750792820221120154443.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079282DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowers, Breanna F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1288-262410aIntra‐specific variation in migration phenology of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) in response to spring temperatures  ap. 1448-1456.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn migratory birds, among‐ and within‐species heterogeneity in response to climate change may be attributed to differences in migration distance and environmental cues that affect timing of arrival at breeding grounds. We used eBird observations and a within‐species comparative approach to examine whether migration distance (with latitude as a proxy) and weather predictors can explain spring arrival dates at the breeding site in a raptor species with a widespread distribution and diverse migration strategies, the American Kestrel Falco sparverius. We found an interactive effect between latitude and spring minimum temperatures on arrival dates, whereby at lower latitudes (short‐distance migrants) American Kestrels arrived earlier in warmer springs and later in colder springs, but American Kestrels at higher latitudes (long‐distance migrants) showed no association between arrival time and spring temperatures. Increased snow cover delayed arrival at all latitudes. Our results support the hypothesis that short‐distance migrants are better able to respond to conditions on the breeding ground than are long‐distance migrants, suggesting that long‐distance migrants may be more vulnerable to shifts in spring conditions that could lead to phenological mismatch between peak resources and nesting.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Biological Sciences and Raptor Research Center at Boise State University  aOIA‐1757324cNSF Idaho EPSCoR Program  aRC‐2702cDepartment of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program 3aFalco sparverius 3abirds of prey 3aclimate change 3alatitude 3amigratory behavior 3aphenology 3asnowpack 3aspring1 aWiniarski, Jason M.1 aRequena‐Mullor, Juan M.1 aHeath, Julie A.0 tIbis.g2021 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.1448-1456dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245013400211300001200345520159700357592002801954650001901982650001902001650001202020650003602032650001602068650001102084650001502095650001902110650001502129650001202144650002502156650002102181650002102202650001402223650001902237650001502256650001402271650001302285650001302298650001802311651001402329653001902343653001902362653001902381653002302400653002402423700002402447700006902471773009502540856008602635852000902721655001202730IND60525797320221120220705.0190319e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmer, Marianne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6095-548810aEffects of point source of untreated sewage waters on seagrass (Zostera marina and Z. noltii) beds in the South-Western Black Sea  ap. 1-9.  aTourist development is rapid on the South-West coast of the Black Sea, increasing the pressure on the coastal ecosystem. Zostera marina and Zostera noltii are abundant seagrasses in the Black Sea, but little is known about their sensitivity towards coastal developments. In this study plant nutrient content (N and P), sulphide intrusion, sediment organic matter, pore water pools of nutrients and sulphides, sulphate reduction rates as well as water column nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations were studied in a mixed seagrass meadow (Z. marina L. and Z. noltii Hornem.) located in an area receiving untreated sewage waters from a point source in Sozopol Bay, South-Western Black Sea. In addition, studies included population level metrics like density, biomass and shoot morphology. The point source impacted water quality in the area leading to local nutrient enrichment, development of filamentous macroalgae and reduced water transparency. Although sulphide intrusion was detected in Z. marina and thus indicating existence of sulphide pressure on the plants, there were no significant effects on the seagrass distribution except for Z. noltii being absent from the meadows close to the point source. The nutrient levels were low in the plants and in the sediments compared to global Z. marina and Z. noltii meadows, but the observed blooms of filamentous macroalgae, increase in sulphide intrusion and higher N contents of the plants during the peak tourist season are signs of eutrophication in Sozopol Bay most likely as a result of increased recreational activity on the coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZostera marina 3aZostera noltei 3abiomass 3achemical constituents of plants 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3amacroalgae 3ameadows 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3asulfates 3asulfides 3awater quality 3aBlack Sea 0aZostera marina 0aZostera noltii 0aEutrophication 0aSulphide intrusion 0aCoastal development1 aGeorgiev, Valeri G.1 aKaramfilov, Ventzislav K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8343-39060 tAquatic botany.g2016 Aug., v. 133 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007700166300001400243520168300257592002801940650003301968650001702001650002602018650001202044650001202056650001602068650001702084650001102101650001502112650001102127650001602138650000702154650003602161650001302197650003802210650002302248653002002271653000802291653001802299653001902317653002702336700001202363700001902375700002402394700001802418773009602436856008602532852000902618655001202627IND60525797420221120220717.0190319e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Liyan10aPhotosynthetic inorganic carbon acquisition in 30 freshwater macrophytes  ap. 48-54.  aPhotosynthetic inorganic carbon (Ci) acquisition mechanisms were surveyed in 30 freshwater macrophytes grown under uniform, nutrient-sufficient, low Ci conditions where Ci is a potentially limiting factor on plant photosynthesis. In pH-drift experiments there was evidence for HCO3− use in 21 of the 30 species that were able to raise the solution pH above 10.0. Titratable acidity had distinct diel fluctuations in the leaves of Nechamandra alternifolia, Egeria densa, Vallisneria spinulosa, Deinostema violaceum, and Isoetes sinensis (aerial and submersed), which suggests some degree of Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) in these species. Incubation of D. violaceum under low Ci conditions substantially increased the amount of acidity and the difference between night and day. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity in Hydrilla verticillata, V. spinulosa, E. densa, D. violaceum, Ottelia acuminata, and O. alismoides ranged from 32.4±6.6 to 156.8±5.3μmolmg−1proteinh−1 and the ratio of PEPC to ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) activity ranged from 1.0 to 2.9. When O. alismoides and D. violaceum were incubated under conditions that greatly reduced daytime Ci, the PEPC activity was around 1.5 times higher than in untreated leaves. A high PEPC to Rubisco activity ratio, and the increased ratio under low Ci conditions, is consistent with a facultative C4 or CAM system. These results indicated that most of the freshwater macrophytes tested can use HCO3− as a carbon source, while O. alismoides, and D. violaceum may possess C4 or CAM characteristics like H. verticillata and I. howellii, and thus are worthy of further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aEgeria densa 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aIsoetes 3aOttelia 3aVallisneria 3abicarbonates 3acarbon 3afreshwater 3aleaves 3amacrophytes 3apH 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aribulose 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atitratable acidity 0aBicarbonate use 0aCAM 0aC4 metabolism 0aPhotosynthesis 0aFreshwater macrophytes1 aLi, Wei1 aMadsen, Tom V.1 aMaberly, Stephen C.1 aBowes, George0 tAquatic botany.g2017 May, v. 140 p.48-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03978naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014300163520223200306592002802538650002002566650001702586650001702603650002302620650002002643650001602663650001302679650001402692650001802706650001502724650001102739650002002750650002102770650001702791650001502808650001402823650001502837650001402852650001102866651001002877653002102887653002502908653002102933653003302954653002202987700002003009700001803029700002003047700001903067700001803086700001303104700001703117700001503134773013303149856008503282852000903367655001203376IND60715959420221120160540.0220726e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071595942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bing10aPre-cenozoic evolution of the northern Qilian Orogen from zircon geochronology: Framework for early growth of the northern Tibetan Plateau  aThe northern Qilian Shan, located along the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, experienced multiple phases of orogeny throughout the Phanerozoic, culminating in fold-thrust and strike-slip deformation associated with the Cenozoic India-Asia collision. Earlier phases of deformation in the Qilian Shan have been severely reactivated or transformed by the most recent Cenozoic strain. To better understand the tectonic evolution of this complex region, we conducted an integrated investigation of field observations, U–Pb dating of igneous and detrital zircons, and a synthesis of previously published data to constrain and reconstruct the pre-Cenozoic history of the northern Qilian Shan. This effort reveals five major age populations important to the history of this region: 2550–2350, 1850–1750, 1050–950, 500–435, and 320–240 Ma. Using this dataset, we identified three major depositional shifts and/or variations in drainage patterns that affected sediment provenance of the northern Qilian Orogen. Observed regional geologic constraints, the magmatic history, and new geophysical observations of the deep structure allow us to propose a coherent tectonic model for the pre-Cenozoic evolution of the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. (1) Late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian rifting opened the Qilian Ocean. (2) Early Cambrian subduction initiation along the margins of Qaidam and North China–Tarim continents resulted in Cambrian-Ordovician bivergent subduction, arc magmatism within these two continents, and consumption of the Qilian Ocean. (3) Final ocean closure and continental collision occurred at ca. 440 Ma and was associated with syn- and post-orogenic magmatism. (4) Collisional orogeny variably eroded the basement rocks, reorganized drainage networks, and altered sedimentary provenance for the lower Paleozoic to upper Paleozoic deposits. (5) Mesozoic extension led to the development of thick Jurassic–Cretaceous terrestrial basins. This pre-Cenozoic history resulted in preexisting weaknesses and/or low-friction detachment horizons that played a decisive role in controlling the pattern, distribution, and timing of Cenozoic deformation across the northern Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambrian period 3aCenozoic era 3aMesozoic era 3aNeoproterozoic era 3adata collection 3adeformation 3adrainage 3aevolution 3ageochronology 3ageophysics 3amodels 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aprovenance 3asediments 3asubduction 3atectonics 3azircon 3aChina 0aOrogenic plateau 0aU–Pb zircon dating 0aTectonic history 0aSediment provenance analysis 0aBasin development1 aZuza, Andrew V.1 aChen, Xuanhua1 aWang, Zeng-Zhen1 aShao, Zhaogang1 aLevy, Drew A.1 aWu, Chen1 aXu, Shenglin1 aSun, Yujun0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 562 p.110091-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1100913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245009500195300001800290500002000308520180100328592002802129596002802157596009202185596009202277596009202369650001402461650001002475650001102485650001502496650001402511650000902525650001202534651001102546700006602557700006102623773010902684856007302793852000902866655001202875IND60750793120221116195304.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079312DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiniz, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3193-637610aUrban cycles of human activity do not significantly alter the behaviour of a duetting bird  ap. 1394-1408.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe weekend effect hypothesis predicts that weekly cycles of human activity impact animal behaviour and physiology. This hypothesis has been supported in the context of recreational activity in natural environments but it is unknown whether it also applies to urban animals. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the sentinel (territorial vigilance), foraging and vocal behaviours of an urban‐dwelling bird, the Rufous Hornero Furnarius rufus, between weekdays and weekends (and holidays) within a university campus in central Brazil. The level of human activity (noise, traffic and pedestrian flow) increases greatly on weekdays on this campus. We predicted that the birds would perceive a greater predation risk and would need to adjust their acoustic signals in response to anthropogenic noise on weekdays. Thus, we expected that the birds would spend more time as sentinels and less time foraging, and would sing for longer periods and at a higher pitch on weekdays than on weekends. We also expected weaker duet responsiveness (answering partner‐initiated song) on noisier weekdays than on weekends, assuming that noise would disrupt signal transmission between partners. We found that birds spent slightly more time (˜ 4%) in sentinel behaviour and less time (˜ 2–5%) foraging on weekdays than on weekends, but these effects were small and not statistically significant. Birds were equally likely to sing solos, start duets and answer partner‐initiated duets on weekends and weekdays. Finally, phrase duration and acoustic parameters of duets were similar on weekends and weekdays.

Due to the artificial control of the Dam, the riparian environments of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River are completely different, which may influence the AMF and DSE colonized in riparian plants. Thus, a survey for the presence of AMF and DSE associations in the roots of 66 riparian species was done in 5 distinct areas of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River. Obtained results indicated that 52 and 42 species were associated with AMF and DSE, respectively, and 33 species presented both associations. For 30 plant species surveyed, this is the first report on their mycorrhizal status. High colonization levels of AMF and DSE were generally found in those local prevalent species characterized by abundant rhizomes. On average, AMF colonization was higher from Yangtze River than from Jialing River but DSE colonization followed the opposite trend. However, no clear relationship between AMF and DSE fungal colonization was recognized among species which showed dual colonization of DSE and AMF. Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that available phosphorus was significantly positive correlated to hyphal colonization of AMF. Finally, we assumed the structure of plant communities of TGR might be strongly influenced by the presence of mycorrhiza.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic plants 3aendophytes 3ahyphae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3arhizomes 3arivers 3aroots 3asummer 3asurveys 3avegetation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aDark septate endophytes 0aArum-type 0aWater-level-fluctuation zone 0aThree Gorges Reservoir Region1 aYuan, Shenhong1 aSong, Hongchuan1 aSu, Xiaolei1 aMao, Hongqiang1 aShen, Weiyun1 aQu, Xiaoli1 aDong, Jinyan0 tAquatic botany.g2016 Aug., v. 133 p.28-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009100169300001600260520149500276592002801771650001201799650001701811650002401828650002301852650001101875650001201886650002801898650001301926650002201939650001401961653002001975653002701995653002302022653002402045653002802069700001602097700001802113700001502131773013802146856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60582510320221120140333.0180830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058251032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Huaxiang10aCharacterization of a major facilitator superfamily transporter in Shiraia bambusicola  ap. 664-672.  aReactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photo-activated hypocrellin from Shiraia bambusicola are detrimental to cellular macromolecules. However, S. bambusicola can still maintain excellent morphology during continuous hypocrellin production, indicating an extraordinary autoresistance system that protects against the harmful ROS. In this study, a major facilitator superfamily transporter (MFS) was isolated from S. bambusicola and deleted using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences (CRISPR)/Cas9 system. The ΔMFS mutant abolished hypocrellin production and was slightly sensitive to 40-μM hypocrellin, while the ΔMFS compliment strain restored hypocrellin production and resistance. Hypocrellin treatment also enhanced the relative expression of MFS in wild-type S. bambusicola. Subsequent pathogenicity assays showed that MFS deletion reduced damage to bamboo leaves. By contrast, restoration of hypocrellin production in the MFS compliment strain generated similar necrotic lesions on bamboo leaves to those observed with the wild-type strain. These results revealed that the identified MFS is involved in efflux of hypocrellin from cells, which reduces the hypocrellin toxicity. Furthermore, hypocrellin contributed to the virulence of S. bambusicola on bamboo leaves. These findings could help to reduce plant loss by disrupting hypocrellin biosynthesis in S. bambusicola, or overexpressing the associated resistance gene in transgenic plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3abiosynthesis 3agene overexpression 3agenetic resistance 3aleaves 3amutants 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants 3avirulence 0aMSF transporter 0aHypocrellin resistance 0aCRISPR/Cas9 system 0aShiraia bambusicola 0aReactive oxygen species1 aGao, Ruijie1 aLiao, Xiangru1 aCai, Yujie0 tResearch in microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 168, no. 7 p.664-672dElsevier Masson SASaInstitut PasteurwJournal:11932x0923-25087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013500173300001600308500001500324520137800339592002801717650001701745650001701762650002401779650001401803650002501817650001901842650001601861650002001877650001401897650001001911653001601921700001901937700002101956700002001977773010601997856005502103852000902158655001202167IND50059106020221118061417.0121011e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005910602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-1835.2012.00651.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawai, Hiroshi10aTaxonomic revision of the genus Cutleria proposing a new genus Mutimo to accommodate M. cylindricus (Cutleriaceae, Phaeophyceae)  ap. 241-248.  a2019-12-05  aMolecular phylogenetic analyses of representative Cutleria species using mitochondrial cox3, chloroplast psaA, psbA and rbcL gene sequences showed that C. cylindrica Okamura was not included in the clade composed of other Cutleria species including the generitype C. multifida (Turner) Greville and the related taxon Zanardinia typus (Nardo) P.C.

Cutleria spp. have heteromophic life histories and their gametophytes are rather diverse in gross morphology, from compressed or cylindrical‐branched to fan‐shaped, whereas the sporophytes are rather similar. In contrast, the monotypic species Z. typus has an isomorphic life history and resembles fan‐shaped Cutleria in morphology. Morphological comparisons of these taxa revealed that C. cylindrica is morphologically distinct from other Cutleria spp. and Z. typus in having cylindrical gametophytes with multiseriate trichothallic filaments instead of uniseriate filaments (hairs) characteristic of Cutleriales (or Cutleriaceae, Tilopteridales), and in lacking rhizoidal filaments in the crustose sporophytes.

However, a model to persuasively explain the preserved chromatin interactions during cell cycle remains lacking. In this paper, we developed two simple, lattice-based models that mimic polymer fiber decondensation from initial fractal or anisotropic condensed status, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. By simulating the dynamic decondensation process, we observed about 8.17% and 2.03% of the interactions preserved in the condensation to decondensation transition, in the fractal diffusion and anisotropic diffusion models, respectively. Intriguingly, although interaction hubs, as a physical locus where a certain number of monomers inter-connected, were observed in diffused polymer models in both simulations, they were not associated with the preserved interactions. Our simulation demonstrated that there might exist a small portion of chromatin interactions that preserved during the diffusion process of polymers, while the interacted hubs were more dynamically formed and additional regulatory factors were needed for their preservation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMarkov chain 3aanisotropy 3abiotechnology 3acell cycle 3achromatin 3aloci 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3apolymers 0aChromatin interaction 0aStructure 0aPolymer model 0aDiffusion 0aPreserve1 aZhang, Zhihua0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.3351-3358dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.057  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001200148245015400160300001600314520205800330592002802388650002102416650001602437650002302453650001002476650000902486650001802495650002202513650001602535650002302551650001002574650001802584700001502602700001402617773009202631856008402723852000902807655001202816IND4480434620221120122906.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448043462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, L.10aEffect of an herb extract mixture on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood characteristics, and fecal microbial shedding in weanling pigs  ap. 189-195.  aA 6-week experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of a dietary herb extracts mixture (HEM) on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood characteristics, and fecal microbial shedding in weanling pigs. A total of 144 pigs [(Landrace×Yorkshire)×Duroc] (BW=7.6±0.6kg; weaned at d 21) were randomly allocated to 4 treatments according to their BW and sex (9 replicates of 4 pigs per treatment). Treatments followed a 2×2 factorial design with 2 levels of HEM (0 or 250mgkg⁻¹ diet) and apramycin (0 or 30mgkg⁻¹ diet). During the first week, pigs fed HEM supplemented diets led to a lower (P<0.05) average daily feed intake (ADFI) but greater gain to feed ration (G:F) than those fed diets without HEM supplementation. Dietary HEM supplementation increased (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and G:F during 4 to 6 weeks. Antibiotics treatments showed greater (P<0.05) ADG and G:F than those in non-antibiotics treatments from 0 to 1 week, 4 to 6 weeks, and the overall period. A decreased ADFI was observed (P<0.05) when pigs were fed antibiotics supplement from 4 to 6 weeks. Pigs fed diets supplemented with HEM or antibiotic led to a higher (P<0.05) DM and N digestibility at d 7. Dietary antibiotic increased (P<0.05) N and energy digestibility at d 21. Antibiotic supplemented diets led to a higher (P<0.05) DM digestibility in pigs at d 42. The coefficient of apparent total tract digestibility (CATTD) of DM and N was increased (P<0.05) by HEM treatments at d 42 compared with non-HEM treatments. The blood lymphocyte concentration in HEM groups was greater (P<0.05) than the non-HEM treatments at d 42. Pigs fed HEM supplemented diets had decreased fecal Escherichia coli concentration (P<0.05) at the end of the current study. In conclusion, administration of HEM in weaning pigs diet had no effect on the growth performance during the whole experiment. However, the beneficial effect on nutrient digestibilities, lymphocyte and fecal E. coli concentration suggested that those kind of HEM have a positive role in weaning pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotics 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aswine 3aswine feeding1 aMeng, Q.W.1 aKim, I.H.0 tLivestock science.g2012 May, v. 145, no. 1-3 p.189-195dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011900166300001400285520134300299592002801642650002601670650002801696650002401724650002101748650001601769650002101785650001701806650001101823650001601834650001001850650001201860650002601872650001901898650001901917650002601936653002301962653000801985653001801993653001202011653002202023700001902045700001402064700001702078700001902095700001702114700001902131700002002150700002002170700002002190700001802210773008502228856008302313852000902396655001202405IND60083306920221120082823.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008330692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Si Jae10aMetabolic engineering of Ralstonia eutropha for the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxyacid-containing polyhydroxyalkanoates  ap. 20-28.  aPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are bio-based and biodegradable polyesters synthesized by numerous microorganisms. PHAs containing 2-hydroxyacids as monomer units have attracted much attention, but their production has not been efficient. Here, we metabolically engineered Ralstonia eutropha strains for the in vivo synthesis of PHAs containing 2-hydroxyacids as monomers. This was accomplished by replacing the R. eutropha phaC gene in the chromosome with either the R. eutropha phaC S506G A510K gene, which contains two point mutations, or the Pseudomonas sp. MBEL 6–19 phaC1437 gene. In addition, the R. eutropha phaAB genes in the chromosome were replaced with the Clostridium propionicum pct540 gene. All of the engineered R. eutropha strains produced PHAs containing 2-hydroxyacid monomers, including lactate and 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB), along with 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and/or 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV), when they were cultured in nitrogen-free medium containing 5g/L lactate or 4g/L 2HB and 20g/L glucose as carbon sources. Expression of the Escherichia coli ldhA gene in engineered R. eutropha strains allowed production of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-lactate) [P(3HB-co-LA)] from glucose as the sole carbon source. This is the first report on the production of 2-hydroxyacid-containing PHAs by metabolically engineered R. eutropha.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aClostridium propionicum 3aCupriavidus necator 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas 3abiodegradability 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3achromosomes 3agenes 3aglucose 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroorganisms 3apoint mutation 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 0aRalstonia eutropha 0aPHA 0a2-hydroxyacid 0aLactate 0a2-hydroxybutyrate1 aJang, Young-Ah1 aLee, Hyuk1 aPark, A-Reum1 aYang, Jung Eun1 aShin, Jihoon1 aOh, Young Hoon1 aSong, Bong Keun1 aJegal, Jonggeon1 aLee, Seung Hwan1 aLee, Sang Yup0 tMetabolic engineering.g2013 Nov., v. 20 p.20-28dElsevier Inc.x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2013.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245011900213300001400332520150500346592002801851650001901879650001201898650002601910650002301936650001601959650002001975650002001995650001002015650001202025650001102037650001502048650001902063653001402082653001302096653002402109653001502133653002102148653001502169653003202184653002102216700002102237700002102258773009702279856008602376852000902462655001202471IND60525797620221120210801.0190319e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPunsalan, April P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6834-855414aThe germination ecology of Helonias bullata L. (swamp pink) with respect to dry, saturated, and flooded conditions  ap. 17-23.  aPoor sexual recruitment is a major conservation concern for the rare obligate wetland plant Helonias bullata L. (swamp pink). Helonias predominately occurs in forested wetlands amongst hummock-hollow topography where water levels fluctuate spatially and temporally, creating a wide variety of moisture microsite conditions for germination. To determine how moisture conditions affect the germination response of Helonias seeds, germination percentages and rates were compared after seeds were exposed to dry, saturated (stream margin), and flooded (floating and submerged) conditions in a growth chamber and field for 1–35 days. Helonias final germination percentages were greater than 50% after exposure of all conditions, except dry conditions in the growth chamber. Moisture availability at the time of seed arrival was the main factor that influenced the germination of Helonias. Helonias seeds exposed to saturated and flooded conditions germinated within a short time frame (10-30days). Rapid germination may be important for Helonias plants in forested wetlands where variable moisture conditions can create a narrow window for regeneration. For both the growth chamber and field experiment, final germination percentages were significantly higher (p<0.05) for floating seeds compared to those kept dry. Water likely serves as an important dispersal mechanism for Helonias seeds since they exhibit high floating capability and germinability relative to the length of time spent in the water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic plants 3aecology 3afield experimentation 3aflooded conditions 3agermination 3agrowth chambers 3alowland forests 3aseeds 3astreams 3aswamps 3atopography 3awetland plants 0aDispersal 0aBuoyancy 0aGermination ecology 0aHydrochory 0aForested wetland 0aRare plant 0aSouthern appalachian region 0aHelonias bullata1 aCollins, Beverly1 aDeWald, Laura E.0 tAquatic botany.g2016 Aug., v. 133 p.17-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014100165300001800306506011700324506007600441520141400517592002801931506003701959650002001996650001802016650002602034650002002060650001102080650001302091650001502104650001302119650001402132650002202146650001702168653001602185653002402201653002102225653002702246653001102273700002102284700001302305700002002318700001702338700001902355773012802374856008302502852000902585655001202594IND60782214220221207094945.0220714s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078221422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xingxin10ai-Modern: Integrated multi-omics network model identifies potential therapeutic targets in glioma by deep learning with interpretability  ap. 3511-3521.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEffective and precise classification of glioma patients for their disease risks is critical to improving early diagnosis and patient survival. In the recent past, a significant amount of multi-omics data derived from cancer patients has emerged. However, a robust framework for integrating multi-omics data types to efficiently and precisely subgroup glioma patients and predict survival prognosis is still lacking. In addition, effective therapeutic targets for treating glioma patients with poor prognoses are in dire need. To begin to resolve this difficulty, we developed i-Modern, an integrated Multi-omics deep learning network method, and optimized a sophisticated computational model in gliomas that can accurately stratify patients based on their prognosis. We built a survival-associated predictive framework integrating transcription profile, miRNA expression, somatic mutations, copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation, and protein expression. This framework achieved promising performance in distinguishing high-risk glioma patients from those with good prognoses. Furthermore, we constructed multiple fully connected neural networks that are trained on prioritized multi-omics signatures or even only potential single-omics signatures, based on our customized scoring system. Together, the landmark multi-omics signatures we identified may serve as potential therapeutic targets in gliomas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3abiotechnology 3acopy number variation 3aearly diagnosis 3aglioma 3amicroRNA 3amultiomics 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprotein synthesis 3atherapeutics 0aMulti-omics 0aDeep learning model 0aData integration 0aPatient stratification 0aGlioma1 aBurgman, Brandon1 aWu, Erxi1 aHuang, Jason H.1 aSahni, Nidhi1 aStephen Yi, S.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.3511-3521dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008800157520181400245592002802059650001602087650001502103650002502118650001802143650001102161650001102172650001402183650002402197650002402221650002002245650002802265650001302293650001202306651001002318700001502328700001702343700001602360700001902376700001302395773012702408856007402535852000902609655001202618IND60652341520221118021720.0190712e20180706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065234152DNAL7 a10.3390/su100723572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xiaolan10aLocation Recommendation of Digital Signage Based on Multi-Source Information Fusion  aWith the increasing amount of digital signage and the complexity of digital signage services, the problem of introducing precise location recommendation methods for digital signage should be solved by digital signage enterprises. This research aims to provide a sustainable location recommendation model that integrates the spatial characteristics of geographic locations and multi-source feature data to recommend locations for digital signage. We used the outdoor commercial digital signage within the Sixth Ring Road area in Beijing as an example and combined it with economic census, population census, average house prices, social network check-in data, and the centrality of traffic networks that have an impact on the sustainable development of the regional economy as research data. The result shows that the proposed method has higher precision and recall in location recommendation, which indicates that this method has a better recommendation effect. It can further improve the recommendation quality and the deployment of digital signage. By this method, we can optimize resource allocation and make the economics and resources sustainable. The digital signage recommendation results of the Beijing City Sixth Ring Road indicated that the areas suitable for digital signage were primarily distributed in Wangfujing, Financial Street, Beijing West Railway Station, and tourist attractions in the northwest direction of the Fifth Ring Road. The research of this paper not only provides a reference for the integration of geographical features and their related elements data in a location recommendation algorithm but also effectively improves the science of digital signage layout, prompting advertising efforts to advance precision, personalization, low carbonization, and sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvertising 3aalgorithms 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbonization 3amodels 3aprices 3arailroads 3aresidential housing 3aresource allocation 3asocial networks 3asustainable development 3atourists 3atraffic 3aChina1 aZhang, Xun1 aFu, Jingying1 aJiang, Dong1 aYu, Chongchong1 aJin, Min0 tSustainability.g2018 July 06, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100723573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012500171300001600296520145700312592002801769650001801797650001901815650001901834650003501853650002301888650001801911650001501929650002001944650002801964650001701992650002002009650002402029650001202053653001602065653000902081653001202090653001802102653004002120653002802160700002002188700002402208700002202232700002502254700001702279700003302296700002002329773009702349856008602446852000902532655001202541IND60567127220221118022905.0170710e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056712722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenureau, Yann10aGuidelines for cloning, expression, purification and functional characterization of primary HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins  ap. 184-195.  aThe trimeric HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 mediate virus entry into target cells by engaging CD4 and the coreceptors CCR5 or CXCR4 at the cell surface and driving membrane fusion. Receptor/gp120 interactions regulate the virus life cycle, HIV infection transmission and pathogenesis. Env is also the target of neutralizing antibodies. Efforts have thus been made to produce soluble HIV-1 glycoproteins to develop vaccines and study the role and mechanisms of HIV/receptor interactions. However, production and purification of Env glycoproteins and their functional assessment has to cope with multiple obstacles. These include difficulties in amplifying and cloning env sequences and setting up receptor binding assays that are suitable for studies on large collections of glycoproteins, flexible enough to adapt to Env and receptor structural heterogeneities, and allow recapitulating the receptor binding properties of virion-associated Env trimers. Here we identify these difficulties and present protocols to produce primary gp120 and determination of their binding properties to receptors. The receptor binding assays confirmed that the produced glycoproteins are competent for binding CD4 and undergo proper CD4-induced conformational changes required for interaction with CCR5. These assays may help elucidate the role of gp120/receptor interactions in the pathophysiology of HIV infection and develop HIV-1 entry inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCCR5 receptor 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3abinding properties 3aglycoproteins 3aguidelines 3amembrane fusion 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3avaccine development 3aviruses 0aHIV-1 gp120 0aAIDS 0aCloning 0aGene toxicity 0aProtein expression and purification 0aReceptor binding assays1 aColin, Philippe1 aStaropoli, Isabelle1 aGonzález, Nuria,1 aGarcia-Perez, Javier1 aAlcami, Jose1 aArenzana-Seisdedos, Fernando1 aLagane, Bernard0 tJournal of virological methods.g2016 Oct., v. 236 p.184-195dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011900176300001400295520163500309592002801944650001701972650002601989650001502015650001102030650001102041650003102052650001302083650002502096650002302121650001602144650001902160650001002179650001402189651001102203653001902214653002002233653001502253653001502268653001802283653003302301653002102334700002502355700002402380700002502404773009702429856008602526852000902612655001202621IND60525797720221120210753.0190319e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052579772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, Márcio J.10aAnatomical development of roots of native and non-native submerged aquatic macrophytes in different sediment types  ap. 24-27.  aIn this study, we evaluated the effects of organic matter in sediment on the aerenchyma development of the roots of Egeria najas (native to Brazil) and the exotic species Hydrilla verticillata. The questions of this study were: (i) can the structural development of roots be influenced by the substrate with different content in organic matter and (ii) do the quantity and perimeter of the cortex intercellular spaces of the roots increase with increases in sediment organic matter? To answer these questions, we conducted an experiment in a greenhouse. We manipulated E. najas and H. verticillata growing in sediment with different proportions of organic matter. The root cortex of E. najas had significantly greater numbers and perimeters of intercellular spaces compared with the exotic species. The interaction between species and sediment was significant for both response variables, which increased faster in E. najas than in H. verticillata with enhancing sediment organic matter. The superior plasticity of E. najas’ roots might be explained by its adaptation to this specific type of sediment in situ for a longer period of time given its native status. On the other hand, the low capacity to increase intercellular spaces in H. verticillata’s roots in organic sediment might be related to the species’ recent introduction to the area and be the main factor that inhibits its expansion into habitats with sediments containing high levels of organic matter. Our results suggest that the species-specific plasticity of roots in these Hydrocharitaceae may help explaining their distribution in the Upper Paraná basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEgeria najas 3aHydrilla verticillata 3aaerenchyma 3abasins 3acortex 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahabitats 3aintercellular spaces 3aintroduced species 3amacrophytes 3aorganic matter 3aroots 3asediments 3aBrazil 0aAquatic plants 0aSediment anoxia 0aAerenchyma 0aPlasticity 0aRoot porosity 0aInduced morphological change 0aInvasive species1 aHarthman, Vanessa C.1 aMichelan, Thaisa S.1 aSouza, Luiz Antônio0 tAquatic botany.g2016 Aug., v. 133 p.24-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2016.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013400167300001800301506011700319506007600436520192200512592002802434506003702462650002202499650002102521650002502542650001802567650002002585650001402605650002102619650001302640650002002653650005002673650002802723650002002751653002202771653001402793653001502807653002102822653002102843653000902864653002702873653002702900700002102927700001902948700002002967700001702987773012803004856008303132852000903215655001203224IND60782214420221207094950.0220714s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078221442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamboj, Sakshi10aTargeting non-structural proteins of Hepatitis C virus for predicting repurposed drugs using QSAR and machine learning approaches  ap. 3422-3438.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes viral hepatitis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the clinical use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) still there is treatment failure in 5–10% cases. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new antivirals against HCV. In this endeavor, we developed the “Anti-HCV” platform using machine learning and quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) approaches to predict repurposed drugs targeting HCV non-structural (NS) proteins. We retrieved experimentally validated small molecules from the ChEMBL database with bioactivity (IC₅₀/EC₅₀) against HCV NS3 (454), NS3/4A (495), NS5A (494) and NS5B (1671) proteins. These unique compounds were divided into training/testing and independent validation datasets. Relevant molecular descriptors and fingerprints were selected using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Different machine learning techniques viz. support vector machine, k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural network, and random forest were used to develop the predictive models. We achieved Pearson’s correlation coefficients from 0.80 to 0.92 during 10-fold cross validation and similar performance on independent datasets using the best developed models. The robustness and reliability of developed predictive models were also supported by applicability domain, chemical diversity and decoy datasets analyses. The “Anti-HCV” predictive models were used to identify potential repurposing drugs. Representative candidates were further validated by molecular docking which displayed high binding affinities. Hence, this study identified promising repurposed drugs viz. naftifine, butalbital (NS3), vinorelbine, epicriptine (NS3/4A), pipecuronium, trimethaphan (NS5A), olodaterol and vemurafenib (NS5B) etc. targeting HCV NS proteins. These potential repurposed drugs may prove useful in antiviral drug development against HCV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis C virus 3aantiviral agents 3abioactive properties 3abiotechnology 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adrug development 3ahepatoma 3aneural networks 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3asupport vector machines 3aviral hepatitis 0aHepatitis C Virus 0aAntiviral 0aPrediction 0aDrug repurposing 0aMachine learning 0aQSAR 0aNon-structural protein 0aNS3-NS3/NS4A-NS5A-NS5B1 aRajput, Akanksha1 aRastogi, Amber1 aThakur, Anamika1 aKumar, Manoj0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.3422-3438dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.06.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245014900206300001800355500002000373520216200393592002802555650001802583650002202601650002202623650002902645650001702674650003002691650002302721650001502744650001502759650002402774650001302798650002302811650000902834650001502843651001302858700002002871700002902891700002702920700002302947700002202970700002402992700002403016700002403040773010903064856007303173852000903246655001203255IND60750793620221116195112.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075079362DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Maxwell da R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0053-117310aLack of protected areas and future habitat loss threaten the Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) and its main food and nesting resources  ap. 1217-1234.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHabitat loss is a major reason for population declines and thus increases extinction risk, particularly for endemic or specialist species. Protected areas are an important biodiversity conservation strategy in the face of native vegetation conversion, but local and regional factors such as anthropogenic pressure can jeopardize their effectiveness. The Pantanal biome is one of the largest inland wetlands in the world. Currently, only 11% of the Pantanal is protected, 7% with full protection and 4% under sustainable use. However, 14% of the natural vegetation of the biome was lost between 2002 and 2014, negatively affecting its biodiversity. Here, we analyse how the availability of protected areas and habitat loss affects the conservation of the Hyacinth Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus, as well as the Acuri Palm Attalea phalerata and the Manduvi Tree Sterculia apetala, its two main resources for food and nesting, respectively. We modelled potential distributions to assess the spatio‐temporal patterns of habitat loss due to the conversion of native vegetation and to evaluate to what degree currently protected areas contribute to the conservation of these three species in the Pantanal. We found that, on average, 11.8% of the suitable habitat had been converted and that 10.6% of habitat predicted as suitable is currently protected. In addition, our results indicated important areas for the three species, which are of high priority for conservation and restoration. We also identified priorities for protection and restoration to maintain native vegetation, such as the creation of corridors. We believe that the high conversion rate and the low protection of suitable areas are related to the fact that these species are associated with areas that are rarely or never flooded. In the Pantanal, these areas are more prone to the conversion of native vegetation and are poorly protected given their higher economic value compared with areas with a high frequency of flooding. These facts, and the inadequate management of these areas, such as inappropriate fire regimens, threaten the persistence of these iconic species in the Pantanal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnodorhynchus 3aAttalea phalerata 3aSterculia apetala 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3arisk 3avegetation 3aPantanal1 aSzabo, Judit K.1 aJúnior, Antônio dos S.1 aGuedes, Neiva Maria R.1 aTomas, Walfrido M.1 aCamilo, André R.1 aPadovane, Carlos R.1 aPeterson, Andrew T.1 aGarcia, Letícia C.0 tIbis.g2021 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.1217-1234dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011000166300001400276520127400290592002801564650001401592650002401606650001001630650000901640650003401649650002101683650004301704650002601747653001401773653002601787653004501813653002001858700001401878700001701892700001601909700001401925700002101939700002001960700001801980700001401998773009502012856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60567127420221118022814.0170710e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056712742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Kui10aDevelopment of a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for the rapid diagnosis of Orf virus infections  ap. 10-17.  aA rapid and simple lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) was developed for the specific detection of Orf virus (ORFV) using two distinct monoclonal antibodies (MAbs: 5A5 and 6F2) against the ORFV ORF011 protein. The MAb 5A5 was conjugated with colloidal gold, and the MAb 6F2 and goat anti-mouse IgG were sprayed onto a nitrocellulose membrane in strips at positions designated test (T) and control (C), respectively. The results showed that samples of ORFV complexed with colloidal gold-conjugated MAb 5A5, were captured by MAb 6F2 at the T line resulting in the appearance of a purple band. When samples did not contain ORFV or when they contained a quantity of ORFV below the detection limit of the test, only the C line was visible. The analysis of sensitivity of the test demonstrated that the lowest detected quantity of ORFV was 2.03×103.0 TCID50/ml. Storage at room temperature for 6 months did not result in the loss of performance of the LFIA test. Using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a reference test, the relative specificity and sensitivity of the LFIA test were determined to be 100% and 92.1%, respectively. Based on these results, the LFIA test developed may be a suitable tool for rapid on-site testing for ORFV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrf virus 3aambient temperature 3agoats 3agold 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amonoclonal antibodies 0aOrf virus 0aMonoclonal antibodies 0aLateral flow immunochromatographic assay 0aRapid detection1 aHe, Wenqi1 aBi, Jingying1 aZhang, Ximu1 aZhang, Di1 aHuang, Houshuang1 aZhang, Yuexiang1 aSong, Deguang1 aGao, Feng0 tJournal of virological methods.g2016 Oct., v. 236 p.10-17dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2016.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012900164300001300293500001500306520216200321592002802483650001302511650001302524650001202537650002602549650002102575650000902596650002402605650001502629650000902644650002002653650002402673653002502697653002502722653001902747653001002766653002802776700001602804773012402820856008202944852000903026655001203035IND60478478920221120212250.0160121e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047847892DNAL7 a10.1556/AAgr.54.2006.1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerzsenyi, Z.10aUse of various functions to analyse the fertiliser responses of maize ( <i>Zea mays</i> L.) hybrids in long-term experiments  ap. 1-14.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of various fertiliser treatments on the yield of maize hybrids was studied on the basis of 26 years of data obtained in a long-term bifactorial split-plot experiment set up in 1967. The seven treatments (NPK ratio 2:1:1) applied were as follows (rates per hectare): 1. Control (no fertiliser), 2. 100 kg NPK, 3. 200 kg NPK, 4. 300 kg NPK, 5. 400 kg NPK, 6. 600 kg NPK, 7. 800 kg NPK. The maize was grown with the conventional cultivation techniques in continuous cropping. The results of analyses carried out with three different methods (analysis of variance, cumulative yield analysis and regression analysis) all indicated that under the given conditions the yield of maize hybrids was highest at an NPK fertiliser rate of 200-400 kg ha <sup>-1</sup> . The effect of fertilisation on the maize yield was significant in 21 of the 26 years. Combined analysis of variance for the years showed that the year effect (quantity of rainfall) had the greatest effect on the maize yield, but although the year effect had a fundamental effect on the yield level it did not influence the fertiliser response pattern. The fertiliser responses of the maize hybrids were described by fitting four types of functions (quadratic, square root, inverse exponential, linear-plateau) to the yield data. It was found that when selecting the best function a consideration of the regression deviations (measured yield - calculated yield) was just as important as the coefficient of determination (R <sup>2</sup>). In 12 of the 26 years the fitting of the quadratic function was not significant and overestimated the fertilisation optimum. The fertiliser response curve generally has a broad maximum which is far better described by the square root function than by the quadratic. If the fertiliser response pattern includes a depressive phase, a square root function should definitely be used in place of the quadratic function. If the maximum of the response surface forms a plateau (as opposed to a maximum point) a linear-plateau function or an inverse exponential function can be recommended. In the present work the linear-plateau function gave the best results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplateaus 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3along term experiments 3afertilizer rates 3acorn 3aregression analysis 3acrop yield 3arain 3aNPK fertilizers 3acontinuous cropping 0along-term experiment 0aanalysis of variance 0aresponse model 0amaize 0aoptimal fertiliser rate1 aDang, Q.

Syngas was fed into the MR shell side where a commercial MeS catalyst was used, while the tube side was swept with a high boiling point liquid with good solubility toward methanol. A mesoporous alumina ceramic membrane was utilized after its surface had been modified to be rendered more hydrophobic. The efficiency of the MR was investigated under a variety of experimental conditions (different pressures, temperatures, sweep liquid flow rates, and types of sweep liquids). The results reveal improved per single-pass carbon conversions when compared to the conventional packed-bed reactor. An ionic liquid (IL), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, was utilized in the MR as the sweep liquid. The experimental results are compared to those previously reported by our group (Li, Z.; Tsotsis, T. T. J. Membrane Sci.2019, 570, 103) while using a conventional petroleum-derived solvent as sweep liquid, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TGDE). Enhanced carbon conversion (over the petroleum-derived solvent) was obtained using the IL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aboiling point 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aceramics 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amethanol 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3asolubility 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature1 aHu, Sheng1 aLi, Zhongtang1 aTsotsis, Theodore T.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 June 03, v. 58, no. 27 p.11811-11820dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b011783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01943naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011700167300001600284520061500300536020000915592002801115596001301143596001601156650001801172650001301190650001201203650002001215650001601235651001001251653001601261653001301277653001401290653000901304653002501313773012401338856008601462852000901548655001201557IND60751341620221118204604.0220107e20210418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075134162DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2021.19257682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Zi-Wei10aTwo new species and additional records of Pseudopsis Newman from China (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Pseudopsinae)  ap. 933-951.  aTwo new Chinese species of the rare staphylinid subfamily Pseudopsinae, Pseudopsis pengi sp. nov. from Shanxi and Pseudopsis serrata sp. nov. from Yunnan, are described primarily based on the diagnostic structures of their aedeagi.

It is introduced to model a computation which is exposed to an environment. We formalized the computation as extension and projection processes of its state space and resulting misidentifications of the state. This is motivated to embed the role of an environment into the system itself, which naturally induces self-organized internal perturbations rather than the usual external perturbations. Implementing this structure into the elementary cellular automata, we characterized its effect by means of input entropy and power spectral analysis. As a result, the cellular automata with this structure showed robust class IV behavior and a 1/f power spectrum in a wide range of rule space comparative to the notion of the edge of chaos.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adata analysis 3aentropy1 aHaruna, Taichi0 tBioSystems.g2011 Sept., v. 105, no. 3 p.216-224dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245012000161520137700281592002801658650002101686650002001707650001201727650000901739650001801748650001601766650001401782650002001796650001701816650002201833650001201855650001201867650001601879651001601895700001701911700002001928700001701948700001901965700001901984773011802003856007702121852000902198655001202207IND60771337220221116140922.0220325e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077133722DNAL7 a10.3390/land110303292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaek, Kigwang 10aImpact on Soil Physical Properties Related to a High Mechanization Level in the Row Thinning of a Korean Pine Stand  aIn ground-based harvesting, machine traffic can cause soil physical disturbances including excessive compaction, the displacement of the soil surface and topsoil, and rutting. These impacts can indirectly hamper seedling survival and tree growth because of reduced soil permeability and root growth. However, the extent of soil disturbance in mechanized row thinning by harvester and forwarder systems in South Korea is unclear. Therefore, our objectives were to determine the impacts of two types of harvesters, soil textures, and extraction methods on soil compaction and rutting in a Korean Pine stand. The results showed that the machine passes affected soil disturbances. The soil bulk density inside the tracks (at 0–10 and 10–20 cm soil depths) after harvester passes (wheeled vs. tracked) increased by 17 and 27% and 30 and 20%, respectively. The largest impact was recorded for the forwarding track and significant differences were observed between the track and reference locations. Furthermore, the rutting depth in the forwarding trails was significantly higher than in the harvester trails. Thus, the application of a brush mat on harvester and forwarder trails may reduce machine-induced soil compaction. These results provide useful information to help forest engineers and field managers design environmentally sound ground-based harvesting operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus koraiensis 3adisturbed soils 3aforests 3aland 3amechanization 3aroot growth 3aseedlings 3asoil compaction 3asoil density 3asoil permeability 3atopsoil 3atraffic 3atree growth 3aSouth Korea1 aLee, Eunjai 1 aChoi, Hyungtae 1 aCho, Minjae 1 aChoi, Yunsung 1 aHan, Sangkyun 0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110303293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169300001400281500001500295520175700310592002802067650002402095650002002119650001602139650002802155650001402183650001902197650001102216650001702227650001702244650002402261650001602285650001102301650001902312650001402331650002702345653002702372653002902399653000902428653001102437653001702448653001202465700002102477700001702498700002002515773008702535856008402622852000902706655001202715IND60097633220221118223003.0160901e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009763322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2013.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Chris10aRelation between perfluorooctanoic acid exposure and strokes in a large cohort living near a chemical plant  ap. 22-28.  a2019-12-06  aA community around a chemical plant was exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for over 50 years, primarily through drinking water. One cohort study of PFOA-exposed workers found a positive trend with stroke mortality. Other, cross-sectional, studies have found positive associations between serum PFOA and risk factors for stroke, including cholesterol, uric acid, and hypertension.We examined the relation between PFOA exposure and incident strokes (including transient ischemic attacks) in community members, including plant workers.Participants completed surveys in 2008–2011 regarding medical history, health-related behaviors, and demographics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the hazard of stroke in relation to time-varying estimated cumulative PFOA serum levels, adjusting for confounders.Of 32,254 survey participants with exposure estimates, 1596 self-reported stroke, of whom 919 had their self-report validated by medical records review. After excluding subjects with strokes before age 20 and subjects born before 1920 or with missing covariate data, 825 cases remained. Compared with the lowest quintile of cumulative exposure, subsequent quintiles in the retrospective analysis had hazard ratios of 1.39 [95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.76], 1.36 [1.08–1.71], 1.45 [1.15–1.82], and 1.13 [0.90–1.44]. Tests for trend with linear or log-transformed cumulative dose were not significant (p=0.52 and 0.59, respectively). Neither an analysis with a 5-year lag, nor prospective analyses restricted to 2005–2011 (302 cases) found positive trends (p=0.44, positive trend; p=0.28, negative trend, respectively).Overall, our data provide only modest evidence of an association between PFOA and stroke incidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acumulative exposure 3amedical history 3ablood serum 3ahazard characterization 3auric acid 3acohort studies 3amodels 3ahypertension 3arisk factors 3aconfidence interval 3acholesterol 3astroke 3adrinking water 3amortality 3ademographic statistics 0aPerfluorooctanoic acid 0aCerebrovascular accident 0aPFOA 0aStroke 0aCohort study 0asurveys1 aWinquist, Andrea1 aLally, Cathy1 aSteenland, Kyle0 tEnvironmental Research.g2013 Nov., v. 127 p.22-28dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014100165520133300306592002801639650001201667650002501679650001601704650001101720650002201731650000901753650002101762650001001783653003201793653004201825653003501867653002701902653002401929700001601953700001501969700001301984700005301997700001402050773009002064856008502154852000902239655001202248IND60755853320221119194918.0220110e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Heng10aThermodynamic analysis and economic assessment of an improved geothermal power system integrated with a biomass-fired cogeneration plant  aA novel geothermal power system integrated with a biomass-fired cogeneration plant has been developed, which feeds the obtained geothermal energy into the steam cycle of the biomass plant. Under the cogeneration scenario, the geothermal water provides heat to the supply-water for district heating together with the extraction steam of the turbine, while in the power generation scenario, the geothermal water is employed to warm the feedwater of the biomass plant. Consequently, much extraction steam of the turbine can be saved to produce additional electricity that can be regarded as geothermal energy-based electricity. Based on a 35 MW biomass cogeneration plant, the thermodynamic and economic performance of the proposed system was evaluated, and the effects of the main parameters were investigated as well. The results indicated that the geothermal power generation efficiency can reach 25.47% or 5.62% under the cogeneration mode or power generation mode. In a whole year, 16935.48 MWh electricity can be yielded from geothermal energy with an annual geothermal power generation efficiency of 17.08%. The levelized cost of geothermal energy-based electricity is only 0.0329 $/kWh when adopting the new design. Generally, the novel concept is quite advantageous from both the thermodynamic and economic perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aeconomic performance 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3ageothermal energy 3aheat 3apower generation 3asteam 0aGeothermal power generation 0aBiomass-fired combined heat and power 0aHybrid renewable energy system 0aPerformance evaluation 0aParametric analysis1 aWang, Yihan1 aLi, Jiarui1 aXu, Gang1 aLei, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3976-28171 aLiu, Tong0 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 240 p.122477-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010300169520143700272592002801709650001801737650001401755650002101769650001001790650002301800650000901823650005201832650001201884700002601896700001501922700001901937773012801956856008702084852000902171655001202180IND60768435420221120124718.0220225e20220212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843542DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100204282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Nigel 10aReal-Time PCR-Based Methods for Detection of Hepatitis E Virus in Pork Products: A Critical Review  aStandard methods for detection of hepatitis A virus and norovirus in at-risk foodstuffs are available, but currently there is no standard method for detection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in pork products or other foods that can be contaminated with the virus. Detection assays for HEV are mainly based on nucleic acid amplification, particularly the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) in real-time format. RTPCR-based methods can be sensitive and specific, but they require a suite of controls to verify that they have performed correctly. There have been several RTPCR methods developed to detect HEV in pork products, varying in details of sample preparation and RTPCR target sequences. This review critically discusses published HEV detection methods, with emphasis on those that have been successfully used in subsequent studies and surveys. RTPCR assays have been used both qualitatively and quantitatively, although in the latter case the data acquired are only reliable if appropriate assay calibration has been performed. One particular RTPCR assay appears to be ideal for incorporation in a standard method, as it has been demonstrated to be highly specific and sensitive, and an appropriate control and calibration standard is available. The review focuses on the detection of HEV in pork products and similar foodstuffs (e.g., boar). The information may be useful to inform standardisation activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatovirus A 3aNorovirus 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aboars 3agene amplification 3apork 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses1 aD’Agostino, Martin 1 aWood, Ann 1 aScobie, Linda 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 12, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100204283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100005900143245014100202300001600343520131700359592002801676650003101704650001501735650002401750650001001774650002701784650001401811650001301825650002501838650000901863653001601872653000901888653002101897653001101918653001401929653002301943700002201966700002501988700005702013700001902070700006102089700002402150773013302174856007802307852000902385655001202394IND60786602320221120175106.0220804e20220405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660232DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2021-02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinger, John W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0661-782110aChanges in antioxidant enzyme levels following capture in juvenile American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are tissue dependent  ap. 428-435.  aMany parameters used to investigate stress in vertebrates are temporally sensitive. The act of capture and sampling can influence them, hindering their functionality for evaluating the effects of stressors. Consequently, the investigation and subsequent incorporation of less time-sensitive parameters are necessary to better evaluate stressors affecting vertebrates. In this study, we investigated how capture stress and handling associated with sampling influence antioxidant status in American Alligators (Alligator mississippiensis (Daudin, 1802); hereinafter Alligator), long-lived, top-trophic carnivores found in the southeastern United States, by measuring levels of two antioxidant enzymes in destructive (brain and pancreas) and nondestructive (tail scutes) tissues: superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1). Capture stress had no effect on pancreatic SOD1 and no effect on brain and pancreatic GPX1 (all p > 0.05). However, brain SOD1, scute SOD1, and scute GPX1 were all impacted by capture stress. These disparate results illustrate that the influence of capture stress on antioxidant enzymes in Alligators is tissue and marker dependent, necessitating further investigation. Our results provide a firm foundation to further investigate oxidative status in crocodilians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlligator mississippiensis 3aalligators 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abrain 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ajuveniles 3apancreas 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atail 0aCrocodilian 0atime 0aoxidative status 0ahealth 0acondition 0aAmerican Alligator1 aKelley, Meghan D.1 aHamilton, Matthew T.1 aZhang, Yufeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7850-559X1 aElsey, Ruth M.1 aMendonca, Mary T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0916-90241 aKavazis, Andreas N.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2022 Apr. 05, v. 100, no. 7 p.428-435dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2021-02313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001300292520124500305592002801550650001901578650001201597650001701609650002101626650002301647650001001670650001501680650001201695653002101707653001801728653002301746653001201769700001901781700002001800773010801820856008201928852000902010655001202019IND60086586020221119031538.0190401e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008658602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSand, Salomon14aThe use of chemical occurrence data at European vs. national level in dietary exposure assessments: A methodological study  ap. 7-15.  aA typical EFSA approach to assess dietary exposure is to combine data from national consumption surveys with chemical occurrence data that have been pooled across the EU Member States (pooled approach). This approach was compared to the case where occurrence data were stratified by country and used for food categories where national data were abundant (semi-pooled approach), using cadmium as a case study. Some differences in estimated dietary exposure were observed between the pooled and semi-pooled approach. They were explained by differences, between the national and the European occurrence data, with respect to (1) contamination values and (2) sample proportions of food items classified in the food categories the assessment was based on. The latter aspect highlighted the sensitivity of the approach of directly aggregating monitoring data into food categories. Both the pooled and semi-pooled approach tended to be conservative relative to approaches used at national level. This appears to be attributed to differences in the way the available occurrence data is aggregated. Refinement of the studied methodologies would include a better separation of the food items with high concentration from those with low concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acadmium 3acase studies 3adietary exposure 3afood contamination 3afoods 3amonitoring 3asurveys 0aDietary exposure 0aContamination 0aConsumption survey 0aCadmium1 aHéraud, Fanny1 aArcella, Davide0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Dec., v. 62 p.7-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006700142245007300209300001800282500002000300520160500320592002801925596007001953650000802023650001502031650001002046650001502056650001502071650001302086650001502099650001602114650001502130700002902145773013102174856007702305852000902382655001202391IND60789723320221120164702.0220822e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078972332DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0146302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnguelova, Magdalena D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5548-083610aWhitecap Fraction From Satellite Measurements: Algorithm Description  ap. 1827-1857.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany air‐sea interaction processes are quantified in terms of whitecap fraction W because whitecaps are the most visible and direct way of observing breaking waves with air entrainment in the open ocean. Photographs or video images of the sea state collected from towers, ships, and aircrafts have been used over the years to obtain W. Satellite remote sensing of W is a recent development that allows long‐term, consistent observations of whitecapping on a global scale. The method for estimating W uses the variations of ocean surface emissivity at microwave frequencies (6 to 37 GHz) due to presence of sea foam on a rough sea surface. Satellite‐borne microwave radiometers detect these variations at the ocean surface as changes of the brightness temperature TB at the top of the atmosphere. We present the physical and parameterized models, as well as the input data, necessary to calculate W from WindSat TB observations with our W (TB) algorithm. We describe the implementation versions through which the W (TB) algorithm has developed. We show that satellite‐based W data vary with the frequency and polarization of the TB observations. The wind speed dependence of the W retrievals at horizontal and vertical polarizations shows different behavior and compares differently with in situ W data and existing wind speed parameterizations W(U₁₀). We discuss the applicability of our methodology to other radiometric data. We indicate possible modifications and tuning of the models in the W (TB) algorithm that can help to further improve the accuracy of the satellite W retrievals.  aPublisher supplied data  a61153NcDOD | United States Navy | Office of Naval Research (ONR) 3aair 3aalgorithms 3afoams 3ageophysics 3aradiometry 3aresearch 3asatellites 3atemperature 3awind speed1 aBettenhausen, Michael H.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.1827-1857dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0146303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245021900167300001200386500001900398520224200417592002802659596006802687650001902755650001202774650002002786650001602806650001402822650001502836650002802851650001502879650002402894650001402918650001202932651002102944651001002965700002702975773013503002856008303137852000903220655001203229IND60696459620221120213150.0200608e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645962DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-09000-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Praveen10aNew empirical relationship between resonance frequency and thickness of sediment using ambient noise measurements and joint-fit-inversion of the Rayleigh wave dispersion curve for Kangra Valley (NW Himalaya), India  ap. 256.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNorthwest Himalaya is one of the seismically active regions that had experienced a number of major and moderate earthquakes in the past. The 4th April 1905 Kangra earthquake (Ms 7.8) is one amongst those which had caused a devastating effect to the built environment, as a consequence of amplification factor due to varied impedance contrast between the overlying alluvial soil and underlying bedrock. Preventive actions aimed at minimizing the economic losses caused by such events require estimation of dynamic characteristics of the surface soil and its behaviour under strong motion excitation. Under this initiative, the Kangra Valley, which falls in seismic zone IV and V, was extensively studied to elucidate the effects of earthquake excitation on the built environment due to the soil amplification. The Kangra Valley is characterized by the presence of hills and valleys, thus has a very high variation in the sediment thickness above bedrock which is an important parameter for seismic hazard assessment. This study aims to establish a new empirical relationship from the experimental data for estimating sediment thicknesses of the Kangra Valley. Under this initiative the resonance frequency has been calculated from ambient noise measurement from 200 sites of the Kangra Valley. This extensive survey allowed the estimation of resonance frequencies (4–20 Hz) in the region and identified the areas prone to site amplification. Furthermore, joint-fit-inversion modelling of horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) and dispersion curves obtained from ambient noise measurement and multichannel simulation with one receiver (MSOR) data acquisition, respectively, led to 1-D shear wave velocity (Vs) profile. New empirical relationships were established for Kangra Valley to estimate the thickness of overburden using non-linear regression analysis between resonance frequency (f₀) obtained by HVSR technique and pseudo-depth (H) from the study area. The equation provides an effective tool to detect sediment thicknesses in the area with similar geological setup. The methods described in the study apply a new approach to derive new empirical relationship in hilly terrain and the area with sparse borehole record.  aPublisher supplied data  aMoES/P.O.(Seismo)/1(206)/2013cMinistry of Earth Science, India 3aalluvial soils 3abedrock 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3aequations 3ageophysics 3ahazard characterization 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asediments 3asurveys 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aMahajan, Ambrish Kumar0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 June, v. 79, no. 11 p.256-256dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09000-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245014800169300001800317520144900335592002801784650002401812650001301836650000901849650002101858650001201879700002001891700001801911700001901929700001701948773014701965856007802112852000902190655001202199IND60541839420221116150047.0160823e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054183942DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b118492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzhagurajan, Mukkannan10aIn Situ Visualization of Lithium Ion Intercalation into MoS2 Single Crystals using Differential Optical Microscopy with Atomic Layer Resolution  ap. 3355-3361.  aAtomic-level visualization of the intercalation of layered materials, such as metal chalcogenides, is of paramount importance in the development of high-performance batteries. In situ images of the dynamic intercalation of Li ions into MoS₂ single-crystal electrodes were acquired for the first time, under potential control, with the use of a technique combining laser confocal microscopy with differential interference microscopy. Intercalation proceeded via a distinct phase separation of lithiated and delithiated regions. The process started at the atomic steps of the first layer beneath the selvedge and progressed in a layer-by-layer fashion. The intercalated regions consisted of Li-ion channels into which the newly inserted Li ions were pushed atom-by-atom. Interlayer diffusion of Li ions was not observed. Deintercalation was also clearly imaged and was found to transpire in a layer-by-layer mode. The intercalation and deintercalation processes were chemically reversible and can be repeated many times within a few atomic layers. Extensive intercalation of Li ions disrupted the atomically flat surface of MoS₂ because of the formation of small lithiated domains that peeled off from the surface of the crystal. The current–potential curves of the intercalation and deintercalation processes were independent of the scan rate, thereby suggesting that the rate-determining step was not governed by Butler–Volmer kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal microscopy 3acrystals 3aions 3alight microscopy 3alithium1 aKajita, Tetsuya1 aItoh, Takashi1 aKim, Youn-Geun1 aItaya, Kingo0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Mar. 16, v. 138, no. 10 p.3355-3361dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b118493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011800204300001800322520124600340592002801586650002201614650002101636650001301657650003501670650002301705650002001728650002101748650003101769650001001800650000901810650001601819650001301835650002901848650002201877650001301899653001101912653003201923653001601955700001201971700002101983700001702004700001302021700001702034700001802051773014702069856008002216961001302296852000902309655001202318IND60684912020221118052039.0200226e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b075412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Tiantian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7379-328910aCysteine Protease Inhibitors Reduce Enzymatic Browning of Potato by Lowering the Accumulation of Free Amino Acids  ap. 2467-2476.  aEnzymatic browning is a major issue affecting the quality of processed potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). To understand the molecular mechanism of browning, transcriptional analyses were performed by employing potatoes that differed in browning. Coexpression analysis indicated that 9 out of 15 upregulated genes in browning-less groups encoded for potato protease inhibitors (StPIs). In addition, gene otology analysis showed that the enriched terms were mainly involved in protease inhibitors. Overexpression of cysteine StPI 143 and StPI 146 individually reduced browning and lowered protease activities and tyrosine and total free amino acid (FAA) contents, but they could not decrease polyphenol oxidase activity. Moreover, supplementing exogenous tyrosine or total FAAs into transgenic potato mash to wild-type amounts promoted mash browning, browning with total FAAs, more than with tyrosine, resembling wild-type levels. These results implied that cysteine StPIs reduced browning via lowering the accumulation of FAAs in addition to tyrosine. Our findings have enriched the knowledge about the roles and mechanisms of protease inhibitors in regulating enzymatic browning of potato, which provide new ways for controlling potato browning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acatechol oxidase 3acysteine 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3afree amino acids 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amash 3apolyphenols 3apotatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 3atyrosine 0apotato 0acysteine protease inhibitor 0apostharvest1 aCao, Yu1 aJiang, Cai-Zhong1 aLi, Guangcun1 aLiu, Pei1 aLiu, Shiyang1 aWang, Qingguo0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 68, no. 8 p.2467-2476dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b075413Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010200168300001400270520196400284592002802248650001302276650001102289650001002300650001402310650000902324650001802333650002102351650000802372650001602380650002402396650001302420650001002433650001002443651001102453653001802464653000902482653001002491653000902501653000902510700001302519700002202532700002302554700001802577700001702595700001602612700001602628700001802644700001502662700002002677773008702697856008402784852000902868655001202877IND60097633320221118223001.0160901e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009763332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2013.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeltzer, H.M.10aConsumption of lead-shot cervid meat and blood lead concentrations in a group of adult Norwegians  ap. 29-39.  aSeveral recent investigations have reported high concentrations of lead in samples of minced cervid meat. This paper describes findings from a Norwegian study performed in 2012 among 147 adults with a wide range of cervid game consumption. The main aim was to assess whether high consumption of lead-shot cervid meat is associated with increased concentration of lead in blood. A second aim was to investigate to what extent factors apart from game consumption explain observed variability in blood lead levels.Median (5 and 95 percentile) blood concentration of lead was 16.6µg/L (7.5 and 39µg/L). An optimal multivariate linear regression model for log-transformed blood lead indicated that cervid game meat consumption once a month or more was associated with approximately 31% increase in blood lead concentrations. The increase seemed to be mostly associated with consumption of minced cervid meat, particularly purchased minced meat. However, many participants with high and long-lasting game meat intake had low blood lead concentrations. Cervid meat together with number of bullet shots per year, years with game consumption, self-assembly of bullets, wine consumption and smoking jointly accounted for approximately 25% of the variation in blood lead concentrations, while age and sex accounted for 27% of the variance. Blood lead concentrations increased approximately 18% per decade of age, and men had on average 30% higher blood lead concentrations than women. Hunters who assembled their own ammunition had 52% higher blood lead concentrations than persons not making ammunition. In conjunction with minced cervid meat, wine intake was significantly associated with increased blood lead. Our results indicate that hunting practices such as use of lead-based ammunition, self-assembling of lead containing bullets and inclusion of lead-contaminated meat for mincing to a large extent determine the exposure to lead from cervid game consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervidae 3aadults 3ablood 3agame meat 3alead 3alinear models 3ameat consumption 3amen 3aminced meat 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3awines 3awomen 3aNorway 0aLead exposure 0aGame 0aMoose 0aDeer 0aRisk1 aDahl, H.1 aBrantsæter, A.L.1 aBirgisdottir, B.E.1 aKnutsen, H.K.1 aBernhoft, A.1 aOftedal, B.1 aLande, U.S.1 aAlexander, J.1 aHaugen, M.1 aYdersbond, T.A.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2013 Nov., v. 127 p.29-39dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2013.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012500173520138400298592002801682650002301710650001501733650001701748650002001765650001901785650004301804650001701847650001501864650001801879650002601897650001601923700001801939773012801957856008702085852000902172655001202181IND60768435520221120124811.0220225e20220212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076843552DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms100204272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, Janine 10aExpression of Scytonemin Biosynthesis Genes under Alternative Stress Conditions in the Cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme  aThe indole-alkaloid scytonemin is a sunscreen pigment that is widely produced among cyanobacteria as an ultraviolet radiation (UVR) survival strategy. Scytonemin biosynthesis is encoded by two gene clusters that are known to be induced by long-wavelength radiation (UVA). Previous studies have characterized the transcriptome of cyanobacteria in response to a wide range of conditions, but the effect on the expression of scytonemin biosynthesis genes has not been specifically targeted. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the variable response of scytonemin biosynthesis genes to a variety of environmental conditions. Cells were acclimated to white light before supplementation with UVA, UVB, high light, or osmotic stress for 48 h. The presence of scytonemin was determined by absorbance spectroscopy and gene expression of representative scytonemin biosynthesis genes was measured using quantitative PCR. Scytonemin genes were up-regulated in UVA, UVB, and high light, although the scytonemin pigment was not detected under high light. There was no scytonemin or upregulation of these genes under osmotic stress. The lack of pigment production under high light, despite increased gene expression, suggests a time-dependent delay for pigment production or additional mechanisms or genes that may be involved in scytonemin production beyond those currently known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc punctiforme 3aabsorbance 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3aosmotic stress 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspectroscopy 3asunscreens 3atranscriptome 3aultraviolet radiation 3awhite light1 aSoule, Tanya 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 12, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100204273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245011200171500001900283520141500302592002801717650001501745650002201760650001701782650001601799650002301815650000901838650001001847650002101857650001501878650001001893651001001903651001101913700003701924700002901961700002301990700002702013773012102040856007902161852000902240655001202249IND60732033020221120055720.0210326e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073203302DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100302292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiovannini, Lucrezia 10aReproductive and Developmental Biology of Acroclisoides sinicus, a Hyperparasitoid of Scelionid Parasitoids  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAcroclisoides sinicus (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) was described in 1988 from China, but recent findings in Europe and North America within the framework of Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) biological control indicate a Holarctic distribution. The few records and fragmented information on A. sinicus are derived from generic observations of other species belonging to the same genus, and its biological and ethological traits are still completely unexplored. It was suspected to be a facultative or obligate hyperparasitoid of many egg parasitoid species (e.g., Scelionidae and Eupelmidae), especially those parasitizing Pentatomidae eggs. Laboratory colonies of A. sinicus were established from specimens collected in the field in Europe and the USA, which allowed us to investigate for the first time the life traits of this somewhat enigmatic species. Our studies confirmed the obligate hyperparasitoid hypothesis for species of Scelionidae but not of Eupelmidae. Laboratory studies revealed that A. sinicus is extremely selective in its host recognition as only the pupal stage of its host species is exploited for parasitization. Taking into consideration its hyperparasitoid habit, the adventive A. sinicus populations in Europe and North America may potentially be severe threats to pentatomid natural control as new components in the trophic chain of pentatomids and their parasitoid guilds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEupelmidae 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aPteromalidae 3aScelionidae 3abiological control 3aeggs 3ahosts 3ahyperparasitoids 3aparasitism 3apupae 3aChina 3aEurope1 aSabbatini-Peverieri, Giuseppino 1 aTillman, Patricia  Glynn1 aHoelmer, Kim  Alan1 aRoversi, Pio  Federico0 tBiology.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100302293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245007900188520189700267592002802164650001602192650001702208650000902225650001702234650002002251650001802271650001802289650001002307650004302317650001302360650001402373650001902387650001502406650001702421650001902438651001102457651001002468653003002478653003502508653002102543653001502564653002102579700003902600700002402639700002602663700002702689700002702716773011102743856008602854852000902940655001202949IND60727686920221120022759.0220606e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1102072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Adriana Raquel Persson da10aOchratoxin A and related fungi in Brazilian black pepper (Piper nigrum L.)  aOchratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin with nephrotoxic, genotoxic, teratogenic and carcinogenic properties, produced by several species of Aspergillus, mainly those belonging to the A. section Circumdati and A. section Nigri. Although this toxin has been detected in spices and condiments, in black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) few studies have investigated the mycobiota (based on a molecular approach) and the presence of OTA in this food. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of potentially ochratoxigenic species and ochratoxin A in black pepper marketed in Brazil, one of the largest producers in the world. A total of 60 samples of black pepper (29 in powder and 31 in grain) were collected in markets. The presence of OTA was investigated in black pepper samples using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), OTA was detected in 55% of the samples, with levels ranging from 0.05 to 13.15 μg/kg, all of which were below the Brazilian legal tolerances. A. section Nigri and A. section Circumdati were found in 80% of the samples, but the species of A. section Nigri were significantly more frequent than those of A. section Circumdati. The potential for OTA production by fungal isolates was tested using the agar plug technique and confirmed by HPLC. Among the isolates belonging to A. section Nigri (n = 1,083) and A. section Circumdati (n = 129), 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively, were able to produce OTA in Yeast Extract Sucrose Agar (YESA). A total of 25 strains from A. section Circumdati and 64 from A. section Nigri were identified using molecular data. The following potentially ochratoxigenic species were found in black pepper: A. niger, A. welwitschiae, A. carbonarius, A. westerdijkiae and A. ochraceus. The occurrence of these species denotes the need for continuous monitoring of black pepper by regulatory bodies in order to safeguard consumers' health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aPiper nigrum 3aagar 3ablack pepper 3acarcinogenicity 3aculture media 3afood research 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amutagens 3amycobiota 3anephrotoxicity 3aoccurrence 3aochratoxin A 3ateratogenicity 3aBrazil 3aNiger 0aAspergillus section Nigri 0aAspergillus section Circumdati 0aBlack aspergilli 0aMycotoxins 0aMycobiota, spice1 aFungaro, Maria Helena Pelegrinelli1 aSilva, Josué José1 aMartins, Ligia Manoel1 aTaniwaki, Marta Hiromi1 aIamanaka, Beatriz Thie0 tFood research international.g2021 Apr., v. 142 p.110207-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.1102073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245008400200500002000284520169700304592002802001596006302029596004702092650001102139650001502150650001102165650001302176650000902189650002302198650002502221700006002246700002202306700005502328773013602383856007702519852000902596655001202605IND60791721420221119095047.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172142DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0186862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafati, Yashar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4153-287710aEntrainment and Transport of Well‐Sorted and Mixed Sediment Under Wave Motion  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEntrainment and suspension of sediment particles with the size distribution similar to a range of natural sands were simulated with a focus on the vertical size sorting and transport dynamics in response to different wave conditions. The simulations were performed using a two‐phase Eulerian‐Lagrangian model by combining the LIGGGHTS discrete element method solver for sediment and SedFoam solver for the fluid phase. The model was first validated for a range of sand grain sizes from 0.21 to 0.97 mm having well‐sorted and mixed (bimodal) size distributions using laboratory oscillatory flow data. Three sediment bed configurations were studied under a wide range of velocity‐skewed waves with different wave intensity and skewness. It was found that the bimodal distribution having only 30% of coarse fraction and 70% of medium fraction responds similar to a well‐sorted coarse sand configuration. Sediment fluxes of the bimodal distribution were slightly higher than those of well‐sorted coarse sand because of the pronounced inverse grading in the bimodal distribution. Furthermore, for the bimodal distribution the medium fraction acted as a relatively smooth foundation underneath the coarse fraction which facilitated the mobilization of the coarser particles. Under high energy wave conditions, the smoothing feature was exacerbated and further caused the formation of plug flow where a thick layer of intense sediment flux was observed. Model results also showed that under high skewness waves, phase‐lag effect occurred in well‐sorted medium sand which caused lower net onshore sediment transport rates but the effect was significantly reduced for mixed sediments.  aPublisher supplied data  aN00014‐18‐1‐2785cDOD, USN, Office of Naval Research  aOCE‐1756714cNational Science Foundation 3aenergy 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3asand 3asediment transport 3astatistical analysis1 aHsu, Tian‐Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8473-34411 aCalantoni, Joseph1 aPuleo, Jack1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2889-59560 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JC018686-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0186863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245010600200300001800306500001100324520132100335592002801656596005801684596007901742650001701821650001901838650001601857650002001873650001701893650001201910650001301922650001701935700005701952700005702009773011802066856007402184852000902258655001202267IND60744889320221120043813.0210721e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488932DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.156032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguly, Kasturi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0055-389010aInterplay between C‐type lectin receptors and microRNAs in cellular homeostasis and immune response  ap. 4210-4229.  aREVIEW  aC‐type lectin receptors (CLRs) belong to the family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). They have a critical role to play in the regulation of a range of physiological functions including development, respiration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and immunity. CLRs can recognize distinct and conserved exogenous pathogen‐associated as well as endogenous damage‐associated molecular patterns. These interactions set off downstream signaling cascades, leading to the production of inflammatory mediators, activation of effector immune cells as well as regulation of the developmental and physiological homeostasis. CLR signaling must be tightly controlled to circumvent the excessive inflammatory burden and to maintain the cellular homeostasis. Recently, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be important regulators of expression of CLRs and their downstream signaling. The delicate balance between miRNAs and CLRs seems crucial in almost all aspects of multicellular life. Any dysregulations in the miRNA‐CLR axes may lead to tumorigenesis or inflammatory diseases. Here, we present an overview of the current understanding of the central role of miRNAs in the regulation of CLR expression, profoundly impacting upon homeostasis and immunity, and thus, development of therapeutics against immune disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  aREV/923/06‐2020cIndian Council of Medical Research  a09/759(0038)/2019‐EMR‐IcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research 3aangiogenesis 3acarcinogenesis 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alectins 3amicroRNA 3atherapeutics1 aKishore, Uday1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6033-67591 aMadan, Taruna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2826-24430 tFEBS journal.g2021 July, v. 288, no. 14 p.4210-4229dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.156033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008700166520115800253592002801411650002301439650002501462650002301487650002501510650001901535650001801554650002301572650001701595653001801612653001801630653001001648653001701658653001301675700001601688700001301704700002201717773012201739856008501861852000901946655001201955IND60674151520221120192427.0191220e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067415152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1098392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyons, B.P.10aMarine plastic litter in the ROPME Sea Area: Current knowledge and recommendations  aThe impact of marine litter, particularly plastic waste, is widely acknowledged as a growing global concern. Marine litter is an understudied issue in the Regional Organisation for Protection of the Marine Environment (ROPME) Sea Area where rapid economic growth has already placed considerable stress on infrastructure and coastal ecosystems. This paper outlines some of the drivers for waste generation in region and reviews the available literature to summarise the current state of knowledge on the environmental fate, behaviour and impact of marine litter within the ROPME Sea Area. While data is limited, those studies conducted demonstrate marine litter is posing a clear and growing threat to the environmental and socioeconomic prosperity of the ROPME Sea Area. The development of regional and national marine litter reduction plans are clearly a priority to focus and coordinate activity across multiple stakeholders. Discussion of the potential environmental impacts arising as a result of marine litter are presented together with a roadmap for establishing and implementing a ROPME Sea Area Marine Litter and Single-Use Plastic Action Plan.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal ecosystems 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental fate 3aenvironmental impact 3ainfrastructure 3amarine debris 3amarine environment 3astakeholders 0aMarine litter 0aMicroplastics 0aROPME 0aArabian gulf 0aPlastics1 aCowie, W.J.1 aMaes, T.1 aLe Quesne, W.J.F.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 187 p.109839-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:1984x0147-65137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.1098393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245008800203500002000291520160300311592002801914596007501942596008602017596006002103650001102163650001502174650001802189650001802207650001302225650000902238700005902247773013602306856007702442852000902519655001202528IND60791721720221119095014.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172172DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0185132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumberston, J.

Wind velocities through the inlet (ranging 0–18 m/s) are modulated at subtidal timescales and are well correlated (R = 0.87) to a subtidal component of the water level slope through the inlet. The subtidal wind and water level slope are also well correlated to the subtidal current along the principal flow axis in the main inlet channel (R = 0.92 and 0.96, respectively). In combination with findings from previous studies, these findings suggest that regional winds induce the subtidal water level slope through the inlet by causing opposing setup/setdown to either side of the inlet. A force balance at the inlet demonstrates that the wind‐induced pressure gradient forces the subtidal currents, with wave forcing and local wind shear acting as lower‐order influences. The magnitude of the subtidal current is substantial, exceeding that of the tidal currents 45% of the time. Cumulatively, these findings indicate that regional winds exert a first‐order control on the currents at Oregon Inlet and cause irregular hydrodynamic patterns not well described by the traditional inlet classification scheme. Regional geographic characteristics may contribute to the high level of wind influence at Oregon Inlet, but similar processes are likely to be important to net flow dynamics at other inlets with large, shallow inland water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data  cDOD | US Army | USACE | ERDC | Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL)  cUNH | School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering, University of New Hampshire  cDOD | US Army | USACE | Coastal Inlets Research Program 3aOregon 3ageophysics 3ahydrodynamics 3ainland waters 3aresearch 3awind1 aLippmann, T.

Such an organism dries up to a state of equilibrium with dry air. Unless special protective mechanisms exist, desiccation leads to damage, mainly to proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids. A short historical outline of research on extreme dehydration of living organisms and the current state of research are presented. Terminological issues are outlined. The role of water in the cell and the mechanisms of damage occurring in the cell under the desiccation stress are briefly discussed. Particular attention was paid to damage to proteins, nucleic acids, and membrane lipids. Understanding the nature of the changes and damage associated with desiccation is essential for the study of desiccation-tolerance mechanisms and application research. Difficulties related to the definition of life and the limits of life in the scientific discussion, caused by the phenomenon of anhydrobiosis, were also indicated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanhydrobiosis 3adrought tolerance1 aSkłodowska, Aleksandra 0 tMicroorganisms.g2022 Feb. 12, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms100204323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010700172520136700279592002801646650001701674650002201691650001501713653002701728653002001755653002101775653002201796653002501818700001201843700001601855700001501871700001901886773009001905856008501995852000902080655001202089IND60755853820221119193457.0220110e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Tiancheng10aHigh-efficiency fuel utilization innovation in microfluidic fuel cells: From liquid-feed to vapor-feed  aFuel cells are an efficient, environmentally friendly and renewable energy device, which is synonymous with the green age. Microfluidic fuel cells are an excellent solution to the energy needs of portable electronic devices. In the present study, both vapor- and liquid-feed modes are established, which are combined with physical fields. Moreover, the accuracy of the models is verified. According to the results, the vapor-feed microfluidic fuel cell achieves higher tolerance to low flow rates while realizing a much higher energy efficiency than the liquid-feed microfluidic fuel cell. In addition, the performance of these microfluidic fuel cells is significantly improved by increasing the electrolyte and fuel concentrations. In terms of fuel utilization, the vapor-feed mode performs much better than that of liquid-feed mode no matter what parameters are changed, which shows the superiority of vapor-feed microfluidic fuel cell. Sensitivity analysis shows that either the electrolyte or fuel concentration significantly affects the power output of these microfluidic fuel cells. Although their growth can improve the power output of the fuel cells, they have adverse effects on energy efficiency. Conclusions indicate that the vapor-feed microfluidic fuel cell is more suitable for portable electronic products, and it is worthy of further development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy efficiency 3afuel cells 0aMicrofluidic fuel cell 0aVapor feed mode 0aLiquid feed mode 0aExergy efficiency 0aSensitivity analysis1 aLu, Jie1 aXu, Peihang1 aHu, Xiaoyi1 aChen, Jingxian0 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 240 p.122484-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006200141245009300203300001400296520186700310592002802177650002002205650003002225650001502255650001202270650001002282650001302292650002302305650002102328650002202349650001602371650001502387650002102402651001302423653001502436653002702451653002202478700006102500700002102561773015202582856007602734852000902810655001202819IND60786602720221120175033.0220804e20220406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660272DNAL7 a10.1017/inp.2022.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeedorf, Rachel H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1933-316610aPrescribed burning followed by indaziflam enhances downy brome (Bromus tectorum) control  ap. 72-80.  aDowny brome (Bromus tectorum L.) is a highly invasive winter annual grass that can fill open niches in native plant communities. Prescribed burning is often used to control B. tectorum and can be combined with herbicide treatments to extend the duration of control and promote the native plant community. Several herbicides have been evaluated in conjunction with burning for B. tectorum control, although the herbicide indaziflam has not. In September 2017, two B. tectorum–infested sites were burned in Colorado foothill shrublands. In March 2018, indaziflam was applied alone or in combination with glyphosate, rimsulfuron, or imazapic. These treatments were compared with imazapic plus glyphosate as a standard. All treatments were made within burned and non-burned areas in a crossed-nested design. Bromus tectorum cover and the desirable plant community responses were evaluated 1 and 2 yr after treatment (YAT). In non-burned areas, all indaziflam treatments reduced B. tectorum cover compared with the control. In contrast, reductions from the imazapic treatments did not persist after the first year. Most post-burn treatments further decreased B. tectorum cover compared with the non-burned treatments. The most effective treatments (indaziflam 44 and 73 g ai ha–¹ + imazapic 123 g ae ha–¹) provided similar levels of control (<1% B. tectorum cover at 2 YAT), with or without burning. Desirable plant cover, richness, and diversity were not negatively impacted by burning or herbicide treatments. Plant diversity and species richness increased at Site 2 when burning was followed by indaziflam treatments. This study indicates that B. tectorum control using indaziflam can be enhanced when applied after burning, and the combinations with imazapic or rimsulfuron provide a wider application window compared with the combination with glyphosate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus tectorum 3aadministrative management 3aglyphosate 3agrasses 3ahills 3aimazapic 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aplant communities 3arimsulfuron 3ashrublands 3aspecies richness 3aColorado 0aHerbicides 0anative plant community 0aspecies diversity1 aClark, Shannon L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2579-83921 aNissen, Scott J.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2022 Apr. 6, v. 15, no. 2 p.72-80dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2022.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245008300202500002000285520090800305592002801213596006601241596002601307650001401333650001501347650001801362650001301380650002201393650001101415651001501426700006101441700006101502700006101563773013601624856007701760852000901837655001201846IND60791721820221119095047.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172182DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0189312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKajtar, Jules B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0114-661010aDrivers, Dynamics, and Persistence of the 2017/2018 Tasman Sea Marine Heatwave  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDuring the austral summer of 2017/2018, the Tasman Sea experienced an intense marine heatwave over an extensive area. It persisted for approximately 3 months and caused substantial ecological impacts. The marine heatwave was understood to have been driven primarily by increased net downward heat flux associated with a high pressure system. However, it has been unclear why the marine heatwave persisted. Using an ultra‐high‐resolution (∼1 km) regional ocean model simulation, the drivers, dynamics, and persistence of the 2017/2018 marine heatwave are explored in detail. It is found that a burst of warm water advection helped to initiate the event, but a shallower than usual mixed layer, coupled with near continuous net downward air‐sea heat flux, caused the marine heatwave to persist. Submesoscale dynamics were found to be relatively unimportant to the marine heatwave's persistence.  aPublisher supplied data  aCE170100023cAustralian Research Council Centre of Excellence  cAustralian Government 3aadvection 3ageophysics 3aheat transfer 3aresearch 3asimulation models 3asummer 3aTasman Sea1 aBachman, Scott D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6479-43001 aHolbrook, Neil J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3523-62541 aPilo, Gabriela S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8590-86450 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JC018931-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0189313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004000140245015500180300001800335500002000353520183800373592002802211596005202239596004502291596005202336596003402388596008102422596003902503650002102542650001802563650002302581650001502604650001402619650002502633650002002658650003102678650001502709650002102724650001402745650001702759700005902776700002402835700001902859700002402878700001902902700006302921773011802984856007403102852000903176655001203185IND60744889520221120043728.0210721e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488952DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.157342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavianatou, Anastasia‐Gerasimoula14aThe action of hyaluronan in functional properties, morphology and expression of matrix effectors in mammary cancer cells depends on its molecular size  ap. 4291-4310.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBreast cancer constitutes a heterogeneous disease. The expression profiles of estrogen receptors (ERs), as well as the expression patterns of extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules, determine its development and progression. Hyaluronan (HA) is an ECM molecule that regulates breast cancer cells' properties in a molecular size‐dependent way. Previous studies have shown that 200‐kDa HA fragments modulate the functional properties, morphology, and expression of several matrix mediators of the highly metastatic ERα⁻/ERβ⁺ MDA‐MB‐231 cells. In order to evaluate the effects of HA fragments (< 10, 30 and 200‐kDa) in ERβ‐suppressed breast cancer cells, the shERβ MDA‐MB‐231 cells were used. These cells are less aggressive when compared with MDA‐MB‐231 cells. To this end, the functional properties, the morphology, and the expression of the molecules associated with breast cancer cells metastatic potential were studied. Notably, both cell proliferation and invasion were significantly reduced after treatment with 200‐kDa HA. Moreover, as assessed by scanning electron microscopy, 200‐kDa HA affected cellular morphology, and as assessed by qPCR, upregulated the epithelial marker Ε‐cadherin. The expression profiles of ECM mediators, such as HAS2, CD44, and MMP7, were also altered. On the other hand, cellular migration and the expression levels of syndecan‐4 (SDC‐4) were not significantly affected in contrast to our observations regarding MDA‐MB‐231 cells. These novel data demonstrate that the molecular size of the HA determines its effects on ERβ‐suppressed breast cancer cells and that 200‐kDa HA exhibits antiproliferative effects on these cells. A deeper understanding of this mechanism may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies against breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data  cHellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation  a645756cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  cGeneral Secretariat for Research and Technology  aMIS5033644cArthroMicroPerMed  cOperational Programme ‘Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation’  cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3abreast neoplasms 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3aepithelium 3aestrogens 3aextracellular matrix 3ahyaluronic acid 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametastasis 3amolecular weight 3asyndecans 3atherapeutics1 aPiperigkou, Zoi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0472-53891 aKoutsakis, Christos1 aBarbera, Carlo1 aBeninatto, Riccardo1 aFranchi, Marco1 aKaramanos, Nikos K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3618-02880 tFEBS journal.g2021 July, v. 288, no. 14 p.4291-4310dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.157343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245008200213506011700295506007600412520133100488592002801819506003701847650002801884650001501912650001301927650002101940650001501961650000901976650001201985650000901997700002702006700001702033773011002050856008802160852000902248655001202257IND60727687220221207115635.0220614e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1055092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLittle, David I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9949-408712aA perspective on oil spills: What we should have learned about global warming  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aScientific knowledge of marine pollution and oil spill response (OSR) innovation has diffused over half a century. Local community resilience to spills and the equitable application of knowledge worldwide are constrained by several barriers. These range from access, governance, cost minimisation, through austerity and poverty in affected areas, to realpolitik (e.g. vested interests, nationalism, corruption, security breakdown and war). Ongoing incidents show inequalities in spill risk and OSR capability. Advances in knowledge have belatedly brought us to the conclusion that the logical way to reduce adverse impacts of oil in an era of global warming is to accelerate decarbonisation. This would rapidly and simultaneously reduce the frequency, magnitude and consequences of oil spills. Meanwhile, mitigating spills, managing OSR, and restoring local communities and ecosystems at spill sites are fundamental obligations for the oil industry. These obligations should be routinely enforced by all responsible governments, and backed by inter-governmental agencies and conventions. However, we must no longer assume that even the best practices in exploration, production, refining, transport and consumption of hydrocarbons can adequately reduce their leading role in the ongoing destruction of the global environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoastal zone management 3agovernance 3aindustry 3amarine pollution 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apoverty 3arisk1 aSheppard, Stephen R.J.1 aHulme, David0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 202 p.105509-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1055093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007400174520123900248592002801487650002201515650002401537650001601561653001601577653002101593653002601614653002101640700006001661700006201721700005601783700001601839700005901855773010401914856008502018852000902103655001202112IND60755853920221119193415.0220110e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbush, Dominic D.10aDesign and testing of a free floating dual flap wave energy converter  aWith a wide variety of wave energy device archetypes currently under consideration, it is a major challenge to ensure that research findings and methods are broadly applicable. In particular, the design and testing of wave energy control systems, a process which includes experimental design, empirical modeling, control design, and performance evaluation, is of interest. This goal motivated the redesign and testing of a floating dual flap wave energy converter. As summarized in this paper, the steps taken in the design, testing, and analysis of the device mirrored those previously demonstrated on a three-degree of freedom point absorber device. The method proposed does not require locking WEC degrees of freedom to develop an excitation model, and presents a more attainable system identification procedure for at-sea deployments. The results show that the methods employed work well for this dual flap device, lending additional support for the broad applicability of the design and testing methods applied here. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that these models are particularly useful for deducing areas of device design or controller implementation that can be reasonably improved to increase device power capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3aexperimental design 3awater power 0aWave energy 0aFeedback control 0aSystem identification 0aFrequency domain1 aBacelli, Giorgio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1208-23521 aSpencer, Steven J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1732-52611 aCoe, Ryan G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0738-37721 aBosma, Bret1 aLomonaco, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6721-56880 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 240 p.122485-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245009600197500002000293520152200313592002801835596006301863596002801926596004401954650001201998650002002010650001502030650000902045650001502054650001102069650001302080650003002093650000902123700006302132700005702195700005802252700002002310700002602330773013602356856007702492852000902569655001202578IND60791721920221119095035.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079172192DNAL7 a10.1029/2022JC0185572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xingkun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0692-814710aSea Spray Impacts on Tropical Cyclone Olwyn Using a Coupled Atmosphere‐Ocean‐Wave Model  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExtreme marine weather enhances the production of sea spray droplets which, in turn, affect the air‐sea fluxes. Despite the ability of sea spray to modulate air‐sea interaction processes, it remains under‐represented in tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting modeling. In this study, impacts of sea spray on the atmospheric and oceanic environments of TC Olwyn are investigated. This is achieved by high‐resolution nested simulations using an air‐sea‐wave model coupled with a sea spray production model. We compared two different sea spray models: a wave‐Reynolds‐number‐dependent model, and a wave‐steepness‐dependent spray model. By including a sea spray model, the root mean square error in the simulated TC Olwyn 10 m wind and significant wave height are significantly reduced by up to 30% and 26%, respectively, in comparison to the baseline simulation without spray. This improvement is because sea spray decreases air‐sea heat fluxes at larger radii of TC, and decreases air‐sea heat fluxes at smaller radii of TC. In contrast to the simulated results without sea spray, sea spray increases the air‐sea heat (sensible + latent) energy transfer and intensifies TC Olwyn. Sea spray also triggers stronger upper‐ocean mixing and strengthens the TC‐induced sea surface temperature cooling. Our results thus imply that sea spray critically impacts the atmosphere and ocean conditions during extreme marine weather and thus needs to be considered explicitly in TC forecasting modeling.  aPublisher supplied data  aN62909‐20‐1‐2080cUS Office of Naval Research Global  cUniversity of Melbourne  cMinistry of Oceans and Fisheries, Korea 3acooling 3aenergy transfer 3ageophysics 3aheat 3ahurricanes 3amodels 3aresearch 3asurface water temperature 3awind1 aVoermans, Joey Jeff1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2963-37631 aMoon, Il‐Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9370-09001 aLiu, Qingxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6100-02211 aGuan, Changlong1 aBabanin, Alexander V.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JC018557-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0185573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100005700141245020400198300001500402520174800417592002802165650002102193650002402214650003002238650002402268650001702292650001602309650001002325650001602335650001602351650002302367650002102390650002102411650001402432650002202446650001502468651002102483653002302504653003002527653001702557653002302574700006302597700006502660773015402725856007602879852000902955655001202964IND60786602820221120175043.0220804e20220411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660282DNAL7 a10.1017/inp.2022.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuckers, Myra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4406-838410aAboveground native plant biomass reduces Potentilla recta growth: the role of a productive native plant community to mitigate reinvasion from the seedbank of invaded northern intermountain grasslands  ap. 98-106.  aSulphur cinquefoil (Potentilla recta L.) is an invasive plant of concern within grasslands in western North America. To better understand the role of native plant communities and soil seedbank in P. recta invasion within grasslands, we conducted two greenhouse studies to examine (1) P. recta growth response when grown with and without fertilizer in established native plant communities of varying functional groups (grasses, forbs, or grasses and forbs), and (2) the prevalence of P. recta and other species in the soil seedbank at varying soil depths (0 to 5 cm, 5 to 10 cm, 10 to 15 cm) of grasslands invaded by P. recta in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. The growth response of P. recta did not differ between the native plant communities. However, P. recta above- and belowground biomass declined as native plant aboveground biomass increased, suggesting a productive plant community may be important to suppress P. recta. Fertilizer did not affect the growth response of P. recta or native plants, suggesting nutrients may not have been a dominant limiting factor under greenhouse conditions. Nine species were identified in the soil seedbank. Seven were nonnative, which included P. recta, and native species represented less than 2% of the seedbank. Of the average number of emerged nonnative seedlings, more than 20% were P. recta. The number of emerged P. recta seedlings was 69% lower at 10- to 15-cm compared with 0- to 5-cm soil depth, although the successful germination of P. recta at greater soil depths suggests viable P. recta seeds are persisting in the seedbank. Active revegetation may be an important strategy to mitigate P. recta reinvasion or secondary invasion by other invasive species from the soil seedbank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotentilla recta 3aaboveground biomass 3aadministrative management 3abelowground biomass 3aburied seeds 3afertilizers 3aforbs 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aland restoration 3aphytomass 3aplant communities 3asoil depth 3aBritish Columbia 0aGrassland recovery 0ainvasive plant management 0arevegetation 0asulphur cinquefoil1 aRoozendaal, Marc L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4654-13771 aStewart, Katherine J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0998-57690 tInvasive plant science and management.g2022 Apr. 11, v. 15, no. 2 p.98-106dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2022.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013400159300002000293520161400313592002801927650002201955650002101977650002201998650001702020650001402037650001402051650001902065650001602084650001602100650002102116650001502137700001902152700002002171700002302191700002302214700002602237700001902263700001702282700002502299700003102324700002102355773014502376856007402521852000902595655001202604IND60670486820221117221420.0191002e20130917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067048682DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta11855j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDocampo, Pablo14aThe influence of 1D, meso- and crystal structures on charge transport and recombination in solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 12088-12095.  aWe have prepared single crystalline SnO₂ and ZnO nanowires and polycrystalline TiO₂ nanotubes (1D networks) as well as nanoparticle-based films (3D networks) from the same materials to be used as photoanodes for solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. In general, superior photovoltaic performance can be achieved from devices based on 3-dimensional networks, mostly due to their higher short circuit currents. To further characterize the fabricated devices, the electronic properties of the different networks were measured via the transient photocurrent and photovoltage decay techniques. Nanowire-based devices exhibit extremely high, light independent electron transport rates while recombination dynamics remain unchanged. This indicates, contrary to expectations, a decoupling of transport and recombination dynamics. For typical nanoparticle-based photoanodes, the devices are usually considered electron-limited due to the poor electron transport through nanocrystalline titania networks. In the case of the nanowire-based devices, the system becomes limited by the organic hole transporter used. In the case of polycrystalline TiO₂ nanotube-based devices, we observe lower transport rates and higher recombination dynamics than their nanoparticle-based counterparts, suggesting that in order to improve the electron transport properties of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, single crystalline structures should be used. These findings should aid future design of photoanodes based on nanowires or porous semiconductors with extended crystallinity to be used in dye-sensitized solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3ananocrystals 3ananotubes 3ananowires 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc oxide1 aIvaturi, Aruna1 aGunning, Robert1 aDiefenbach, Sandra1 aKirkpatrick, James1 aPalumbiny, Claudia M.1 aSivaram, Varun1 aGeaney, Hugh1 aSchmidt-Mende, Lukas1 aWelland, M.

In this sense, the objective of this study was to identify the knowledge management practices that are present in an ecological restoration process in the tropical dry forest. The empirical study was developed using a mixed approach over an area of 11,079 ha in Huila, Colombia. At first, the qualitative study was supported by a documentary review and participant observation between 2018 and 2020. On the other hand, the quantitative study was carried out through the application of the Delphi method with the participation of 64 experts. Twenty-two knowledge management practices were identified with orientation towards human factors, organization, information technologies, strategy, and intellectual protection. These findings show that all the knowledge management practices identified have an impact on the six components of the ecological restoration process (planning, diagnosis, implementation, monitoring, participation, and consolidation). Likewise, these practices contribute to the generation, transformation, and mobilization of local and scientific knowledge in the components of the ecological restoration process of the tropical dry forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphi method 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aempirical research 3ahumans 3ainformation management 3aland 3aqualitative analysis 3atropical dry forests 3aColombia1 aAcosta-Prado, Julio César0 tLand.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110303303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245015200165300001800317520124800335592002801583650002601611650002501637650002401662650001101686650002401697650002401721650001301745650001501758650002001773650001701793650001501810650001801825650001001843650002101853650001501874650002201889650000901911650001901920650001701939653002301956653000901979653002201988653001502010700001502025700001502040700001702055700005502072700005702127773014702184856008002331852000902411655001202420IND60684912520221118051930.0200226e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b076872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chenyang10aEvaluation and Exploration of Potentially Bioactive Peptides in Casein Hydrolysates against Liver Oxidative Damage in STZ/HFD-Induced Diabetic Rats  ap. 2393-2405.  aHyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress can cause liver damage in diabetes, and protein hydrolysates with antidiabetic and antioxidant properties are emerging as a potential therapy. In this study, protective effects of casein hydrolysates against live oxidative damage in streptozotocin/high-fat-induced diabetic rats were studied and potentially bioactive peptides were explored by an integrated approach of differential peptide and in silico analysis. Results showed that different casein hydrolysates significantly alleviated liver oxidative damage (p < 0.05) via different mechanisms. Particularly, casein hydrolyzed by a papain–flavourzyme combination (P-FCH) treatment significantly improved liver antioxidant enzyme activities by enhancing nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 18 peptides were screened as potential bioactive peptides by analyzing differential peptides among different hydrolysates combined with in silico prediction. Among them, the dipeptide WM might directly inhibit the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)–Nrf2 interaction as potential Nrf2 activators. These results suggested that P-FCH might be an alternative way to treat liver damage in diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acasein 3acasein hydrolysates 3acomputer simulation 3adiabetes 3adipeptides 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahyperglycemia 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3aprediction 3aprotective effect 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3atherapeutics 0acasein hydrolysate 0aNrf2 0adiabetes mellitus 0apeptidomic1 aZheng, Lin1 aSu, Guowan1 aZeng, Xin-An1 aSun, Baoguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4326-82371 aZhao, Mouming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0221-38380 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 68, no. 8 p.2393-2405dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b076873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04298naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245012900210300001200339520233100351592002802682650001702710650002002727650001502747650002202762650001902784650001602803650000902819650002102828650001202849650001002861650003002871650001402901650001102915650001702926650001002943650001002953650001702963650001302980650001102993650001403004650001403018650001603032650001303048650001803061650002403079650001303103651001303116700002703129700002203156700002803178700002203206700002503228700002003253700002503273700002503298700001903323700002303342700002303365773011703388856008303505961001503588852000903603655001203612IND60696460420221118121441.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069646042DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02361-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaffer, Paula A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1584-013910aDelayed diagnosis of fatal pneumonic canine plague: clinical and pathologic features in two naturally infected Colorado dogs  ap. 160.  aBACKGROUND: Plague caused by Yersinia pestis is a highly infectious and potentially fatal zoonotic disease that can be spread by wild and domestic animals. In endemic areas of the northern hemisphere plague typically cycles from March to October, when flea vectors are active. Clinical forms of disease include bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. All clinical forms are uncommon in dogs and the pneumonic form is exceedingly rare. CASE PRESENTATION: Two mixed breed young-adult male domestic dogs presented to Colorado veterinarians with fever and vague signs that progressed to hemoptysis within 24 h. Case 1 presented in June 2014, while Case 2 occurred in December 2017. Thoracic radiography of Case 1 and 2 revealed right dorsal and right accessory lobe consolidation, respectively. In Case 1 initial differential diagnoses included pulmonary contusion due to trauma or diphacinone toxicosis. Case 1 was euthanized ~ 24 h post presentation due to progressive dyspnea and hemoptysis. Plague was confirmed 9 days later, after the dog’s owner was hospitalized with pneumonia. Case 2 was treated as foreign body/aspiration pneumonia and underwent lung lobectomy at a veterinary teaching hospital. Case 2 was euthanized after 5 days of hospitalization when bacterial culture of the excised lobe yielded Yersinia pestis. Both dogs had severe diffuse necrohemorrhagic and suppurative pneumonia at post mortem examination. CONCLUSIONS: Both dogs were misdiagnosed due to the atypical lobar presentation of an extremely rare form of plague in a species that infrequently succumbs to clinical disease. Presentation outside of the typical transmission period of plague was also a factor leading to delayed diagnosis in Case 2. Erroneous identification by automated bacterial identification systems was problematic in both cases. In endemic areas, plague should be ruled out early in febrile dogs with acute respiratory signs, hemoptysis, lobar or diffuse pathology, and potential for exposure, regardless of season. Seasonal and geographic distributions of plague may shift with climate change, so vigilance by primary care veterinarians is warranted. Timely submission of samples to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory could expedite accurate diagnosis and reduce potential for human and domestic animal exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiphonaptera 3aYersinia pestis 3aautomation 3abacterial culture 3aclimate change 3adiphacinone 3adogs 3adomestic animals 3adyspnea 3afever 3ageographical distribution 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3alaboratories 3alungs 3amales 3amixed breeds 3anecropsy 3aplague 3apneumonia 3apoisoning 3aradiography 3asampling 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary medicine 3azoonoses 3aColorado1 aHershkowitz, Connor S.1 aDowers, Kristy L.1 aGolchanour, Jennifer L.1 aHarris, Lauren J.1 aAboellial, Tawfik A.1 aMorley, Paul S.1 aBrault, Stephanie A.1 aPabilonia, Kristy L.1 aMason, Gary L.1 aHouse, Jennifer A.1 aDaniels, Joshua B.0 tBMC veterinary research.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.160-160dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02361-z3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245009800181300001400279500001900293500000900312520074200321592002801063650003101091650001301122650001301135650001301148650001701161650001401178650001401192650001501206773012001221856009601341852000901437655001201446IND60663646920221120195032.0191122e196801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066364692DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000010018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, J.

For highest seed yields, the optimum harvest period was found to be Sept. 15 to Oct. 1, with seeds planted May 1 to 18. Highest seed yields approached 1 metric ton/ha. Post-frost harvests resulted in reduced yields. Photoperiod influenced the time at which flowering occurred. Short days promoted flowering, but highest yields resulted from an intermediate photoperiod of 14 hours at planting with a reduced photoperiod after the first flowers began to develop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaccharoides anthelmintica 3aagronomy 3aepoxides 3afruiting 3aharvest date 3aphenology 3aseed oils 3aseed yield0 tAgronomy journal.g1968 Jan., v. 60, no. 1 p.55-58dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000010018x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007600170520129300246592002801539650001901567650002801586650001501614650002201629650001101651650001301662651001801675651000901693653002001702653001701722653002401739653002001763653002301783700005201806700001201858700001601870700001701886700001901903773010901922856008802031852000902119655001202128IND60727687420221117164312.0210506e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Danyue10aCO2 emission projection for Arctic shipping: A system dynamics approach  aAs the Arctic route has shown its potential for Europe-North Asia trade, the number of ships across Arctic route is surging. However, CO₂ emissions generated by ships would harm the regional environment. Thus, how to quantify the CO₂ emissions brought by ships for the present stage and future is critical for Arctic environment governance. As shipping emissions are determined by economic, political, environmental and operational factors, little research has been done to estimate CO₂ emission from a systematical way. This paper proposed a System Dynamics (SD) model that incorporates those comprehensive factors simultaneously for Arctic shipping CO₂ emission projection. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the ships sail across NSR are selected for estimation. 12 scenarios with different fuel usage conditions and ship speeds have been set to investigate the trend of CO₂ emissions. Results show that when under the BAU scenario, the overall shipping CO₂ emission on the NSR by 2050 will be 5506149 tons, which is 1.76 times of the emission level in 2020. Switching to cleaner fuels (such as LNG) and slow steaming are effective ways of emission reduction based on the simulation results. The conclusions can facilitate policy makers in making emission reduction decision.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoastal zone management 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apolitics 3aArctic region 3aAsia 0aArctic shipping 0aCO2 emission 0aEmission projection 0aSystem dynamics 0aPolicy implication1 aDai, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7023-46091 aHu, Hao1 aDing, Wenyi1 aWang, Yubing1 aZhou, Xiaoxuan0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 May 01, v. 205 p.105531-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245010200188300001600290520156300306592002801869650001101897650002101908650002401929650001401953650001401967650001301981650001501994650002202009650004202031650003802073650003602111651001102147700002802158700002302186700002902209773009502238856004802333852000902381655001202390IND4482433120221122035027.0120416e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448243312DNAL7 a220720462pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-011-9413-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkriptsova, Anna V.10aComparative Study of Polysaccharides from Reproductive and Sterile Tissues of Five Brown Seaweeds  ap. 304-311.  aSterile and reproductive tissues of five brown algae (Sargassum pallidum, Silvetia babingtonii, Fucus evanescens, Saccharina japonica, and Alaria ochotensis) from Russian Far East seas were compared for the content and monosaccharide composition of fucoidans as well as the content of laminarans and alginic acids. It was proved that reproduction has an apparent effect on fucoidan content and its monosaccharide composition. Fucoidan content in fertile tissues was shown to be 1.3–1.5 times as high as in sterile ones. Based on the present and previously reported data, we believe that fucoidan accumulation during the development of reproductive structure is a general trend for brown seaweeds. Reproduction also caused changes in the monosaccharide composition. As a result, fertile plants synthesized fucoidan with less heterogeneous monosaccharide composition in comparison with sterile ones. Structural changes of this polysaccharide are species-specific and perhaps depend on the type of the synthesized polysaccharide. The fertile plants of S. babingtonii yielded the highest fucoidan content [25% dry weight (dw)] among the tested species, whereas the maximum alginic acid content was found for the sterile tissues of S. japonica—up to 43% dw. There was no general trend in alginic acid content variation during sporulation. The alginic acid content was much higher in the sterile tissues of S. japonica in comparison with the fertile ones. On the contrary, the fertile tissues of A. ochotensis contained more alginic acid than the sterile ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlaria 3aFucus evanescens 3aSaccharina japonica 3aSargassum 3aalginates 3afucoidan 3amacroalgae 2aPlant Infertility 2aPolysaccharidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aReproduction, Asexualxphysiology 2aSeaweedxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aRussia1 aShevchenko, Nataliya M.1 aTarbeeva, Daria V.1 aZvyagintseva, Tatiana N.0 tMarine biotechnology.g2012 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.304-311dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-011-9413-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012700167520132400294592002801618650001501646650001801661650001101679650001001690650001601700653000801716653001501724653001601739653001801755700001201773700001601785773009001801856008501891852000901976655001201985IND60755854220221119193139.0220426e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075585422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Sheng10aNumerical study on the influence of inclination angle on the melting behaviour of metal foam-PCM latent heat storage units  aThis study numerically investigated the melting performance of a paraffin/copper foam composite phase change material (PCM) heat storage unit with a rectangular encapsulation under the effect of different inclination angles. Taking the coupled heat conduction and natural convection into consideration, the transient mathematical models were solved numerically, and the results were validated using experimental data from the literature. The results show that although the ligaments of the metal foams had a strong suppressive influence on natural convection, the composite PCM systems with different tilt angles exhibited different thermal behaviours and melting performances. Natural convection was completely suppressed in the horizontal cases (θ = 0° and 180°) and tended to be stronger for tilted container systems, especially for the vertical case. Due to the natural convection, a heat transfer dead zone appeared at the bottom of the tilted container. The boundary heat fluxes of horizontal cases were highest in the later stage of melting and the total melting time was shorter than that of the other tilted cases. Furthermore, the results indicated that the melting rate of the composite PCM system could be further increased by adopting a larger Rayleigh number and metal foam with smaller pore density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3afoams 3alatent heat 0aPCM 0aMetal foam 0aInclination 0aHeat transfer1 aLu, Jun1 aLi, Yongcai0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.122489-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100007000142245014200212300001800354500002000372520150800392592002801900596011301928650001502041650001802056650001302074650001302087650001502100650001102115650001102126650001802137650001602155650001502171651002202186700005902208700005602267700006002323700001702383700006202400773013102462856007702593852000902670655001202679IND60789724320221120180209.0220822e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078972432DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JC0146362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarceló‐Llull, Bàrbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4219-667610aTemporal and Spatial Hydrodynamic Variability in the Mallorca Channel (Western Mediterranean Sea) From 8 Years of Underwater Glider Data  ap. 2769-2786.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEight years of glider data are used to characterize the temporal and spatial variability of a region in the western Mediterranean that will constitute one of the targets for the calibration phase of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The characteristic horizontal dimension of mesoscale instabilities in the Mallorca channel is 6.0 km. The temporal evolution of intermediate water masses is dominated by an increase over time of the characteristic temperature values. Western Mediterranean and Levantine Intermediate waters display an increase of the temperature extrema of 0.064 ± 0.002 and 0.044 ± 0.002 °C/year between 2011 and 2018, respectively. At the layer of Levantine Intermediate water the salinity temporal regression reveals a mean trend of 0.010 year⁻¹. Temperature annual cycle shows an averaged temperature gradient of ∼6 °C in 6 months at the upper layer, with a disconnection with the annual cycle at 100‐m depth. The circulation across the channel is dominated by high‐frequency variability. The signature of eddies with radius ranging from 5 to 18 km is apparent in 16% of the transects analyzed and mainly in spring and summer, with a dominance of subsurface cyclonic eddies. Two‐way flow controls the annual cycle of the water transport through the channel with prevalence of the inflow of Atlantic water. Variations of water transport over timescales of weeks to months can be similar to those identifiable as seasonal changes.  aPublisher supplied data  aCTM2016-78607-PcSpanish National Research Program and the European Regional Development Fund (MINECO-FEDER) 3ageophysics 3ahydrodynamics 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atopography 3aMediterranean Sea1 aPascual, Ananda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9476-92721 aRuiz, Simón1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9395-93701 aEscudier, Romain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8532-00241 aTorner, Marc1 aTintoré, Joaquín1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6311-00930 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Apr., v. 124, no. 4 p.2769-2786dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0146363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011400167300001400281520256600295592002802861650002202889650001502911650001202926650000902938650001702947650002502964650001102989650001403000650001803014650001103032650001303043650001303056650001103069650002003080773010803100856008203208990002303290852000903313655001203322IND60097634120221118223332.0141104e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009763412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2010.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrockamp, Olaf10aDelamination of smectite in river-borne suspensions at the fluvial/marine interface – An experimental study  ap. 33-41.  aFine fractions (<2 μm) from smectite-rich flood-plain sediments from the Elbe and Weser rivers in Germany were treated in the laboratory with synthetic sea salt solutions at different concentrations and for different periods of time to document sheet delamination of smectite particles at the fluvial/marine interface and thus simulate changes in clay minerals at the mouth of a river. The project consisted of two steps: (1) Pilot tests were made in 0.5% salt solutions (brackish environment) showing a nearly 2-min delay of the clearing of the clayey suspensions, when the suspension was redispersed 15 and 30 min later after the first measurement. This was due to an obviously increased number of fine laminae from disintegrated smectite particles. (2) X-ray diffraction studies (XRD) of the clayey material from suspensions in 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0% salt solutions after standing 10 min, and one and three weeks were made to document alteration reactions of smectite. An aliquot was pipetted periodically from each series, and oriented clay-mineral specimens were analyzed by XRD in air-dried, glycol- and glycerin-solvated states. The peak intensities in the XRD patterns of the clay minerals smectite, random-ordered mixed-layer illite/smectite (I–S), kaolinite, chlorite, and illite did not change in the salt-free series during the experiments. In contrast the peak intensities of smectite and I–S mineral in the air-dried and glycerin-solvated states after suspension in saline solutions decreased significantly. The d-values of the smectitic materials in the air-dried state also decreased after contact with the saline solutions, and in the glycerin-solvated state the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the 001 smectite reflection increased by about 20%, indicating a reduction in grain size. The variations in FWHM, d-values and peak intensity of the smectitic material are assumed to be caused by an exchange of Na for Ca in the interlayer spaces and subsequent delamination of the particles along the Na-activated interlayers. Only those smectite particles in which adjacent sheets are still stabilized by the remaining Ca are preserved after contact with seawater. The experiments show that delamination of smectite and I–S mixed-layer minerals is likely to occur in the brackish environment at the mouth of a river. However, formation of these fine laminae is expected to be a transitional stage in the development of clay particle size, owing to the formation of flocs and aggregates in the higher salt concentrations of seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair drying 3acalcium 3aclay 3adelamination 3adevelopmental stages 3aillite 3akaolinite 3aparticle size 3arivers 3aseawater 3asmectite 3asodium 3asodium chloride0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 91, no. 1 p.33-41dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2010.10.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006500153245013400218520199500352592002802347650002302375650002802398650001102426650001302437650001502450650003302465650001502498650001102513650001902524650000902543650002002552650001502572651001602587651001502603651001802618651001002636651001702646653002102663653001102684653001702695653000802712653000902720700007602729773010902805856008802914852000903002655001203011IND60727687520221123035544.0210506e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasheer Ahammed, K.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-923X10aCharacterization and impact assessment of super cyclonic storm AMPHAN in the Indian subcontinent through space borne observations  aTropical cyclones can cause extensive damage in coastal regions as a result of high winds, storm tide, and intense rainfall. The West Bengal state in India was severely affected by a recent cyclonic storm 'Amphan' a 'super cyclone'with a high wind speed of above 220 km/h. The present study aimed to assess the impact of the cyclone Amphan in the potential impact zone covering the two states of India (Odisha and West Bengal) and the west coast of Bangladesh. The present study analyzed the land use land cover, rainfall variability, and potential storm surge along the cyclone track to assess the possible impact on the coastal landscape as well as community. The cyclone Amphan was formed in the Northern Indian Ocean near Equatorial Easterly wave over south Andaman Sea and adjoiningsoutheast Bay of Bengal (BoB) at 10° N 87° E on 16 May 2020 as deep depression and moved toward the north direction and had land fall at the coast of West Bengal on 20 May 2020 as an extremely severe cyclonic storm with the wind speed 155 km/h and central pressure of 960hpa.The cyclone devastated the coastal districts of West Bengal due to the high intensity of precipitation along with the extreme storm surge. About 100 people lost their lives and ~20 million people severely affected in West Bengal alone. Within the West Bengal state, around 7877 sq km area was observed under the potential storm surge zone. Cropland was observed as the most surge affected land cover with 5191 sq km area (65.9%), followed by wetlands (1635.2 sq km (20.75%) along with 38.34 sq km (0.48%)) of built up land under the potential surge impact zone The cyclone more severely affected the west Medinapur and South 24 Parganas, which were also the most affected by COVID-19 which resulted in slow evacuation, delay in medical support and concomitant increase in loss of life. The present study provided near real time cyclone hazard and risk assessment to help in prioritization of coastal mitigation and planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3acropland 3aland cover 3aland use and land cover maps 3alandscapes 3apeople 3aprioritization 3arain 3arisk assessment 3awind speed 3aAndaman Sea 3aBangladesh 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia 3aIndian Ocean 0aTropical cyclone 0aAMPHAN 0aIndian ocean 0aGPM 0aLULC1 aPandey, A.

Previous studies have revealed a strongly clonal population structure that is shared between North America and Europe, while South American strains show greater genetic diversity and evidence of sexual recombination. The common inheritance of a monomorphic version of chromosome Ia (referred to as ChrIa*) among three clonal lineages from North America and Europe suggests that inheritance of this chromosome might underlie their recent clonal expansion. To further examine the diversity and distribution of ChrIa, we have analyzed additional strains with greater geographic diversity. Our findings reveal that the same haplotype of ChrIa* is found in the clonal lineages from North America and Europe and in older lineages in South America, where sexual recombination is more common. Although lineages from all three continents harbor the same conserved ChrIa* haplotype, strains from North America and Europe are genetically separate from those in South America, and these respective geographic regions show limited evidence of recent mixing. Genome-wide, array-based profiling of polymorphisms provided evidence for an ancestral flow from particular older southern lineages that gave rise to the clonal lineages now dominant in the north. Collectively, these data indicate that ChrIa* is widespread among nonclonal strains in South America and has more recently been associated with clonal expansion of specific lineages in North America and Europe. These findings have significant implications for the spread of genetic loci influencing transmission and virulence in pathogen populations. Understanding parasite population structure is important for evaluating the potential spread of pathogenicity determinants between different geographic regions. Examining the genetic makeup of different isolates of Toxoplasma gondii from around the world revealed that chromosome Ia is highly homogeneous among lineages that predominate on different continents and within genomes that were otherwise quite divergent. This pattern of recent shared ancestry is highly unusual and suggests that some gene(s) found on this chromosome imparts an unusual fitness advantage that has resulted in its recent spread. Although the basis for the conservation of this particularly homogeneous chromosome is unknown, it may have implications for the transmission of infection and spread of human disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aancestry 3aanimals 3adisease transmission 3agenes 3agenetic recombination 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahuman diseases 3aloci 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apopulation structure 3avirulence 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aMiller, Natalie1 aRoos, David S.1 aDubey, J.

Model Development and Validation  ap. 388-395.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aMost popular indices in use today that address agricultural drought [e.g., the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Crop Moisture Index (CMI)J do not consider specific crop responses to the drought event. Thus, values produced by indices such as the PDSI and CMI cannot be directly linked to drought impacts on crop production and yield since each crop responds differently to moisture and heat stress. This paper presents a new drought index that, unlike other drought indices, is specific to a single crop (corn—Zea mays L.) and takes into consideration water use during specific periods of growth. The Crop-Specific Drought Index (CSDI) model was developed with 8 yr of data from Nebraska's East Central Crop Reporting District (CRD), and validated with 10 yr of data from Nebraska's East Central CRD, 9 yr of data from Missouri's Northeast CRD, 8 yr of data from Wisconsin's South Central CRD, and 9 yr of data from Indiana's Central CRD. Plots of model predicted vs. actual CSDI values yielded coefficients of determination (r²) ranging from 0.32 (Central Indiana) to 0.76 (Northeast Missouri); D-index of agreement values ranging from 0.72 (Central Indiana) to 0.90 (South Central Wisconsin); and root mean square errors ranging from 7.7% (South Central Wisconsin) to 13.4% (Northeast Missouri). The CSDI model may provide an effective drought monitoring and assessment tool for the Corn Belt of the United States.

The simulations were run for a period of five years—between 2015 and 2020—with a horizontal resolution of 3 km, and were compared with data from 41 automatic surface stations for the onshore case. For the offshore case, data from a surface station located in the Abrolhos Archipelago were used. The winter period presents higher values of wind speed for the onshore region (9–14 m/s), and the northern and southwestern regions of the state stand out for the generation of wind energy. In the offshore case, spring presents the highest averages for wind speed (7–8 m/s), followed by the summer season, highlighting the maritime coast in the extreme south of the state (7–10 m/s). Furthermore, the nocturnal wind regime is more intense than the daytime one, indicating a great complementarity with solar energy. The year 2017 had the highest average values of wind speed in the region, being considered one of the warmest years without the influence of the El Nino phenomenon recorded globally since 1850. The hourly averages of onshore and offshore winds for the state of Bahia demonstrated the great wind potential of the region, with high and medium speeds at altitude, which were in accordance with the minimum attractiveness thresholds for investments in wind energy generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aaltitude 3acoasts 3aenergy 3asolar energy 3aspring 3asummer 3atropics 3aweather research and forecasting model 3awind power 3awind speed 3aBrazil 0aWRF model 0aOnshore and offshore 0aWind mapping 0aTropical climate 0aRenewable energy1 aSperandio Nascimento, Erick Giovani1 aBandeira Santos, Alex Alisson1 aMoreira, Davidson Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0902-52180 tEnergy.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 240 p.122491-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1224913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245015200171300001800323520106100341592002801402596009901430650001101529650002201540650001101562650001301573650001101586650001301597650001901610650002001629700006001649700005501709700002001764700001701784700002101801700002001822700005701842700002201899700002001921773012001941856008802061852000902149655001202158IND60786603220221120185226.0220804e20220719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c036972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Satyam10aGeneration and Regeneration of the C(sp³)–F Bond and 1,4-NADH/NADPH via Newly Designed S-gC₃N₄@Fe₂O₃/LC Photocatalysts under Solar Light  ap. 8402-8412.  aDue to the pharmaceutical, biological, physical, and chemical properties of fluorinated compounds and 1,4-NADH/NADPH, these species have attracted a lot of attention from researchers across the chemical society. Despite their crucial significance, present methods of regenerating cofactors (1,4-NADH/NADPH) as well as inserting fluorine into organic compounds suffer from ruthless drawbacks. Herein, we designed a highly efficient S-gC₃N₄@Fe₂O₃/LC photocatalyst, and its in situ generations were accomplished by calcinations of Fe₂O₃, melamine (M), thiophenol (T), and lignin carbon (LC). The Fe₂O₃ part performs similar to an additional light harvester, gifting utmost photo-generated electrons, whereas the carbon part bridges a “thoroughfare” to make easy electron transfer from Fe₂O₃ to S-gC₃N₄ (Schemes 1 and 2). Therefore, the newly designed S-gC₃N₄@Fe₂O₃/LC photocatalyst is more efficient for the generation and regeneration of the C(sp³)–F bond and 1,4-NADH/NADPH due to its surface active sites and defects.  aPublisher supplied data  a2022R1C1C1007517cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725 3acarbon 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afluorine 3alignin 3amelamine 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar radiation1 aYadav, Rajesh K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5320-52591 aKim, Tae Wu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6370-09071 aSingh, Chandani1 aSingh, Pooja1 aChaubey, Surabhi1 aSingh, Atul.

In this study, a hydrodynamic model of the Changjiang River plume was developed based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System, and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) were applied to the model simulations to analyze the horizontal transport characteristics of the river plume with the surface plume front, the tidal front, and the far‐field plume front in summer. The results show that the plume currents during the ebb tide were supercritical upstream of the near‐field surface plume front and tidal front and subcritical downstream of the fronts. In the LCSs results, transport barriers existing in the frontal regions indicated that the materials hardly crossed the fronts and tended to accumulate. The water parcels near the surface plume front and the tidal front in the near‐field entirely originated from the Changjiang River Estuary. The surface East China Sea shelf water could not influence the near‐field region due to the transport barrier formed by the far‐field plume front. Momentum balance analysis results reveal that the plume currents were in geostrophic balance around the near‐field fronts, rendering the flows mainly in the along‐front direction and significantly weakening the cross‐shore flows. These physical processes provided enough residence time of the plume water and growth time for phytoplankton in the frontal region and thus favored algal blooming with sufficient nutrients. Even though the frontal convergence induced by transport barriers also appeared near the far‐field plume front, insufficient supply of nutrients limited the phytoplankton growth.  aPublisher supplied data  a41861134040cNational Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC  a41530960cNational Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC  a41549903cNational Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC  aSL2020ZD204cShanghai Jiao Tong University 3aalgae 3acoastal ecosystems 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3ahydrologic models 3amomentum 3aphytoplankton 3aresearch 3ariver plume 3asummer 3aEast China Sea 3aYangtze River1 aZhang, Zhaoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6125-86601 aZhou, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0023-13031 aWang, Chuning1 aWu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3910-46621 aZhong, Yisen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0741-89630 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2022JC018541-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JC0185413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165300001600263520130800279592002801587650001601615650001101631650002401642650001601666650002001682650002401702650000901726650002101735650001801756650002301774650001101797650002001808650000901828650002001837650003401857650000901891650002001900651001101920653000801931653000901939653000801948653001101956653000801967653000801975653000801983653000901991653000802000653000902008653001002017653000902027653000802036653000702044653000702051653000802058653000902066653001102075653000802086653000902094653000802103653001002111653002502121653002902146653002402175653002302199653002502222653002102247700002802268700001902296700001702315773011102332856008202443852000902525655001202534IND60086587020221119031500.0190401e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008658702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Yung-Lin10aProbabilistic risk assessment of exposure to leucomalachite green residues from fish products  ap. 770-776.  aTo assess the potential risk of human exposure to carcinogenic leucomalachite green (LMG) due to fish consumption, the probabilistic risk assessment was conducted for adolescent, adult and senior adult consumers in Taiwan. The residues of LMG with the mean concentration of 13.378±20.56μgkg−1 (BFDA, 2009) in fish was converted into dose, considering fish intake reported for three consumer groups by NAHSIT (1993–1996) and body weight of an average individual of the group. The lifetime average and high 95th percentile dietary intakes of LMG from fish consumption for Taiwanese consumers were estimated at up to 0.0135 and 0.0451μgkg-bw−1day−1, respectively. Human equivalent dose (HED) of 2.875mgkg-bw−1day−1 obtained from a lower-bound benchmark dose (BMDL10) in mice by interspecies extrapolation was linearly extrapolated to oral cancer slope factor (CSF) of 0.035 (mgkg-bw−1day−1)−1 for humans. Although, the assumptions and methods are different, the results of lifetime cancer risk varying from 3×10–7 to 1.6×10–6 were comparable to those of margin of exposures (MOEs) varying from 410,000 to 4,800,000. In conclusions, Taiwanese fish consumers with the 95th percentile LADD of LMG have greater risk of liver cancer and need to an action of risk management in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadults 3aantibiotic residues 3abody weight 3acarcinogenicity 3aexposure assessment 3afish 3afish consumption 3afish products 3afood contamination 3ahumans 3aliver neoplasms 3amice 3amouth neoplasms 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3arisk management 3aTaiwan 0aAIC 0aBFDA 0aBMD 0aBMDL10 0aBMR 0aCSF 0aDNA 0aEFSA 0aHED 0aIPCS 0aJECFA 0aLADD 0aLMG 0aMC 0aMG 0aMOA 0aMOEs 0aNAHSIT 0aNTP 0aPDFs 0aPOD 0aUSEPA 0aLeucomalachite green 0aProbabilistic assessment 0aCancer slope factor 0aMargin of exposure 0aLifetime cancer risk 0aFish consumption1 aChimeddulam, Dalaijamts1 aSheen, Lee-Yan1 aWu, Kuen-Yuh0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Dec., v. 62 p.770-776dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015700170520187800327592002802205650002802233650001502261650002202276650002202298650002302320650003002343650002802373650001702401651001402418651002302432651001302455653002802468653002502496653000902521653001302530700001202543700001902555700002602574700002902600700001902629773010902648856008802757852000902845655001202854IND60727687720221123030127.0210506e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Zafar10aImplementation of a marine spatial planning approach in Pakistan: An analysis of the benefits of an integrated approach to coastal and marine management  aMany maritime countries have implemented the Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) approach in their respective regions to rationally exploit and conserve their biological and non-biological resources.

Therefore, this study outlines the considerations of the MSP approach to purse its progress in developed and developing countries that would help to establish a planning framework for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) coastal and marine areas of Pakistan. The newly launched CPEC project is expected to greatly contribute to the industrialization and urbanization of the coastal and marine areas of Pakistan. Therefore, various special economic zones have been established along the CPEC coastal and marine areas. However, marine environmental safety policies that govern the protection of these coastal and marine areas are either limited or completely missing. Therefore, this study evaluates the MSP approach through SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis in order to determine the extent to which its implementation supports the sustainable development along CPEC coastal and marine areas of Pakistan. The implementation of the MSP approach along the CPEC coastal and marine areas is also expected to induce a sustainable socio-economic development, and simultaneously improve available ecosystem services in the study areas. This study also provides a baseline for CPEC policy makers, planners and developers in the country to follow the MSP (social, economic and ecological) framework in order to minimize the conflicts amongst users and between users and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3aecosystems 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3amarine environment 3asocioeconomic development 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef 3aPakistan 0aMarine spatial planning 0aLearning experiences 0aCPEC 0aPakistan1 aWu, Wen1 aWang, Xiao Hua1 aPavase, Tushar Ramesh1 aHussain Shah, Syed Babar1 aPervez, Rashid0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 May 01, v. 205 p.105545-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245014100204300001800345500002000363520100400383592002801387596005601415596004901471596003401520650001501554650002801569650001401597650001301611650001601624650002001640700005801660700006001718700005801778700001901836700005701855773011801912856007402030852000902104655001202113IND60744890020221120122658.0210721e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074489002DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.156082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholson, Joshua M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1111-182810aMeasuring the quality of scientific references in Wikipedia: an analysis of more than 115M citations to over 800 000 scientific articles  ap. 4242-4248.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWikipedia is a widely used online reference work which cites hundreds of thousands of scientific articles across its entries.

The estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) is a characteristic feature, it occurs in the channel accompanying spring tide during the monsoon and pre-monsoon, and shifts to the bay on neap tide during post-monsoon. ETM remains at the same position in the Mandovi River, both during the monsoon and pre-monsoon, whereas in Zuari it stretched upstream during monsoon and migrates seaward of the channel during pre-monsoon. The ETM coincides with the freshwater–seawater interface during the monsoon and is formed by the interaction between tidal currents and river flows. The ETM during pre-monsoon is associated with high salinities and is generated by tidal and wind-induced currents. The turbidity maximum on neap tide during post-monsoon may be due to the erosion and resuspension of sediments from the emergent tidal flats and transport of these turbid waters into the bay. Funneling effect of the narrowing bay in the Zuari estuary and associated physical processes effectively enhance the magnitude of the currents and transports sediments to the channel. SPM retention percentage indicates that the estuarine channel is prone to siltation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3amonsoon season 3aparticulates 3arain 3arivers 3asalinity 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3atides 3aturbidity 3aIndia1 aShynu, R.1 aKessarkar, Pratima M.1 aSundar, D.1 aMichael, G.S.1 aNarvekar, Tanuja1 aBlossom, Viegas1 aMehra, Prakash0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 91, no. 1 p.78-86dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2010.10.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245012700198300001800325500002000343520186400363592002802227596002802255596003602283596002302319650001102342650001202353650002802365650000902393650001402402650002202416650001402438650001102452650001802463650000902481650001302490650001402503650002502517650002302542700002202565700005802587700002202645700006402667700001902731700002302750700006002773773012102833856007302954852000903027655001203036IND60750121120221118113814.0210910e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075012112DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.158292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThia, Joshua A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9084-095910aGenetic and phenotypic variation exhibit both predictable and stochastic patterns across an intertidal fish metapopulation  ap. 4392-4414.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInteractions among selection, gene flow, and drift affect the trajectory of adaptive evolution. In natural populations, the direction and magnitude of these processes can be variable across different spatial, temporal, or ontogenetic scales. Consequently, variability in evolutionary processes affects the predictability or stochasticity of microevolutionary outcomes. We studied an intertidal fish, Bathygobius cocosensis (Bleeker, 1854), to understand how space, time, and life stage structure genetic and phenotypic variation in a species with potentially extensive dispersal and a complex life cycle (larval dispersal preceding benthic recruitment). We sampled juvenile and adult life stages, at three sites, over three years. Genome‐wide SNPs uncovered a pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness, that is, weak‐but‐significant patchy spatial genetic structure that was variable through time and between life stages. Outlier locus analyses suggested that targets of spatially divergent selection were mostly temporally variable, though a significant number of spatial outlier loci were shared between life stages. Head shape, a putatively ecologically responsive (adaptive) phenotype in B. cocosensis also exhibited high temporal variability within sites. However, consistent spatial relationships between sites indicated that environmental similarities among sites may generate predictable phenotype distributions across space. Our study highlights the complex microevolutionary dynamics of marine systems, where consideration of multiple ecological dimensions can reveal both predictable and stochastic patterns in the distributions of genetic and phenotypic variation. Such considerations probably apply to species that possess short, complex life cycles, have large dispersal potential and fecundities, and that inhabit heterogeneous environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cHarman Slade Foundation  cEcological Society of Australia  cGoodman Foundation 3aadults 3aecology 3aevolutionary adaptation 3afish 3agene flow 3agenetic structure 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alittoral zone 3aloci 3aontogeny 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3atemporal variation1 aMcGuigan, Katrina1 aLiggins, Libby1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1143-23461 aFigueira, Will F.1 aBird, Christopher E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0228-33181 aMather, Andrew1 aEvans, Jennifer L.1 aRiginos, Cynthia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5485-41970 tMolecular ecology.g2021 Sept., v. 30, no. 18 p.4392-4414dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.158293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03959naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015200169300001500321520262100336592002802957650002102985650001403006650001403020650001103034650001303045650001403058650001503072650001603087650002203103650001503125650001303140650001703153651001803170651001803188700002703206700002003233700002103253700001603274773010903290856008203399990002303481852000903504655001203513IND60097634620221118223528.0141104e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009763462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2010.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGonigle, Chris10aDetection of deep water benthic macroalgae using image-based classification techniques on multibeam backscatter at Cashes Ledge, Gulf of Maine, USA  ap. 87-101.  aBenthic macroalgae form an important part of temperate marine ecosystems, exhibiting a complex three-dimensional character which represents a vital foraging and spawning ground for many juvenile fish species. In this research, image-based techniques for classification of multibeam backscatter are explored for the detection of benthic macroalgae at Cashes Ledge in the Gulf of Maine, USA. Two classifications were performed using QTC-Multiview, differentiated by application of a threshold filter, and macroalgal signatures were independently extracted from the raw sonar datagrams in Matlab. All classifications were validated by comparison with video ground-truth data. The unfiltered classification shows a high degree of complexity in the shallowest areas within the study site; the filtered demonstrates markedly less variation by depth. The unfiltered classification shows a positive agreement with the video ground-truth data; 82.6% of observations recording Laminaria sp., 39.1% of Agarum cribrosum and 100.0% (n = 3) of mixed macroalgae occur within the same acoustically distinct group of classes. These are discrete from the 8.1% recorded agreement with absences and nulls (>40 m) of macrophytes (n = 32) from a total of 86 ground-truth locations. The results of the water column data extraction (WCDE) show similar success, accurately predicting 78.3% of Laminaria sp. and 30.4% of A. cribrosum observations. The unfiltered classes which showed agreement with the ground-truth data were then compared to the WCDE results. Comparison of surface areas reveals the overall percentage agreement is relatively constant with depth (67.0–70.0%), with Kappa coefficient increasing from k = 0.17–0.35 as depth (and surface area) increases. The results have demonstrated that both methods were more effective at detecting the presence of Laminaria sp. (82.6–77.3%) than Agarum cribrosum, (66.6–30.4%), and that the efficiency of prediction decreased with depth. Canopy volume derived from the WCDE analysis was between 1.21 × 10⁶ m³ at <24 m water depth, 1.82 × 10⁶ m³ at <30 m and 2.45 × 10⁶ m³ at <40 m. These results suggest that the presence of benthic macrophytes has a significant capacity to affect image-based classification of acoustic data, and highlights the fact that multibeam backscatter and image-based classification have significant potential for benthic macroalgal research. This is beneficial to help refine segmentations of substrates, adding valuable contextual information about biological characteristics of infaunal and epifaunal benthic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgarum cribrosum 3aLaminaria 3aacoustics 3acanopy 3aforaging 3ajuveniles 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3amarine ecosystems 3aprediction 3aspawning 3asurface area 3aGulf of Maine 3aUnited States1 aGrabowski, Jonathan H.1 aBrown, Craig J.1 aWeber, Thomas C.1 aQuinn, Rory0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 91, no. 1 p.87-101dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2010.10.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013800166300001600304500001500320520119500335592002801530650002501558650001601583650001101599650002101610650001501631650001401646650001601660650001801676650001101694650002501705650001701730650001401747650003201761650002301793650001601816650001401832650002101846650001701867650001801884653002201902653001301924653001801937653001601955653002001971700001601991773011102007856008202118852000902200655001202209IND60086587220221119031347.0190401e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008658722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Pei-Feng10aEffect of a glycoprotein from mushroom Hypsizygus marmoreus (Peck) Bigelow on growth and differentiation of human leukemic U937 cells  ap. 782-785.  a2019-12-06  aA non-lectin glycoprotein (HM-3A) isolated from the basidioma of edible mushroom Hypsizygus marmoreus (Peck) Bigelow was shown to be inhibitory against the growth of human myeloid leukemia U937 cells in our previous research. The present study further investigated the mechanisms of inhibition and differentiation in an indirect model. Human mononuclear cells (MNC) were stimulated by HM-3A for 1, 2 and 3days to obtain the conditioned media (MNC-CM1, 2 and 3) that was effective in inhibiting the growth of U937 cells. The percentage of mature monocytes/macrophages among the cells and the total productivity of superoxide increased in the treatment and proved the differentiation-inducing effect of HM-3A-MNC-CM. The secretion of cytokines TNF-α, IL-2 and IFN-γ from the treated MNC were increased. Antibody neutralization tests of HM-3A-MNC-CM1 further showed that the growth inhibition effect of HM-3A can be attributed to the promotion in secretion of cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. We propose that HM-3A may stimulate human MNC to secrete cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α to inhibit the growth of U937 cells, and that HM-3A may be developed into an anti-leukemia ingredient in health food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypsizygus marmoreus 3abasidiomata 3ahumans 3ainterferon-gamma 3aantibodies 3amonocytes 3amacrophages 3ainterleukin-2 3amodels 3aneutralization tests 3ahuman growth 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3agrowth retardation 3aingredients 3amushrooms 3amyeloid leukemia 3ahealth foods 3aglycoproteins 0aGrowth inhibition 0aCytokine 0aLeukemic cell 0abasidiocarp 0aDifferentiation1 aMa, Chia-Yu0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Dec., v. 62 p.782-785dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245014100159300001800300520132800318592002801646650000801674650002001682650001101702650001701713650001501730650001301745650001301758650001601771650001001787650001401797650003101811650001001842650001101852650002601863650002201889650001001911650000801921650001301929650001801942650002001960651001001980653002101990653002202011653001202033653002602045653003202071700001202103700001402115700001602129700001302145700001802158700001702176700005402193773014702247856008002394852000902474655001202483IND60684913120221118051941.0200226e20200203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068491312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b082122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ping10aShading Effects on Leaf Color Conversion and Biosynthesis of the Major Secondary Metabolites in the Albino Tea Cultivar “Yujinxiang”  ap. 2528-2538.  aAlbino became a novel kind of tea cultivar in China recently. In this study, transcriptome and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) were employed to investigate the shading effects on leaf color conversion and biosynthesis of three major secondary metabolites in the albino tea cultivar “Yujinxiang”. The increased leaf chlorophyll level was likely the major cause for shaded leaf greening from young pale or yellow leaf. In comparison with the control, the total catechin level of the shading group was significantly decreased and the abundance of caffeine was markedly increased, while the theanine level was nearly not influenced. Meanwhile, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in some biological processes and pathways were identified by transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, whole-genome DNA methylation analysis revealed that the global genomic DNA methylation patterns of the shading period were remarkably altered in comparison with the control. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and the DMR-related DEG analysis indicated that the DMR-related DEGs were the critical participants in biosynthesis of the major secondary metabolites. These findings suggest that DNA methylation is probably responsible for changes in the contents of the major secondary metabolites in Yujinxiang.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aalbino 3abiosynthesis 3abisulfites 3acaffeine 3acatechin 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3acultivars 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence analysis 3ashade 3atea 3atheanine 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aChina 0aalbino tea plant 0aCamellia sinensis 0ashading 0aleaf color conversion 0amajor secondary metabolites1 aSu, Hui1 aJin, Rong1 aMao, Yuxiao1 aXu, Anan1 aCheng, Haiyan1 aWang, Yuefei1 aMeng, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7665-54150 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Feb. 03, v. 68, no. 8 p.2528-2538dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b082123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008600156520118000242592002801422650002001450650002901470650001901499650001501518650001501533650001001548650001501558651001101573700001801584700001701602700002101619700002201640700002401662700002201686700001801708700001601726700002001742700001701762773012801779856007501907852000901982655001201991IND60763569820221123021511.0220120e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356982DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140203512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Fang 13aAn Operational Analysis Ready Radar Backscatter Dataset for the African Continent  aDigital Earth Africa is now providing an operational Sentinel-1 normalized radar backscatter dataset for Africa. This is the first free and open continental scale analysis ready data of this kind that has been developed to be compliant with the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) specification for normalized radar backscatter (NRB) products. Partnership with Sinergise, a European geospatial company and Earth observation data provider, has ensured this dataset is produced efficiently in the cloud infrastructure and can be sustained in the long term. The workflow applies radiometric terrain correction (RTC) to the Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) product, using the Copernicus 30 m digital elevation model (DEM). The method is used to generate data for a range of sites around the world and has been validated as producing good results. This dataset over Africa is made available publicly as a AWS public dataset and can be accessed through the Digital Earth Africa platform and its Open Data Cube API. We expect this dataset to support a wide range of applications, including natural resource monitoring, agriculture, and land cover mapping across Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3ainfrastructure 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aradar 3aradiometry 3aAfrica1 aRepse, Marko 1 aLeith, Alex 1 aRosenqvist, Ake 1 aMilcinski, Grega 1 aMoghaddam, Negin F.1 aDhar, Tishampati 1 aBurton, Chad 1 aHall, Lisa 1 aJorand, Cedric 1 aLewis, Adam 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 14, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140203513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007000173520149800243592002801741650002801769650001501797650001701812650002201829700002601851773010901877856008801986852000902074655001202083IND60727688020221123035556.0210506e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbotoush, Reda13aAn authority for marine spatial planning (MSP): A systemic review  aDifferent challenges have been encountered in the implementation of MSP. Some of these challenges are attributed to the different governance approaches and structures, and the absence or lack of channels of communication between MSP agencies at the national and international level. In addition, there are differences between the practices of institutional systems. Recent studies have focused on the importance of addressing issues related to an authority for MSP. Nevertheless, there has been no comprehensive study that focused on addressing the governance and authority(agency) type over marine areas within the national jurisdiction. Although it has been argued that, as yet, there is no single solution or unique recipe for the successful implementation of MSP, this study was aimed at carrying out a systematic review of the literature concerning an MSP authority and its types and its related concepts. By doing so, it is believed that this study will be able to highlight the practices related to an MSP authority and its tools of governance, and the approaches for its implementation, ultimately highlighting the best practices that can be mainstreamed worldwide. In addition, recommendations will be introduced concerning the authority of the MSP that suits its transboundary nature. In conclusion, it is believed that the identification of a single authority (agency) type would serve as an administrative reference for all agencies and stakeholders nationally and internationally.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3agovernance 3astakeholders 3asystematic review1 aTan Shau-Hwai, Aileen0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 May 01, v. 205 p.105551-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1055513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245016800155300001800323520124300341592002801584650001401612650002301626650000901649650001201658650001101670650001801681650001401699650001601713700001801729700001601747700001601763700001301779700001701792700001801809700001701827700002101844700001601865700002001881700001901901773014701920856007602067852000902143655001202152IND60541840520170623000000.0160823e20160316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054184052DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b127302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aAtomically Precise Alkynyl-Protected Metal Nanoclusters as a Model Catalyst: Observation of Promoting Effect of Surface Ligands on Catalysis by Metal Nanoparticles  ap. 3278-3281.  aMetal nanoclusters whose surface ligands are removable while keeping their metal framework structures intact are an ideal system for investigating the influence of surface ligands on catalysis of metal nanoparticles. We report in this work an intermetallic nanocluster containing 62 metal atoms, Au₃₄Ag₂₈(PhC≡C)₃₄, and its use as a model catalyst to explore the importance of surface ligands in promoting catalysis. As revealed by single-crystal diffraction, the 62 metal atoms in the cluster are arranged as a four-concentric-shell Ag@Au₁₇@Ag₂₇@Au₁₇ structure. All phenylalkynyl (PA) ligands are linearly coordinated to the surface Au atoms with staple “PhC≡C–Au–C≡CPh” motif. Compared with reported thiolated metal nanoclusters, the surface PA ligands on Au₃₄Ag₂₈(PhC≡C)₃₄ are readily removed at relatively low temperatures, while the metal core remains intact. The clusters before and after removal of surface ligands are used as catalysts for the hydrolytic oxidation of organosilanes to silanols. It is, for the first time, demonstrated that the organic-capped metal nanoclusters work as active catalysts much better than those with surface ligands partially or completely removed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3aligands 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3atemperature1 aWan, Xian-Kai1 aRen, Liting1 aSu, Haifeng1 aLi, Gang1 aMalola, Sami1 aLin, Shuichao1 aTang, Zichao1 aHäkkinen, Hannu1 aTeo, Boon K1 aWang, Quan-Ming1 aZheng, Nanfeng0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Mar. 16, v. 138, no. 10 p.3278-3281dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5b127303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245015300215300001800368520197800386592002802364596014002392596011102532650001102643650002902654650001502683650001502698650000902713650002002722650001302742650001102755650002002766650001602786650002102802650001602823700001802839700006402857773012002921856008803041852000903129655001203138IND60786603720221120185149.0220804e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehera, Uma Sankar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1388-040110aPore-Scale Investigation and Performance Evaluation of SMART LowSal Flooding for Enhanced Oil Recovery from Matured Reservoirs Using a Lab-on-a-Chip  ap. 8115-8127.  aOil recovery from a matured oilfield is challenging due to the low recovery factor. These challenges became opportunities for existing low-salinity water (LSW)-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. The performance of the LSW in recovering the residual oil from a matured oilfield is improved with the help of additives, viz., surfactant, water-soluble polymer, and silica nanoparticles (NPs). In the present study, series of experiments have been carried out to understand the pore-scale oil displacement phenomena of the novel nanofluids (SMART LowSal) using a microfluidic chip (lab-on-a-chip) integrated with an inverted microscope. The microfluidic chip is saturated with oil and is flooded with different nanofluids (NFs) to recover oil. The efficacy of oil displacement is evaluated using two unique methods (series and parallel). The oil displacement efficacy from the chip matrix, the interaction between rock–oil–nanofluid, and wettability alteration of the rock representative surface have been visually investigated. The oil displacement results are compared with the oil recovery results from the sand-pack reactor and Amott cell. Oil displacement was found to increase with increasing concentration of nanoparticles in NFs and slightly decreases beyond 1000 ppm of NPs. Visual observation clarified the complex interaction of rock–oil–nanofluid systems. A significant reduction in the interfacial tension of the fluid–fluid phase in the presence of surfactant leads to elongation of the oil globules and higher oil recovery. A thin layer of a film of water is noticed between the grain and the fluid phase, which could be the reason for the wettability alteration and improved oil recovery. The lab-on-a-chip method adopted for evaluating the efficacy of oil recovery due to the various nanofluids could help better understand the displacement phenomena and screening of additives for the best formulation of injection fluid for EOR application.  aPublisher supplied data  aEMR/2016/005360cDepartment of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Indiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001409  aRF/21-22/0989/OE/RFIR/008450cIndian Institute of Technology Madrasdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003845 3aenergy 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3ananofluids 3aoil fields 3aoils 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apolymers 3asilica 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3awater solubility 3awettability1 aKumar, Ganesh1 aSangwai, Jitendra S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8931-04830 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 13, v. 36, no. 15 p.8115-8127dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c010093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245014700202300001600349500002000365520059800385592002800983596007601011650001101087650001201098650002201110650002101132650001801153650001401171650001401185650001001199650001401209650001201223650000901235650001301244650001201257650001301269700005901282700006701341773014101408856007901549852000901628655001201637IND60744887020221122232954.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488702DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.127982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGünay, Emine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7170-739112aA comparative study of amino acid, mineral and vitamin profiles of milk from Turkish Saanen, Hair and Maltese goat breeds throughout lactation  ap. 441-452.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to evaluate the changes in nutritional compounds such as amino acids, minerals, and vitamins in the milk of Turkish Saanen, Hair and Maltese goat breeds.

Results show the power generation sector reduces output levels by 14%–42% across various countries if households 100% self-supply. Coal mining sectors are adversely affected in numerous countries with contractions of 9%–28% ($6,086-$18,935 million) in the United States and 4%–13% ($2,505–$8,143 million) in Australia. Improved outcomes for the world environment are found with reductions of CO₂e emission levels of 2.24%–7.38% (or 924–3,042 MtCO₂ equivalent). The agriculture and food-processing sectors expand significantly in many countries but also cause major increases in land prices, particularly in land-scarce countries in Middle East, Europe, Japan, and Taiwan. Results also show the security of food and energy supply are improved along with environmental gains from lower emission levels.

The estimated northward time‐mean Benguela Current absolute geostrophic transport is 24 Sv, with a temporal standard deviation of 17 Sv. Beneath this current the time‐mean transport is southward, indicating the presence of a deep‐EBC (DEBC), with a time‐mean transport of 12 Sv, and a standard deviation of 17 Sv. Offshore of these currents, the shallow and deep flows are more variable with weak time means, likely influenced by Agulhas Rings transiting through the region. Hydrographic data collected along the CPIES line demonstrate that the DEBC is carrying recently ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water, as it flows along the continental slope. This is consistent with a previously hypothesized interior pathway bringing recently ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water from the Deep Western Boundary Current across the Atlantic to the Cape Basin. The observations further indicate that much of the DEBC must recirculate within the basin. Spectral analyses of the shallow and deep EBC transport time series demonstrate that the strongest variability occurs on timescales ranging from 30 to 90 days, associated with the propagation of Agulhas Rings.  aPublisher supplied data  a633211cEuropean Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme  a11‐ANR‐56‐004cSAMOC Research Project  a100007298cNOAA's Ocean Observing and Monitoring Division  aNNX14AH60GcNASA  aNA13OAR4310131cNOAA Climate Variability Program  aGC16‐212cNOAA Climate Variability Program  aNA10OAR4320143cCooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) 3abasins 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3astandard deviation 3atime series analysis1 aPerez, Renellys C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4401-38531 aSpeich, Sabrina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5452-82871 aMeinen, Christopher S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8846-60021 aLamont, Tarron1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8464-891X1 aLe Hénaff, Matthieu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5548-25431 avan den Berg, Marcel A.1 aMajumder, Sudip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0431-21891 aAnsorge, Isabelle J.1 aDong, Shenfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8247-80721 aSchmid, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-47361 aTerre, Thierry1 aGarzoli, Silvia L.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 Mar., v. 124, no. 3 p.1634-1659dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC0145543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245012100168300001600289500002000305520075000325592002801075596006301103650001701166650001201183650001001195650002401205650002101229650001301250650000901263650001901272650002501291650001701316650002501333700005701358700001901415700002201434700002401456700006001480700006301540773014101603856007901744852000901823655001201832IND60744887120221123005229.0210721e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074488712DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.127972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuralnick, Jacob R10aPilot‐scale production and physicochemical characterisation of spray‐dried nanoparticulated whey protein powders  ap. 581-591.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpray‐dried whey protein isolate (WPI) powders were prepared at pilot‐scale from solutions without heat (WPIUH), heated (WPIH) or heated with calcium (WPIHCₐ), which were analysed and compared with a control sample (WPIC).

This study used intensive evaluation technology for industrial land in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei to evaluate Tianjin and Hebei development zones, and took the Dingzhou Economic Development Zone as an example to evaluate and analyze the intensive use of enterprise land; it suggests the influencing factors for the intensive use of development zones and the measures that can take advantage of the potential of enterprise stock land so as to provide a basis for the rationale behind upgrading industrial land structures and the efficient use of industrial land in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. The results show that the typical enterprise land use in the typical economic development zone is extensive, which suggests that the intensive use of land in the Dingzhou economic development zone is low and that there is still potential for land redevelopment. According to the classification system developed for available land, there is ample opportunity for land-use redevelopment in the development zone, especially in the area of approved but not supplied land and extended enterprise land. Therefore, the redevelopment of enterprise land could also provide a better land guarantee for industrial transfer projects in the equipment manufacturing industry. This study also offers strategies to redevelop available industrial land.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aeconomic development 3aequipment 3aindustrial sites 3aland use 3aChina1 aLi, Shaoxing 1 aSun, Dongqi 1 aLi, Chenxi 1 aWu, Jiahui 0 tLand.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110304323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245009600176520155100272592002801823650002801851650002601879650002501905650001701930650002201947650001601969650001201985650002201997650002402019650003202043650002002075650001902095650001902114650001202133650001302145650001502158650001502173650002002188650001702208700002002225700002702245700001902272773012002291856007902411852000902490655001202499IND60763566820221120051248.0220120e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356682DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110202212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmnan, Muhammad Asyraf Mohd10aDrought Stress Induces Morpho-Physiological and Proteome Changes of Pandanus amaryllifolius  aDrought is one of the significant threats to the agricultural sector. However, there is limited knowledge on plant response to drought stress and post-drought recovery. Pandanus amaryllifolius, a moderate drought-tolerant plant, is well-known for its ability to survive in low-level soil moisture conditions. Understanding the molecular regulation of drought stress signaling in this plant could help guide the rational design of crop plants to counter this environmental challenge. This study aimed to determine the morpho-physiological, biochemical, and protein changes of P. amaryllifolius in response to drought stress and during recovery. Drought significantly reduced the leaf relative water content and chlorophyll content of P. amaryllifolius. In contrast, relative electrolyte leakage, proline and malondialdehyde contents, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the drought-treated and recovered samples were relatively higher than the well-watered sample. The protein changes between drought-stressed, well-watered, and recovered plants were evaluated using tandem mass tags (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics. Of the 1415 differentially abundant proteins, 74 were significantly altered. The majority of proteins differing between them were related to carbon metabolism, photosynthesis, stress response, and antioxidant activity. This is the first study that reports the protein changes in response to drought stress in Pandanus. The data generated provide an insight into the drought-responsive mechanisms in P. amaryllifolius.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPandanus amaryllifolius 3aagricultural industry 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon metabolism 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aleaf relative water content 3amalondialdehyde 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant response 3aproline 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asoil water 3astress response 3awater stress1 aAizat, Wan Mohd1 aKhaidizar, Fiqri Dizar1 aTan, Boon Chin0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110202213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008500168500001900253520135100272592002801623650002401651650002301675650002301698650001301721650001601734650001301750700002001763700002901783700002301812700002101835700002101856700002601877700002101903700002101924700002101945700002501966773012101991856007902112852000902191655001202200IND60732031320221119235130.0210326e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073203132DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100302142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranata, Vincenza 10aLymphadenopathy after BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine: Preliminary Ultrasound Findings  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring a spontaneous and autonomous study, we assessed the ultrasound finding of lymphadenopathy after BNT162b2 Pfizer vaccine. We enrolled 18 patients with 58 lymphadenopathies: in 10 patients, they were in the laterocervical side, while in 8 patients in the axillar site. The largest diameter was 16 mm with a range from 7 to 16 mm (median value = 10 mm). In the same patient, we found different ultrasound nodal findings. A total of 25 nodes showed eccentric cortical thickening with wide echogenic hilum and oval shape. In total, 19 nodes showed asymmetric eccentric cortical thickening with wide echogenic hilum and oval shape. Overall, 10 nodes showed concentric cortical thickening with reduction in the width of the echogenic hilum and oval shape. A total of four nodes showed huge reduction and displacement of the echogenic hilum and round or oval shape. No anomaly was found at the Doppler echocolor study. In conclusion, eccentric cortical thickening with wide echogenic hilum and oval shape, asymmetric eccentric cortical thickening with wide echogenic hilum and oval shape, concentric cortical thickening with reduction in the width of the echogenic hilum and oval shape, and a huge reduction and displacement of the echogenic hilum and round shape are the features that we found in post BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine lymphadenopathies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiological Sciences 3aCOVID-19 infection 3alymphatic diseases 3apatients 3aultrasonics 3avaccines1 aFusco, Roberta 1 aSetola, Sergio  Venanzio1 aGaldiero, Roberta 1 aPicone, Carmine 1 aIzzo, Francesco 1 aD’Aniello, Roberta 1 aMiele, Vittorio 1 aGrassi, Roberta 1 aGrassi, Roberto 1 aPetrillo, Antonella 0 tBiology.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100302143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010300173300001400276520192200290592002802212650000802240650001802248650002002266650001102286650001202297650001702309650001802326650001402344650002102358650001002379650001502389650001802404650001802422650001902440650001202459653000702471653000802478653000702486653000702493653000702500653000802507653000702515653000702522653000702529653000802536653000702544653000702551653000802558653000802566653000702574653000702581653001902588653002502607653002802632653001802660653003402678700001802712700002002730700002102750700001902771700002002790700002302810773008702833856008402920852000903004655001203013IND60097631820221118223648.0160901e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009763182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2013.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanos, Jennifer K.10aSynoptic weather typing applied to air pollution mortality among the elderly in 10 Canadian cities  ap. 66-75.  aSynoptic circulation patterns (large-scale weather systems) affect ambient levels of air pollution, as well as the relationship between air pollution and human health.To investigate the air pollution–mortality relationship within weather types and seasons, and to determine which combination of atmospheric conditions may pose increased health threats in the elderly age categories.The relative risk of mortality (RR) due to air pollution was examined using Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs) within specific weather types. Analysis was completed by weather type and age group (all ages, ≤64, 65–74, 75–84, ≥85 years) in ten Canadian cities from 1981 to 1999.There was significant modification of RR by weather type and age. When examining the entire population, weather type was shown to have the greatest modifying effect on the risk of dying due to ozone (O3). This effect was highest on average for the dry tropical (DT) weather type, with the all-age RR of mortality at a population weighted mean (PWM) found to be 1.055 (95% CI 1.026–1.085). All-weather type risk estimates increased with age due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). On average, RR increased by 2.6, 3.8 and 1.5% for the respective pollutants between the ≤64 and ≥85 age categories. Conversely, mean ozone estimates remained relatively consistent with age. Elevated levels of air pollution were found to be detrimental to the health of elderly individuals for all weather types. However, the entire population was negatively effected by air pollution on the hot dry (DT) and hot humid (MT) days.We identified a significant modification of RR for mortality due to air pollution by age, which is enhanced under specific weather types. Efforts should be targeted at minimizing pollutant exposure to the elderly and/or all age groups with respect to weather type in question.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarbon monoxide 3acities 3aelderly 3ahuman health 3alinear models 3amortality 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3apollutants 3arelative risk 3arisk estimate 3asulfur dioxide 3aweather 0aCO 0aAIC 0aDM 0aDP 0aDT 0aGLM 0aMM 0aMP 0aMT 0aNO2 0aO3 0aPM 0aPWM 0aSO2 0aTR 0aRR 0aAir pollutants 0aAcute health effects 0aRelative mortality risk 0aWeather types 0aSynoptic scale classification1 aCakmak, Sabit1 aBristow, Corben1 aBrion, Vladislav1 aTremblay, Neil1 aMartin, Sara L.1 aSheridan, Scott S.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2013 Oct., v. 126 p.66-75dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245017100202500002000373520174100393592002802134596008802162596006902250596001402319596002702333650001502360650001502375650001302390650001102403650001902414650002402433650001302457650001202470650001302482650001102495651001802506651001502524700007102539700002102610700005802631700006302689700002502752773013602777856007702913852000902990655001202999IND60791719320221119211802.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079171932DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0182152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzett, Robert W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3289-633410aImpact of Vertical Mixing on Summertime Net Community Production in Canadian Arctic and Subarctic Waters: Insights From In Situ Measurements and Numerical Simulations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present ΔO₂/Ar‐based estimates of mixed layer net community production (NCP) from three summer cruises in the North American Arctic and Subarctic oceans. Coupling shipboard underway and discrete observations with output from an ocean circulation model, we correct the NCP estimates for vertical mixing fluxes impacting the surface O₂ budget. Large positive mixing fluxes, exceeding 100 mmol O₂ m⁻² d⁻¹, were derived in regions of strong wind‐driven mixing, such as the Labrador Sea (LS), and in the physically‐dynamic Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In contrast, flux corrections were small (<10 mmol O₂ m⁻² d⁻¹, on average) in the density‐stratified Baffin Bay, where mixing was low, and parts of the well‐mixed Hudson Strait (HS), where vertical O₂ gradients were weak. The distribution of corrected NCP was highly heterogenous across the study region, reflecting varying contributions of nutrient supply, freshwater input and sea ice dynamics. Elevated NCP was apparent in the LS, HS, and nearshore regions influenced by glacial meltwater and recent ice retreat. Low NCP and localized net heterotrophy occurred in Baffin Bay, and near strong freshwater and organic matter sources in Hudson Bay and the Queen Maud Gulf. A multiple linear regression model developed using available oceanographic data explained ∼58% of the observed NCP variability. Our work demonstrates the spatially explicit influence of vertical mixing on ΔO₂/Ar‐based NCP calculations across varied hydrographic conditions, and presents a novel approach to account for this process. This study contributes new knowledge of biological productivity distributions in under‐sampled, rapidly changing, high‐latitude waters.  aPublisher supplied data  cGouvernement du Canada Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada)  cMarine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network  cArcticNet  cPolar Knowledge Canada 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3alatitude 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3asea ice 3asnowmelt 3asummer 3aArctic region 3aHudson Bay1 aCastro de la Guardia, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3845-90901 aChanona, Melanie1 aMyers, Paul G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-26541 aWaterman, Stephanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5797-10921 aTortell, Philippe D.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Aug., v. 127, no. 8 p.e2021JC018215-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0182153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010600207300001800313520145000331592002801781650001701809650000801826650001401834650002101848650002301869650001101892650001501903650002101918650001501939650001701954650002201971650001901993650001102012650002202023650001302045653002002058653001802078653001402096653001102110700002002121700002002141700001502161700001702176700001202193700001102205700002002216700005402236773014302290856008502433852000902518655001202527IND60696457620221121025345.0200526e20200511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069645762DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b077142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiujing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9141-835110aSynthesis of ZIF-Derived CoS₂ Nanocages Interconnected by CNTs for Rechargeable Li–O₂ Batteries  ap. 7581-7587.  aLithium–oxygen (Li–O₂) batteries, profiting by their super high theoretical energy density and oxygen-breathing electrodes, have attracted extensive concern. The synthesis of the electrode materials with high conductivity and promising cycling durability will be a critical aspect for Li–O₂ batteries. In this article, a hybrid composite of CoS₂ nanocages derived from ZIF-67 and interconnected by carbon nanotubes (CoS₂/CNTs) is prepared and used in the air electrode fabrication for Li–O₂ batteries. A reversible capacity of 2398.9 mAh g–¹ is obtained, equivalent to 90% of the discharge capacity. When restricting the cycling capacity to 500 mAh g–¹, the battery exhibits cycling stability for 52 cycles, with the cutoff potential keeping above 2.0 V. The key point of this material is the formation of porous CoS₂ nanocages and insertion of the nanocages with CNTs, forming interconnected electrically conducting networks. The incorporation of CNTs serves as channels for fast electron transfer, which overcomes the poor conductivity of CoS₂. Furthermore, the porous CoS₂ nanocages could provide affluent active sites for an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which also facilitates the diffusion of O₂ and the infiltration of electrolytes. The combination of highly conductive CNTs and CoS₂ with efficient catalytic activity renders improvement in the battery performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aair 3abatteries 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy density 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3asulfides 0aLi−O2 battery 0aAir electrode 0aCoS2/CNTs 0aZIF-671 aZhang, Tingting1 aChu, Chengcheng1 aLi, Zhuang1 aLiu, Ruiqing1 aLi, Pan1 aLi, Yi1 aHuang, Zhendong1 aMa, Yanwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0043-11560 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 May 11, v. 8, no. 20 p.7581-7587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b077143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009700164520131500261592002801576650002601604650001401630650000901644650001001653650001201663650001501675650001001690650001201700773012001712856007901832852000901911655001201920IND60763567020221119202009.0220120e20220106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076356702DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110201512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebedev, Vadim 10aStability of Transgene Inheritance in Progeny of Field-Grown Pear Trees over a 7-Year Period  aBreeding woody plants is a very time-consuming process, and genetic engineering tools have been used to shorten the juvenile phase. In addition, transgenic trees for commercial cultivation can also be used in classical breeding, but the segregation of transgenes in the progeny of perennial plants, as well as the possible appearance of unintended changes, have been poorly investigated. We studied the inheritance of the uidA gene in the progeny of field-grown transgenic pear trees for 7 years and the physical and physiological parameters of transgenic seeds. A total of 13 transgenic lines were analyzed, and the uidA gene segregated 1:1 in the progeny of 9 lines and 3:1 in the progeny of 4 lines, which is consistent with Mendelian inheritance for one and two transgene loci, respectively. Rare and random deviations from the Mendelian ratio were observed only for lines with one locus. Transgenic seeds’ mass, size, and shape varied slightly, despite significant fluctuations in weather conditions during cultivation. Expression of the uidA gene in the progeny was stable. Our study showed that the transgene inheritance in the progeny of pear trees under field conditions occurs according to Mendelian ratio, does not depend on the environment, and the seed vigor of transgenic seeds does not change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMendelian inheritance 3ajuveniles 3aloci 3apears 3aprogeny 3atransgenes 3avigor 3aweather0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110201513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015200168520108800320592002801408650002201436650001301458650001801471650001301489650001301502650002101515650001401536650003301550650001501583650001101598650001401609650001501623650001601638650002101654653001701675653002201692653001401714653001401728653001401742653001601756700001801772700001501790700001601805700005601821773010601877856008701983852000902070655001202079IND60727685320221120095945.0220326e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072768532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Yanjun10aProducts distribution and interaction mechanism during co-pyrolysis of rice husk and oily sludge by experiments and reaction force field simulation  aIn this work, the co-pyrolysis behavior of rice husk (RH) and oily sludge (OS) was investigated by combining experiments and simulation. The thermogravimetric-derivative thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) and Reaction force field (ReaxFF MD) results indicate that synergetic effects exist in co-pyrolysis. Compared with the single component pyrolysis, the activation energy of RH and OS in co-pyrolysis was decreased by 15.97% and 17.14% shown by kinetic analysis, respectively. The Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PY-GC/MS) experiments, and simulation products analysis reveal that more bio-oil and molecules with low molecular weight were produced during the co-pyrolysis process. The synergetic effect mechanism was studied by detecting the variation of free radical intermediates. The results show that hydroxyl radicals from RH pyrolysis reduced cracking temperature of OS, and the hydrogen radicals from OS pyrolysis increased the degree of ring-splitting of RH. The study explores an approach to identify the synergetic effect and reveal the mechanism of co-pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abiofuels 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen 3akinetics 3amolecular weight 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis gas chromatography 3arice hulls 3asludge 3asynergism 3atechnology 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aCo-pyrolysis 0aSynergetic effect 0aMechanism 0aReaxFF MD 0aRice husk 0aOily sludge1 aXie, Yingshen1 aJiang, Chi1 aLi, Wenxuan1 aHou, Yingfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4877-45770 tBioresource technology.g2021 June, v. 329 p.124822-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010100157300001400258500002000272520117900292592002801471596004101499650000801540650001501548650001001563650001801573650001101591650001501602650001801617650001301635650001101648650002001659650002001679651001101699700004001710700002201750700002101772700002601793700006201819773014201881856007402023852000902097655001202106IND60786600620221120185211.0220804e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078660062DNAL7 a10.1002/awwa.10422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRa, Kyungyeon10aCritical Review: Surface Water and Stormwater Quality Impacts of Cured‐In‐Place Pipe Repairs  ap. 15-32.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCured‐in‐place pipe (CIPP) technology has been used to rehabilitate sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and drinking water pipes. However, utilities, regulators, and health officials have raised environmental, occupational, and public health concerns regarding chemical emissions into air and water. To better understand emissions into water, available literature was reviewed. Water contamination has been documented in 10 states and Canada because of the release of uncured resin, solvents, manufacturing byproducts, and wastes during and after construction. Odor, fish kill, and drinking water contamination incidents have been reported. The few field‐ and bench‐scale studies available show that a variety of volatile organic compounds and semivolatile organic compounds have been released into water and contamination was detected for several months. CIPP waste was acutely toxic to aquatic organisms. Chemical release is likely influenced by formulation, installation, and environmental conditions. CIPP installation and inspection recommendations were suggested. Studies are needed to develop evidence‐based construction and monitoring practices to minimize risks.  aPublisher supplied data  a1399cFederal Highway Administration 3aair 3afish kills 3aodors 3apublic health 3astorms 3astormwater 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3awastes 3awater pollution 3awater utilities 3aCanada1 aTeimouri Sendesi, Seyedeh Mahboobeh1 aHowarter, John A.1 aJafvert, Chad T.1 aDonaldson, Bridget M.1 aWhelton, Andrew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5934-30810 tJournal of the American Water Works Association.g2018 May, v. 110, no. 5 p.15-32dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27674x0003-150X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/awwa.10423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245003400175300001800209520102700227592002801254650003001282650002501312650001501337650002801352650000901380650001101389650001301400651001101413651000901424651001301433651001201446651001801458700002201476773012701498856007901625852000901704655001201713IND60300829820221120075320.0150703e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030082982DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12333182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorsteinsdóttir, Halla,10aTackling Meningitis in Africa  ap. 1546-1547.  aThe United States is currently in the midst of a meningitis outbreak (with at least 36 deaths) as the result of fungal contamination of steroid injections to relieve back pain (1). In Africa's so-called “meningitis belt,” outbreaks of meningitis are a regular occurrence, killing thousands and infecting tens of thousands each year. In 2009, about 5300 people died of meningitis and 88,000 were infected with the disease (2). The meningitis belt stretches from Senegal in the West to Ethiopia in the East and includes around 300 million people. Sanofi Pasteur had provided Africa with a meningitis vaccine for decades but because of reduced supplies in 2006 and 2007, and a threat of increased incidences of the disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) made a call for additional vaccine providers (3).

The new qRT-PCR assay targeting the S segment (NSs and N gene) was tested on synthesized standard RNA and MP-12 strain viruses. The detection limit of the new qRT-PCR assay is 1 copy/μL of NSs and N, and is able to differentiate the Smithburn vaccine strain of RVF from the Clone 13 vaccine strain. No cross-reactivity with other vector-borne viruses was observed, a factor that is especially important in the Republic of Korea (ROK). To examine the performance of the qRT-PCR, intra- and inter-assay variability data were analyzed and showed high reproducibility. These results indicate that the new qRT-PCR can be used as a safe and cost-effective test. Furthermore, this result suggests the possibility of differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals diagnostic test in RVF-free countries including ROK.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRift Valley fever 3aRift Valley fever phlebovirus 3aanimals 3acost effectiveness 3across reaction 3adata analysis 3adetection limit 3agenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aSouth Korea 0aqRT-PCR 0aClone 13 0aDIVA 0aRepublic of Korea1 aLyoo, Hye-Rhyoung1 aChoi, Jeong-Soo1 aLee, Yoon-Hee1 aKim, Byoung-Han1 aYoo, Han Sang0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2019 Feb. 1, v. 19, no. 2 p.121-127dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2018.23423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01682naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300001400270520053000284592002800814650001700842650001300859650002300872650002600895650002200921650002100943650001200964650001000976650001200986650001400998700001801012700002001030700001601050700001901066773012801085856007401213852000901287655001201296IND60660780120221118185738.0190827e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066078012DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08218d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Honghan10aFunctionalization of robust Zr(iv)-based metal–organic framework films via a postsynthetic ligand exchange  ap. 66-69.  aA facile and efficient fabrication approach for homogeneous, crack-free UiO-66 films with exceptionally high crystallinity and tunable thickness on a transparent and conductive glass substrate is reported.

The doping ratios and annealing temperatures were optimized by testing photodegradation of the products to methyl orange. To improve the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas of the catalyst, PEG was grafted to the structure of precursor polymer, by which an increase of 55% in BET surface areas and 20% in the photodegradation efficiencies was achieved. The crystalline phase was measured by X-ray diffraction and structural parameters were calculated by Xpert Highscores. FESEM and HRTEM pictures showed that the average particle size of the nitrogen doped and PEG modified catalyst reached to only 5 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that nitrogen dope mode was interstitial. Using quartz fabrics as substrate, the loaded catalysts were facilely recycled and reused by 15 times without decay in photodegradation efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aannealing 3acatalysts 3afabrics 3aliquids 3amethyl orange 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aphotolysis 3apolymers 3aquartz 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater1 aYe, Li1 aZhang, Tuzi1 aZhou, Heng1 aZhao, Tong0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 07, v. 7, no. 25 p.15265-15271dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra27187a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245010400185300001600289520138200305592002801687650001701715650001301732650002001745650001301765650001601778650001201794650002601806650001001832650001501842650001501857650001201872650002101884650002901905650001201934653001601946653001501962653001701977653001301994653002702007700002602034700002902060700002402089700002002113700002202133773011102155856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60591527220221116224135.0180320e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059152722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Bianchi A. Cruz, Michelle10aMoxidectin residues in lamb tissues: Development and validation of analytical method by UHPLC-MS/MS  ap. 390-396.  aThe development and validation of a throughput method for the quantitation of moxidectin residues in lamb target tissues (muscle, kidney, liver and fat) was conducted using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). To achieve higher recovery of the analyte from the matrices, a modified QuEChERS method was used for sample preparation. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 RRHD column with a mobile phase comprising 5mM ammonium formate solution +0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile +0.1% formic acid (B) in a linear gradient program. Method validation was performed based on the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and VICH GL49. To quantify the analyte, matrix-matched analytical curves were constructed with spiked blank tissues, with a limit of quantitation of 5ngg⁻¹ and limit of detection of 1.5ngg⁻¹ for all matrices. The linearity, decision limit, detection capability accuracy, and inter- and intra-day repeatability of the method are reported. The method was successfully applied to incurred lamb tissue samples (muscle, liver, kidney and fat) in a concentration range from 5 to 200μgkg⁻¹, which demonstrated its suitability for monitoring moxidectin residues in lamb tissues in health surveillance programs, as well as for pharmacokinetics and residue depletion studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium 3adetection limit 3aformates 3aformic acid 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amonitoring 3amoxidectin 3amuscles 3apharmacokinetics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissues 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aMoxidectin 0aLamb tissues 0aQuEChERS 0aResidues determination1 aFernandes, Maria A.M.1 ade C.

Despite substantial efforts, no clinically applicable strategy has yet been developed to effectively treat KRAS-mutant tumors. Here, we perform a cell-line-based screen and identify strong synergistic interactions between cell-cycle checkpoint-abrogating Chk1- and MK2 inhibitors, specifically in KRAS- and BRAF-driven cells. Mechanistically, we show that KRAS-mutant cancer displays intrinsic genotoxic stress, leading to tonic Chk1- and MK2 activity. We demonstrate that simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition leads to mitotic catastrophe in KRAS-mutant cells. This actionable synergistic interaction is validated using xenograft models, as well as distinct Kras- or Braf-driven autochthonous murine cancer models. Lastly, we show that combined checkpoint inhibition induces apoptotic cell death in KRAS- or BRAF-mutant tumor cells directly isolated from patients. These results strongly recommend simultaneous Chk1- and MK2 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of KRAS- or BRAF-driven cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3amice 3amitosis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3apatients 3asynergism1 aKalb, Bastian1 aJokic, Mladen1 aNoll, Elisa M.1 aStrong, Alexander1 aTharun, Lars1 aOzretić, Luka1 aKünstlinger, Helen1 aKambartel, Kato1 aRanderath, Winfried J.,1 aJüngst, Christian1 aSchmitt, Anna1 aTorgovnick, Alessandro1 aRichters, André1 aRauh, Daniel1 aSiedek, Florian1 aPersigehl, Thorsten1 aMauch, Cornelia1 aBartkova, Jirina1 aBradley, Allan1 aSprick, Martin R.1 aTrumpp, Andreas1 aRad, Roland1 aSaur, Dieter1 aBartek, Jiri1 aWolf, Jürgen1 aBüttner, Reinhard1 aThomas, Roman K.1 aReinhardt, H. Christian0 tCell.g2015 July 02, v. 162 p.146-159dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01334naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300001800270520031600288592002800604650001100632650001400643650001800657650002300675650003400698700001200732700001600744700001900760700001400779773013200793856007400925852000900999655001201008IND60660780220221118185726.0190827e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066078022DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08220f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zhiqiang14aThe disodium salt of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone as anode material for rechargeable sodium ion batteries  ap. 1446-1448.  aThe disodium salt of 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone has been prepared and proposed as anode material for rechargeable sodium ion batteries for the first time, showing an average operation voltage of ∼1.2 V, a reversible capacity of ∼265 mA h g⁻¹, a long cycle life (300 cycles), and high rate capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3abenzoquinones 3achemical reactions 3aelectric potential difference1 aLi, Hao1 aLiang, Jing1 aTao, Zhanliang1 aChen, Jun0 tChemical communications.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 51, no. 8 p.1446-1448dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc08220f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011400169300001600283520141800299592002801717650002801745650001601773650001601789650001701805650001901822650001001841650002101851650003301872650001401905650002101919650001501940650001201955650001301967650001901980650001501999651001402014651001702028651001202045700002102057700002202078700002102100773013002121856008302251852000902334655001202343IND60124110020221120075937.0200415e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012411002DNAL7 a10.1657/1938-4246-45.2.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarilla, Julieta10aLake Fluctuations, Plant Productivity, and Long-Term Variability in High-Elevation Tropical Andean Ecosystems  ap. 179-189.  aEnvironmental trends and ecosystems’ ranges of variability are little known in tropical very high elevation Andean ecosystems (above 4400 m a.s.l.). We combined satellite image analyses and dendrochronological methods with instrumental records at lower elevation to assess changes in lake size and indices of plant productivity of subtropical high-elevation ecosystems in northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. Between 1985 and 2009, interannual lake fluctuations assessed with Landsat images were positively correlated with interannual variations in regional precipitation and de Martonne’s aridity index, showing a decreasing trend in moisture availability during the period. Changes in lake size were positively correlated with radial growth of Polylepis tarapacana, and with MODIS-derived phenological parameters of enhanced vegetation index (EVI; an index of vegetation “greenness”) between 2001 and 2010. This indicates that water balance has a significant effect on ecosystem functioning, which is related to regional scale atmospheric circulation. A long-term tree ring chronology (starting in 1750) showed that tree growth during recent decades was lower than the last 180 years, and were comparable to growth patterns that occurred between 1775 and 1825. These results suggest that if recent climatic trends continue, long-term ranges of variability in ecosystem functioning could be exceeded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3atree growth 3acorrelation 3agrowth rings 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3adendrochronology 3adry environmental conditions 3aphenology 3avegetation index 3aecosystems 3aLandsat 3aaltitude 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3aArgentina 3aAndes region 3aBolivia1 aGrau, H.

To analyze the mutual influence between vegetation coverage and soil quality at different slope aspects in a reclaimed dump, fitting analyses were built between the normalized difference vegetation index and soil physical properties at each slope aspect. Twenty six quadrats were sampled in slope-platform alternate mode. Each quadrat was 10 m × 10 m. Vegetation index and soil physical properties were measured and calculated. Through curve fitting analysis, the results showed that soil bulk density has a negative correlation with the vegetation index on shady and half shady slopes, sunny slopes, and half sunny slopes. Soil porosity has a positive correlation with the vegetation index on shady and half shady slopes, sunny slope, and half sunny slope. The soil mass water content has a concave function relationship with the vegetation index on shady and half shady slopes and has a quadratic function relationship with the vegetation index on sunny and half sunny slopes, with the parabola moving upwards. The soil gravel content has a linear relationship with the vegetation index on shady and half shady slopes, and the image has a negative slope with a quadratic function relationship to the vegetation index on sunny slope and half sunny slope, with the parabola moving downwards. Due to differences among hydrothermal conditions, the relationship between vegetation coverage and soil quality indicators at different slope aspects is different; therefore, reasonable improvement of soil quality indicators on sunny and half sunny slopes could help plants to grow. These findings feed into a reference document that sets out how vegetation and soil quality may be improved in mining areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3agravel 3amining 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aporosity 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil density 3asoil erosion 3asoil quality 3avegetation 3awater content1 aBai, Zhongke1 aCao, Yingui1 aZhou, Wei1 aWang, Jinman0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Oct., v. 24, no. 30 p.23953-23965dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9974-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245008800179520121500267592002801482650001601510650001101526650001101537650001901548650001601567650001301583650001601596650001201612650001601624650001001640650001601650650001101666651001401677653001201691653002501703653001801728700002301746700002701769773012401796856008301920852000902003655001202012IND60765996120221119123104.0220207e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076599612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2022.1078862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalčiauskas, L.q(Linas),10aRodent fertility in commercial orchards in relation to body mass and body condition  aAlthough rodents are recognized as pests, they are still an important part of agricultural ecosystems. In 2018–2020, we snap-trapped small mammals in Lithuania in 18 commercial orchards (apple and plum orchards, currant and raspberry plantations) and in adjacent control habitats. We aimed to discover whether the litter size of the six most abundant rodent species depended on season, on female body mass and/or on fitness. Litter size in common and root voles was smaller in habitats with a higher intensity of agricultural practices. Compared to summer, observed litter size in autumn significantly decreased in common voles (from 5.6 to 4.8) and yellow-necked mice (from 5.8 to 4.6). In autumn, litter size and female body mass was positively correlated in all rodent species, while in summer this was characteristic to root voles (r = 0.67, p < 0.05, 45% of variation of the litter size explained) and yellow-necked mice (r = 0.53, p < 0.005, 27% respectively) only. Female body condition index and litter size correlations were weak. Potential litter size exceeded the observed rate and breeding failures were observed in all species, with the highest percentage in root, bank and common voles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aapples 3aautumn 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acurrants 3aenvironment 3afemales 3alitter size 3aplums 3araspberries 3asummer 3aLithuania 0aRodents 0aPregnancy disruption 0aAgrolandscape1 aStirkė, Vitalijus1 aBalčiauskienė, Laima0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2022 May 01, v. 329 p.107886-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.1078863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300001600281520171900297592002802016650002502044650001302069650002602082650002602108650001502134650001302149650001902162650001302181650001502194650000902209650001002218650001702228650001402245650001502259650000902274650002002283650001802303650001102321650001602332650002702348651002102375651001502396651001202411700002102423700002002444700001702464700001902481700002102500700002002521773013002541856008302671852000902754655001202763IND60124110120221120075929.0200415e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012411012DNAL7 a10.1657/1938-4246-45.2.1902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChacón, Noemí10aDo P Cycling Patterns Differ Between Ice-Free Areas and Glacial Boundaries in the Maritime Antarctic Region?  ap. 190-200.  aAntarctic studies have indicated that during summer, ice-free areas experience greater temperatures than those along the glacial boundaries. This allows for the availability of liquid water and thus influences the biogeochemical processes of Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. In this study we explore whether the patterns of soil phosphorus cycling differ between the glacial boundary and ice-free areas. To do so, we chose two sites on the Fildes Peninsula in Antarctica, one at the boundary of the Collins Glacier and another within an ice-free area close to Lake Uruguay. In each location, we determined soil phosphorus distribution, iron and aluminum fractions, soil mineralogy, alkaline phosphatase activity, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. The results showed that soils of the ice-free area had a greater content of phosphorus sorbed on iron/aluminum oxyhydroxides and occluded forms. An opposite pattern was obtained for the calcium-bound phosphorus pool. Accordingly, soil samples from the ice-free area showed the greatest levels of iron/ aluminum oxyhydroxides and the presence of secondary minerals such as hematite and the intergrade chlorite-vermiculite-montmorillonite. Alkaline phosphatase activity and the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis were also favored at the ice-free area. The overall results suggest that the less extreme microclimatic conditions and the presence of liquid water in the ice-free area promote the biogeochemical cycling of soil phosphorus. In a context of climate warming this study may contribute to the comprehension of how the expansion of the ice-free areas due to glacial retreat influences biogeochemical cycling of essential nutrients in the Antarctic Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaluminum 3abiogeochemical cycles 3afluorescein diacetate 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3aglobal warming 3ahematite 3ahydrolysis 3airon 3alakes 3amicroclimate 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil sampling 3asummer 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aUruguay1 aAscanio, Mildred1 aHerrera, Rafael1 aBenzo, Diana1 aFlores, Saúl,1 aSilva, Soraya J.1 aGarcía, Belkis0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2013 May 1, v. 45, no. 2 p.190-200dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-45.2.1903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245011700216300001600333520193700349592002802286650001202314650002902326650001102355650002502366650001502391650001902406650002902425650001802454650002202472650001802494650001402512650001202526650002102538650001402559650002302573650001302596650001102609650002202620650001102642651001802653651001102671653002902682653002302711653001202734653001202746653001802758653001802776700006102794700002902855700002202884700001702906700002102923700002302944773013402967856008803101852000903189655001203198IND60625365020221117220136.0190325e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062536502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.3972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStorhaug, Ekaterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9815-806510aSeasonal and spatial variations in biomarker baseline levels within Arctic populations of mussels (Mytilus spp.)  ap. 921-936.  aClimate change and pollution resulting from human activities in the Arctic require reliable monitoring systems in sentinel species. Mytilus spp. are used as sentinel species all around the world. The use of Mytilus spp. in environmental monitoring requires knowledge about natural variations in pollution biomarkers. Seasonal variations in baseline levels of biomarkers were studied over a year in the mussels from both upper and lower littoral zones in Rakkfjorden, Norway, as they underwent their annual reproductive cycle. Spatial variations of these biomarker baseline levels were measured in five mussel populations within a 60-km radius from Rakkfjorden to investigate universality of the results from the specific population of Rakkfjorden at a regional scale. Seasonal variations in biomarker baseline levels were revealed and seemed to be related to the reproductive state of the mussels and the tidal zone. The mussels appeared to be more sensitive to oxidative stress during gametogenesis in autumn and winter, when having lower lysosome membrane stability and lower baseline levels of antioxidant biomarkers. An increase in baseline levels of these biomarkers was reported during spawning in spring, however, it was not possible to reveal whether these changes were due to spawning, or to a higher metabolic activity in mussels in response to elevated water temperature and food abundance. The differences between the tidal zones were reflected in reduced size of the mussels from the upper littoral zone, their late spawning in the season and increased baseline levels of antioxidant biomarkers during the coldest month, indicating a more challenging environment in the upper littoral zone. The spatial study indicated that the biomarker baseline levels measured in Rakkfjorden were no different from the levels measured in the mussels from five other sites and thus, are representative for mussels on a regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental monitoring 3agametogenesis 3aindicator species 3alittoral zone 3alysosomes 3amussels 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aseasonal variation 3aspawning 3aspring 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aReproductive cycle 0aBivalve 0aMollusc 0aLittoral zone 0aNorwegian Sea1 aNahrgang, Jasmine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4202-59221 aPedersen, Kristine Bondo1 aBrooks, Steven J.1 aPetes, Laura1 aBakhmet, Igor N.1 aFrantzen, Marianne0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 656 p.921-936dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.3973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245015700163300001800320520154400338592002801882650001501910650000801925650001201933650002301945650001601968650000901984650000701993650001602000650001302016650001302029650002102042650001102063650002002074653002102094653002302115653003302138653003102171653002002202700001302222700001502235700001102250700005102261773014702312856008002459852000902539655001202548IND60632295820221119122601.0190314e20190114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063229582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b063562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Fuchao10aFoaming Properties and Linear and Nonlinear Surface Dilatational Rheology of Sodium Caseinate, Tannin Acid, and Octenyl Succinate Starch Ternary Complex  ap. 2340-2349.  aIn this paper, the foaming and surface properties of sodium caseinate (SC), sodium caseinate/tannin acid (SC/TA), sodium caseinate/octenyl succinate starch (SC/OSA-starch), and sodium caseinate/tannin acid/octenyl succinate starch (SC/TA/OSA-starch) complex systems are described. First, foaming properties of different samples were compared at pH 6.0. The interface adsorption and linear surface dilatational rheological of different samples were characterized in the linear viscoelastic region to explore the relationship between macroscopic foaming properties and surface properties. At equal protein concentrations, the foamability and foam stability of the SC/TA/OSA-starch complex was markedly higher than that of the SC/TA complex. Meanwhile, the surface properties of the SC/TA/OSA-starch complex were also superior to those of the SC/TA complex. Finally, to investigate the nonlinear surface dilatational rheological behavior of the air/water interface stabilized by complex systems, the large-amplitude oscillatory dilatational rheology and Lissajous plots were studied. For the SC/TA/OSA-starch complex, the OSA-starch increases the degree of strain softening in extension, suggesting that the surface structure may change from a surface gel to a mixed phase of SC/TA patches and OSA-starch domains. These findings indicate that the complex formed between polyphenols, proteins, and polysaccharides could be used as a good alternative to understand and, consequently, improve the surface and foaming properties in food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3afoaming 3afoaming properties 3afood matrix 3agels 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aproteins 3arheology 3asodium caseinate 3astarch 3aviscoelasticity 0asodium caseinate 0afoaming properties 0asurface dilatational modulus 0anonlinear surface rheology 0aLissajous plots1 aLi, Jing1 aShi, Minqi1 aWu, Di1 aLi, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7763-42450 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Jan. 14, v. 67, no. 8 p.2340-2349dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b063563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010300160500002000263520153800283592002801821650001501849650001501864650001601879650001601895650001801911650001001929650001201939650002201951650001101973650001601984650001502000650001502015650001202030651001402042651001802056700001902074773010502093856007302198852000902271655001202280IND60591784320221118054328.0180323e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059178432DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.21102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, James W.10aPositive severity feedback between consecutive fires in dry eucalypt forests of southern Australia  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFire regimes have long‐term effects on ecosystems which can be subtle, requiring study at a large spatial scale and temporal scale to fully appreciate. The way in which multiple fires interact to create a fire regime is poorly understood, and the relationship between the severities of consecutive fires has not been studied in Australia. By overlaying remotely sensed severity maps, our study investigated how the severity of a fire is influenced by previous fire severity. This was done by sampling points at 500‐m spacing across 53 fires in dry eucalypt forests of southeast Australia, over a range of time since fire spanning every major fire season for 30 yr. Generalized additive models were used to determine the influence of previous severity on the probability of crown fire and understory fire, controlling for differences in time since fire, topography, and weather. We found that a crown fire is more than twice as likely after a previous crown fire than previous understory fire, and understory fire is more likely after previous understory fire. Our findings are in line with the results of studies from North America and suggest that severe fire promotes further fire. This may be evidence of a runaway positive feedback, which can drive ecological change, and lead to a mosaic of divergent vegetation, but research into more than two consecutive fires is needed to explore this. Our results also suggest that a low‐severity prescribed fire may be a useful management option for breaking a cycle of crown fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aecosystems 3afire regime 3afire season 3afire severity 3afires 3aforests 3along term effects 3amodels 3aprobability 3atopography 3aunderstory 3aweather 3aAustralia 3aNorth America1 aPrice, Owen F.0 tEcosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 9, no. 3 p.e02110-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.21103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245008000207300001400287506007600301520106800377592002801445506003701473650000801510650001901518650002301537650002501560650001401585650003001599650000901629650001301638650001301651650001501664700001501679700001501694700001701709700002001726700001701746700002001763700001501783700003001798700002001828700002001848700002101868700002301889700002701912700001301939700002301952700001701975700002801992700003102020773007202051856008202123852000902205655001202214IND60551722020221207132720.0161019e20150702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055172202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.0012doi7 aPMC44910022pmcid7 a260952532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMan, Si Ming10aCritical Role for the DNA Sensor AIM2 in Stem Cell Proliferation and Cancer  ap. 45-58.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aColorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Mutations in the innate immune sensor AIM2 are frequently identified in patients with colorectal cancer, but how AIM2 modulates colonic tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we found that Aim2-deficient mice were hypersusceptible to colonic tumor development. Production of inflammasome-associated cytokines and other inflammatory mediators was largely intact in Aim2-deficient mice; however, intestinal stem cells were prone to uncontrolled proliferation. Aberrant Wnt signaling expanded a population of tumor-initiating stem cells in the absence of AIM2. Susceptibility of Aim2-deficient mice to colorectal tumorigenesis was enhanced by a dysbiotic gut microbiota, which was reduced by reciprocal exchange of gut microbiota with healthy wild-type mice. These findings uncover a synergy between a specific host genetic factor and gut microbiota in determining the susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Therapeutic modulation of AIM2 expression and microbiota has the potential to prevent colorectal cancer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytokines 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3amutation 3apatients 3astem cells1 aZhu, Qifan1 aZhu, Liqin1 aLiu, Zhiping1 aKarki, Rajendra1 aMalik, Ankit1 aSharma, Deepika1 aLi, Liyuan1 aMalireddi, R.K. Subbarao1 aGurung, Prajwal1 aNeale, Geoffrey1 aOlsen, Scott R.1 aCarter, Robert A.,1 aMcGoldrick, Daniel J.1 aWu, Gang1 aFinkelstein, David1 aVogel, Peter1 aGilbertson, Richard J.,1 aKanneganti, Thirumala-Devi0 tCell.g2015 July 02, v. 162 p.45-58dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01245naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008200153300001800235520029100253592002800544650002300572650001400595650000900609700001300618700001700631700001700648700001400665700001600679700001900695773012200714856007400836852000900910655001200919IND60641471820221118130542.0190505e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064147182DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra27201k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Ying10aCuI promoted sulfenylation of organozinc reagents with arylsulfonyl chlorides  ap. 6018-6022.  aA CuI promoted sulfenylation of organozinc reagents with arylsulfonyl chlorides/PPh₃ has been explored.

In this study, we developed an ApoE genotyping and one-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based-capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for the enhanced diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. The primer mixture of ApoE genes enabled the performance of direct one-step multiplex PCR from whole blood without DNA purification. The combination of direct ApoE genotyping and one-step multiplex PCR minimized the risk of DNA loss or contamination due to the process of DNA purification. All amplified PCR products with different DNA lengths (112-, 253-, 308-, 444-, and 514-bp DNA) of the ApoE genes were analyzed within 2min by an extended voltage programming (VP)-based CE under the optimal conditions. The extended VP-based CE method was at least 120–180 times faster than conventional slab gel electrophoresis methods In particular, all amplified DNA fragments were detected in less than 10 PCR cycles using a laser-induced fluorescence detector. The detection limits of the ApoE genes were 6.4–62.0pM, which were approximately 100–100,000 times more sensitive than previous Alzheimer’s diagnosis methods In addition, the combined one-step multiplex PCR and extended VP-based CE method was also successfully applied to the analysis of ApoE genotypes in Alzheimer’s patients and normal samples and confirmed the distribution probability of allele frequencies. This combination of direct one-step multiplex PCR and an extended VP-based CE method should increase the diagnostic reliability of Alzheimer’s with high sensitivity and short analysis time even with direct use of whole blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aapolipoprotein E 3ablood 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acholesterol 3achromatography 3acoronary artery disease 3aelectric power 3afluorescence 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3ascreening 0aAD 0aApoE 0aCE 0aEtBr 0aLIF 0aPTFE 0aPVP 0aSGE 0aTBE 0aVP 0aAlzheimer’s 0aDiagnosis 0aApolipoprotein E (ApoE) 0aDirect one-step multiplex PCR 0aCapillary electrophoresis1 aKim, Su-Kang1 aSun, Yucheng1 aKang, Seong Ho0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 1072 p.290-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014500168300001600313520081000329592002801139650001901167650002201186650002301208650001001231650002201241650002001263650001701283650002101300650001101321650002601332650001201358650001501370650002201385650002201407653002401429653001601453653001401469653001901483653001501502700001701517700001801534700001601552700001701568700001401585700001901599700001801618773008701636856008401723852000901807655001201816IND60560271520221119171126.0170105e20170125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056027152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Wenzeng10aDesign and synthesis of novel rhodamine-based chemodosimeters derived from [2.2]paracyclophane and their application in detection of Hg2+ion  ap. 271-278.  aFor a better insight into the spectroscopic properties of [2.2]paracyclophane in fluorescent probes, a novel rhodamine-based chemodosimeter bearing [2.2]paracyclophane 4a has been designed and synthesized. The probe 4a exhibits a highly selective and sensitive response to Hg2+ over other transition metal ions in aqueous solution. Its detection limit is determined to be 77nM. The significant changes in the fluorescence color could be used for the naked-eye detection. Furthermore, the probe 4a shows good membrane permeability and can be applied to detect intracellular Hg2+ in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 cells).

In comparison with the traditional oil/water system, the enrichment factor of n-3 PUFA in this system was increased by 363.4% as a result of a higher dispersity, higher selectivity of the lipase for the other fatty acids except for n-3PUFA, and relief of product inhibition. The content of n-3 PUFA in the glyceride fraction could be concentrated to 67.97% by repeated hydrolysis after removing the free fatty acids. Furthermore, the lipase could be reused for at least eight rounds. This method would be an ideal approach for enriching n-3 PUFA because it is cost-effective, low in toxicity, and easily scaled up.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acost effectiveness 3afish oils 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrolysis 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atoxicity 0athree-liquid-phase system 0an-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 0alipase 0afish oil 0ahydrolysis1 aChen, Hua1 aSu, Jinfen1 aWang, Weifei1 aChen, Huayong1 aYang, Bo1 aWang, Yonghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3255-752X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 11, v. 67, no. 9 p.2570-2580dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b063823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014600162300001600308520114800324592002801472650002101500650002301521650002801544650001701572650002101589650001901610650002101629650001001650650002301660650003901683700001401722700001401736700001601750700001601766773011101782856004801893852000901941655001201950IND4480238220221120030108.0120821e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448023822DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437120500682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, X.

The product, which is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, participating in plant brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis was deduced. This method is based on the combination of differential centrifugation (DC) with preparative SDS-PAGE and below is named as DC-PSDS-PAGE. The target protein obtained by this method was apparently better in purity and yield than that obtained by Ni2+ chelate affinity chromatography (Ni2+-CAC). The target protein purity and yield was 95% and 37.897 mg/L of bacterial culture, respectively, in DC-PSDS-PAGE vs. 30% and 0.816 mg/L of bacterial culture in Ni2+-CAC. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is reported for the first time. The reasons for selecting this method and its advantages are discussed in the paper. The purified protein can be used for raising antibody, which is necessary for in situ localization, and this will be a very important part of our subsequent experiments in studying the function of the target protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPopulus euphratica 3aaffinity chromatography 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3acentrifugation 3acytochrome P-450 3agenes 3aphotomorphogenesis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis1 aWu, H.

Analysis of an 823 km² area using a Landsat NDVI time series showed that the homogeneous greening at coarser scales was very heterogeneous at 30-m pixel resolution, with a strong influence due to glacial history. Small scattered patches of pixels with significant increases in NDVI occurred throughout the younger, late Pleistocene glacial deposits. On older, mid-Pleistocene deposits, increases occurred in few, larger patches of mostly tussock-sedge, dwarf-shrub, moss tundra, possibly a result of release of nutrients from thawing of ice-rich permafrost. Five percent of pixels had significant linear increases in NDVI from 1985 to 2007 (n = 6, p &#60; 0.05), while 0.4% showed significant decreases, in small patches whose causes were evident when sampled on the ground. Trends in NDVI varied by glacial history, elevation, slope, and the resulting vegetation conditions. This heterogeneity in response to climate change can be expected throughout much of the Arctic, where complex glacial histories determine existing soil and vegetation characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate change 3aglacial deposits 3ahills 3alandscapes 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3athawing 3atime series analysis 3atopographic slope 3atundra 3aAlaska 3aArctic region1 aWalker, D.

Lindl. ex Spach) fruit cultivars  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aJapanese quince (JQ) shows climacteric behavior that is respiration takes place during ripening. Phytochemical processes during fruit storage cause changes in quality; thus, relevant storage conditions are to be identified to sustain fruit quality over the storage time. The present work aimed to evaluate the effect of 1‐MCP treatment and controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the quality of JQ fruit. Two experiments during the 2017 and 2018 seasons were carried out with four JQ cultivars. Better maintenance of fresh weight was observed in the case of CA storage, although the degree of effectiveness was cultivar and growing season dependent. The best preservation of JQ fruit phytochemicals, for example, total phenolics, proanthocyanidins, and vitamin C has been reached when the CA system was employed. In turn, no clear effect of either CA or 1‐MCP on fruit soluble solids and total acids content was observed for JQ fruit after long‐term storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In recent years, there have been many studies centered on the evaluation of the chemical composition of Japanese quince (JQ) fruits revealing that these fruits are a good source of valuable compounds for the food and pharmaceutical industries. Currently, the fruit of JQ are processed for many food products, thus leading to the intensive diversification of planting areas. It is expected that the market share of JQ will increase double or triple in the future. To ensure the quality of JQ during storage, proper storage technology needs to be identified. Acquired data in this study are of potential interest to growers and industries dealing with JQ fruit processing and storage.  aPublisher supplied data  cERAF 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3aChaenomeles japonica 3aascorbic acid 3aclimacteric fruits 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3acultivars 3afruit quality 3amarket share 3aproanthocyanidins 3aquinces 3astorage quality 3astorage time1 aRadenkovs, Vitalijs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9443-35251 aKrasnova, Inta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3386-02800 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.e16193-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.161933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245020400166300001200370520137900382592002801761650002501789650001901814650001401833650001301847650002001860650004301880650001301923650001801936650001301954650000701967650001501974650001401989650003302003650001302036650001502049650001102064700002902075773013402104856008102238852000902319655001202328IND60454432820221116202736.0151217e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045443282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4928-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Susan12aA new method for separation and determination of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water samples by high-performance liquid chromatography based on anion exchange stationary phase of ionic liquid modified silica  ap. 725.  aIn this work, N-methylimidazolium-chloride ionic liquid functionalized silica was prepared and used as an anion-exchange stationary phase for separation of chromium species by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at 200 nm. The Cr(VI) as HCr₂O₇ ⁻ and chelated Cr(III) with potassium hydrogen phthalate (PHP) as Cr(PHP)₂ ⁻ was retained on the prepared column and separated using a mobile phase composed of 5 % methanol in 25 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. Several variables affecting the chelation/separation steps were modeled by response surface methodology (RSM) using Box–Behnken (BBD) design. The significance of the independent variables and their interactions were tested by the analysis of variances (ANOVA) with 95 % confidence limit. Under the optimized conditions, the Cr(III) and Cr(VI) anionic species were well separated with a single peak for each Cr species at retention times of 2.3 and 4.3 min, respectively. The relationship between the peak area and concentration was linear in the range of 0.025–30 for Cr(III) and 0.5–20 mg L⁻¹ for Cr(VI) with detection limits of 0.010 and 0.210 mg L⁻¹ for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. The proposed method was validated by simultaneous separation and determination of the Cr species in tap and underground water samples without impose to any pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanion exchange 3achelation 3achromium 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3amethanol 3apH 3aphthalates 3apotassium 3aresponse surface methodology 3asampling 3aseparation 3asilica1 aMoghaddam, Ali Zeraatkar0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Dec., v. 187, no. 12 p.725-725dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4928-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002100157245012200178300001600300500001900316520118800335592002801523650001701551650001301568650001101581650001201592650001101604650001601615653001801631653002801649653003001677653003101707653002601738700006001764700001801824773011301842856009201955852000902047655001202056IND60717131120221118164925.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071713112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kwei-Long10aPlant factory crop scheduling considering volume, yield changes and multi-period harvests using Lagrangian relaxation  ap. 328-337.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA plant factory is an environmentally controlled facility that can sustain stable crop cultivation while ensuring fast production and better crop quality by manipulating temperature, humidity, lighting, nutrient supply, and other cultivation factors. It requires better cultivation planning to fully utilise the facility since the set up and operating costs are high. This study aims to schedule crops in a commercial plant factory to maximise revenue by determining which crops are cultivated, the quantity, and at what time. The model considers not only crop market prices but also crop properties such as cultivation duration, volume change, multiple periods of harvests, and yield rates under different environmental settings. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem to find an optimal schedule. For a large size problem, Lagrangian relaxation with surrogate subgradient method is applied to obtain a good solution in a short time. The numerical results show that, compared to the integer program solver, the proposed method provides faster solutions with more than 80% efficacy when longer planning periods and multiple cultivation rooms are considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop quality 3ahumidity 3aincome 3amarkets 3amodels 3atemperature 0aPlant factory 0aCrop scheduling problem 0aMixed integer programming 0aHeuristic algorithm method 0aLagrangian relaxation1 aYang, Chao Lung,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5585-00941 aKuo, Che-Ming0 tBiosystems engineering.g2020 Dec., v. 200 p.328-337dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014300172300001600315520101900331592002801350650002301378650002301401650001301424650000901437650001501446650001001461653003101471653001901502653003201521653003701553653002401590700003201614773008701646856008401733852000901817655001201826IND60560271920221119172012.0170105e20170125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056027192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.11.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNahide, Pradip D.10aMild, rapid and efficient metal-free synthesis of 2-aryl-4-aryloxyquinolines via direct Csp2O bond formation by using diaryliodonium salts  ap. 279-284.  aAn efficient ligand- and transition metal-free procedure for the direct Csp2O bond formation for the arylation of 2-aryl-4-quinolones was developed. The synthesis of the starting quinolones was carried out under our optimized Cu-catalyzed CN bond formation conditions between 2′-bromoacetophenone and benzamide derivatives followed by cyclization. Easily prepared diaryliodonium salts were used as aryl source. Highly functionalized 4-aryloxyquinolines were obtained in a mild and operationally simple protocol, which involves conventional heating and short periods of time. The method shows good to excellent yields and broad toleration of functional groups like fluorine or trifluoromethyl, which are important in medicinal chemistry. The Csp2O bond formation process herein described for the quinolone functionalization offers an excellent non-toxic alternative to the transition metal-catalyzed reactions that not only can potentially contaminate the final compounds but also can be environmental pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afluorine 3aheat 3aquinolones 3asalts 0a2-Aryl-4-aryloxyquinolines 0aIodonium salts 0aDirect Csp2O bond formation 0aLigand- and metal-free reactions 0aNon-toxic reactions1 aSolorio-Alvarado, César R.0 tTetrahedron letters.g2017 Jan. 25, v. 58 p.279-284dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2016.11.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008100160300001400241500002000255520168600275592002801961650001201989650001602001650002002017650002002037650002202057650001302079650001602092700002202108700002302130773008902153856007302242852000902315655001202324IND60587234320221118033927.0171215e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058723432DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.127062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFichtel, Claudia10aMeasuring social tolerance: An experimental approach in two lemurid primates  ap. 65-73.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSocial tolerance crucially affects the life of group‐living animals as it can influence, among other things, their competitive regimes, access to food, learning behavior, and recruitment. However, social tolerance tests were mainly conducted in semi‐free or captive populations, and we know little about the behavioral mechanisms and consequences of social tolerance under natural conditions. We therefore developed a co‐feeding experiment to measure social tolerance in groups of wild and captive animals across two primate species. Specifically, we recorded the social tolerance level of redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons, four wild, one captive group) and ringtailed lemurs (Lemur catta, three wild, three captive groups) by presenting a clumped food resource in an experimental arena, and recorded patterns of resource use during the experiment. Because redfronted lemurs exhibit lower levels of decided conflicts than ringtailed lemurs, we predicted that they would be socially more tolerant. The probability for an individual to feed in the arena was higher in redfronted lemurs than in ringtailed lemurs. In addition, in both species, the probability for an individual to feed in the arena was higher in the captive populations than in their wild counterparts, suggesting that proximate factors, such as a relaxation of feeding competition in captivity, may adapt species‐specific levels of social tolerance to local levels of food availability. Hence, the number of individuals co‐feeding on a valuable food resource appears to be a useful proxy of social tolerance that could be measured with this experimental setup in other wild and captive species as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEulemur 3aLemur catta 3aanimal behavior 3acaptive animals 3afood availability 3alearning 3aprobability1 aSchnoell, Anna V.1 aKappeler, Peter M.0 tEthology.g2018 Jan., v. 124, no. 1 p.65-73dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.127063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012000161500002000281520203800301592002802339650001502367650002102382650002202403650000902425650001402434650002502448650001302473650001402486650001102500650001502511650002502526650001102551650001702562650001102579650002202590650001502612651001102627700002102638700001802659700002102677773010502698856007302803852000902876655001202885IND60591785020221118054235.0180323e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059178502DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.21312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaunders, W.

Using these data, we (1) evaluated the extent to which juvenile salmonid abundance and resource limitation correlated with areas of high gross primary production (GPP), (2) developed models to predict GPP from both site‐level measurements and remotely sensed data, and (3) made predictions of GPP across the entirety of the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJD) network and assessed the utility of these spatially continuous predictions for describing variation fish densities at broad scales. We produced reliable estimates of GPP at sites where DO loggers were deployed using measurements of solar exposure, water temperature, and conductivity measured at each site, as well as surrogates for these data estimated from remote sensing data sources. Estimates of GPP across fish sampling sites explained, on average, 58–63% of the variation in juvenile salmonid densities during the summer sampling period, and 51–83% during the fall sampling period, while continuous network predictions of GPP explained 44% of the variation in fish densities across 29 km of the MFJD. Further, GPP explained nearly half of the variation in juvenile steelhead dietary resource limitation, as inferred from bioenergetics modeling results. These results comprise a first effort at quantifying variation in autochthonous production across an entire river network and, importantly, provide a much‐needed food‐web context for guiding more effective fish and habitat management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy metabolism 3afish 3afood webs 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3aspatial data 3asummer 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aOregon1 aBouwes, Nicolaas1 aMcHugh, Peter1 aJordan, Chris E.0 tEcosphere.g2018 Mar., v. 9, no. 3 p.e02131-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.21313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010900168300001800277520115000295592002801445650001701473650001401490650001601504650001401520650002601534650002201560650001601582650002301598650002301621653001001644653002901654653002201683653001701705653001701722700002301739700002401762700002801786700001801814700002201832700002601854700006101880773014701941856008002088852000902168655001202177IND60632296620190425000000.0190314e20190214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063229662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b064562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFayeulle, Noémie10aFast Discrimination of Chocolate Quality Based on Average-Mass-Spectra Fingerprints of Cocoa Polyphenols  ap. 2723-2731.  aThis work aims to sort cocoa beans according to chocolate sensory quality and phenolic composition. Prior to the study, cocoa samples were processed into chocolate in a standard manner, and then the chocolate was characterized by sensory analysis, allowing sorting of the samples into four sensory groups. Two objectives were set: first to use average mass spectra as quick cocoa-polyphenol-extract fingerprints and second to use those fingerprints and chemometrics to select the molecules that discriminate chocolate sensory groups. Sixteen cocoa polyphenol extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography–low-resolution mass spectrometry. Averaging each mass spectrum provided polyphenolic fingerprints, which were combined into a matrix and processed with chemometrics to select the most meaningful molecules for discrimination of the chocolate sensory groups. Forty-four additional cocoa samples were used to validate the previous results. The fingerprinting method proved to be quick and efficient, and the chemometrics highlighted 29 m/z signals of known and unknown molecules, mainly flavan-3-ols, enabling sensory-group discrimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3achocolate 3acocoa beans 3aflavanols 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apolyphenols 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 0acocoa 0apolyphenolic fingerprint 0amass spectrometry 0achemometrics 0aflavan-3-ols1 aMeudec, Emmanuelle1 aBoulet, Jean Claude1 aVallverdu-Queralt, Anna1 aHue, Clotilde1 aBoulanger, Renaud1 aCheynier, Véronique,1 aSommerer, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9424-76850 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 14, v. 67, no. 9 p.2723-2731dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b064563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01176naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005100167300001800218520027600236592002800512650002200540650001200562650001900574650001000593650001200603650002900615700002400644700002700668773007600695856008200771852000900853655001200862IND60551722720221121095029.0161019e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055172272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2015.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Nikhil12aA Shortcut to Activity-Dependent Transcription  ap. 1496-1498.  aNeuronal activity results in the rapid induction of gene transcription through a series of defined molecular events.

Carrière] Along the Gulf of Alaska  ap. 211-218.  aRecent observations of divergence between tree growth at high-latitude sites and temperature, as well as the decline of yellow cedar [Callitropsis nootkatensis (D. Don) Oerst. ex D.P. Little] in southeast Alaska due to warming, emphasize a need to investigate nonstationary climate response of Alaskan coastal forests to warming in other tree species. Comparison of annual tree growth in mountain hemlock [Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière] to mean monthly temperature and precipitation data from Sitka, Alaska, from A.D. 1830s to 1990s along an elevational transect reveals nonstationarity in tree growth response to climate that suggests an ongoing biome shift. We observe a marked weakening in the positive relationship between annual growth and warmer growth season temperatures at low-elevation hemlock sites, and a concurrent increase in growth and sensitivity at higher elevations coupled with increased correlation between growth and April precipitation at all sites along our transects. As previously observed with yellow cedar, the mechanism of the hemlock biome shift may be due to an increased susceptibility of roots to damage from late frosts resulting from earlier seasonal loss of protective snowpack.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTsuga mertensiana 3aXanthocyparis nootkatensis 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3acoastal forests 3aecosystems 3alatitude 3aroots 3asnowpack 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atrees 3aAlaska 3aGulf of Alaska1 aWiles, Gregory C.1 aAppleton, Sarah N.1 aD'Arrigo, Rosanne D.1 aLawson, Daniel E.0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2013 May, v. 45, no. 2 p.211-218dInstitute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), University of Coloradox1523-04307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-45.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009900172300001600271500001400287520113500301536035501436592002801791596011201819596016001931650002002091650002102111650001402132650002102146650002302167650001302190650002002203650001702223650001902240650001602259650001302275650002302288650001802311650001102329653001102340653001602351653001302367700002202380700002502402700002202427773012802449856008502577852000902662655001202671IND60720425720221118062713.0201214e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072042572DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2020.18288932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanuta, Jaworska14aThe effect of fish oil, lycopene and organic selenium as feed additives on rabbit meat quality  ap. 476-483.  aNAL-light  aThe aim of the study was to compare the quality of rabbit meat depending on the type of feed used. The animals were divided into 5 groups of 10 individuals and were fed ad libitum with feed for 55 days. The control group was fed with the addition of sunflower oil (4%), the feed of group FO was enriched with 4% odourless fish oil (FO), the feed of group FOLyc was enriched with 4% FO and 15 ppm lycopene (Lyc), the feed of group ROSe was enriched with 4% FO and selenized yeast (SeY) and the feed of group FOLycSe contained 4% FO, 15 ppm Lyc and SeY. The obtained results showed that the enrichment of feed with fish oil resulted in an increase in the longissimus muscle mass by 7.3%. The feed supplementation with fish oil was beneficial in terms of nutrition due to the increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fat oxidation level, measured in the malondialdehyde test, indicated that the highest level was observed in muscles of rabbits fed diets enriched with only FO. The use of odourless FO in feed adversely affected the sensory quality of meat by increasing the intensity of negative notes like rancid.  aThis study was supported by the statutory funds from The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences (Jabłonna, Poland) and by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education within funds of Faculty of Human Nutrition and Consumer Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (WULS), for scientific research.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences (Jablonna, Poland)  cPolish Ministry of Science and Higher Education within funds of Faculty of Human Nutrition and Consumer Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (WULS) 3aanimal research 3afeed supplements 3afish oils 3alipid metabolism 3alongissimus muscle 3alycopene 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat quality 3amuscle tissues 3arabbit meat 3aselenium 3asensory properties 3asunflower oil 3ayeasts 0aRabbit 0alongissimus 0afish oil1 aMarian, Czauderna1 aWiesław, Przybylski1 aAnna, Ranachowska0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 48, no. 1 p.476-483dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2020.18288933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03888naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245013900203300001800342500002000360520205300380592002802433650002502461650004002486650001402526650001602540650001302556650001302569650001902582650002102601650001402622650001102636650001002647650002202657650003002679650001802709650001402727650001402741650001002755651001202765651002502777651001202802651001202814700002402826700002002850700002902870700002502899700002702924700002202951700001902973700003002992700005503022773013703077856007503214852000903289655001203298IND60783580320221118053910.0220720e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078358032DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.141882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorte, Ana Cláudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7833-446310aDiversity of microorganisms in Hyalomma aegyptium collected from spur‐thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in North Africa and Anatolia  ap. 1951-1962.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTicks carry a diverse community of microorganisms including non‐pathogenic symbionts, commensals, and pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, protozoans, and fungi. The assessment of tick‐borne microorganisms (TBM) in tortoises and their ticks is essential to understand their eco‐epidemiology, and to map and monitor potential pathogens to humans and other animals. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity of microorganisms found in ticks collected from the spur‐thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) in North Africa and Anatolia. Ticks feeding on wild T. graeca were collected, and pathogens were screened by polymerase chain reaction using group‐specific primers. In total, 131 adult Hyalomma aegyptium ticks were collected from 92 T. graeca in Morocco (n = 48), Tunisia (n = 2), Algeria (n = 70), and Turkey (n = 11). Bacteria and protozoa detected included Hemolivia mauritanica (22.9%), Midichloria mitochondrii (11.4%), relapsing‐fever borreliae (8.4%), Ehrlichia spp. (7.6%), Rickettsia spp. (3.4%), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (0.9%), Francisella spp. (0.9%), and Wolbachia spp. (0.8%). The characterization of Rickettsia included R. sibirica mongolitimonae (Algeria), R. aeschlimannii (Turkey), and R.africae (Morocco). Hemolivia mauritanica and Ehrlichia spp. prevalence varied significantly with the sampling region/country. We did not detect significant associations in microorganism presence within ticks, nor between microorganism presence and tick mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. This is the first report of Francisella persica‐like, relapsing fever borreliae, M. mitochondrii, and Wolbachia spp. in H. aegyptium ticks collected from wild hosts from the South and Eastern Mediterranean region, and of R. sibirica mongolitimonae and R. africae in H. aegyptium from Algeria and Morocco, respectively. Given that T. graeca is a common species in commercial and non‐commercial pet trade, the evaluation of the role of this species and its ticks as hosts for TBM is particularly relevant for public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aCandidatus Midichloria mitochondrii 3aEhrlichia 3aFrancisella 3aHyalomma 3aProtozoa 3aTestudo graeca 3aTurkey (country) 3aWolbachia 3aadults 3afever 3amitochondrial DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3asymbionts 3atortoises 3atrade 3aAlgeria 3aMediterranean region 3aMorocco 3aTunisia1 aHarris, David James1 aSilveira, Diogo1 aNunes, Carolina Saramago1 aNúncio, Maria Sofia1 aMartínez, Eva Graciá1 aGiménez, Andrés1 ade Sousa, Rita1 aLopes de Carvalho, Isabel1 aPerera, Ana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7466-47530 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 July, v. 69, no. 4 p.1951-1962dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.141883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007700170300001600247520141900263592002801682650001301710650002701723650001901750650001001769650001901779650002001798650001601818650001101834650001901845650001801864650001601882650001501898650001101913650001101924650002101935653001701956653000901973653000901982653001601991653001602007653001302023653002002036700002202056700006202078700002002140700001702160700002002177700002202197700002002219700006502239700002402304700006002328700006502388700005802453700002802511700005802539700002202597773011802619856008302737852000902820655001202829IND60530189420221121223143.0190405e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053018942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2016.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, Ruud J.B.10aNanomaterials for products and application in agriculture, feed and food  ap. 155-164.  aNanotechnology applications can be found in agricultural production, animal feed, food processing, food additives and food contact materials (hereinafter referred to as agri/feed/food). A great diversity of nanomaterials is reported to be currently used in various applications, while new nanomaterials and applications are reported to be in development.It is expected that applications of nanomaterials in agri/feed/food will increase in the future and thereby increase the human and environmental exposure to such materials. To gain up-to-date knowledge we explored and reviewed the already marketed and in-development applications of nanomaterials in the agri/feed/food sectors upon the request of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In this paper the results of the project are highlighted and discussed in more detail.The majority of the applications of nanomaterials that we identified concerned application in food as food additives and food contact materials, while much fewer applications seem to be developed for agriculture and feed. Nano-encapsulates, silver, titanium dioxide and silica are the most often mentioned nanomaterials in the literature. About half of the identified applications are claimed to be already in use. In-development applications are found for nano-encapsulates and nano-composites in novel foods, food and feed additives, biocides, pesticides and food contact materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocides 3aenvironmental exposure 3afeed additives 3afeeds 3afood additives 3afood processing 3afood safety 3ahumans 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3anovel foods 3apesticides 3asilica 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide 0aNanomaterial 0aFood 0aFeed 0aAgriculture 0aApplication 0aProducts 0aRisk assessment1 aBouwmeester, Hans1 aGottardo, Stefania1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6465-62181 aAmenta, Valeria1 aArena, Maria1 aBrandhoff, Puck1 aMarvin, Hans J.P.1 aMech, Agnieszka1 aMoniz, Filipa Botelho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8033-96851 aPesudo, Laia Quiros1 aRauscher, Hubert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1850-01641 aSchoonjans, Reinhilde1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4112-89511 aUndas, Anna K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4454-87671 aVettori, Maria Vittoria1 aWeigel, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4197-57581 aAschberger, Karin0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2016 Aug., v. 54 p.155-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2016.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014300157300002000300520089800320592002801218650001301246650002601259650002201285650001401307650001201321650002001333650001601353700001901369700001601388773012401404856007401528852000901602655001201611IND60617194320221119050400.0181024e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061719432DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra03730b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Qiaoyun10aOptimal design of an antireflection coating structure for enhancing the energy-conversion efficiency of a silicon nanostructure solar cell  ap. 34793-34807.  aIn this paper, we present our investigation of the optical and electrical characteristics of silicon solar cells using silicon nanowire, silicon nanocone, silicon nanopillar, and silicon nanopillar/silicon nitride structures, which were obtained by the Ag-assisted electroless etching method and ICP etching with extreme ultraviolet lithography.

Invitro gametogenesis was developed using mouse pluripotent stem cells but is increasingly being applied in other mammalian species, including humans. In principle, the entire process of germ cell development is nearly reconstitutable in culture using mouse pluripotent stem cells, although the fidelity of differentiation processes and the quality of resultant gametes remain to be refined. The methodology in the mouse system is only partially applicable to other species, and thus it must be optimised for each species. In this review, we update the current status of invitro gametogenesis in mice, humans and other animals, and discuss challenges for further development of this technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3agametogenesis 3agerm cells 3amedicine 3amice 0ainvitro 0apluripotent stem cells 0areconstitution1 aGalli, Cesare1 aDiecke, Sebastian1 aHildebrandt, Thomas B.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2021, v. 33, no. 2 p.91-101dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD202653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245007800199300001800277500002000295520145600315592002801771596005301799596005301852596006001905650002501965650002501990650001202015650002602027650002502053650001702078650001902095650003002114650001602144650001402160650002402174650002002198650001102218700002202229700001602251700002002267700002302287700002202310700003502332700004102367700006002408773012702468856007402595852000902669655001202678IND60779960820221117035142.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077996082DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.132102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, M.

An infective CN juvenile enters the host's roots and migrates towards the vascular cylinder, where it induces the formation of syncytial feeding cells, which nourish the CN throughout its parasitic stages. Here, we examined the role of glutathione (l‐γ‐glutamyl‐l‐cysteinyl‐glycine) in Arabidopsis thaliana on infection with the CN Heterodera schachtii. Arabidopsis lines with mutations pad2, cad2, or zir1 in the glutamate–cysteine ligase (GSH1) gene, which encodes the first enzyme in the glutathione biosynthetic pathway, displayed enhanced CN susceptibility, but susceptibility was reduced for rax1, another GSH1 allele. Biochemical analysis revealed differentially altered thiol levels in these mutants that was independent of nematode infection. All glutathione‐deficient mutants exhibited impaired activation of defence marker genes as well as genes for biosynthesis of the antimicrobial compound camalexin early in infection. Further analysis revealed a link between glutathione‐mediated plant resistance to CN infection and the production of camalexin on nematode infection. These results suggest that glutathione levels affect plant resistance to CN by fine‐tuning the balance between the cellular redox environment and the production of compounds related to defence against infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a287570125cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  a390686111cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  a91525252cDeutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aHeterodera schachtii 3aalleles 3aanti-infective agents 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acyst nematodes 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aglutathione 3ajuveniles 3anematode infections 3aplant pathology 3athiols1 aChopra, Divykriti1 aDamm, Anika1 aKoprivova, Anna1 aKopriva, Stanislav1 aMeyer, Andreas J.1 aMüller‐Schüssele, Stefanie1 aGrundler, F.

Thirty six ewes fed two protein level (Treatment 1, T1 and treatment 2, T2) and no protein supplement ration (control, T0). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed from blood cell DNA following standard protocols. PCR products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing and MEGA6 software were used for molecular analysis. The conception rate of ewes was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the treated group than the control. Gestation period and lambing interval were significantly higher (worse) in control (154.00 ± 0.57 and 186.00 ± 1.24 days) than treated groups. Birth weight of lamb ranged from 1.07 to 1.65 kg and higher birth weight was found in T2 than other groups. Sequence alignment of BMP15 and GDF9 gene in indigenous sheep showed 100% homology with other sheep breed. As no mutation was observed and apparently these genes have no effect on ewe fertility. However, nutritional supplements had a positive impact on reproductive performance. The phylogenetic inferences have close relations of Bangladeshi sheep with other breed elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/32cChittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University 3aDNA 3aanimal research 3abirth weight 3ablood 3acomputer software 3aconception rate 3aewes 3agenes 3agestation period 3amutation 3aprotein content 3aprotein supplements 3areproductive performance 3asequence alignment 3aBangladesh 0aSheep 0acharacters 0afertility 0agene1 aKhan, Md.

Three possible mechanisms other than vegetation could contribute to the bank cohesion required to promote meandering: permafrost, abundant mud, and chemical cementation. Banks at the meandering Quinn River show little vegetation cover. Almost all sediment samples collected from the Quinn River deposits contain at least 41% mud (silt/clay), which is much higher than for most meandering streams. Ion chromatography (IC) analysis and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed presence of salts in river waters and sediments which may induce fine sediment to flocculate and be deposited. We find that bank cohesion promoting meandering can be provided by silt/clay, the deposition of which may be induced by dissolved salts. The sinuous Usuktuk River in the continuous permafrost region near Barrow, Alaska exhibited no exposed permafrost on stream banks. Instead vegetation seemed to be the dominant control of bank erosion. We have not found evidence for ice control of bank cohesion in this or other terrestrial rivers of similar size and in meandering pattern to the Martian AD meanders. We conclude that bank cohesion in the AD meanders was probably provided by deposition of fine suspended sediment that was flocculated by dissolved salts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abank erosion 3aclay 3acohesion 3aice 3aion exchange chromatography 3apermafrost 3ariparian areas 3ariver water 3arivers 3asalts 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilt 3astreams 3asuspended sediment 3avegetation cover 3aAlaska 0aMeandering rivers 0aTerrestrial analog 0aAeolis Dorsa 0aMud-dominated 0aPermafrost controlled1 aHoward, Alan D.1 aBurr, Devon M.1 aWilliams, Rebecca M.E.1 aDietrich, William E.1 aMoore, Jeffery M.0 tGeomorphology.g2015 July 01, v. 240 p.102-120dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2014.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04129naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245013500156300001200291500001900303520299100322592002803313650001403341650001303355650000903368650001703377650001403394650002603408650001903434650001803453700001503471700002103486700001503507700001903522773012903541856007603670852000903746655001203755IND60722903920221121103623.0210108s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072290392DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv33n2Ab1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeran, E.10a100 The evolution and premature hyperactivation of kinetic sperm subpopulations are affected by inbreeding level in Retinta cattle  ap. 157.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aComputer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) has become a powerful tool to study sperm heterogeneity because it allows to cluster individual sperm in subpopulations (Sp) according to their kinetic parameters, which are associated with fertility and sperm quality. In cattle, inbreeding (mating between close relatives) affects sperm quality. Inbreeding estimation has become more accurate with the increasing availability of genomic methodologies, such as the detection of runs of homozygosity (ROH). Additionally, genomic inbreeding values (FROH) allow us to determine which metabolic pathways are differentially affected by this genetic trait. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of inbreeding on evolution of sperm Sp over time in cattle. Sperm samples (n=100) from 50 Retinta bulls (two replicates) were analysed in a sperm longevity experiment at time 0 (T0, after thawing), 1 (T1) and 2 (T2) h. At each time point, eight parameters were measured using a CASA system (Sperm Class Analyzer 5.4), including curvilinear velocity (VCL, μm/s), straight-line velocity (VSL, μm/s); average path velocity (VAP, μm/s), percentage of linearity (LIN,%: VSL/VCL), percentage of straightness (STR,%: VSL/VAP), wobble coefficient (WOB,%: VAP/VCL), mean amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, μm) and beat-cross frequency (BCF, Hz). The presence of Sp was determined by a two-step multivariate analysis including non-hierarchical followed by hierarchical analysis in 80,154 motile sperm. Four sperm Sp were identified: Sp1 (rapid and highly progressive sperm); Sp2 (progressive sperm with intermediate speed); Sp3 (slow and non-progressive sperm); and Sp4 (fastest, hyperactive-like, non-progressive sperm). To determine the effect of inbreeding, individuals were clustered into lowly (FROH < 0.125, n=27) and highly (FROH > 0.125, n=23) inbred individuals. After thawing (T0), the percentage of sperm Sp4 was higher and showed premature hyperactivation in highly inbred animals, which was previously associated with reduced fertility (Table 1). However, highly inbred individuals showed an increased percentage of rapid (Sp1) and intermediate (Sp2) progressive sperm after T1 and T2 incubation, respectively, compared with lowly inbred bulls (P<0.001). These results suggest that sperm velocity and progression persist for longer in highly inbred bulls, at least after a short incubation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that inbreeding affects sperm motility pattern and premature hyperactivation in cattle. Table 1.

Integrated cyclical water management can help adaptation to climate variation and uncertainty by varying the proportion of surface water and groundwater allocations over time in response to changing water availability. Water use entitlements and rules specify conditions for the use, storage and exchange of surface water and groundwater. These entitlements and rules provide certainty for water users, investors and managers. Entitlements and rules also need to be flexible to enable users and managers to respond to changing water availability and knowledge. Arrangements to provide certainty and flexibility can conflict. For example guarantees of specific long-term allocations of water, or shares of allocations can conflict with arrangements to bank water underground during wet periods and then to use an increased amount of groundwater in dry periods. Systems of water entitlements and rules need to achieve a balance between certainty and flexibility. This article explores the effect of water entitlements and rules, and arrangements to provide certainty and flexibility for the integration of surface water and groundwater management over time. The analysis draws on case studies from the Namoi River basin in New South Wales and the South Platte River basin in Colorado. Integrated cyclical water management requires a comprehensive, flexible and balanced system of water entitlements and rules that allow extended water carryover, water banking, aquifer storage and recovery over the wet and dry climate cycle. Opportunities for extended carryover and aquifer storage and recovery over the wet and dry climate cycle merit further consideration in New South Wales, Colorado and other jurisdictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3aclimate 3agroundwater 3amanagers 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aColorado 3aNew South Wales 0aIntegrated 0aCyclical 0aManagement 0aStorage 0aSurface water 0aGroundwater0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Nov. 27, v. 519 p.2493-2500dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014100163300001600304520171000320592002802030650002002058650002102078650001202099650001402111650002102125650002302146650004102169650002502210650002002235650001402255650001002269650001002279650003102289700002002320773009302340856004802433852000902481655001202490IND50068504420221120023337.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006850442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-013-1652-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Sang-Mi10aPlant growth promoting rhizobacterium Proteus vulgaris JBLS202 stimulates the seedling growth of Chinese cabbage through indole emission  ap. 485-495.  aBackgrounds and aims: The functional role of volatile indole in interaction between rhizobacteria and plant remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the functional role of the volatile indole emitted by rhizobacterial strain Proteus vulgaris JBLS202 in plant growth promoting activity. Methods: P. vulgaris strain JBLS202 was used to study the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on growth stimulation of Chinese cabbage (cabbage) at seedling stage. SPME-GC/MS analysis employed to identify headspace VOCs emitted from the rhizobacterium. Synthetic indole was assayed at various concentrations for the growth stimulation of cabbage and the emission of indole from the bacterized cabbage seeds was identified. Results: P. vulgaris JBLS202 promoted the growth of cabbage via volatiles in a dose-dependent manner. VOC emission assay by SPME-GC/MS revealed that indole was a major headspace volatile compound emitted from the rhizobacterium. Moreover, the growth of cabbage was promoted significantly in the presence of 0.63 μg of synthetic indole. The vigor index and fresh weight of the seedlings were increased by 39.9 % and 32.6 %, respectively when the seeds of cabbage were bacterized with P. vulgaris JBLS202 cells (1 × 107 CFU/ml). The emission of indole from the bacterized seeds was demonstrated by SPME-GC/MS. Conclusions: Results indicated that either synthetic or biological/bacterial indole could increase the growth of cabbage significantly. Though the molecular biological role of indole in plant growth promotion remains to be investigated, this is the first report on detailed interaction between bacterial indole and plants. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese cabbage 3aProteus vulgaris 3acabbage 3aemissions 3agrowth promotion 3aheadspace analysis 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3avigor 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLee, Yong-Hoon,0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Sept., v. 370, no. 1-2 p.485-495dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1652-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245024600206520190700452592002802359650002002387650002502407650001502432650002202447650001802469650003202487650001802519650002102537653001802558653001702576653002802593653003202621653004502653700001902698700002002717700001902737700003202756700002102788700001802809700002902827700001902856700006102875773011402936856008503050852000903135655001203144IND60775931120221123014247.0220706e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077593112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4630932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbreu, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7236-229210aRapid assessment of fatty acyls chains of phospholipids and plasmalogens by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in positive mode and high-resolution mass spectrometry using in-source generated monoacylglycerol like fragments intensities  aWe recently published a new concept using monoacylglycerol-like fragments [MG+H-H₂O]⁺ (ions B) produced in-source by atmospheric pressure photoionization in positive mode and high-resolution mass spectrometry for the determination of the fatty acyl (FA) composition of triacylglycerols (TGs) from plant oils. This study extends the concept to the phospholipids (PLs) category and shows that the APCI⁺ source can also be used. Moreover, the coupling with NP-LC allows to simultaneously analyze different PLs classes in the same sample. We compared the relative intensities of the ions B produced in-source to the % composition of FAs determined by GC-FID. In the case of PLs from natural extracts composed exclusively of diacyl-PLs, the relative intensities of ions B are close to the % of the FAs obtained by GC-FID. This approach is not directly useable for extracts containing plasmalogens (P-PLs). For these PLs, acidic hydrolysis by HCl fumes allows hydrolyzing selectively vinyl ether functions to form lyso-PLs. The analysis of hydrolyzed extracts makes it possible to obtain the composition of P-PLs FAs thanks to the lyso-PLs thus formed, while the diacyl-PLs composition remains unchanged. Unlike GC-FID FAs determination, this approach allows a distinction between the diacyl-PLs and P-PLs FAs composition. We also found that the ion B intensities were consistent among the PL classes (PG, PE, PA, PI, CL, PS and PC) and lyso- forms (LPE and LPC). In the case of the diacyl-PLs extracts analyzed, no statistically significant differences were found between the PLs FAs compositions calculated from ion B intensities and the corresponding GC-FID data. A weighting coefficient was applied to correct ion B intensities issued from polyunsaturated FAs with three or more double bonds. The fatty alkenyls composition of P-PLs could also be calculated from the % intensities of specific ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aatmospheric pressure 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aphospholipids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arapid methods 3atriacylglycerols 0aPhospholipids 0aPlasmalogens 0aFatty acyls composition 0aNormal phase chromatography 0aAtmospheric pressure chemical ionization1 aHéron, Sylvie1 aSolgadi, Audrey1 aProst, Bastien1 aDalloux-Chioccioli, Jessica1 aKermarrec, Alice1 aMeynier, Anne1 aBertrand-Michel, Justine1 aTchapla, Alain1 aChaminade, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4246-544X0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 June 21, v. 1673 p.463093-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4630933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245014300201300001800344500002000362520192500382592002802307596006902335650002102404650003202425650002802457650001302485650000802498650001802506650002002524650002102544650001802565650002602583650001402609650001902623650001402642650002302656650001102679650000902690650001802699650001802717650001702735650002002752650001402772650002002786650002402806650001202830650001302842651001302855700005702868700002202925700002202947700002202969773013702991856007503128852000903203655001203212IND60783581020221118053544.0220720e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078358102DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.141802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuggins, Lucas G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1384-288612aA multipronged next‐generation sequencing metabarcoding approach unearths hyperdiverse and abundant dog pathogen communities in Cambodia  ap. 1933-1950.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent surveys in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, have identified canine vector‐borne pathogens (VBPs), including those with zoonotic potential, as highly prevalent. The lack of veterinary care alongside the close association semidomesticated dogs have with humans in the region exacerbates these zoonotic risks. Nonetheless, the number of studies investigating such pathogens and the threats they pose to dog and human health is limited. Here, we utilize a next‐generation sequencing (NGS)‐based metabarcoding protocol to conduct an assumption‐free characterization of the bacterial, apicomplexan, and kinetoplastid blood‐borne pathogens of free‐roaming dogs from across Cambodia. From 467 dogs at five field sites, 62% were infected with one of eight confirmed pathogens, comprising Anaplasma platys (32%), Ehrlichia canis (20%), Hepatozoon canis (18%), Babesia vogeli (14%), Mycoplasma haemocanis (13%), the zoonotic pathogen Bartonella clarridgeiae (3%), Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum (0.2%), and Trypanosoma evansi (0.2%). Coinfections of between two and four VBPs were common with 28% of dogs found to have a mixed infection. Moreover, DNA from putatively infectious agents belonging to the bacterial family and genera Coxiella, Mycobacterium, Neisseria, Rickettsiaceae, Treponema, and two uncharacterized Mycoplasma species were identified, in addition to protozoan genera Colpodella, Parabodo, and Bodo. Using a multiple logistic regression model, the presence of ectoparasites, abnormal mucous membranes, anemia, and total protein were found as predictors of canine VBP exposure. This study represents the first time an NGS metabarcoding technique has been used to holistically detect the bacterial and protozoan hemoparasites communities of dogs through an in‐depth survey, highlighting the power of such methods to unearth a wide spectrum of pathogenic organisms in an unbiased manner.  aPublisher supplied data  aLP170100187cAustralian Research Council and Bayer Animal Health 3aAnaplasma platys 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBartonella clarridgeiae 3aCoxiella 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aEhrlichia canis 3aHepatozoon canis 3aMycobacterium 3aMycoplasma haemocanis 3aNeisseria 3aRickettsiaceae 3aTreponema 3aTrypanosoma evansi 3aanemia 3adogs 3aectoparasites 3ahemoparasites 3ahuman health 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3aprotein content 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3azoonoses 3aCambodia1 aColella, Vito1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4903-14791 aKoehler, Anson V.1 aSchunack, Bettina1 aTraub, Rebecca J.0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2022 July, v. 69, no. 4 p.1933-1950dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.141803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014500169300001600314520127200330592002801602650001101630650001401641650002801655650002401683650002601707650001101733650001301744651001001757653001801767653001001785653001301795653001601808653001001824700001801834700002101852700001801873700001601891700001701907700001801924773010801942856008502050852000902135655001202144IND60570413520221119174534.0181002e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057041352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandhi, Drasti10aTesting the numerical models for boulder transport through high energy marine wave event: An example from southern Saurashtra, western India  ap. 209-216.  aPresence of large boulders along rocky coasts can be used as archives to reconstruct past extreme wave event history, vital for the coastal hazard assessment. Dimensions of boulders lying in supratidal zone have been used to reconstruct the origin of wave responsible for their transport and processes. There are several mathematical equations available which take into account submerged, subaerial and joint bounded block scenarios for boulder transport to estimate the wave height required to transport the boulders to their final position. However, there are limited studies which validate these equations using modeling and observational analysis. Navabandar coast, situated in western India provides an excellent opportunity for such analysis as there exists three boulders derived from shore platform during the November 1982 storm. We present the analysis of these boulders and event history of region to conclude that all the mathematical equations overestimate the wave heights required to dislodge and transport these boulders by at least 5 times the actual event. We emphasize that there is a vital need to re-evaluate and improve the existing equations considering the local control variables for better visualization of ‘palaeo’ tsunami/storm events.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aequations 3ahazard characterization 3amathematical models 3aobservational studies 3astorms 3atsunamis 3aIndia 0aPalaeotsunami 0aStorm 0aBoulders 0aArabian Sea 0aIndia1 aChavare, K.A.1 aPrizomwala, S.P.1 aBhatt, Nilesh1 aBhatt, N.Y.1 aMohan, Kapil1 aRastogi, B.K.0 tQuaternary international.g2017 July 15, v. 444 p.209-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245011500163300001200278500001900290520216600309592002802475650000802503650002502511650002202536650001002558650002202568650000902590650003102599650001002630650000702640650002002647650004302667650002402710650001902734650001602753650001402769650001402783700001902797700001702816700001602833700001902849773012902868856007602997852000903073655001203082IND60722904120221120171415.0210108s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072290412DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv33n2Ab1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhary, A.

Semen was collected from 9 Marwari stallions (6 ejaculates per stallion) of 3 different age groups (2 to 4 years, GI; 4 to 6 years, GII; and >6 years, GIII) twice a week using an artificial vagina by allowing the stallions to mount a mare. The collected ejaculate was divided into 2 parts. Part A was used for evaluation of various seminal parameters (colour, consistency, total volume, gel volume, gel-free volume, pH, progressive sperm motility, sperm concentration, sperm viability, total sperm morphological abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal integrity, and DNA integrity). Part B was centrifuged to obtain the sperm pellet for DNA extraction. Six fertility-related marker genes (SPATA1, SP17, PLCz, CRISP3, UBB, and PRM1) were examined in the spermatozoa DNA using PCR. Expression levels of these genes were also studied using quantitative real-time PCR. Data obtained were analysed statistically by one-way or two-way analysis of variance using the SPSS computer program (version 20.0; IBM Corp.). No significant difference was observed among the GI, GII, and GIII stallions for seminal parameters, except mean sperm concentration, which was lowest in 2- to 4-year-old stallions (146.06±11.50 million mL−1), intermediate in stallions >6 years old (182.03±8.51 million mL−1), and highest in stallions of 4 to 6 years (270.92±9.12 million mL−1; P<0.01). The study demonstrated that all six fertility-related genes showed differential expression in stallions from the GI, GII, and GIII groups. In addition, expression levels of the same genes varied across individuals. Expression of SPATA1, SP17, PLCz, CRISP3, UBB, and PRM1 genes was reduced in stallions below 4 years of age compared with older stallions. This result suggests that expression of these genes increases with age, although possibly only up to a certain age. We inferred that stallions around 4–6 years of age can be considered optimum to use for breeding purposes, provided seminal parameters are normal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalysis of variance 3aartificial vagina 3acolor 3acomputer software 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3amares 3apH 3aplasma membrane 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3astallions 3aviability1 aPurohit, G.

In goats, our previous studies have demonstrated the importance of male sexual activity for an efficient reactivation of the gonadotrope axis assessed through ovulation and blood LH pulsatility. In the present experiment, we assessed whether the level of male sexual activity would also induce differential activation of two brain regions of key importance for the reactivation of GnRH activity, namely the medial preoptic area and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. In both structures, we observed a differential activation of Fos in females, depending on the level of buck sexual activity. Indeed, goats unexposed to males showed low levels of expression of Fos while those exposed to sexually inactive bucks showed an intermediate level of Fos expression. Finally, the highest level of Fos expression was found in females exposed to sexually active males. However, and contrary to our initial hypothesis, we were not able to find any specific activation of kisspeptin cells in the arcuate nucleus following the introduction of highly sexually active males. As a whole, these results demonstrate that the level of male sexual activity is a key factor to stimulate brain regions involved in the control of the gonadotrope axis in the context of the male effect in goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanestrus 3aanovulation 3ablood 3abucks 3afemales 3agoats 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3amale effect 3apreoptic area 3asheep 0aSeasonality 0aReproduction 0aMale/female interaction 0aOvulation 0ac-Fos 0aKisspeptin1 aPortillo, Wendy1 aDubois, Jean-Philippe1 aDuarte, Gerardo1 aFlores, José A.1 aChemineau, Philippe1 aKeller, Matthieu1 aParedes, Raúl G.1 aDelgadillo, José A.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 165 p.173-178dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245009000209300001600299520142900315592002801744653000801772653000901780653002101789653002001810653001801830653000901848653003001857700001801887700002101905700001701926700001901943700002601962700001801988700002602006773010002032856008302132852000902215655001202224IND60530826420221121232158.0160721e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053082642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrep.2015.11.0182doi7 aPMC55983872pmcid7 a289558112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Márcia10aHuman carboxylesterase 2: Studies on the role of glycosylation for enzymatic activity  ap. 105-110.  aHuman carboxylesterase 2 (hCES2) is a glycoprotein involved in the metabolism of drugs and several environmental xenobiotics, whose crystallization has been proved to be a challenging task. This limitation could partly be due to glycosylation heterogeneity and has delayed the disclosure of the 3D structure of hCES2 which would be of upmost relevance for the development of new substrates and inhibitors. The present work evaluated the involvement of glycans in hCES2 activity and thermo stability in an attempt to find alternative active forms of the enzyme that might be adequate for structure elucidation.Partial or non-glycosylated forms of a secreted form of hCES2 have been obtained by three approaches: (i) enzymatic deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F; (ii) incubation with the inhibitor tunicamycin; ii) site directed mutagenesis of each or both N-glycosylation sites.Deglycosylated protein did not show a detectable decrease in enzyme activity. On the other hand, tunicamycin led to decreased levels of secreted hCES2 but the enzyme was still active. In agreement, mutation of each and both N-glycosylation sites led to decreased levels of secreted active hCES2. However, the thermostability of the glycosylation mutants was decreased.The results indicated that glycans are involved, to some extent in protein folding in vivo, however, removal of glycans does not abrogate the activity of secreted hCES2.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCES 0ahCES 0aCarboxylesterase 0aDeglycosylation 0aGlycosylation 0ahCES 0aSite directed mutagenesis1 aLamego, Joana1 aBandeiras, Tiago1 aCastro, Rute1 aTomás, Hélio1 aCoroadinha, Ana Sofia1 aCosta, Júlia1 aSimplício, Ana Luisa0 tBiochemistry and Biophysics Reports.g2016 Mar., v. 5 p.105-110dElsevier B.V.x2405-58087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2015.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007800164300002000242520152800262592002801790650002901818650001301847650002501860650001801885650002201903650001901925650001601944650004801960650001302008650001802021650001402039650001802053650002802071700003502099700002602134700001802160700002802178700002002206773012402226856007402350852000902424655001202433IND60617194920221119050225.0181024e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061719492DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra04361b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourenço, Cláudio10aEffects of bovine serum albumin on light activated antimicrobial surfaces  ap. 34252-34258.  aBovine serum albumin (BSA) is currently recommended as an interfering substance to emulate organic soiling, in evaluating the efficacy of disinfectants. The European Standard recommends 0.03% BSA to test clean conditions and 0.3% for dirty conditions. Reactive oxygen species are known to exert excellent antimicrobial activity with low specificity against a broad range of pathogens. Herein, we present our data from the first study of the effects of the addition of BSA on the antibacterial activity of light activated antimicrobial surfaces. Light activated antimicrobial surfaces were made from polyurethane swell-encapsulated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with the light active triarylmethane dye, crystal violet (PU-AuNP-CV). The antibacterial efficacy of the antimicrobial substrates was tested against two strains of Staphylococcus aureus 8325-4, a well-characterised laboratory strain and MRSA 4742, a recent clinical isolate, in the presence of 0.1% to 1% BSA by irradiating the substrates with a fluorescent lamp (300 lux). After 6 hours of irradiation, the number of surviving bacteria was determined. The results showed that BSA reduced the antibacterial efficacy of all the PU-AuNP-CV surfaces with increasing BSA concentrations resulting in a progressive reduction in antibacterial activity towards the bacteria tested. However, the light activated surfaces did perform well at 0.1 and 0.25% BSA levels, showing they may have potential for real world environments with low levels of organic soiling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abovine serum albumin 3adisinfectants 3afluorescent lamps 3agentian violet 3airradiation 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3ananogold 3aorganic soils 3apathogens 3apolyurethanes 3areactive oxygen species1 aMacDonald, Tommyq(Thomas J.),1 aGavriilidis, Asterios1 aAllan, Elaine1 aMacRobert, Alexander J.1 aParkin, Ivan P.0 tRSC advances.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 8, no. 60 p.34252-34258dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra04361b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04095naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012600169300001600295520233800311592002802649650002002677650001902697650001202716650001102728650001002739650001702749650000802766650001002774650002202784650001402806650001402820650002202834650002502856650001302881650001602894650001502910653001302925653001302938653001802951653001302969700002502982700002403007700002103031700002303052700001903075700002803094700001703122700002103139700001803160700002203178700002303200700002103223700002003244773012403264856008403388852000903472655001203481IND60591260620221120224816.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059126062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2017.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoubli, Jean P.10aHow many pygmy marmoset (Cebuella Gray, 1870) species are there? A taxonomic re-appraisal based on new molecular evidence  ap. 170-182.  aThe pygmy marmoset, Cebuella pygmaea, the smallest of the New World monkeys, has one of the largest geographical distributions of the Amazonian primates. Two forms have been recognized: Cebuella pygmaea pygmaea (Spix, 1823), and C. p. niveiventris Lönnberg, 1940. In this study, we investigated if the separation of pygmy marmosets into these two clades can be corroborated by molecular data. We also examine and compare coloration of the pelage in light of the new molecular results. We analyzed the mtDNA cytochrome b gene and, for the first time for any Neotropical primate, we used a reduced representation genome sequencing approach (ddRADseq) to obtain data for recently collected, geographically representative samples from the Rio Japurá, a northern tributary of the Rio Solimões and from the Javarí, Jutaí, Juruá, Madeira and Purus river basins, all tributaries south of the Solimões. We estimated phylogenies and diversification times under both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference criteria. Our analysis showed two highly supported clades, with intraclade divergences much smaller than interclade divergences, indicating two species of Cebuella: one from the Rio Japurá and one to the south of Solimões. The interpretation of our results in light of the current taxonomy is not trivial however. Lönnberg stated that the type of Spix’s pygmy marmoset (type locality ‘near Tabatinga’) was obtained from the south of the Solimões, and his description of the distinct niveiventris from Lago Ipixuna, south of the Solimões and several hundred kilometres east of Tabatinga, was based on a comparison with specimens that he determined as typical pygmaea that were from the upper Rio Juruá (south of the Solimões). As such it remains uncertain whether the name pygmaea should be applicable to the pygmy marmosets north of the Rio Solimões (Tabatinga type locality) or south (near Tabatinga but across the Solimões). Finally, our analysis of pelage coloration revealed three phenotypic forms: (1) south of the Rio Solimoes, (2) Eirunepé-Acre, upper Juruá basin; and (3) Japurá. More samples from both sides of Solimões in the region of Tabatinga will be necessary to ascertain the exact type locality for Spix’s pygmaea and to resolve the current uncertainties surrounding pygmy marmoset taxonomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCallitrichidae 3aCebidae 3abasins 3acolor 3acytochrome b 3afur 3agenes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3astatistical analysis 3ataxonomy 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 0aAmazonia 0aCebuella 0aPhylogenomics 0aTaxonomy1 ada Silva, Maria N.F.1 aRylands, Anthony B.1 aNash, Stephen D.1 aBertuol, Fabrício1 aNunes, Mário,1 aMittermeier, Russell A.1 aByrne, Hazel1 aSilva, Felipe E.1 aRöhe, Fábio1 aSampaio, Iracilda1 aSchneider, Horacio1 aFarias, Izeni P.1 aHrbek, Tomáš,0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2018 Mar., v. 120 p.170-182dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2017.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009400176300001600270520136400286592002801650650001401678650001301692650001001705650001501715653002201730653001901752653002001771653002401791700002001815700002201835773009101857856008501948852000902033655001202042IND60551322720221122230646.0161018e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055132272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, Fabiano A.10aConscious distance monitoring and perceived exertion in light-deprived cycling time trial  ap. 211-216.  aThe monitoring of distance is crucial to calculate the metabolic requirement and the ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) for a given exercise bout. Visual cues provide valuable information for distance estimation, navigation and orientation. The present study investigated if light deprivation may affect the conscious monitoring of distance, RPE and associative thoughts to exercise (ATE) during a 20-km cycling time trial (TT20km). Eleven male, endurance cyclists performed two TT20km in illuminated-control and light-deprived laboratory. They were asked to self-report RPE and ATE when they perceived they had completed each 2km. Results: The light deprivation resulted in elongated perceived distance at each actual 2km, rather than in illuminated-control trial (P<0.05). Although there was no difference in RPE when it was plotted as a function of the perceived distance, RPE was lowered in light-deprived environment when it was plotted as a function of the actual distance (P<0.05). Additionally, ATE was lowered during TT20km in light deprivation (P<0.01); however, pacing and performance were unaffected in light-deprived environment. Conclusion: Results suggest that pacing and performance were regulated through a system which was unaffected in light-deprived environment, despite the altered conscious distance monitoring and perceptive responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicycling 3aexercise 3amales 3amonitoring 0aNighttime cycling 0aInternal clock 0aPacing strategy 0aExercise regulation1 aSantos, Tony M.1 aPires, Flávio O.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 165 p.211-216dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013000170300001600300520143500316592002801751650001601779650001801795650001801813650002801831650001301859650001101872700002201883700003301905773010401938856004802042852000902090655001202099IND50071654420221120052337.0140104e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007165442DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-013-1150-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColina-Coca, Clara10aNutritional Composition of Processed Onion: S-Alk(en)yl-L-cysteine Sulfoxides, Organic Acids, Sugars, Minerals, and Vitamin C  ap. 289-298.  aThe aim of this work was to study the effect of onion high-pressure processing (HPP) and HPP combined with freeze-drying and pulverization, focusing on onion nutritional attributes in terms of S-alk(en)yl-L-cysteine sulfoxides, organic acid, sugar, mineral, and vitamin C contents. Allium cepa L. var. cepa, "Recas" was treated at T1 (200 MPa/25°C/5 min), T2 (400MPa/25 °C/5 min), and T3 (600 MPa/25 °C/5 min). After treatment, high-pressure (HP)-treated (T1, T2, and T3) and untreated or non-HP-treated (T0) samples were frozen (diced onion). Subsequently, part of the diced samples was freeze-dried and pulverized (pulverized onion). In general, the freeze-drying process of fresh onion maintained the concentration of S-alk(en)yl-l-cysteine sulfoxides (ACSOs), organic acids, total sugars, total protein, and minerals, and significantly increased vitamin C concentration. Regarding HPP, the concentration of ACSOs, total sugars, and vitamin C of fresh onion was preserved at the three HPP assayed (200, 400, 600 MPa for 5 min at 25 °C); however, for some organic acids and minerals, small decreases were found. In HP-treated onion (especially for treatment at 400 MPa), freeze-drying retained the levels of the major organic acids, total sugars, total protein, and minerals (Ca, Fe, Mg, K, Na, Zn, Mn, and Se), and increased the content of ascorbic acid and total vitamin C. ©Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aascorbic acid 3afreeze drying 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aminerals 3aonions1 ade Ancos, Begoña1 aSánchez-Moreno, Concepción0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2014 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.289-298dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-013-1150-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012500182300001400307520140500321592002801726650001401754650002301768650002001791650002101811650001001832650001901842650001501861650002201876650001401898650001401912650001401926650000901940650001301949650001601962650001201978650002501990650002902015650000902044650003702053650002402090650004102114700002402155700002302179700002102202773008602223856004802309852000902357655001202366IND4447283620221120085747.0121003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444728362DNAL7 a209788472pmid7 a10.1007/s10646-010-0558-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Sandra A.10aToxicological effects of the aquatic herbicide, fluridone, on male water mites (Hydrachnidiae: Arrenurus: Megaluracarus)  ap. 81-87.  aThe acute toxicities for technical grade fluridone (Sonar™) and the commercial formulation of fluridone (Sonar®AS) were assessed for male water mites (Hydrachnidiae: Arrenurus: Megaluracarus). Signs of toxicity were evaluated by detection of locomotor dysfunction or death after exposure to concentrations of 100,000, 10,000, 1,000, and 100 μg/L of Sonar™ and 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, 100, and 10 μg/L of Sonar®AS in US EPA, moderately hard reconstituted water (MHRW). The median effective concentration (EC50) was 891 and 631 μg/L for Sonar™ at 48 and 96 h and less than 10 μg/L for Sonar®AS at 96 h. Increased duration of exposure to Sonar®AS from 48 to 96 h had a significant effect on increasing the rate of combined morbidity and mortality. At the lowest concentration of Sonar®AS tested, which is half the concentration allowed within 400 m of any functioning potable water intake for human usage, 40% of the mites were adversely affected at 48 h and 70% were affected after 96 h of exposure. This study demonstrates that Sonar®AS is 60-fold more toxic to water mites than the active ingredient alone. At currently acceptable application rates of 90–150 μg/L fluridone, the addition of ingredients classified as inert, as in Sonar®AS, result in an increased risk of adverse effects on populations of male water mites (Arrenurus: Megaluracarus) in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArrenurus 3aactive ingredients 3aadverse effects 3aapplication rate 3adeath 3adrinking water 3aecosystems 3aexposure duration 3afluridone 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arisk 3atoxicity 3awater mites 2aAnimals 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aLocomotionxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMitesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPyridonesxtoxicity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aFrancis, Bettina M.1 aJarrell, Wesley M.1 aSoucek, David J.0 tEcotoxicology.g2011 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.81-87dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-010-0558-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010200207300001600309520174400325592002802069650000802097650002102105650001502126650001602141650001602157650001302173650002102186650001502207650002402222650001602246650002102262653002302283653001902306653002202325653002302347700001602370700001502386773010802401856008602509852000902595655001202604IND60539702520221119132403.0190219e20140606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053970252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongshou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8588-122X14aThe daily evaporation characteristics of deeply buried phreatic water in an extremely arid region  ap. 172-179.  aMeasurements of the daily evaporation characteristics of deeply buried phreatic water in an extremely arid area are reported. The results are used to analyze the mechanism responsible for water movement in the groundwater–soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. A closed PVC greenhouse was set up on Gobi land at the top of the Mogao Grottoes where phreatic water is more than 200m deep. An air-conditioning unit and an automatic weighing scale were placed inside the greenhouse to condense and monitor phreatic evaporation and soil water changes in this extremely arid region. Soil temperature and humidity at various depths (0–40cm) and other meteorological factors were also recorded on a sub-hourly basis. The relationship between evaporated water and soil water movement was analyzed by observing changes in soil weight, the condensate from the air-conditioning unit, and air moisture. The results show that phreatic water evaporation occurs from this deeply buried source in this extremely arid zone. The daily characteristics are consistent with the variation in the Sun’s radiation intensity (i.e. both show a sinusoidal behavior). In the daytime, most of the soil water does not evaporate but moves to cooler sub-layers. In the afternoon, the shallow soil layer absorbs moisture as the temperature decreases. At night, an abundance of water vapor moves upwards from the sub-layers and supplements the evaporated and downward-moving moisture of the superstratum in the daytime, but there is no evaporation. The stable, upwardly migrating vapor and film water is supported by geothermy and comes from phreatic water, the daily evaporation characteristics of which changes according to soil temperature when it reaches the ground.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aarid zones 3aevaporation 3agreenhouses 3ahumidity 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water movement 3awater vapor 3aweighing devices 0aExtra-arid regions 0aMogao Grottoes 0aGreenhouse method 0aCondensation water1 aWang, Wanfu1 aLiu, Benli0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 June 06, v. 514 p.172-179dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245011200167300001800279520180600297592002802103650001202131650001902143650001502162650002502177650001502202650001402217650001502231650002202246650001102268650001102279650001102290650002102301650001702322650001702339650001502356651001102371700002102382773010102403856008702504852000902591655001202600IND4475473720221122064027.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447547372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Lucas10aHow will combined changes in water demand and climate affect water availability in the Zambezi river basin?  ap. 1061-1072.  aMany of the world’s large international river basins, which are the principal sources of freshwater for billions of people and nature, are likely to experience increasing stress over the coming decades. In many cases this stress will be due to changes both on the water supply (because of climatic changes) and demand side. Only few studies have examined the implications of water demand and climatic changes jointly. We combine a comprehensive set of water demand scenarios and climate change projections with a hydrological model to estimate future water availability in key parts of the Zambezi river basin (ZRB) until 2050. We focus on the ZRB because it is both substantively important and analytically challenging in terms of demonstrating the value of our methodological approach: it is one of the largest freshwater catchments in Africa and worldwide; it has a complex hydrological and political geography; and it experiences only minor water stress today. The results show that our approach is feasible and can produce valuable results. Our results indicate that current water abundance in most parts of the ZRB is unlikely to last. While, perhaps surprisingly, climatic changes are likely to have only relatively small effects on water availability, population and economic growth as well as expansion of irrigated agriculture and water transfers are likely to have very important transboundary impacts. Such impacts involve drastically reduced runoff in the dry season at key locations and changing (relative) shares of ZRB countries in the basin’s total runoff and water demand. These results imply that effective governance mechanisms for water allocation and for dealing with flow variability should be set up within the next few years in order to manage the situation cooperatively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adry season 3aeconomic development 3afreshwater 3ageography 3agovernance 3airrigated farming 3amodels 3apeople 3arunoff 3awater allocation 3awater stress 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aAfrica1 aBernauer, Thomas0 tGlobal environmental change.g2011 Aug., v. 21, no. 3 p.1061-1072dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245026700206520207600473592002802549650004402577650002202621650001502643650001502658650002102673650001102694650002602705650001502731650003702746650001302783650001302796650001302809650001202822650002902834650002502863653001402888653004802902653004302950653003002993653001303023700002003036700003503056700006303091700002403154773011403178856008503292852000903377655001203386IND60775931520221123014358.0220706e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077593152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4630992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohebbi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0359-328110aDispersive micro–solid–phase extraction of aflatoxins from commercial soy milk samples using a green vitamin–based metal–organic framework as an efficient sorbent followed by high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry determination  aIn the current work, for the first time, a vitamin–based metal–organic framework constructed from cobalt ions and vitamin B₃ has been used as a sorbent in dispersive micro–solid–phase extraction. The proposed method was used to extract and enrich aflatoxins (B₁, B₂, G₁, and G₂) from soy milk samples before their quantification by high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. In this work, first the metal–organic framework was synthesized and characterized using techniques such as X–ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, and energy–dispersive X–ray spectroscopy. Then it was used as an efficient sorbent in the proposed dispersive micro–solid–phase extraction. For this purpose, after precipitating the proteins of soy milk sample with the aid of trichloroacetic acid, the supernatant phase was taken, mixed with the synthesized sorbent, and vortexed. After centrifuging, the analytes loaded on the adsorbent were eluted with methanol to transfer them into an organic phase which was compatible with the subsequently employed separation system. The adsorption capacity of the synthesized MOF for aflatoxins B₁, B₂, G₁, and G₂ were 0.77, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.54 mg g–¹, respectively. Under the best experimental situations, satisfactory outcomes including acceptable extraction recoveries (64–75%), low limits of detection (11.3–48.2 ng L–¹) and quantification (42.8–161.6 ng L–¹), and good repeatability (relative standard deviations equal or less than 4.0 and 4.7% for intra– and inter– day precisions, respectively) were obtained. In addition, green synthesis of the metal–organic framework (using vitamin B₃ as a linker, water as the reaction solvent, and mild conditions) and usage low amount or volume of the adsorbent and organic solvents during the extraction process were the other beneficial aspects of this work which caused the suggested analytical method to be environmentally friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achemical species 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3asolvents 3asoymilk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atrichloroacetic acid 0aAflatoxin 0aDispersive micro–solid–phase extraction 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography 0aMetal–organic framework 0aSoy milk1 aNemati, Mahboob1 aAfshar Mogaddam, Mohammad Reza1 aFarajzadeh, Mir Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3746-00111 aLotfipour, Farzaneh0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 June 21, v. 1673 p.463099-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4630993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014700167300001600314520177600330592002802106650000902134650002602143650002102169650001302190650001302203650002602216650001602242650001702258650001102275650001602286650000902302650001402311650001102325650000902336650002102345650001502366650001002381650001502391650001502406651001002421653003202431653002302463653002502486653001702511653001802528700001502546773010802561856008502669852000902754655001202763IND60570414020221119174459.0181002e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057041402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuamar, M.F.10aDo the common natural pollen trapping media behave similarly?

The reasons behind the irregularity in the representation of palynoassemblages amongst the various natural pollen trapping media could be manifold such as vegetation composition and its density, habit, habitat, timing of flowering of a particular plant and collection of samples, pollination types and modes, genetics, physiology, morphology, age of tree and bark, topography, pollen sinking speed, pollen catching/trapping capacity of the respective media, types of pollen transport (horizontal pollen transport and vertical pollen transport), differences in pollen transport distance, wind speed, its pace and direction, rainfall, specific gravity, climatic conditions, and human activities (including over-cultivation and overgrazing), etc. The study could aid in the preferential selection of natural pollen trapping substrate to understand the pollen deposition pattern in any area in question which has significant proposition for the reconstruction of past vegetation and climate, allowing the improved resolution of palaeoenvironmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3abotanical composition 3aclimatic factors 3agenetics 3ahabitats 3amosses and liverworts 3aovergrazing 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3apollination 3arain 3asediments 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aspecific gravity 3atopography 3atrees 3avegetation 3awind speed 3aIndia 0aComparative pollen analysis 0aPollen assemblages 0aNatural pollen traps 0aChhattisgarh 0aCentral India1 aBera, S.K.0 tQuaternary international.g2017 July 15, v. 444 p.217-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010000169300001600269520174800285592002802033650001202061650001602073650001402089650002802103650001402131650002102145650001102166653002402177653003002201653003202231653002202263653004702285700001802332773010802350856008602458852000902544655001202553IND60539702720221119130726.0190318e20140606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053970272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi-Hua10aSolution of two key issues in arbitrary three-dimensional discrete fracture network flow models  ap. 281-296.  aIt is necessary to consider a great number of arbitrarily developed fractures in applications involving realistic 3-d fracture network flow models of rock masses. In order to model the fluid flow in a complicated arrangement of discrete fracture networks (DFNs), two core issues have to be solved. Firstly, how does one identify the connection relationships between fractures in the 3-d arbitrary fracture network? Secondly, how can one calculate numerically the fluid flow in arbitrarily-shaped 2-d domains? This paper first proposes that the boundaries of all enclosed blocks form flow pathways. All enclosed blocks can be identified using a 3-d block cutting method. The boundaries of the blocks are composed of loops which are formed by intersecting lines between all faces (fractures and other surfaces). Therefore, the connection relationships between fractures can be determined according to the linkages of the loops. Accordingly, the linkages of the finite element nodes between different faces can also be determined. On the other hand, the fluid flow occurring in the fractures can be treated as a 2-d continuous flow within the arbitrarily shaped loops in the fracture’s local coordinates. We propose that these loops can be meshed into triangles using a method of simplex triangulation of the arbitrarily shaped domain. Then, according to the linkages between nodes, the global conductivity matrix can be assembled and the solution of the equations governing flow can be derived. Three cases are used to validate the model. Finally, an analysis is made of a practical engineering example (with 8914 lines of intersection and 4188 loops) which shows that the proposed flow model is practicable and can deal with complicated DFNs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acutting 3aengineering 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3ahydrology 3amodel validation 3amodels 0aFractured rock mass 0aDiscrete fracture network 0aFracture network flow model 0a3-d block cutting 0aTriangulation of arbitrarily shaped domain1 aYin, Jian-Min0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 June 06, v. 514 p.281-296dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245006000174520146000234592002801694650001401722650001701736650001901753650001501772650002601787650001201813650001601825653002601841653001701867653001701884653001901901653002201920700002201942700002401964700003101988700006102019773011402080856008502194852000902279655001202288IND60775931920221123014325.0220706e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077593192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiagioni, Valentina10aTaming Taylor-Aris dispersion through chaotic advection  aTaylor-Aris dispersion represents an undesired phenomenon in pressure-driven liquid chromatography, often responsible for the unchecked increase of the Height Equivalent of the Theoretical Plate (HETP) when high throughput operating conditions are sought. Previous work on the subject showed how it is possible to contain the augmented dispersion in empty microchannels by inducing cross-sectional velocity components yielding an overall helical structure of the flow streamlines. Here, we explore the possibility of further reducing axial dispersion by devising flow conditions that give rise to chaotic streamlines. A three-dimensional steady flow generated by the combination of a pressure-driven Poiseuille flow and an electroosmotically-induced spatially periodic flow is used as a case study. Brenner’s macrotransport approach is used to predict the axial dispersion coefficient of a diffusing solute in flows possessing regular, partially chaotic and globally chaotic kinematic features. Accurate Lagrangian-stochastic simulations of particle ensembles are used to validate the predictions obtained through Brenner’s paradigm. Our findings suggest that the Taylor-Aris phenomenon can be altogether suppressed in the limit of globally chaotic kinematics. A theoretical interpretation of this outcome is developed by combining macrotransport theory with established results of the spectral approach to mixing in advecting-diffusing chaotic flows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3acase studies 3adispersibility 3akinematics 3aliquid chromatography 3asolutes 3asteady flow 0aLiquid chromatography 0aOpen channel 0aOpen tubular 0aElectroosmotic 0aChaotic advection1 aVenditti, Claudia1 aAdrover, Alessandra1 aGiona, M.q(Massimiliano),1 aCerbelli, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3906-65950 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 June 21, v. 1673 p.463110-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4631103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245017300172300001600345500001400361520139600375536005001771592002801821596006101849650001601910650001601926650001801942650001501960650002001975650002201995650001502017650002902032650001602061650001302077650002002090650001602110650002702126650001402153650001902167650002302186650001002209650002002219650001402239650001302253650001602266650001702282650002102299650002602320650001702346650001102363653001702374653003002391653003502421653001302456700002202469700002702491700002102518700002002539773012802559856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60720427120221120234423.0201214e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072042712DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2020.18504592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassar, Ahmed Y.10aComparative ameliorative actions of extracted bradykinin potentiating fraction from cobra snake venom and synthetic antioxidants on hepatic tissue of aflatoxicosed rats  ap. 593-602.  aNAL-light  aMycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus, Penicillium and other genera which contaminate food and exhibit hazardous effects on humans and animals. Aflatoxins (AFs) caused liver necrosis, fibrosis. In the present study, we planned to evaluate the action of bradykinin potentiating factor (BPF) extracted from Egyptian cobra snake venom and synthetic antioxidants; butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and oltipraz (OPZ) on the hepatic tissue of aflatoxicosed rats. Aflatoxicosis caused a significant increase of nitric oxide (NO) and lipid peroxidation as malondialdehyde (MDA) associated with a significant decrease in the level of total thiols, glutathione (GSH), and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and transferase (GST). In addition to a decrease in the counts of white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MONO), eosinophils (EOS), red blood cells (RBCs) and an increase in neutrophil counts (NEUT) as well as a significant decrease in the gene expression of hepatic interleukin-1β (Il-1β). The previous changes were confirmed by histopathological alterations. Treatment of aflatoxicosed rats with any of BPF, BHT or OPZ resulted in amelioration of the oxidative stress parameters, blood picture and hepatic IL-1β with improvement in histological features. In conclusion, either BPF, BHT or OPZ can be used for the treatment of aflatoxicosis.  aThis work was supported by Assiut University.  aPublisher supplied data  cAssiut Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009169 3aAspergillus 3aPenicillium 3aaflatoxicosis 3aaflatoxins 3aanimal research 3ablood cell counts 3abradykinin 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3aeosinophils 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amonocytes 3anecrosis 3aneutrophils 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3asecondary metabolites 3asnake venoms 3athiols 0aAflatoxin B1 0abutylated hydroxy toluene 0abradykinin potentiating factor 0aoltipraz1 aMahgoub, Safaa A.1 aOmar, Hossam-El-Din M.1 aBakkar, Sally M.1 aOsman, Amany A.0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 48, no. 1 p.593-602dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2020.18504593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013000173300001800303520117100321592002801492650001001520650001501530650001201545650001201557650001301569650000901582650001101591650002101602650001201623650001301635650001701648650001301665650000901678650001101687650001101698650001801709650000901727700001601736700001601752700001301768773010501781856008901886852000901975655001201984IND60580510720221118044906.0170921e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058051072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b021472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guangxue10aConcentration, Enrichment, and Partitioning Behavior of Heavy Metals in Ash from a Down-Fired Furnace Burning Anthracite Coal  ap. 9381-9392.  aThe concentrations, enrichment, partitioning behavior, emission factors, and leaching characteristics of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Cr) emitted from a 3.25 MW pilot-scale down-fired furnace burning a typically Chinese anthracite coal are studied in this study. The results show that all six heavy metals are highly enriched in the fine fly ash, whereas they are depleted in the bottom ash. The enrichment of heavy metals increases significantly as the fly ash particle size decreases, which is found to be in the order of Pb, Cd > Cu, Zn > Ni, Cr. A surface deposition model is developed in the study to describe the correlation between metal concentrations and particle sizes, which shows that surface reactions are the rate-limiting step in condensation of heavy metals on fly ash surface. The study also shows that the removal efficiency could exceed 98% for Cd, Cu, and Ni when using an electrostatic precipitator, while it drops to 85–92% for Pb, Zn, and Cr. In addition, the study also finds that the extractable concentrations of heavy metals in the fly ash are relatively low according to the leaching tests; even acids are used as the leachant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3abottom ash 3aburning 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoal 3acopper 3aemissions factor 3afly ash 3afurnaces 3aheavy metals 3aleaching 3alead 3amodels 3anickel 3aparticle size 3azinc1 aZhang, Lili1 aFan, Haiyan1 aHu, Eric0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 31, no. 9 p.9381-9392dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b021473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013400211300001300345520156300358592002801921650002401949650002201973650004401995650002602039650002202065650003002087650001302117650002102130650001502151650001502166650003702181650001102218650002602229650001302255650001802268650001502286650001802301650001402319650003302333650001102366650001502377650001702392650003702409651001002446653001502456653002402471653002502495653002302520653002702543700002102570700002202591700002202613700002302635773010302658856008502761852000902846655001202855IND60530190820221117163544.0180831e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053019082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2015.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalakumaran, M.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7586-779010aMycosynthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles: Optimization, characterization and antimicrobial activity against human pathogens  ap. 8-20.  aThis study was aimed to isolate soil fungi from Kolli and Yercaud Hills, South India with the ultimate objective of producing antimicrobial nanoparticles. Among 65 fungi tested, the isolate, Bios PTK 6 extracellularly synthesized both silver and gold nanoparticles with good monodispersity. Under optimized reaction conditions, the strain Bios PTK 6 identified as Aspergillus terreus has produced extremely stable nanoparticles within 12h. These nanoparticles were characterized by UV–vis. spectrophotometer, HR-TEM, FTIR, XRD, EDX, SAED, ICP-AES and Zetasizer analyses. A. terreus synthesized 8–20nm sized, spherical shaped silver nanoparticles whereas gold nanoparticles showed many interesting morphologies with a size of 10–50nm. The presence and binding of proteins with nanoparticles was confirmed by FTIR study. Interestingly, the myco derived silver nanoparticles exhibited superior antimicrobial activity than the standard antibiotic, streptomycin except against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The leakage of intracellular components such as protein and nucleic acid demonstrated that silver nanoparticles damage the bacterial cells by formation of pores, which affects membrane permeability and finally leads to cell death. Further, presence of nanoparticles in the bacterial membrane and the breakage of cell wall were also observed using SEM. Thus, the obtained results clearly reveal that these antimicrobial nanoparticles could be explored as promising candidates for a variety of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus terreus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanti-infective properties 3abacteria 3abinding proteins 3acell death 3acell walls 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahumans 3amembrane permeability 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anucleic acids 3apathogens 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asoil fungi 3astreptomycin 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aIndia 0aSoil fungi 0aAspergillus terreus 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aGold nanoparticles 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aRamachandran, R.1 aBalashanmugam, P.1 aMukeshkumar, D.J.1 aKalaichelvan, P.T.0 tMicrobiological research.g2016 Jan., v. 182 p.8-20dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2015.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245010200179300001800281520142000299592002801719650004401747650002201791650002201813650001201835650001201847650001401859650001901873650002001892650001301912650001201925650001501937650002101952650001301973650001401986650002002000650002002020650001602040650002202056650002102078650002402099650002102123650001802144700001902162700002102181773012002202856008902322852000902411655001202420IND60580510820221118044917.0170921e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058051082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b022492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReshad, Ali Shemsedin10aThermal Degradation Kinetic Study of Rubber Seed Oil and Its Methyl Esters under Inert Atmosphere  ap. 9642-9651.  aNonedible vegetable oil feedstocks are promising for sustainable production of biodiesel. Thermal decomposition characteristics of the feedstocks and their biodiesel are crucial for handling and quality control. Thermal degradation of rubber seed oil (RSO) and rubber seed oil methyl esters (ROME) was investigated with the help of thermogravimetry. The samples were pyrolyzed from 30 to 800 °C at heating rates of 10 °C/min to 50 °C/min with a 10 °C/min increment under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature window for thermal degradation of RSO and ROME was shifted toward a higher range as the heating rate increased from 10 °C/min to 50 °C/min. A transesterification reaction leads to a decrease in the molecular weight of triglycerides present in the sample (RSO), and this causes a lower thermal stability of the produced product (ROME). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis of evolved gaseous products during pyrolysis revealed the formation of water, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and saturated (alkanes) and unsaturated (alkenes) aliphatic hydrocarbons. Friedman (FRD), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), modified Coat–Redfern (MCR), and Kissinger (KM) methods and Avrami theory were applied to calculate the values of activation energy (E), order of reaction (n), and enthalpy (ΔH). Furthermore, the pre-exponential factor (A), entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) were also calculated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivation energy 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afeedstocks 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3apyrolysis 3aquality control 3arubber seed oil 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols 3avegetable oil1 aTiwari, Pankaj1 aGoud, Vaibhav V.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 31, no. 9 p.9642-9651dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b022493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011100167500002200278520199200300592002802292650001402320650002902334650001202363650001102375650001202386650001002398650001702408650001902425650001902444650001702463650002602480650000902506650001902515650002002534650001102554650001502565651001002580653001802590653001302608653004402621653001502665653001402680700001902694700001502713700001202728700001602740700001502756700001402771773006902785856008402854852000902938655001202947IND60570414720221119174219.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057041472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.06.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Licheng10aHolocene environmental changes in the Horqin desert revealed by OSL dating and δ13C analyses of paleosols  aPre-press version  aThe Horqin desert in northeastern China is located on the climatically-sensitive margin of the East Asian summer monsoon front and the paleosols in the desert potentially provide a record of environmental changes in the region. During the last two decades several paleoenvironmental studies have increased our knowledge of past shifts in the desert-grassland border in the deserts of northeastern China. However, studies of Holocene vegetation changes with high-quality age data are scarce. Here, we present the results of optically stimulated luminescence dating and analyses of magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon and the stable carbon isotope composition of organic matter, and inferred C4 biomass, of the paleosol sequences of the Tuquan and Mutougou sections in the Horqin desert and utilize them to document Holocene environmental changes in the region. The results reveal that the East Asian summer monsoon precipitation gradually increased and previously unstable dunes were semi-stabilized from ∼11 to 9 ka. The semiarid conditions were then replaced by the more humid environment of the Holocene climatic optimum from ∼9 to 5 ka. During the Holocene climatic optimum, the paleosols in the Tuquan and Mutougou sections developed, and the percentage of C4 plants increased and the dunes in the Horqin desert were extensively stabilized. Subsequently, alternation of eolian sand mobilization and paleosol development occurred, indicating that the environment became cold and dry, with temporary wet and warm stages. Estimates of C4 biomass from the two sections demonstrate that the favorable growing conditions for C4 plants extended to at least 45°N in North China during the Holocene. We conclude that Holocene environmental changes in the Horqin desert were controlled by movements of the East Asian summer monsoon rainfall belt on a millennial time scale, and that human activity also played a significant role in environmental change during the late Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adeserts 3adunes 3aluminescence 3amonsoon season 3aorganic matter 3apaleoecology 3apaleosolic soil types 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3avegetation 3aChina 0aHorqin desert 0aHolocene 0aEast Asian summer monsoon rainfall belt 0aOSL dating 0aC4 plants1 aXiong, Shangfa1 aYang, Ping1 aYe, Wei1 aJin, Guiyun1 aWu, Wenwan1 aZhao, Hua0 tQuaternary International.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.06.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100002100183245007500204300001800279520108000297592002801377596008301405650001201488650001601500650001501516650001001531650001301541650001101554650001901565650001101584650001301595650001501608650001401623650001301637700002401650700002001674773015201694856008101846852000901927655001201936IND60548702220221120084049.0160905e20160831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054870222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b020922doi7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b020922chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHough, Blake R.,10aDetailed Kinetic Modeling of Lignin Pyrolysis for Process Optimization  ap. 9147-9153.  aBiomass valorization through thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks is limited by our lack of detailed kinetic models. In addition to adding mechanistic understanding, more detailed models are needed to optimize industrial biomass pyrolysis processes for producing fuels and chemicals. To this end, a kinetic model for lignin pyrolysis involving ∼100 species and 400 reactions is presented which is capable of predicting the temporal evolution of molecules and functional groups during lignin pyrolysis. The model provides information beyond the lumped yields of common pyrolysis models without any fitting, allowing it to cover a wider range of feedstocks and reaction conditions. Good agreement is observed with slow pyrolysis experiments, and an exhaustive global sensitivity analysis using over 2 million simulations sheds light on reactions that contribute most to the variance in model predictions. Model predictions for fast pyrolysis are available, but data from kinetically controlled experiments has yet to be generated for lignin fast pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3abiomass 3aengineering 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3akinetics 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3amoieties 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3avariance1 aSchwartz, Daniel T.1 aPfaendtner, Jim0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Aug. 31, v. 55, no. 34 p.9147-9153dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl54923x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b020923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006600170300001800236520143800254592002801692650001201720650000901732650001601741650001401757650001901771650000901790650002501799650001501824650000901839651001001848700002301858700001801881700001801899700001601917773012401933856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60454426220221119185916.0151103e20151018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045442622DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10411792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guangjun10aEffect of the Qinghai–Tibet Railway on vegetation abundance  ap. 5222-5238.  aLarge-scale engineering projects such as mines and dams cause ecological damage that can persist after construction is complete. The Qinghai–Tibet Railway (QTR) from Golmud to Lhasa was constructed entirely during the Landsat era and began operating in 2006. Therefore, it presents an opportunity for determining both the extent of ecological damage and the time required for some level of natural restoration after a major construction project. We have studied the effect of the QTR construction on vegetation abundance measured using multi-endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) of a time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ images (2001, 2007, 2010) covering the 231 km stretch of the railway from south of Kaixinling Station to north of Chumaerhe Station. We found that the effect of QTR construction on vegetation abundance was limited to within 5.0 km of the tracks, the largest decrease, 2.9%, occurring within 0.125 km of the tracks from 2001 to 2007. There was only 0.4% further decrease in vegetation abundance from 2007 to 2010. We attributed the decrease in vegetation abundance within 0.125 km of the tracks mostly to the accumulation of drifting sand resulting from the barrier of the railway and the measures adopted to keep the sand away from the railway under the prevailing west or northwest winds. It appears that in this sensitive cold desert, vegetation damage was limited to the period of railway construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acold 3aengineering 3arailroads 3aremote sensing 3asand 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3awind 3aChina1 aGillespie, Alan R.1 aLiang, Shihai1 aMushkin, Amit1 aWu, Qingbai0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Oct. 18, v. 36, no. 19-20 p.5222-5238dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10411793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245015100176300002000327520235000347592002802697650002202725650001402747650001702761650002702778650001202805650001202817650001802829650001102847650002302858650001102881650001502892650001402907650001202921650001902933650001002952650001402962650000902976650001302985650002502998650001003023650001303033650001603046700002003062700001803082773014903100856008103249852000903330655001203339IND60583470020221122222131.0171015e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058347002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9988-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsagba, Samuel Ogheneovo10aInfluence of farmyard manure on some morphological and biochemical parameters of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) seedling grown in cadmium-treated soil  ap. 23735-23743.  aThe present study aims to assess the effects of the two kinds of farmyard manure (poultry and pig manures) as amendments for soil on cadmium (Cd) toxicity in plants using cowpea seedlings as plant model. Cd toxicity was evaluated by assessing the effect of the metal on the growth rate and antioxidant status as well as the ability of the plant to metabolise xenobiotic. There was a significantly (p < 0.05) increased concentration of Cd in the root, stem and leaves of cowpea seedlings grown in all the treated soils relative to control. Addition of poultry manure to the soil significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the level of Cd in these component parts of the seedlings and their corresponding bioaccumulation factor in a dose-dependent manner as compared with treatments with Cd pollution without manure addition and Cd pollution with pig manure addition. There was restoration of Cd-induced effect on growth rate parameters to levels comparable to controls in cowpea seedlings grown in Cd-treated soil augmented with poultry manure but not in cowpea seedlings in cadmium-treated soil with pig manure amendments. Similarly, augmentation of Cd-treated soil with pig manure did not alter the Cd-induced effect on the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in leaf, stem and roots, as SOD remained significantly (p < 0.05) decreased and LPO increased relative to control. On the other hand, the levels of SOD and LPO in these parts of cowpea seedlings grown in Cd-treated soils amended with poultry manure were restored to a level not significantly (p > 0.05) different from control. Like in the case of SOD, the Cd-induced inhibition of the activity of xenobiotic metabolising enzymes, aldehyde oxidase and sulphite oxidase remained significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the organs of seedling grown in Cd-treated soil amended with pig manure. Conversely, the Cd-induced effect on the activities of these enzymes was reversed in the organs of seedlings exposed to Cd and poultry manure as it was not significantly (p > 0.05) different from control. In conclusion, the findings of the study revealed that supplementation of Cd-treated soils with pig and poultry manures reversed effects of Cd on cowpea seedlings. However, poultry manure was more effective than pig manure in ameliorating the effects of Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3aaldehydes 3aantioxidants 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3acowpeas 3adose response 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3apig manure 3apollution 3apoultry 3apoultry manure 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asulfites 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswine 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics1 aEzedom, Theresa1 aKadiri, Helen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Oct., v. 24, no. 30 p.23735-23743dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9988-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04178naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009400168300001600262520196800278592002802246650001602274650001302290650002902303650002202332650001202354650000902366650001502375650003202390650002102422650002202443650002902465650001802494650001302512650001302525650002502538650001802563650002902581650002802610650001302638650001302651650000902664650001802673650001302691650002002704650001902724653001002743653001802753653000802771653000802779653003202787653000802819700001502827700001902842700001302861700001502874700001802889700001502907700001302922700001502935700001602950700001702966700001702983700001503000700001303015700001403028700005403042700001603096700005603112773011903168856008803287852000903375655001203384IND60625363220221117220413.0210108e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062536322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.3762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ping10aYield advantage and nitrogen fate in an additive maize-soybean relay intercropping system  ap. 987-999.  aSustainable agricultural development is urgently required to satisfy future food demands while decreasing environmental costs. Intercropping can increase per-unit farmland productivity through a resource-efficient utilization. However, the fate of N in intercropping systems remains unclear. To study the yield advantages and the fate of N in additive maize–soybean relay intercropping (IMS) systems, we quantified crop yield, soil N transformation abilities, soil bacterial abundances, and the fate of ¹⁵N. This study was conducted using three planting patterns, namely, monoculture maize (Zea mays L.) (MM), monoculture soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) (MS), and IMS, and two N application rates, specifically, no N and applied N (N₁, 45 and 135 kg N ha⁻¹ for MS and MM, correspondingly; and N for the IMS, which was the sum of the monocultures). Results showed that a higher per-unit farmland productivity and a lower land use intensity are attained in the intercropping system than in the corresponding monocultures. In addition, land equivalent ratio (LER) ranges from 1.85 to 2.20. Moreover, the fate of ¹⁵N showed that the N uptake and residual are the highest, whereas N loss in the IMS is the lowest among all planting patterns. Intercropping had an increased N use efficiency by increasing N utilization efficiency, rather than N uptake efficiency. The abundance of ammonia oxidizer and denitrifier indicated that IMS improves the structure of soil microorganisms. Furthermore, the transformation abilities of soil N denoted that intercropping strengthens ammonifying and nitrifying capacities to increase soil N residual while decreasing ammonia volatilization and N₂O emission. Finally, the greenhouse warming potential and gas intensity of N₂O were significantly lower in the IMS than in the corresponding monocultures. In summary, the IMS system provides an environmentally friendly approach to increasing farmland productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3aammonia 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3afertilizer rates 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aintercropping 3aland use 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3anutrient use efficiency 3aoxidants 3aplanting 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3asoybeans 3astable isotopes 3avolatilization 0aYield 0aIntercropping 0aLER 0aNUE 0aReactive nitrogen emissions 0a15N1 aSong, Chun1 aLiu, Xiaoming,1 aZhou, Li1 aYang, Huan1 aZhang, Xiaona1 aZhou, Ying1 aDu, Qing1 aPang, Ting1 aFu, Zhi-dan1 aWang, X.

To better understand the contribution of haustoria to the interactions with the host plants, we isolated haustoria from susceptible wheat leaves infected with Pst race CYR31 and sequenced their transcriptome as well as those of urediospores and germ tubes, and compared the three transcriptomes. A total of 3524 up‐regulated genes were obtained from haustoria, of which 73 genes were related to thiamine biosynthesis, glycolysis and lipid metabolic processes. Silencing seven of the genes reduced the growth and development of Pst in wheat. More interestingly, 1197 haustorial secreted proteins (HASPs) were detected in haustoria, accounting for 34% of the total proteins, indicating that these HASPs play important roles in haustorium‐mediated pathogenic progression. Furthermore, 69 HASPs were able to suppress Bax‐triggered programmed cell death in tobacco. Additionally, 46 HASPs significantly reduced callose deposition in wheat using the type III secretion system. This study identified a large number of effectors through transcriptome sequencing, and the results revealed components of metabolic pathways that impact the growth and colonization of the pathogen and indicate essential functions of haustoria in the growth and pathogenicity of Pst.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018TD‐004cTechnology Innovation Team of Shaanxi province  a31772150cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31972352cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD020040806cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  cNational Youth Talent Support Program of the Ten‐Thousand Plan  aCARS‐03cModern Agricultural Industry Technology System  a31772150cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD020040806cResearch and Development0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPuccinia striiformis f. tritici 3aTriticum 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acallose 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agerm tube 3aglycolysis 3agrowth and development 3ahaustoria 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3alipids 3anutrients 3aparasites 3apathogen survival 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aprogrammed cell death 3aprotein secretion 3athiamin 3atobacco 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atype III secretion system 3aurediniospores 3awheat1 aTang, Chunlei1 aWang, Likun1 aZhao, Congcong1 aKang, Zhensheng1 aWang, Xiaojie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9968-03730 tMolecular plant pathology.g2020 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.83-94dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.128823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03895naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011600165500002000281520196200301592002802263596005202291650003302343650002302376650001302399650001302412650001502425650001502440650001102455650002202466650001602488650001902504650002102523650001202544650001402556650001602570650002602586650001602612650001802628650001102646650001202657650001402669650002002683650001902703650001602722700006302738700002502801700002702826700005802853700002402911700001702935700003002952700006402982700002403046773012703070856007503197852000903272655001203281IND60762166120221117094704.0220108e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216612DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.140272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalleh, Syafiq Zikri10aErgogenic property of Morinda citrifolia L. leaf extract affects energy metabolism in obese Sprague Dawley rats  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aErgogenic property is the ability to enhance capacity for physical activities through efficient production of energy and is potentially beneficial in weight management for the obese. In this study, ergogenic property of Morinda citrifolia leaf's extract (MCL) was evaluated using AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and high fat diet‐induced obese rats. Findings from the study showed that MCL demonstrated ergogenic activity via enhancement of AMPK activity using L6 skeletal muscle cell line. Interestingly, the result also revealed that rats treated with the intermediate dosage of MCL experienced the lowest % weight gain. The rats fed the highest dose of 200 mg/kg BW MCL demonstrated the longest swimming time of approximately three times that of green tea and caffeine‐fed rats. The highest dose fed rats were also found to have lower glucose and lactate levels, suggesting that energy metabolism was more effective in these rats. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase activities, the muscle injury indicators, were found to be the lowest in rats fed the highest MCL dose. The same effect was not seen in rats fed either caffeine or green tea, indicating that MCL treatment is may be protective of the rats' muscles. It was also shown that MCL consisted of various flavonoids with epicatechin, catechin, and quercetin that may be responsible for the effects measured. In conclusion, improvements were seen in rats fed MCL in terms of weight management, endurance capacity, energy metabolism, and muscle injury parameters. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Results of the study revealed that Morinda citrifolia leaf has great potential to be used as functional ingredient in the development of designer food/drink as ergogenic aid for both obese and non‐obese individuals. Morinda citrifolia leaf could help in the weight management of obese people and enhance endurance capacity and energy metabolism in active individuals.  aPublisher supplied data  aNH1014DO55cMinistry of Agriculture of Malaysia 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aMorinda citrifolia 3acaffeine 3acatechin 3acell lines 3acreatinine 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aepicatechin 3aergogenic aids 3afunctional foods 3aglucose 3agreen tea 3aingredients 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amuscles 3aquercetin 3askeletal muscle 3aweight control 3aweight gain1 aHamid, Azizah Abdul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7464-017X1 aJaafar, Ahmad Haniff1 aAbdul Majid, Nor Diana1 aSaari, Nazamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4185-94151 aHalim, Hani Hafeeza1 aIsmail, Amin1 aAbdul Razis, Ahmad Faizal1 aRamli, Nurul Shazini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7989-49611 aPak Dek, Mohd Sabri0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2022 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.e14027-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.140273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245017300168300001800341520092500359592002801284650001601312650001301328650001501341650001201356650000901368650001801377650001501395650003201410650001601442700002401458700002101482700002001503700002401523700002301547700002201570773013401592856008201726852000901808655001201817IND60548702420180405000000.0160905e20160831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054870242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b021112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokoli, Hülya U.10aCharacterization of the Liquid Products from Hydrolyzed Epoxy and Polyester Resin Composites Using Solid-Phase Microextraction and Recovery of the Monomer Phthalic Acid  ap. 9118-9128.  aA method to recover the fibers and monomers from epoxy-based and unsaturated polyester-based composites and characterize the liquid products using solid-phase microextraction has been investigated in this study. Experiments were performed using near-critical water in a batch reactor (1 L) at temperatures and pressures up to 350 °C and 170 bar. In-situ sampling was performed. The samples collected at temperatures in the range of 300 to 350 °C were divided into an aqueous phase and an oil phase. It was possible to identify various phenolic and aromatic compounds in both phases. In the samples collected during degradation of the polyester composites, the monomer phthalic acid precipitated nearly purified at temperatures in the range of 250–325 °C. By the recovery of fibers, an oil product, and the possibility to recover phthalic acid, the polymer composite end-of-life cycle is a step closer to completion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aepoxides 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3aoils 3aphthalic acid 3apolyesters 3asolid phase microextraction 3atemperature1 aSimonsen, Morten

Therefore, tilapia piscidin 4 (TP4) dietary supplementation was evaluated in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) on arrays of selected innate immune responses, oxidative stress, cytokine genes expression, microbial load, histopathological indices, and disease resistance against Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae). TP4 supplemented diets were formulated as; TP₅₀ (group fed 50 mg/kg diet of TP4); and TP₁₀₀ (group fed 100 mg/kg diet of TP4); besides a basal diet (control, no AMPs). Results showed that serum lysozyme, bactericidal, nitric oxide (NO), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels activities were all significantly increased at day 10 and 20. Interleukin- 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) mRNA expression levels were upregulated at both TP₅₀, ₁₀₀ supplementations at day five then started to decline at day 10 and 20 compared to the control. Cumulative mortality rates were significantly decreased in both TP₅₀, ₁₀₀ groups compared to the control; whereas the lowest mortalities were observed in group TP₁₀₀. The microbial load was significantly decreased in TP4 supplemented diets in both posterior kidney and intestine compared to control. Further, histopathological and scoring analysis proved a safe effect of TP4 on Nile tilapia. Our findings proposed that TP4 dietary supplementation could enhance immune response, antioxidant activity, and intestinal health furthermore it conferred protection against bacterial infections in Nile tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus iniae 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantioxidant activity 3abacterial infections 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3adietary supplements 3adisease resistance 3afarmed fish 3afish diseases 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestines 3akidneys 3alysozyme 3amessenger RNA 3amicrobial load 3amortality 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAntimicrobial peptides 0aFish 0aInnate immunity 0aCytokine 0aMicrobial load 0aInfection 0aHistology1 aRisha, Engy1 aElbahnaswy, Samia1 aMahgoub, Hebatallah Ahmed1 aEl-Moaty, Amany Abd0 tAquaculture.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 513 p.734451-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245011400160300001800274520098100292592002801273650002601301650002401327650002101351650001301372650002301385650001301408650001201421650001501433650001201448650001201460653003601472653001501508653001701523653001601540653001201556700001601568700001301584700001901597700001401616700005501630700001401685700005701699700005401756773014701810856008001957852000902037655001202046IND60632294020221119120104.0190314e20190207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063229402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b056092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chun10aInactivation of Soybean Bowman–Birk Inhibitor by Stevioside: Interaction Studies and Application to Soymilk  ap. 2255-2264.  aIn this work, the interaction of the soybean Bowman–Birk inhibitor (BBI) with stevioside (STE) was studied by stopped-flow–fluorescence and molecular docking. STE’s inactivation of protease-inhibitor activities in soymilk and the influence of STE addition on the sensory character of soymilk were also evaluated. The results indicate that STE binds BBI with a binding constant (Kₐ) of 3.38 × 10⁵ L mol–¹ to form a 1:1 complex. The docking study reveals that two hydrogen bonds are formed between the side-chain of Lys16 (reactive site 1) of BBI and the glucose-ring hydroxyl groups of STE, which may block BBI from contacting trypsin and thus deactivate the trypsin-inhibitor activity (TIA) of BBI. Moreover, the residual TIA in soymilk could also be inactivated by STE. A mixture of 159 mg/L STE and 60 g/L sucrose could be used for sweetening soymilk without affecting the sensory characteristics when compared to a reference product sweetened with 9% sucrose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBowman-Birk inhibitor 3acomputer simulation 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties 3asensory properties 3asoybeans 3asoymilk 3astevioside 3asucrose 3atrypsin 0asoybean Bowman−Birk inhibitor 0astevioside 0ainactivation 0ainteraction 0asoymilk1 aLuo, Lijuan1 aWu, Ying1 aYang, Xiaoquan1 aDong, Jie1 aLuo, Feijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1951-40711 aZou, Yuan1 aShen, Yingbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9767-11071 aLin, Qinlu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2043-42200 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 07, v. 67, no. 8 p.2255-2264dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b056093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010900173300001600282520186500298592002802163650001802191650001902209650001102228650001902239650001502258650001302273650002102286650002102307650001502328650002302343700002602366700002302392700001902415773013102434856008302565852000902648655001202657IND60124108020221122210501.0200415e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012410802DNAL7 a10.1657/1938-4246-44.4.4572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelsey, Katharine C.10aVariation in Soil Carbon Dioxide Efflux at Two Spatial Scales in a Topographically Complex Boreal Forest  ap. 457-468.  aCarbon dynamics of high-latitude regions are an important and highly uncertain component of global carbon budgets, and efforts to constrain estimates of soil-atmosphere carbon exchange in these regions are contingent on accurate representations of spatial and temporal variability in carbon fluxes. This study explores spatial and temporal variability in soilatmosphere carbon dynamics at both fine and coarse spatial scales in a high-elevation, permafrost-dominated boreal black spruce forest. We evaluate the importance of landscape-level investigations of soil-atmosphere carbon dynamics by characterizing seasonal trends in soil-atmosphere carbon exchange, describing soil temperature-moisture-respiration relations, and quantifying temporal and spatial variability at two spatial scales: the plot scale (0–5 m) and the landscape scale (500–1000 m). Plot-scale spatial variability (average variation on a given measurement day) in soil CO₂ efflux ranged from a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.25 to 0.69, and plot-scale temporal variability (average variation of plots across measurement days) in efflux ranged from a CV of 0.19 to 0.36. Landscape-scale spatial and temporal variability in efflux was represented by a CV of 0.40 and 0.31, respectively, indicating that plot-scale spatial variability in soil respiration is as great as landscape-scale spatial variability at this site. While soil respiration was related to soil temperature at both the plot- and landscape scale, landscape-level descriptions of soil moisture were necessary to define soil respiration-moisture relations. Soil moisture variability was also integral to explaining temporal variability in soil respiration. Our results have important implications for research efforts in high-latitude regions where remote study sites make landscape-scale field campaigns challenging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea mariana 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3atemporal variation1 aWickland, Kimberly P.1 aStriegl, Robert G.1 aNeff, Jason C.0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 44, no. 4 p.457-468dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-44.4.4573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245016900207300001400376520055700390592002800947650002700975650001301002650001301015650001901028650001601047650002301063650001001086650001401096650002501110650001801135700006401153700006001217700005901277773012501336856008201461852000901543655001201552IND60770426120221118135254.0220316e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077042612DNAL7 a10.1134/S10630740220101142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSigacheva, T.

Initial economic analysis by the Federal Water Pollution Administration in 1966 concluded the multimillion dollar pollution abatement programme would generate $350 million in annual benefits by improving dissolved oxygen levels to fishable standards in the Delaware River. Although water quality in the Delaware has improved substantially, scientists have called for raising the 1960s dissolved oxygen criteria from 3.5 mg/L to 5.0 mg/L to ensure year‐round propagation of anadromous American shad and Atlantic sturgeon. This higher level would also mitigate atmospheric warming resulting in increased water temperatures and sea water incursion, both of which would lead to reductions in dissolved oxygen saturation in the river. Additional economic valuation of this water quality improvement shows direct use benefits in the Delaware River to range from $371 million to $1.1 billion per year. Other economic sectors benefiting from improved water quality include recreational boating ($46–$334 million), recreational fishing ($129–$202 million), agriculture ($8–$188 million), nonuse value ($76–$115 million), viewing/boating/fishing ($55–$68 million), bird watching ($15–$33 million), property value ($13–27 million), water supply ($12–$24 million), commercial fishing (up to $17 million), and navigation ($7–$16 million). Future economic research is needed in the Delaware River watershed to more precisely measure nonuse benefits by public willingness to pay for improved water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser oxyrinchus 3aAlosa sapidissima 3aClean Water Act 3aanadromous fish 3abirdwatching 3aboating 3adissolved oxygen 3aeconomic sectors 3aeconomic valuation 3afinancial economics 3afisheries 3aoxygen 3apollution control 3arivers 3aseawater 3asport fishing 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3awillingness to pay 3aDelaware 3aDelaware River0 tRiver research and applications.g2019 Dec., v. 35, no. 10 p.1652-1665dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.34843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245005200157300002000209520103100229592002801260650001501288650001401303650001101317650001301328650001701341700001601358773012401374856007401498852000901572655001201581IND60641469820221118004722.0190505e20170224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064146982DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra27137e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hongwei10aDFT study of NO adsorption on pristine graphene  ap. 13082-13091.  aThis study reports in detail the adsorption of NO exhaust gas on pristine graphene by a first-principle. Ten kinds of adsorption configurations were built for three different adsorption sites on graphene. Structure optimization was carried out using different approximation methods; we found that the optimal method was the PBEsol approximation under the GGA approximation, and the orbital cutoff was 6 Å. Optimal parameters were used to calculate the adsorption energy, charge Mulliken, electron density difference, LUMO HOMO, and projected density of states (PDOS) for these ten kinds of adsorption configurations. We found that the adsorption of NO molecules on graphene was a physical adsorption process, and electrons were transferred from graphene to a NO molecule. The optimal adsorption site of graphene indicated the B-site, followed by the T-site, and the least negative adsorbed position was the H-site. Meanwhile, adsorption energy analysis showed that O-end graphene was the most stable adsorption configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agraphene 3anitric oxide1 aLiu, Zhijie0 tRSC advances.g2017 Feb. 24, v. 7, no. 22 p.13082-13091dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra27137e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245015600199500002000355520176200375592002802137596005402165650002302219650001702242650001702259650001502276650001702291650002102308650002302329650001102352650001602363700002502379700002402404773014302428856007502571852000902646655001202655IND60762166520221117094636.0220108e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216652DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.162112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHa, Nguyen Cong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9921-928810aErgothioneine extract from Aspergillus oryzae prevents lipid oxidation and increases bioactive compounds during the processing of germinated brown rice  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study aimed to evaluate the impact of ergothioniene (ESH) concentrated extract (CE) to lipid anti‐oxidation and γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), γ‐oryzanol (GORZ) biosynthesis during germinated brown rice (GBR) processing. To do that 0, 2, 4 and 6% ESH CE was supplemented to soaking stage of brown rice for 6 hr and determined changes about the quality of GBR during processing. The results showed when added 4% of ESH CE to soaking stage, total lipid was stable during four stages of GBR processing as 1.96, 1.87, 1.77, and 1.67 g/100 g corresponding to less increasing peroxide and thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances (TBARs) as 0.53, 0.54, 0.55, and 0.55 meq/kg lipid and 0.21, 0.23, 0.25, and 0.26 µmol TBARs/g while GABA and GORZ increased considerably to 2378.63 mg/kg and 222 mg/kg, respectively. The results indicated that ESH CE helps to increase GABA, GORZ and prevent lipid oxidation that contributes to improving the quality of GBR. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: GBR contains various bioactive compounds such as GABA, GORZ, which have positive effects for human health. So, it becomes one of the value‐added products from rice. However, in GBR processing, there are still some problems that impact negatively on the quality of GBR such as low levels of GABA, GORZ and high levels of peroxide and TBAR values that may occur during processing. To address these problems, this study used ESH, a powerful antioxidant compound, which was biosynthesized from Aspergillus oryzae applying to GBR processing. The results show that ESH CE not only inhibits fat oxidation during GBR processing but also increases significantly GABA, GORZ level. So, this study contributed one of great solutions for improving the quality of GBR products.  aPublisher supplied data  aVN14‐P6cCan Tho University Improvement Project 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aantioxidants 3abiosynthesis 3abrown rice 3ahuman health 3alipid metabolism 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3avalue added1 aThao, Doan Le Phuong1 aNgoc, Nguyen Thi Le0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.e16211-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.162113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013000173520184200303592002802145650001602173650002802189650001402217650001702231650001502248650001402263650000902277650001602286650001902302650001002321650001202331650001402343650001402357650002102371650001502392650002902407650002002436650001502456650001402471650001702485653002402502653001902526653002302545653001702568653002502585700002002610700002202630700002502652700001902677700002002696773011802716856008602834852000902920655001202929IND60765994720221119123108.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076599472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1061052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Ch'ang-gyun,10aTranscriptomic and physiological analysis of endocrine disrupting chemicals Impacts on 3D Zebrafish liver cell culture system  aIn recent decades, extensive efforts have focused on developing in vitro platforms mimicking fish livers to better understand the acute or chronic effects of toxicants on lower aquatic vertebrates. Fish liver cell lines have emerged as a promising culture system for these in vitro platforms because they complement the currently limited in vitro tools that mostly consist of mammalian cell lines and adhere to the 3Rs: replacement, reduction, and refinement of living animal tests. However, monolayer cell lines have lower transcriptional and physiological responses upon exposure to toxic chemicals than freshly isolated primary cells. To overcome this challenge, we utilized a three-dimensional (3D) spheroid-based in vitro platform, in which hepatocyte cells had self-organized into spheroid forms via E-cadherin bonds. This platform exhibited augmented transcriptomic and phenotypic regulation of liver cells in comparison to monolayer cells. We examined the organoid platform using the zebrafish liver (ZFL) cell line as a model system. ZFL cells spontaneously clustered into 3D spheroids with long-term viability by optimizing cell seeding density on a non-adherent substrate. Interestingly, 3D ZFL spheroids treated with estrogenic chemicals were activated to synthesize a higher level of vitellogenin (Vtg) than monolayer cells. Whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis confirmed that 3D ZFL spheroids had greater transcriptional regulation of genes related to reproductive toxicological response and liver functions, such as the urea cycle, estrogen receptors, and vitellogenin, compared to monolayer cells. These results may contribute to the engineering of novel 3D in vitro platforms for screening harmful chemicals and improving understanding of the underlying liver toxicity mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aanimal use alternatives 3acadherins 3acell culture 3acell lines 3aestrogens 3afish 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3aliver 3amammals 3aorganoids 3aphenotype 3atoxic substances 3atoxicology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3aurea cycle 3aviability 3avitellogenin 0a3D spheroid culture 0a17β-estradiol 0aIn vitro platforms 0aVitellogenin 0aZebrafish liver cell1 aRyu, Chang Seon1 aSung, Baeckkyoung1 aManz, A.q(Andreas),1 aKong, Hyunjoon1 aKim, Yŏng-jun,0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Apr., v. 245 p.106105-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1061053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245016100198500002000359520161900379592002801998650002502026650001702051650001702068650001702085650001302102650001002115650001802125650001902143650002602162650001802188650001402206650002302220650001402243650001602257650001902273650002102292650001702313700006102330700005702391700002102448700005602469700006202525700007402587700006902661773014302730856007502873852000902948655001202957IND60762166620221117094929.0220108e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216662DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.161772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafiq, Shafiya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1012-382410aPhysicochemical, antioxidant, and polyphenolic attributes of microencapsulated freeze‐dried kinnow peel extract powder using maltodextrin as wall material  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe physicochemical, antioxidant, and polyphenolic attributes of microencapsulated freeze‐dried kinnow peel extract powder using maltodextrin as wall material were investigated. The total phenolic, flavonoid, and antioxidant content of fresh peel extract were 24.51 mg GAE/g, 9.12 mg Quercetin/g, and 81.53% scavenging activity, respectively. The maltodextrin prepared from broken rice starch competes well with those commercial types. The microencapsulated kinnow peel powders across feed solutions 10%, 15%, and 20% total soluble solids (TSS) significantly differed (p < .05)by yield, water absorption, water solubility, swelling capacity, bulk density, antioxidant activity, moisture, water activity, hygroscopicity, water solubility index, swelling capacity, and color. The low cohesiveness and good flowability were respectively demonstrated by Carr index (1.18) and Hausner ratio (15.21) values. The intestinal fluid released more polyphenolic components over the gastric medium. Overall, the maltodextrin as a wall material would effectuate a beneficial microencapsulation process. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Maltodextrin is among the polysaccharides used as wall materials with desirable characteristics. Despite the previous studies that have evidenced the role of maltodextrin, relevant information about those specifically obtained from broken rice starch for use in the microencapsulation of citrus peel extract is scant. In this work, we demonstrated the maltodextrin specifically obtained from broken rice starch to be a promising wall material for the microencapsulated citrus peel extract powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abulk density 3acitrus peels 3acohesion 3acolor 3afreeze drying 3ahygroscopicity 3aintestinal secretions 3amaltodextrins 3amandarins 3amicroencapsulation 3aquercetin 3arice starch 3awater activity 3awater solubility 3awater uptake1 aSofi, Sajad Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5681-23721 aKumar, Harish1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7025-15671 aKaul, Raj Kumari1 aMehra, Rahul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0299-44431 aAwuchi, Chinaza G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5071-88951 aOkpala, Charles Odilichukwu R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4475-88871 aKorzeniowska, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0300-04070 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2022 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.e16177-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.161773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245015100207300001400358520096200372592002801334650001601362650001401378650001401392650001001406650001101416650001401427650001401441650001301455651001001468651002201478700005901500773012501559856008201684852000901766655001201775IND60770426520221118135301.0220316e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077042652DNAL7 a10.1134/S10630740220100352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelousova, Y.

However, how urbanization affects personalities remains incompletely understood, especially because different urban stressors could affect personality traits in opposing ways, whereas most previous studies have considered only one urban disturbance factor. For instance, novel habitat features could favor reduced neophobia, whereas exposure to pollutants could increase risk sensitivity through neurotoxic or hormonal effects. To address this contingency, we studied object neophobia in four urban populations of great tits (Parus major) that vary in exposure to metal pollution and anthropogenic disturbance, as quantified by proximity to roads and pathways. We measured the return latency of incubating females when flushed from the nest and presented with up to two different novel objects, allowing quantification of behavioral repeatability and plasticity. To separate neophobia from sensitivity to disturbance, we also conducted baseline trials, in which females were flushed but no object was presented. We additionally measured exploration behavior and aggression (hissing) during nest defense, to explore whether suites of behaviors covary with urbanization, and examined whether neophobia affects reproductive success. Sensitivity to disturbance and neophobia were repeatable, and thus represent personality traits. Moreover, females occupying territories near roads and pathways had shorter return latencies during novel object but not baseline trials, suggesting a specific reduction in neophobia in disturbed areas. Plasticity in neophobia also increased with disturbance level. In contrast, metal exposure did not affect neophobia or sensitivity to disturbance, despite negatively correlating with exploration behavior. Neophobia correlated with exploration behavior, but not aggression or reproductive success. Results suggest that shifts in personality types in urbanized areas might involve specific reductions in neophobia, rather than general reductions in sensitivity to disturbance, and unexpectedly indicate no effect of toxic metals on risk sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aaggression 3aanimals 3aanthropogenic activities 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ametals 3anests 3aneurotoxicity 3apersonality 3apollutants 3apollution 3areproductive success 3arisk 3aroads 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization 0aUrbanization 0aMetal pollution 0aNeophobia 0aAnimal personality 0aBehavioral plasticity1 aGrunst, Melissa L.1 aPinxten, Rianne1 aEens, Marcel0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 656 p.997-1009dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.3833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245011100208300001800319506007600337520105700413592002801470506003701498650001801535650001401553650002501567650001001592650002501602650001601627650001101643650001301654650001901667650001201686650001401698650002001712653000801732653001401740653001001754653000801764653002101772653000801793700002601801700001901827700003001846700002301876700001801899700002001917773007601937856008202013852000902095655001202104IND60551720520221207134718.0161019e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055172052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.0332doi7 aPMC44752792pmcid7 a260910372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDow, Lukas E.10aApc Restoration Promotes Cellular Differentiation and Reestablishes Crypt Homeostasis in Colorectal Cancer  ap. 1539-1552.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor is mutated in the vast majority of human colorectal cancers (CRC) and leads to deregulated Wnt signaling. To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. In established tumors, Apc restoration drives rapid and widespread tumor-cell differentiation and sustained regression without relapse. Tumor regression is accompanied by the re-establishment of normal crypt-villus homeostasis, such that once aberrantly proliferating cells reacquire self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capability. Our study reveals that CRC cells can revert to functioning normal cells given appropriate signals and provide compelling in vivo validation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target for treatment of CRC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acarcinoma 3acell differentiation 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3arelapse 3aremission 3asmall intestine 0aAPC 0apolyposis 0ashRNA 0aWnt 0atumor regression 0aFAP1 aO’Rourke, Kevin P.1 aSimon, Janelle1 aTschaharganeh, Darjus F.1 avan Es, Johan H.1 aClevers, Hans1 aLowe, Scott W.,0 tCell.g2015 June 18, v. 161 p.1539-1552dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01661naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163300001600274520055500290592002800845650001500873650001400888650002300902650002300925650001100948650001300959653003500972653002101007653002301028653001701051653001801068700001601086700001601102773007901118856008101197852000901278655001201287IND60560269920221119165844.0170606e20170209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056026992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Feihua13aAn efficient synthesis of iminoisoindolione derivatives by cobalt-catalyzed oxidative isocyanide insertion  ap. 758-763.  aA Cobalt-catalyzed oxidative isocyanide insertion of aminoquinoline benzamides has been developed.

The major factors responsible for these declines are an increasing temperature trend of 0.36 °C per decade, and a reduction in winter precipitation at the rate of 10.1 mm a⁻¹. While the depth of the snowpack is dependent upon precipitation trends and minimum temperatures (multiple r ²= 0.43), the shortening in the length of the snow period is best predicted by increasing temperatures and reduced humidity. The major forcing of the warming trend involves greenhouse gasses, in particular atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor. However, the decline in winter precipitation seems to be unrelated to the forcing of greenhouse gasses, and is instead statistically associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (r = 0.38). Inverse correlations were found between depth of snow and solar irradiance, which in turn is inversely correlated with the number of sunspots per cycle. The latter findings suggest that the declining precipitation and snow trends could additionally be associated with a reduction in solar activity during the past five decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3ahumidity 3amountains 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3awinter 3aAustralia1 aGreen, Ken0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 45, no. 1 p.107-118dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245012000155300001800275520103300293592002801326650001901354650002001373650001401393650002101407650001201428650001301440650001801453650000701471650002901478650002501507700001701532700001701549700001101566700001201577700001401589700001801603700002001621700002001641700002301661700001801684700002601702773013201728856007801860852000901938655001201947IND60548703020221120084007.0160905e20160706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054870302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b028782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Zhi12aA Molecular Surface Functionalization Approach to Tuning Nanoparticle Electrocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction  ap. 8120-8125.  aConversion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO₂) to value-added products is an important challenge for sustainable energy research, and nanomaterials offer a broad class of heterogeneous catalysts for such transformations. Here we report a molecular surface functionalization approach to tuning gold nanoparticle (Au NP) electrocatalysts for reduction of CO₂ to CO. The N-heterocyclic (NHC) carbene-functionalized Au NP catalyst exhibits improved faradaic efficiency (FE = 83%) for reduction of CO₂ to CO in water at neutral pH at an overpotential of 0.46 V with a 7.6-fold increase in current density compared to that of the parent Au NP (FE = 53%). Tafel plots of the NHC carbene-functionalized Au NP (72 mV/decade) vs parent Au NP (138 mV/decade) systems further show that the molecular ligand influences mechanistic pathways for CO₂ reduction. The results establish molecular surface functionalization as a complementary approach to size, shape, composition, and defect control for nanoparticle catalyst design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3agreenhouse gases 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apH 3arenewable energy sources 3avalue-added products1 aKim, Dohyung1 aHong, Dachao1 aYu, Yi1 aXu, Jun1 aLin, Song1 aWen, Xiaodong1 aNichols, Eva M.1 aJeong, Keunhong1 aReimer, Jeffrey

Temperature-normalized oxygen consumption was significantly lower for the hypolimnetic profunda phenotype than for the shallow type. Mass-normalized respiration rates were inversely related to mussel size. Mussels adjusted their oxygen consumption in response to food enhancement and deprivation, lowering their respiration to a basal metabolic rate 18 hours after food deprivation. In response to decreasing ambient oxygen, quagga mussels exhibited first-order reaction kinetics, with mass-normalized respiration rate at a dissolved oxygen concentration of 0.002 mol L−1 being 1% of that at saturation. Using published data on quagga mussel energy budgets and respiratory quotients, oxygen consumption rates were converted to organic carbon consumption rates. Using these values, along with data on mussel density and size frequency distribution, it is estimated that quagga mussels consume 54% of annual phytoplankton production, from 1.4–4.1 times the offshore annual settled organic carbon in the southern basin of Lake Michigan, and from 2.4–5.5% of offshore areal particulate carbon in the water column. Dreissenids appear to exert significant direct influences on benthic oxygen dynamics, and consume enough organic carbon to have a significant effect on energy flow in the Lake Michigan ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena bugensis 3abasal metabolic rate 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aenergy flow 3afood deprivation 3alaboratory experimentation 3ametabolism 3amussels 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aphenotype 3aphytoplankton 3areaction kinetics 3arespiratory rate 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aLake Michigan 0aQuagga mussels 0aMetabolism 0aDreissena rostriformis bugensis 0aRespiration 0aLake Michigan1 aBootsma, Harvey A.1 aLafrancois, Brenda Moraska0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2015, v. 41 p.27-37dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2015.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008200167300001600249520135600265592002801621650001201649650002901661650001101690650001301701650001301714650000801727650001301735650001901748650000901767650002101776650001001797650001101807651001001818700002301828700001601851700002101867700001801888773013101906856008302037852000902120655001202129IND60124108720221122210512.0200415e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012410872DNAL7 a10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSankelo, Paula10an-Alkanes in Fresh Snow in Hokkaido, Japan: Implications for Ice Core Studies  ap. 119-131.  aPlant waxes (e.g. long-chain n-alkanes) in ice cores are a promising paleovegetation proxy. However, much work needs to be done to assess how n-alkanes are transported from source areas to, and incorporated into, glacial archives. In this paper we present analyses of n-alkanes in seasonal snow and assess the information on source vegetation. n-Alkanes with carbon numbers C₁₈ to C₄₃ were extracted from snow samples collected at two sites in Hokkaido, northern Japan, during winter 2009–2010. Molecular distributions revealed that the majority of the n-alkanes originated from higher vegetation (ca. 65%), rather than anthropogenic sources. The distribution characteristics confirmed that the n-alkane signal had a wide regional origin, rather than a local source. We determined stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions for the C₂₇ n-alkane. The δ¹³C of the C₂₇ (-28.2 to -33.0‰) was more representative of C₃ than C₄ vegetation, while the δD of the C₂₇ (- 169.9 to -223.1‰) indicated growth latitudes more northerly than Hokkaido. The n-alkanes in the snow preserve information about the source vegetation type (photosynthetic group, growth site), confirming that if deposited with seasonal snows that firnify to form glacial ice, they have potential to record broad, regional vegetation changes over time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon 3aglaciers 3ahydrogen 3aice 3alatitude 3aphotosynthesis 3asnow 3avegetation types 3awaxes 3awinter 3aJapan1 aKawamura, Kimitaka1 aSeki, Osamu1 aShibata, Hideaki1 aBendle, James0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 45, no. 1 p.119-131dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007300147245015700220300001400377520057200391592002800963650001400991650001301005650001601018650001601034650001401050650001801064651001601082773012501098856008201223852000901305655001201314IND60770426720221118135303.0220316e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077042672DNAL7 a10.1134/S10630740220100962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoezzhalova-Chegodaeva, E.

Serum samples were spiked with D5-glycocholic acid and then pretreated with protein precipitation. The analysis was performed on a Waters BEH C18 column (100 mm×2.1mm, 1.7μm), followed by ESI–MS/MS detection in negative ion mode under multiple reaction monitoring mode. The calibration curves covered a concentration range from 0.2 to 400ng/mL. The limit of detection and limit of quantification was 0.01ng/mL and 0.05ng/mL, respectively. The method showed satisfactory precision on intra-day (2.3–6.1%) and inter-day (2.4–4.6%) analyses and achieved good recovery at three spiked levels (103.7–114.3%). Moreover, this established method was successfully applied for quantification of GCA in serum samples from healthy volunteers, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and patients with other cancers. We demonstrated that the level of GCA in patients with HCC was significantly higher not only than that in healthy controls, but also than that in patients with other cancer, whereas no significant difference of GCA level was observed between healthy control group and other cancers group.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aglycocholic acid 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3aisotope dilution technique 3amonitoring 3apatients 3astable isotopes 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aID-UPLC-ESI–MS/MS 0aGlycocholic acid 0aSerum 0aHepatocellular carcinoma 0aBiomarker1 aXie, Cong1 aDing, Peili1 aQin, Guangming1 aMo, Weimin1 aCao, Xiaoji1 aZheng, Shu0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 1072 p.315-319dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010100156300001800257520103900275592002801314650003001342650002501372650001101397650001601408650001601424650001001440650001201450650001401462650001301476650001701489700001801506700002701524773012201551856007401673852000901747655001201756IND60641470320221118131218.0190505e20170120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064147032DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra27156a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Arslan10aApplication of dyes as doping agents in MALDI-MS matrices for the signal enhancement of proteins  ap. 6598-6604.  aMatrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is considered as a technique of choice for analysing proteins and peptides.

These dopant constitutes commonly used dyes such as Coomassie Blue G-250 (A), Cochineal (B), Erythrosin B (C), Sunset yellow (D), and Acid Red 1 (E), which when employed in 0.1–100 pM range along with conventional MALDI-MS matrices such as α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCCA), sinapic acid (SA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), can significantly increase (×2–35) the ion intensity of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), myoglobin, casein and insulin. Moreover, such effect remains consistent when applied to analyse real samples such as honey and egg white analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 3abovine serum albumin 3acasein 3aegg albumen 3aerythrosine 3ahoney 3ainsulin 3amyoglobin 3apeptides 3asinapic acid1 aShahid, Najia1 aMusharraf, Syed Ghulam0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 20, v. 7, no. 11 p.6598-6604dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra27156a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012400166300001800290520169800308592002802006650002002034650001502054650002502069650001402094650001302108650002302121650002202144650001902166650001102185650003002196700002402226700002702250700002802277700002302305700001902328773012402347856008502471852000902556655001202565IND60454428020221119185828.0151103e20151018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045442802DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10549652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattar, C.10aGlobal Atmospheric Profiles from Reanalysis Information (GAPRI): a new database for earth surface temperature retrieval  ap. 5045-5060.  aThis paper presents the Global Atmospheric Profiles derived from Reanalysis Information (GAPRI) database, which was designed for earth surface temperature retrieval. GAPRI is a comprehensive compilation of selected atmospheric vertical profiles at global scale which can be used for radiative transfer simulation in order to obtain generalized algorithms to estimate land surface temperature (LST). GAPRI includes information on geopotential height, atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis data from year 2011. The atmospheric profiles are structured for 29 vertical levels and extracted from a global spatial grid of about 0.75° × 0.75° latitude–longitude with a temporal resolution of 6 hours. The selection method is based in the extraction of clear sky profiles over different atmospheric weather conditions such as tropical, mid-latitude summer, subarctic, and arctic, while also considering sea and land areas and day- and night-time conditions. The GAPRI database was validated by comparing land and sea surface temperature values derived from it to those obtained using other existing atmospheric profile databases and in situ measurements. Moreover, GAPRI was also compared to previous radiosonde atmospheric profiles using simulated split-window algorithms. Results show good agreement between GAPRI and previous atmospheric databases, thus demonstrating the potential of GAPRI for studies related to forward simulations in the thermal infrared range.

In this time, an economically important sport fishery developed around non-native salmon and trout species (i.e., Chinook and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Oncorhynchus kisutch) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)). While trying to maintain this economically important recreational fishery, fishery managers are also trying to restore native species to the ecosystem (i.e., lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)). We describe the trophic niche space of five ecologically and socioeconomically important Lake Ontario salmonid species (Chinook and coho salmon and rainbow, brown (Salmo trutta) and lake trout) using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (13C and 15N, respectively). Using a modified standard ellipse analysis, we found a high degree of stable isotope niche space overlap in Lake Ontario salmonid species. Lake trout had the largest trophic niche space and the smallest proportion of overlap relative to the other four salmonid species (14%–28%), whereas coho salmon had the smallest stable isotope niche space and exhibited the highest degree of overlap with the other species (66%–99%). This study identifies and quantifies dietary resource sharing between Lake Ontario salmonids and highlights the importance of other prey fish species to the restoration and sustainability of Lake Ontario salmonid fish stocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aSalmo salar 3aSalmo trutta 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3aecosystems 3afisheries 3aindigenous species 3anitrogen 3asalmon 3asport fishing 3astable isotopes 3atrout 3aLake Ontario 0aStable isotope 0aNiche space 0aLake Ontario 0aSalmonid 0aStandard ellipse1 aFisk, Aaron T.1 aStewart, Tom1 aJohnson, Timothy B.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2015 Sept., v. 41 p.934-940dElsevier B.V.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007400170300001600244520154500260592002801805650003001833650001901863650003301882650001301915650001101928650001601939700001701955773013101972856008302103852000902186655001202195IND60124108920221122210538.0200415e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012410892DNAL7 a10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Satoru10aModeling Glacier Behavior Under Different Precipitation Seasonalities  ap. 143-152.  aTo understand the dependence of glacial features on precipitation, glacier behavior was simulated under different precipitation conditions using a glacier fluctuation model that combined a mass-balance model with a glacier flow model. The results reveal a strong dependence of glacier behavior on precipitation conditions. Glacier volume changes in accordance with both precipitation seasonality and annual precipitation amount. Glacier volume also fluctuates in response to changes in precipitation seasonality even if no change in annual precipitation amount occurs, because of changes in glacier albedo and the volume that is able to accumulate. Furthermore, the accumulation area ratio (AAR) depends not only on the annual precipitation amount, but also on precipitation seasonality. These relationships should be considered when the AAR method is used to reconstruct the past equilibrium line of glaciers. Glacier reactions to temperature change become more sensitive as the amount of annual precipitation increases. Response time is different for each glacier type defined by precipitation seasonality: the winter-precipitation-seasonality type had the longest response time, and the summer-precipitation-seasonality type had the shortest. The difference in the response time of glacier types is larger under arid conditions and smaller under humid conditions. The simulation results in this study underscore the importance of including glacier response to precipitation conditions when estimating glacier reactions to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aglaciers 3amodels 3atemperature1 aFujita, Koji0 tArctic, antarctic, and alpine research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 45, no. 1 p.143-152dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12076x1938-42467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-45.1.1433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001800288520168600306592002801992650002002020650001902040650001602059650001602075650001102091650001902102650001902121650001502140650002302155650001202178650002402190650002102214650001502235700001902250700001802269700001702287700001202304700001502316700001402331773012402345856008502469852000902554655001202563IND60454428220221119190130.0151103e20151018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045442822DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2015.10556102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dianjun10aValidation of a practical normalized soil moisture model with in situ measurements in humid and semi-arid regions  ap. 5015-5030.  aSoil moisture is an important parameter that influences the exchange of water and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. Through the simulation by a Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere Transfer model, Carlson proposed the universal spatial information-based method to determine soil moisture that is insensitive to the initial atmospheric and surface conditions, net radiation, and atmospheric correction. In this study, a practical normalized soil moisture model is established to describe the relationship among the normalized soil moisture (M), the normalized land surface temperature (T *), and the fractional vegetation cover. The dry and wet points are determined using the surface energy balance principle, which has a robust physical basis. This method is applied to retrieve soil moisture for the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment campaign in the Walnut Creek watershed, which has a humid climate, and at the Linzestation, which has a semi-arid climate. The validation data are obtained on days of year (DOYs) 182 and 189 in 2002 in the humid region and on DOYs 148 and 180 in 2008 for the semi-arid region; these data collection days are coincident with the overpass of the Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus. When the estimates are compared with the in situ measurements of soil water content, the root mean square error is approximately 0.10 m ³ m ⁻³ with a bias of 0.05 m ³ m ⁻³ for the humid region and 0.08 m ³ m ⁻³ with a bias of 0.03 m ³ m ⁻³ for the semi-arid region. These results demonstrate that the practical normalized soil moisture model is applicable in both humid and semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aenergy balance 3aenergy flow 3ahumid zones 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astreams 3asurface temperature 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds1 aLi, Zhao-Liang1 aTang, Ronglin1 aTang, Bo-Hui1 aWu, Hua1 aLü, Jing,1 aShao, Kun0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Oct. 18, v. 36, no. 19-20 p.5015-5030dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10556103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245006700184300001600251520131300267592002801580650002801608650000801636650001001644650001401654650000901668650001201677650001601689650001201705650001201717650001101729650001501740650001001755650002001765650000901785650001201794650003601806650003401842650002401876650002101900650004001921650001901961650001601980650002001996650003302016650003402049650001002083650001402093650000902107700002202116773010902138856004802247852000902295655001202304IND50064110620221120034045.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006411062DNAL7 a234945842pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-013-0806-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuo, Eriko10aNeuronal encoding of sound, gravity, and wind in the fruit fly  ap. 253-262.  aThe fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster responds behaviorally to sound, gravity, and wind. Exposure to male courtship songs results in reduced locomotion in females, whereas males begin to chase each other. When agitated, fruit flies tend to move against gravity. When faced with air currents, they ‘freeze’ in place. Based on recent studies, Johnston’s hearing organ, the antennal ear of the fruit fly, serves as a sensor for all of these mechanosensory stimuli. Compartmentalization of sense cells in Johnston’s organ into vibration-sensitive and deflection-sensitive neural groups allows this single organ to mediate such varied functions. Sound and gravity/wind signals sensed by these two neuronal groups travel in parallel from the fly ear to the brain, feeding into neural pathways reminiscent of the auditory and vestibular pathways in the human brain. Studies of the similarities between mammals and flies will lead to a better understanding of the principles of how sound and gravity information is encoded in the brain. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of these principles and discuss the advantages of the fruit fly as a model system to explore the fundamental principles of how neural circuits and their ensembles process and integrate sensory information in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aair 3abrain 3acourtship 3aears 3afemales 3afruit flies 3agravity 3ahearing 3ahumans 3alocomotion 3amales 3aneural pathways 3awind 2aAnimals 2aArthropod Antennaexinnervation 2aAuditory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aAuditory Perception 2aBehavior, Animal 2aDrosophila melanogasterxphysiology 2aFlight, Animal 2aGravitation 2aGravity Sensing 2aMechanoreceptorsxphysiology 2aMechanotransduction, Cellular 2aSound 2aVibration 2aWind1 aKamikouchi, Azusa0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2013 Apr., v. 199, no. 4 p.253-262dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-013-0806-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245007900210506011700289506007600406520080400482592002801286506003701314650001801351650002001369650001801389650001601407650001101423650001801434650000901452650002401461653002601485653001501511653001901526653002301545653002001568653002301588700002901611700001801640773011501658856008801773852000901861655001201870IND60765995220221207111856.0220929e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076599522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.1055892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGálvez, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9247-313610aCitizen science set in motion: DIY light traps for phlebotomine sand flies  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhlebotomine sand flies are vectors of various diseases such as leishmaniasis making them a public health concern worldwide.

A hydroponic system (pH 4.3) and a loam soil slurry system were designed to respectively simulate acidic and neutral soil condition, and cultivation at increasing temperatures (20, 25, and 30 °C) were performed to evaluate the greenhouse effect. The root and shoot elongation and the Cd concentration in root and solution were measured; furthermore, batch experiments for Cd adsorption were undertaken. An increasing inhibition of the root by Cd addition was observed at increasing temperatures. The inhibition rate was 50.50 and 20.80% in hydroponic system and slurry system at 25 °C, respectively; however, the corresponding inhibition rates of root were significantly decreased to 25.5 and 3.5% with addition of RS400. This is mainly attributed to the reduction of Cd migration into the roots by RS400, which decreased Cd bioavailability. The mechanism behind the reduced Cd bioavailability is attributed to the Cd adsorption and the strong buffering capacity of acidity by RS400.

This article considered Amdo, Baingoin, Coqên, and Zhongba counties in Tibet as the study areas, employed remote-sensing data, and developed Tibetan grassland desertification classification indices based on field surveys. Moreover, this study used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) methods to interpret remote-sensing image data from the study areas during three periods (1990, 2000, and 2009) and considered the bare sand (gravel) area proportion as the main basis for the evaluation of grassland desertification. The results of this study demonstrate that the slightly, moderately, and severely desertified grasslands of the monitoring zone covered a total area of 114,113.16 km ² in 1990, accounting for 82.12% of the study area. The area exhibited no change in 2000 and decreased by 4472.31 km ² in 2009. The severely desertified grassland area declined from 1990 to 2009. The degree of grassland desertification in these four Tibetan counties diminished from 1990 to 2009, and the grassland desertification area exhibited a gradual reduction during the same period. Regarding other soil coverage types, the ice and snow area markedly changed and declined to approximately one-third of its original extent during these 20 years, and most of the ice and snow area was converted to bare land and various types of desertified grassland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3adesertification 3agravel 3ahumans 3aice 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asand 3asnow 3asoil 3asurveys 3aChina1 aLi, J.Y.1 aJin, Y.X.1 aWang, Z.L.1 aQin, Z.H.1 aWu, M.Q.1 aWang, D.

After 7 days oral exposure to LCT enantiomers, the concentration of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (PBA), hydroxylated and sulfated LCT were higher in the (+)-LCT exposure group than that in the (−)-LCT exposure group, which indicated a higher metabolic rate of (+)-LCT than (−)-LCT. Although no significant differences were seen on lizard body weight after enantiomers’ exposure, the gonadosomatic index was dramatically decreased. The testicular impacts such as increased seminiferous tubule diameters were only observed in the (+)-LCT exposure group. Consistent with this result, the expression of ar gene in the (+)-LCT exposure was significantly higher than that in the (−)-LCT exposure group. In addition, the stronger binding affinity of AR with (+)-LCT further demonstrated the more serious disruption of (+)-LCT on lizard HPG axis than (−)-LCT. This study first elucidated the metabolic pathway and endocrine effects of LCT in lizards at enantiomeric level and provided some evidence for lizard population decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abiochemical pathways 3abody weight 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3afeces 3agenes 3agonadosomatic index 3ahydroxylation 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3alizards 3ametabolism 3aoral exposure 3apopulation dynamics 3atestes 0apyrethroid pesticides 0aendocrine disruption 0ametabolism 0aenantiomers 0areptiles1 aXu, Peng1 aLi, Wei1 aLi, Jitong1 aWang, Huili1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0984-29630 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 67, no. 8 p.2183-2189dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b059903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001800159245015200177300001600329520155100345592002801896650001801924650001401942650001001956650001601966650000901982650001401991650002302005650002202028650002602050650001502076650001902091650003102110650001902141650003302160650001402193650001502207650001502222650000902237650001502246650003102261650002802292653001502320653001502335653001002350653001402360653002602374653003302400700002302433700002002456700005802476700002802534773009902562856009302661852000902754655001202763IND60561784420221122024240.0170320e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056178442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadji, Célia10aInfluence of weathering on visual and surface aspect of wood plastic composites: Correlation approach with mechanical properties and microstructure  ap. 162-172.  aThis study aims to assess and understand simultaneously the changes in visual aspect, surface topography and mechanical properties of a wood flour reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite under natural and artificial weathering conditions. Compounds were produced through twin-screw extrusion followed by injection molding in order to obtain dog bone samples. A one-year natural outdoor exposure and a xenon-arc accelerated weathering were studied. As expected, mechanical performances are decreased under UV exposure. This performance degradation goes along with important changes in visual aspect. In addition to commonly used microscopy observations, other methods such as colorimetry, spectrogoniometry and confocal rugosimetry are used to characterize the surface aspect through color, gloss and roughness properties. These analyses revealed that ageing induces a surface bleaching, a wood particle protrusion and numerous micro-cracks. Moreover the chain scission attested by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and lixiviation on the surface induces roughness and gloss loss. Otherwise biocomposites were more degraded under natural weathering. This paper gives new insights in understanding how weathering affects physico-mechanical properties of wood plastic composites (WPC). For that, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) gives global overview about effects of type of weathering and wood rate on physical, mechanical and chemical properties by calculating their contributions to the drawing of axes (Principal Components) during PCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocomposites 3ableaching 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adogs 3aextrusion 3agel chromatography 3ainjection molding 3amechanical properties 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolypropylenes 3aprincipal component analysis 3aroughness 3atopography 3aweathering 3awood 3awood flour 3awood mechanical properties 3awood plastic composites 0aWood flour 0aWeathering 0aColor 0aRoughness 0aMechanical properties 0aPrincipal Component Analysis1 aSoccalingame, Lata1 aGaray, Hélène1 aBergeret, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7118-65841 aBénézet, Jean-Charles0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2017 Mar., v. 137 p.162-172dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01240naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245004700210520024400257592002800501653000800529653000800537653000800545653001800553653002100571653000800592653001500600700006000615700005800675773009800733856008600831852000900917655001200926IND60792368620221117223740.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079236862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1108382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamelin, Anaïs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6530-548710aNo debt no performance?

In this paper we argue that Urban Ecosystem Services (UES) could increase urban resilience; and that resilient UES depends directly on the quantity, quality and diversity of the green infrastructure that produces them. The case of the western boundaries of Mexico City is used to map and assess these issues. We classified the different settings of green infrastructure as Service Providing Units (SPUs) and identified their provision of UES through remote sensing techniques; the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) combined with fieldwork verification in two scales of analysis, the local and regional. The results reveal that the vast majority of green infrastructure has low quality, hindering the provision of the UES required for building Mexico City´s resilience. At the regional scale, the growing pressures of urban development and the consequent reduction of SPUs threatens the delivery of provisioning ecosystem services while at the local scale, the low quality of SPUs threatens the provision of regulating ecosystem services. We argue that addressing these challenges could improve the design and implementation of environmental decision-making and urban policy towards more resilient urban social-ecological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3aurban development 3aMexico 0aUrban resilience 0aUrban Ecosystem Services 0aGreen infrastructure 0aQuality 0aDiversity1 aQuiroz-Rosas, Laura Elisa0 tEcosystem services.g2017 Feb., v. 23 p.127-137dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245012000179300001600299500001500315520173700330592002802067650002202095650002102117650002302138650001802161650001702179650002502196650002202221650003702243650002802280650002602308650001602334650001302350653001202363653000802375653002602383653002102409653001302430653002102443700002802464700002102492700002102513700002502534700002602559700001902585773009902604856009302703852000902796655001202805IND60561784520221122024017.0170320e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056178452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyaux, Adeline10aAging of plasticized polyvinyl chloride in heritage collections: The impact of conditioning and cleaning treatments  ap. 109-121.  a2019-12-06  aThe degradation kinetics of plasticized PVC films naturally aged for about 30 years old in museum conditions and displaying surface exudates was studied during an artificial aging treatment consisting in a temperature cycle (2 days at 80 °C/1 day at 25 °C) and under controlled relative humidity (65%). The role of the enclosure was investigated by placing the films either in a closed vessel or by freely hanging them in the climatic chamber, while the effect of a preliminary mechanical surface cleaning to remove the exudates was also studied. Plasticizer migration and PVC degradations were characterized every week by coupling thermo-gravimetric analysis, gas chromatography, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, infrared and UV–visible spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements. The results show that there is a significant slowing down of PVC aging in a closed container with respect to an open environment. Plasticizer loss and thus changes in mechanical properties are thus strongly delayed in a closed environment while PVC dehydrochlorination leading to sample yellowing also evolves at a slower pace. Concerning the effect of the preliminary PVC surface cleaning, it appears effective and has no effect on the kinetics of further PVC degradation. In particular, the removal of the exudates does not accelerate the further plasticizer loss. This study brings significant insights for conservation strategies. Indeed, the lifetime of soiled PVC-base heritage artifacts can be extended through a soft mechanical cleaning of the surface allowing retaining their visual appearance. Moreover, preservation of PVC artifacts in a closed container is preferable to slow their degradation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3afilms (materials) 3athermogravimetry 3agas chromatography 3acontact angle 3aplasticizers 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3arelative humidity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3amechanical properties 3atemperature 3acleaning 0aStorage 0aPVC 0aPlasticizer migration 0aArtificial aging 0aCleaning 0athermal analysis1 aFabre-Francke, Isabelle1 aBalcar, Nathalie1 aBarabant, Gilles1 aBollard, Clémentine1 aLavédrine, Bertrand,1 aCantin, Sophie0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2017 Mar., v. 137 p.109-121dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009100177500002200268506011700290506007600407520105800483592002801541506003701569650002401606650002301630650003001653650001601683650001501699650001101714650001701725650001701742650002501759650001301784653002801797653002401825653002101849653001601870700002401886700002401910700002201934700002701956773009801983856005002081852000902131655001202140IND60792171620221207115841.0220905e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079217162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plana.2022.1000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTachapermpon, Yordkhuan10aFluorescent carbon dots based phytosensor for Indoor Formaldehyde pollution monitoring  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndoor formaldehyde pollution released from household products is one of the major causes of several health diseases. Ornamental plants have been paid more attention recently to improve air quality and increase natural decorative appeal. Therefore, we aimed to use ornamental plants as a plant-based biosensor or phytosensor to monitor/detect indoor formaldehyde exposure. The synthesized carbon dots with nitrogen doping (N-doped CDs) in this study shows a big “turn-off” significant response with high selectivity to formaldehyde. The lowest formaldehyde concentration that gave the observable fluorescence quenching signal by naked eye on Fittonia albivenis (Nerve Plant) was 50.0μg/L, which is lower than the exposure limit of 80.0μg/L as indicated by World Health Organization. The results showed that ornamental plants with the aid of N-doped CDs can be developed into phytosensor for formaldehyde detection. Furthermore, findings in this study will be useful for the development of plant biosensor for other indoor air pollution monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBiological Sciences 3aFittonia albivenis 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair quality 3abiosensors 3acarbon 3afluorescence 3aformaldehyde 3aindoor air pollution 3anitrogen 0aFormaldehyde monitoring 0aN-doped carbon dots 0aOrnamental Plant 0aPhytosensor1 aMuangphrom, Paskorn1 aPataranutaporn, Pat1 aChaiworn, Wachira1 aSurareungchai, Werasak0 tPlant nano biology.g2022 Sept. 01,  p.100015-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28687x2773-11117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plana.2022.100015  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009800175300001800273520095100291592002801242650001501270650001401285650002101299650001101320650001801331650000701349650001101356650001601367650001401383650001601397650001601413653001101429653002101440653001501461653002101476653002101497700002601518700002001544773013001564856008501694852000901779655001201788IND60530908120221118044143.0160723e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053090812DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b014862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrell, Matthew J.10aImproving the Wettability of Enzyme-Bleached Cotton Fabric with Inclusion of Sodium Surfactin  ap. 1569-1572.  aThe enzymatic bleaching of cotton fabric has presented itself as a sustainable step forward in the field of textile processing. Instead of employing high temperature and alkalinity to promote the oxidative peroxide bleaching of cotton, enzyme bleaching of cotton fabrics allows near neutral pH bleaching at much lower temperatures by the generation of peracids. A notable drawback observed with enzymatic bleaching of cotton fabrics is that although white fabrics are obtained, initial and instantaneous wetting is not easily obtained. It has been found that the naturally derived surfactant sodium surfactin can be used with a conventional textile surfactant during enzymatic bleaching to obtain much faster initial and instantaneous wetting. Adding small amounts (0.005–0.1 g/L) of sodium surfactin to an enzymatic bleach process caused a substantial decrease in the amount of time it takes a water drop to completely absorb on cotton fabric.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3ableaching 3ableaching agents 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3apH 3asodium 3asurfactants 3asurfactin 3atemperature 3awettability 0acotton 0aenzyme bleaching 0asurfactant 0asodium surfactin 0awater absorbance1 aDe Boskey, Miranda J.1 aAnkeny, Mary A.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1569-1572dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b014863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245009100169300002000260520128300280592002801563650001601591650002401607650002801631650002101659650001501680650001301695650001301708650001301721700002201734700002301756700002301779700002301802773012901825856008201954852000902036655001202045IND60565973920221123033811.0170330e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056597392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b086222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooksby, Paula A.10aQuantum Capacitance of Aryldiazonium Modified Large Area Few-Layer Graphene Electrodes  ap. 25778-25785.  aThe quantum capacitance from large area, 6- to 7-layered graphene, and chemically modified graphene, was determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measured at 100 Hz in a three-electrode electrochemical cell and aqueous acidic solution. Aryldiazonium chemistry was used to modify one side of the few-layered graphene sheets with methoxy- and iodo-phenyl groups. The graphene sheets were then mounted via an aqueous transfer method onto an epoxy substrate. It was found that both sides of the graphene sheets could be accessed by the electrolyte and thus the sheets were in a pseudo free-floating arrangement. The results show a complex quantum capacitance behavior with applied electrode potential, and that behavior was not stable with potential cycling. Chemically modified samples have similar quantum capacitance minimum to unmodified graphene, and all samples have a shallow U-shaped relationship with respect to applied electrode potential. The results show chemically modifying one side of few-layer graphene sheets using diazonium chemistry was not detrimental to the measured quantum capacitance minimum at the potential of zero charge, but the capacitance remained low over a large potential window which is not desirable for supercapacitor applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adiazonium compounds 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3amoieties1 aFarquhar, Anna K.1 aDykstra, Haidee

Its constituent response regulator (RR), WalR belongs to the OmpR/PhoB family which possesses a winged helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding. An in silico knowledge based model of WalR C-terminal DNA binding domain in complex with its ftsE promoter region binding motif was used to identify specific residues of the recognition helix important for DNA binding. The model was validated by mutagenesis in conjunction with in vitro DNA binding analysis. The ftsE promoter region DNA binding motif was also varied. Optimal binding of WalR to DNA required the presence of both half-sites in its binding motif. Substitution of invariant bases of WalR DNA binding motif abrogated the binding whereas changes at variable motif positions governed affinity. D199 was not in direct contact with the DNA but its substitution modified the WalR-DNA specificity indicating the importance of contact avoidance by this residue for DNA specificity. This represents the first in-depth study of RR-DNA interaction from B. anthracis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding domains 3adirect contact 3agenes 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3apromoter regions 0aTwo component system 0aWalR 0aRecognition helix1 aRahi, Amit1 aGopalani, Monisha1 aBajpai, Sailesh1 aBhatnagar, Sonika1 aBhatnagar, Rakesh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Mar., v. 96 p.257-264dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04571naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002200167245011700189300001600306520206000322592002802382650002102410650000802431650001202439650001802451650001502469650001002484650002102494650001002515650001302525650001002538650002102548650001702569650002402586650004202610650000902652650001102661650001902672650001002691650001202701650005802713650002502771650002502796650002302821650002102844650002602865650005102891650002402942650005002966650005103016650003803067650000903105650005203114650003803166650001003204650005303214650002603267700001703293700002203310700002203332700002203354700002103376700001803397700002003415700002103435700003003456700001903486700002503505700002203530773012003552856008403672852000903756655001203765IND4470580420221120071126.0141111e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447058042DNAL7 a226480452pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, Sharla M.10aIn vivo characterization of inflammatory biomarkers in swine and the impact of flunixin meglumine administration  ap. 236-242.  aNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are a family of chemicals that function to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation, and they are commonly used in people and animals for this purpose. Currently there are no NSAIDs approved for the management of inflammation in swine due to a lack of validated animal models and suitable biomarkers to assess efficacy. A previous in vitro study examining biomarkers of inflammation identified fourteen genes that were significantly altered in response to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. In the present study, five of those fourteen genes were tested in vivo to determine if the same effects observed in vitro were also observed in vivo. Plasma levels of prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), an essential mediator of fever and inflammation, were also determined. Two groups of swine were stimulated with LPS with the second group also treated with flunixin meglumine. Blood was collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24, and 48h post LPS-stimulation. The RNA was extracted from the blood and quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to determine the expression patterns of CD1, CD4, serum amyloid A2 (SAA2), Caspase 1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). The LPS-stimulated animals demonstrated a statistically significant alteration in expression of SAA2 and CD1 at 3h post-stimulation. Flunixin meglumine treated animals’ demonstrated reduced expression of CD1 in comparison to the LPS-stimulated swine at 24 and 48h post LPS-stimulation. Flunixin meglumine treated animals exhibited reduced expression of SAA2 at 48h post-stimulation compared to LPS-stimulated swine. Swine treated with LPS demonstrated statistically significant increases in plasma PGE₂ at 1h post-stimulation. Swine treated with flunixin meglumine had no increase in plasma PGE₂ levels at any time. These results demonstrate that PGE₂ production, along with two out of five genes (SAA2 and CD1) have the potential to serve as early biomarkers of inflammation as well as indicators of NSAID efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3achemoattractants 3afever 3aflunixin 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apain 3apeople 3aprostaglandins 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxpharmacology 2aAntigens, CD1xblood 2aCD4 Antigensxblood. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCaspase 1xblood 2aChemokine CCL2xblood 2aClonixinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aDinoprostonexblood 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aInflammationxbloodxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxanalysis 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxbloodxdrug therapyximmunology. 2aThromboxane B2xblood1 aYancy, Haile1 aDeaver, Christine1 aJones, Yolanda L.1 aKenyon, Elizabeth1 aChiesa, Oscar A.1 aEsparza, Juan1 aScreven, Rudell1 aLancaster, Vicki1 aStubbs, John T., IIIcIII1 aYang, Maocheng1 aWiesenfeld, Paddy L.1 aMyers, Michael J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 148, no. 3-4 p.236-242dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245014900167300001600316506011700332506007600449520167900525592002802204506003702232650001302269650001702282650001202299650001602311650001102327650001602338650001802354650001302372650002502385650001002410650000902420650001702429650001902446650001702465650002502482650001202507653000902519653001802528653001602546653001702562653001802579700001202597700001202609700001602621773010702637856008402744852000902828655001202837IND60792171720221207115842.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079217172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crope.2022.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Shaokun10aEffect of in situ incorporation of three types of green manure on soil quality, grain yield and 2-acetyl-1-pyrrolline content in tropical region  ap. 189-197.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFragrant rice is widely consumed worldwide due to its pleasant aroma and better cooking qualities. Incorporation of green manure plays a good substitutable role in reducing chemical fertilizer applications while enhancing soil fertility. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of in situ incorporation of different green manures on soil physio-chemical properties, nitrogen (N) uptake, grain yield and the 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) of subsequently grown fragrant rice across two seasons. Treatments included fragrant rice grown with fallow (T0 as control), with incorporation of rice biomass in field (T1), with incorporation of Sesbania biomass in field (T2), and with incorporation of Stylosanthes biomass in field (T3). Results showed that yields of T1, T2 and T3 were increased by on average of 13.1%, 29.1% and 23.9%, respectively, across two seasons compared with T0. And 2-AP contents in rice grains under T1, T2 and T3 were increased by 44.6–56.5%, 97.2–138.1% and 75.2–174.6%, respectively. Further analysis indicated that in situ incorporation of leguminous green manure significantly decreased soil bulk density, while increased the soil total organic carbon, and N availability. Thus, the plant N uptake and the partial factor productivity for N fertilizer (PFPN) were markedly increased by incorporation of leguminous green manure. Results suggested in situ incorporation of leguminous green manure was beneficial to sustain the production of fragrant rice in tropical regions. The mechanisms underlying the improvement of 2-AP content of fragrant rice with incorporation of the leguminous green manure will be addressed in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSesbania 3aStylosanthes 3abiomass 3aenvironment 3afallow 3agrain yield 3agreen manures 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aodors 3arice 3asoil density 3asoil fertility 3asoil quality 3atotal organic carbon 3atropics 0a2-AP 0aFragrant rice 0aGrain yield 0aGreen manure 0aSoil property1 aLi, Lin1 aYin, Qi1 aNie, Lixiao0 tCrop and environment.g2022 Sept., v. 1, no. 3 p.189-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:28660x2773-126X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crope.2022.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006200173300001400235520082000249592002801069650000801097650002501105650001801130650002201148650001701170650002101187650001801208653000901226653001001235653002801245653002401273653002001297653003101317700001901348700002601367700002001393700001801413700001601431700002601447700002001473773009001493856008401583852000901667655001201676IND60673106420221119132238.0200614e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067310642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchbender, Andreas10aImproved library preparation with the new iCLIP2 protocol  ap. 33-48.  aIndividual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) is a state-of-the-art technology to map the RNA interaction sites of an RNA-binding protein (RBP) across the transcriptome. Here, we present the new iCLIP2 protocol that allows to obtain high-quality iCLIP libraries in a fast and efficient manner. The new protocol comprises separate adapter ligations, two cDNA amplification steps and bead-based size selection. The full procedure can be completed within four days. Our advances significantly increase the complexity of the iCLIP2 libraries, resulting in a more comprehensive representation of RBP binding sites. Overall, the methodological advances in iCLIP2 allow efficient library generation and thereby promote the versatile and flexible application of this important technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aRNA-binding proteins 3abinding sites 3acomplementary DNA 3acrosslinking 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscriptome 0aCLIP 0aiCLIP 0aProtein-RNA interaction 0aRNA-binding protein 0aUV crosslinking 0aHigh-throughput sequencing1 aMutter, Holger1 aSutandy, F.X.

Landowners use oil palm sap for the production of sodabi (a local spirit), and an oil palm fallow (if no crops are grown beneath the palms) to restore soil fertility. In this area, growing oil palm for its oil is uncommon. Tenants access the land under specific contracts but are not allowed to plant oil palm. They grow food crops beneath the oil palm and extend the cropping period by severely pruning the palms because their right to grow food crops terminates when the palms reach a height of 2m. The competing claims between landowners and tenants and between oil palm and annual food crops result in conflicts over practices that either degrade or restore soil fertility. Using a political ecology perspective, we examined how two overlapping institutions shape access to and management of the land: the customary tenure system and the legal system that was introduced to regulate titling and contracting. These institutions have divergent implications for tenants and landowners, in terms of both social equity and land management practices. The implications of this institutional patchwork (bricolage) for joint learning to achieve sustainable agriculture are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aecology 3afallow 3afarmers 3afood crops 3aland management 3alandowners 3apalm oils 3aplateaus 3apolitics 3apruning 3asap 3asoil fertility 3asustainable agriculture 3aBenin1 aCrane, T.A.1 aVissoh, P.V.1 aMongbo, R.L.1 aRichards, P.1 aKossou, D.K.1 aKuyper, T.W.0 tNetherlands journal of agricultural science.g2012 Dec., v. 60-63 p.91-99dElsevier B.V.x1573-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2012.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003800152245011700190300001600307520095600323592002801279650004401307650002201351650001601373650002301389650001701412650002101429650004401450650001301494650005801507650001301565650001401578653000801592653000801600653001301608653000801621653001301629653001001642653001201652653001301664653000801677653001001685653001201695653001001707653001201717653001801729653002301747653002201770700002901792700002601821700002801847700002501875700003201900700003801932773011601970856008602086852000902172655001202181IND60561784720221122023934.0170124e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056178472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.11.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastellane, Tereza Cristina Luque10aCharacterization of new exopolysaccharide production by Rhizobium tropici during growth on hydrocarbon substrate  ap. 361-369.  aExopolysaccharide (EPS) are produced by a diverse of rhizobia species and has been demonstrated to be a bioemulsifier with potential applications in the degradation of hydrocarbons. In the present study, attempts were made to obtain the new exopolysaccharide production by Rhizobium tropici (SEMIA 4080 and MUTZC3) strains during growth on hydrocarbon substrate. Under the different cultivation conditions, the high molecular weight exopolysaccharides from Rhizobium tropici strains cultivated for 96h mainly consisted of carbohydrates (79–85%) and a low percentage of protein. The EPSC3-D differed from the others, with only 60% of carbohydrate. However, all strains produced polymers with distinct rheology properties, such as viscosity of each EPS sample, suitable for different applications. In addition, RP-HPLC, FTIR and NMR studies revealed EPS produced by rhizobia strains were similar indicating minimal difference between EPS compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRhizobium tropici 3aemulsifiers 3aexopolysaccharides 3ahydrocarbons 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3arheology 3aviscosity 0aEPS 0aCDW 0aATR-FTIR 0aRMN 0aVACP-MAS 0aHPSEC 0aRP-HPLC 0aUV–vis 0aPMP 0aEPSWT 0aEPSWT-D 0aEPSC3 0aEPSC3-D 0aBioemulsifier 0aExopolysaccharides 0aRhizobium tropici1 aCampanharo, João Carlos1 aColnago, Luiz Alberto1 aCoutinho, Isabel Duarte1 aLopes, Érica Mendes1 aLemos, Manoel Victor Franco1 ade Macedo Lemos, Eliana Gertrudes0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Mar., v. 96 p.361-369dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.11.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006900169520067800238592002800916650002000944650001000964650001100974653000800985653000800993653000801001653001801009653003401027653002801061653003201089700002001121700005601141773009801197856008601295852000901381655001201390IND60792368920221117223606.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079236892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1108442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaliar, Lilia10aCapital-skill complementarity and inequality: Twenty years after  aWe revisit a seminal capital-skill complementarity analysis of Krusell et al.

We find that over the recent years, the skill premium pattern changed dramatically, from a U-shaped to a monotonically increasing. However, the capital-skill complementarity framework remains remarkably successful in explaining the data. This is true even when the model is estimated using a significantly declining labor share as in Karabarbounis and Neiman (2014). We finally construct a projection for skill premium for 2017–2037, and we conclude that the inequality will continue to grow in the US economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3alabor 3amodels 0aC73 0aD90 0aE21 0aSkill premium 0aCapital-skill complementarity 0aCES production function 0aSkilled and unskilled labor1 aMaliar, Serguei1 aTsener, Inna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6795-06710 tEconomics letters.g2022 Nov., v. 220 p.110844-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1108443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245006500164300001600229520117700245592002801422653002201450653002201472653002401494653002801518653001601546653002501562653001601587653003201603700001701635700002101652700002201673773009401695856008001789852000901869655001201878IND60130689520221117222946.0151127e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013068952DNAL7 a10.1525/auk.2011.110262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Jane M.10aMaintenance of a Hybrid Zone: The Role of Female Mate Choice  ap. 688-695.  aHybrid zones between different plumage morphs are common in birds. These zones can be maintained by (1) divergent selection pressures on either side of the zone or (2) some restriction to mating between the forms that limits gene flow from one side to the other. In eastern Australia, there is a distinct hybrid zone between two plumage forms of the Australian Magpie (Cracticus tibicen), with black-backed birds in the north, white-backed birds in the south, and both forms plus intermediates in a zone ∼100 km wide. On the basis of social groups, there is no evidence of assortative mating in the hybrid zone. However, extrapair fertilizations (EPF) occur in other Australian Magpie populations and, thus, may also occur in the hybrid zone. We examined evidence of EPFs in the hybrid zone to test for either (1) positive assortative mating or (2) preference for the brighter plumage form. Although there were significant levels of EPFs of ∼30%, there was no evidence for positive assortative mating or preference for the brighter white-backed males. Other explanations for the current distribution of the hybrid zone and its maintenance will need to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAustralian Magpie 0aCracticus tibicen 0adivergent selection 0aextrapair fertilization 0ahybrid zone 0ainbreeding avoidance 0amate choice 0apositive assortative mating1 aToon, Alicia1 aMather, Peter B.1 aLange, Corinna L.0 tAuk.g2011 Oct., v. 128, no. 4 p.688-695dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2011.110263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245009800161300001400259520051900273592002800792650002200820650002300842650001200865650001200877700002200889700002000911773012400931856007201055852000901127655001201136IND60657317720221118132710.0190816e20021219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065731772DNAL7 a10.1039/b208603b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKownacki, Ireneusz10aAlkoxy/siloxy group exchange in the system vinyltrialkoxysilane–iridium(i) siloxide complex  ap. 76-77.  aA study of reactions of dimeric siloxide iridium complex, [{(cod)Ir(μ-OSiMe₃)}₂] (1) with vinyltriethoxysilane and vinyltrimethoxysilane has revealed a new type of the reaction—alkoxy group transfer from silicon to iridium with a simultaneous transfer of a siloxy group from iridium to silicon—as a result of which vinyldialkoxytrimethyldisiloxane and dimeric alkoxide iridium complex [{(cod)Ir(μ-OR)}₂] (3) are formed.

Here, a collection of 125 pale flax accessions and the Canadian flax core collection of 407 accessions were genotyped using 112 genome-wide simple sequence repeat markers and phenotyped for nine traits with the aim of conducting population structure, molecular diversity and association mapping analyses. The combined population structure analysis identified two well-supported major groups corresponding to pale and cultivated flax. The L. usitatissimum convar. crepitans accessions most closely resembled its wild progenitor, both having dehiscent capsules. The unbiased Nei’s genetic distance (0.65) confirmed the strong genetic differentiation between cultivated and pale flax. Similar levels of genetic diversity were observed in both species, albeit 430 (48 %) of pale flax alleles were unique, in agreement with their high genetic differentiation. Significant associations were identified for seven and four traits in pale and cultivated flax, respectively. Favorable alleles with potentially positive effect to improve yield through yield components were identified in pale flax. The allelic frequencies of markers associated with domestication-related traits such as capsular dehiscence indicated directional selection with the most common alleles in pale flax being absent or rare in cultivated flax and vice versa. Our results demonstrated that pale flax is a potential source of novel variation to improve multiple traits in cultivated flax and that association mapping is a suitable approach to screening pale flax germplasm to identify favorable quantitative trait locus alleles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aalleles 3adehiscence 3aflax 3agene frequency 3agene pool 3agenetic background 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3aquantitative trait loci 3ascreening 3ayield components1 aDiederichsen, Axel1 aDuguid, Scott1 aBooker, Helen1 aRowland, Gordon1 aCloutier, Sylvie0 tMolecular breeding.g2014 Dec., v. 34, no. 4 p.2091-2107dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-014-0165-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008200162520104400244592002801288650002101316650001801337650001201355650001301367650001201380650001901392650001701411650001901428650001101447650002301458650001401481653001401495653001101509653001901520653001201539653001201551700001301563700001701576700001501593700001601608700001701624700001201641700001201653773012401665856008301789852000901872655001201881IND60792369020221117223522.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079236902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Zijun10aImpacts of CO2 atmosphere on property of the biochar from pyrolysis of lignin  aCO₂ can be used to activate biomass for production of activated carbon at high temperatures (usually above 700 °C). At typical pyrolysis temperatures, CO₂ might also involve in biomass pyrolysis, which was investigated via pyrolysis of lignin at temperatures from 400 to 700 °C in N₂ and CO₂ atomsphere, respectively. The results suggested that CO₂ interfered with the pyrolysis process, facilitating formation of bio-oil and biochar but not gases via suppressing further gasification of volatiles. This reserved more mono-ring phenolics in bio-oil and also formed more heavier phenolics through secondary condensation routes. As for biochar, CO₂ enhanced the aromatization process, generating the carbon-rich biochar of higher heating value. The in-situ characterization of the functionalities of biochar during pyrolysis suggested that CO₂ accelerated removal of the aliphatics like -OH, -C-H, CO, and C-O-C. This rendered the biochar of hydrophobic surface but less fragmentized structures than that obtained in N₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aaromatization 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3agasification 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3aphenolic compounds 3apyrolysis 0aPyrolysis 0aLignin 0aCO2 atmosphere 0aBiochar 0aBio-oil1 aLi, Chao1 aZhang, Lijun1 aZhang, Shu1 aGao, Wenran1 aWang, Shuang1 aLi, Bin1 aHu, Xun0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 Oct., v. 167 p.105689-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1056893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010700167300001800274520117200292592002801464650001201492650001001504650002001514650001501534650001401549650001401563650003001577650001801607650002701625650001401652650001401666650003501680650001601715650001001731700001901741700001701760700002201777700002001799700002701819700002501846700001601871700001901887700002001906700002501926773011301951856008102064852000902145655001202154IND60119321120221120114420.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011932112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-014-0166-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForrest, Kerrie10aDevelopment of a SNP marker assay for the Lr67 gene of wheat using a genotyping by sequencing approach  ap. 2109-2118.  aThe recently characterised and mapped adult plant resistance gene Lr67 contributes to the breeding of durable resistance against multiple fungal pathogens of wheat. Lack of tightly linked markers has so far prevented widespread use of Lr67 in breeding programmes. Exhaustive screening of available SSR markers and 9,000 gene-associated SNPs using bulk segregant analysis yielded several linked markers but none close enough to the gene for routine breeding applications. In contrast, genotyping by sequencing identified several better-linked SNP-based markers that were converted into single-marker KASPar assays. Marker csSNP856 co-segregated with Lr67 in two mapping populations and was significantly associated with stripe rust resistance in an association mapping population of 972 wheat lines. High frequency (43 %, 29/66) of the Lr67-associated SNP allele in landraces from the Indian subcontinent suggests the origin of Lr67 from this region. While marker csSNP856 is not diagnostic for the presence of Lr67, it represents a significant step towards assisting the transfer of this adult plant resistance gene into elite germplasm via marker-assisted breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3afungi 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3agermplasm 3alandraces 3amarker-assisted selection 3amature plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3ascreening 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astripe rust 3awheat1 aPujol, Vincent1 aBulli, Peter1 aPumphrey, Michael1 aWellings, Colin1 aHerrera-Foessel, Sybil1 aHuerta-Espino, Julio1 aSingh, Ravi1 aLagudah, Evans1 aHayden, Matthew1 aSpielmeyer, Wolfgang0 tMolecular breeding.g2014 Dec., v. 34, no. 4 p.2109-2118dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-014-0166-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017400165300001600339520089300355592002801248650001101276650001401287650001101301650001201312650002201324650001801346650002301364650001801387650001501405651001001420700001801430700001801448700001901466700001801485700001501503773012201518856008101640852000901721655001201730IND60440707120221121143120.0160522e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044070712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-014-0187-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Nirmal10aCharacterization and evaluation of hydrological processes responsible for spatiotemporal variation of surface water quality at Narmada estuarine region in Gujarat, India  ap. 261-270.  aThis study is an effort to trace the spatiotemporal variation in water at Narmada estuarine region through solute concentration. A total of 72 water samples were collected and analyzed from three sampling points along with in situ measurement of tidal height at monthly basis for 2 years. Result shows that spatiotemporal variation of water quality occurs because of the following main mechanisms, i.e., carbonate weathering, dilution and seawater–freshwater mixing. Firstly, points situated toward inland showing the simple dilution effect on receiving high amount of monsoonal precipitation. Secondly, tidal fluctuation pattern has a strong influence on the water quality taken from the point located in near proximity to the coast. Finally, it can be concluded that water quality shows a different response, in accordance with the different tidal phase and the distance from the sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3amixing 3asolutes 3aspatial variation 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3aweathering 3aIndia1 aKumar, Pankaj1 aBasil, George1 aKumar, Rita N.1 aKharrazi, Ali1 aRam Avtar,0 tApplied water science.g2015 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.261-270dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22883x2190-54877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-014-0187-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006000166300001400226520091400240592002801154650001401182650001101196650004201207700001901249700001601268773009001284856008401374852000901458655001201467IND60673106620221119132246.0200330e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067310662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapurso, Dan10aMethods for comparative ChIA-PET and Hi-C data analysis  ap. 69-74.  aThe three-dimensional architecture of chromatin in the nucleus is important for genome regulation and function.

To clarify the genetic basis of stigma exsertion rate, a recombinant inbred line population was developed from two superior rice cultivars, Zhongguo Xiangdao (ZX) and Chuanxiang 29B (CX29B), and a total of 11 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for stigma exsertion rate were detected over 2 years. Two QTLs on chromosome 1 and four QTLs on chromosome 6 formed two QTL cluster regions, qSe1 and qSe6, respectively. To further validate the effect of qSe1 and qSe6, the near-isogenic lines (NILs) of the two QTL cluster regions were constructed with the genetic background of CX29B. Compared to CX29B, CX29B (qSe1ZX), the NIL carrying homozygous qSe1 regions from ZX, showed a dual stigma exsertion rate increased by 18.35 % and a single stigma exsertion rate increased by 16.24 %; in contrast, CX29B (qSe6ZX), the NIL carrying homozygous qSe6 regions from ZX, showed a dual stigma exsertion rate decreased by 16.87 % and a single stigma exsertion rate decreased by 20.47 %. Therefore, the qSe1 region from ZX and the qSe6 region from CX29B have positive effects on improvement of stigma exsertion rate and would be very useful in rice breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3agenetic background 3ahomozygosity 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3astigma1 aFeng, Fuchun1 aZhang, Qinglu1 aZhao, Yuan,1 aGao, Guanjun1 aHe, Yuqing0 tMolecular breeding.g2014 Dec., v. 34, no. 4 p.2131-2138dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-014-0168-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015400174300001600328520174800344592002802092650002302120650002502143650001902168650002102187650001002208650001502218650001902233650001102252650001102263650002102274650001202295650001202307650001802319650002002337650002402357650002302381651001202404700002302416700001702439773012202456856008102578852000902659655001202668IND60440707320221121111335.0160522e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044070732DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-014-0186-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDauda, Suleiman Alhaji10aHousehold’s willingness to pay for heterogeneous attributes of drinking water quality and services improvement: an application of choice experiment  ap. 253-259.  aThe service of providing good quality of drinking water can greatly improve the lives of the community and maintain a normal health standard. For a large number of population in the world, specifically in the developing countries, the availability of safe water for daily sustenance is none. Damaturu is the capital of Yobe State, Nigeria. It hosts a population of more than two hundred thousand, yet only 45 % of the households are connected to the network of Yobe State Water Corporation’s pipe borne water services; this has led people to source for water from any available source and thus, exposed them to the danger of contracting waterborne diseases. In order to address the problem, Yobe State Government has embarked on the construction of a water treatment plant with a capacity and facility to improve the water quality and connect the town with water services network. The objectives of this study are to assess the households’ demand preferences of the heterogeneous water attributes in Damaturu, and to estimate their marginal willingness to pay, using mixed logit model in comparison with conditional logit model. A survey of 300 households randomly sampled indicated that higher education greatly influenced the households’ WTP decisions. The most significant variable from both of the models is TWQ, which is MRS that rates the water quality from the level of satisfactory to very good. 219 % in simple model is CLM, while 126 % is for the interaction model. As for MLM, 685 % is for the simple model and 572 % is for the interaction model. Estimate of MLM has more explanatory powers than CLM. Essentially, this finding can help the government in designing cost-effective management and efficient tariff structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloping countries 3adrinking water 3ahigher education 3ahosts 3ahouseholds 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3apeople 3astate government 3asurveys 3atariffs 3awater quality 3awater treatment 3awaterborne diseases 3awillingness to pay 3aNigeria1 aMohd.

The most effective isolate was TS3B-45, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as being more closely related to Bacillus velezensis; its effect was compared with different control methods: chitosan, two synthetic fungicides (benomyl and prochloraz), NaHCO3 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 55614. TS3B-45 isolate showed inhibitory activity in vitro (80%), similar to prochloraz (82%) and B. subtilis ATCC 55614 (77%). It also proved effective against other fungal plant pathogens, including native Colletotrichum spp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Curvularia clavata, Pestalotiopsis maculans, and both Fusarium nivale and F. solani. In vivo tests validated the effectiveness of this novel B. velezensis strain against C. gloeosporioides under semi-commercial postharvest conditions, achieving a disease control based on Abbott's method. Based on this analysis, the results did not differ significantly of those exhibited by the commercial product Serenade® (Bacillus subtilis). B. velezensis TS3B-45 treatment did not affect a range of quality parameters including maturity index, fruit weight, reducing sugar, and acidity of mangoes after 32 days of storage and shelf conditions. To our knowledge this is the first report of a B. velezensis-like bacterium as a promising suitable biocontrol agent for postharvest conservation. Further testing is required including stabilization, bioformulation and assessment of toxicity against human.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBacillus velezensis 3aColletotrichum 3aCurvularia 3aFusarium solani 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aMangifera indica 3aMonographella nivalis 3aPestalotiopsis 3aacidity 3aantagonists 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3abenomyl 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3achitosan 3adisease control 3afinancial economics 3afruit weight 3afruits 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3aleaves 3amangoes 3aorchards 3aphyllosphere 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apoisoning 3aprochloraz 3areducing sugars 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asodium bicarbonate 3astorage time 3atoxicity 3aMexico 0aFungal decay 0aMango 0aMicrobial antagonism 0aPostharvest decay1 aSanmartín, Patricia1 aCamacho-Chab, Juan Carlos1 aDe la Rosa-García, Susana C.1 aChan-Bacab, Manuel Jesús1 aÁguila-Ramírez, Ruth Noemí1 aCarrillo-Villanueva, Francisco1 aDe la Rosa-Escalante, Erika1 aArteaga-Garma, Jorge Luis1 aSerrano, Miguel1 aOrtega-Morales, Benjamín Otto,0 tBiological control.g2020 Feb., v. 141 p.104127-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.1041273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03727naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245015700201500001900358500002000377520156600397592002801963596007201991596005902063596010402122596010002226650001602326650002402342650001702366650002202383650002002405650001702425650003002442650001502472650001802487650001802505650002402523650001702547650003002564650001502594650002402609650001702633650002202650650002802672650002002700650001602720700001802736700001502754700001702769700001502786700001602801700001602817700001602833700001202849700001402861773013902875856007803014852000903092655001203101IND60735466620221122043548.0210426e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546662DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2020007452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Baoming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5288-820610aLycium ruthenicum Anthocyanins Attenuate High‐Fat Diet‐Induced Colonic Barrier Dysfunction and Inflammation in Mice by Modulating the Gut Microbiota  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: Gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation originating from a dysbiotic gut microbiota (GM) are strongly associated with a high‐fat diet (HFD). Anthocyanins from Lycium ruthenicum (ACs) show antiobesity effects through modulating the GM. However, the mechanism linking the antiobesity effects of ACs and GM modulation remains obscure. METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate the ameliorative effects of ACs on colonic barrier dysfunction and inflammation, mice are fed an HFD with or without ACs at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg kg⁻¹ for 12 weeks. AC supplementation reduced weight gain, enriched short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA)‐producing bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcaceae, Muribaculaceae, Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG‐014, and Bacteroides) and SCFA content, depleted endotoxin‐producing bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter and Desulfovibrionaceae), and decreased endotoxin (i.e., lipopolysaccharide) levels. SCFAs substantially activated G protein‐coupled receptors (GPRs), inhibited histone deacetylases (HDAC), increased intestinal tight junction mRNA and protein expression levels, reduced intestinal permeability, and protected intestinal barrier integrity in HFD‐induced mice. These effects mitigate intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the LPS/NF‐κB/TLR4 pathway. CONCLUSION: These data indicates that ACs can mitigate colonic barrier dysfunction and inflammation, induce SCFA production and inhibit endotoxin production by modulating the GM in HFD‐fed mice. This finding provides a clue for understanding the antiobesity effects of ACs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2452019181cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31360191cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKJT2017004cNingxia Hui Autonomous Region Science and Technology Innovation Leading Talents Project  a2013NYYZ0101cSpecial Foundation for Agricultural Breeding of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region 3aBacteroides 3aDesulfovibrionaceae 3aHelicobacter 3aLycium ruthenicum 3aRuminococcaceae 3aanthocyanins 3adigestive system diseases 3aendotoxins 3afood research 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistone deacetylase 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alipopolysaccharides 3apermeability 3aprotein synthesis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3atight junctions 3aweight gain1 aZhao, Jianhua1 aZhang, Min1 aChen, Zhifei1 aMa, Qingyu1 aLiu, Huicui1 aNie, Chenxi1 aZhang, Ziqi1 aAn, Wei1 aLi, Juxiu0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2021 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.e2000745-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2020007453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008500171520131800256592002801574650002701602650003001629650002201659650001801681650002001699650001701719650004301736650001301779650001601792700002801808700002001836700001801856700002801874773009401902856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60725044020221120093434.0210124e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072504402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1037752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Ríos, David10aData of clavulanic acid and clavulanate-imidazole stability at low temperatures  aClavulanic acid (CA) is a β-lactam antibiotic with a strong inhibitory effect on β-lactamase enzymes. CA is produced in submerged cultures by the filamentous Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus (S. clavuligerus). CA is an unstable molecule in aqueous solution and its stability depends strongly on temperature and concentration. In this contribution, the experimental data of CA stability, produced in chemically defined media and exposed to temperatures between −80 and 25 °C, are presented. The chromophore clavulanate-imidazole (CAI) is commonly used for analysis and quantification of CA samples by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC); nevertheless, this molecule is also susceptible to suffer degradation in aqueous solution, potentially affecting the quantification of CA. Data of CAI concentration for samples conserved at 4 °C and 25 °C are also presented. A reversible-irreversible kinetic model was applied to estimate the degradation rate of CA. Data from numerical simulations of CA degradation using the proposed kinetic model are also graphically presented. The data show the clavulanic acid instability in fermentation broths, in a range of temperatures of interest for bioprocess operation, downstream processing, samples quantification, conservation and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStreptomyces clavuligerus 3aaqueous solutions 3abioprocessing 3aclavulanic acid 3afermentation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akinetics 3atemperature1 aRamírez-Malule, Howard1 aNeubauer, Peter1 aJunne, Stefan1 aRíos-Estepa, Rigoberto0 tData in Brief.g2019 Apr., v. 23 p.103775-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.1037753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011400170300001400284520176600298592002802064650002202092650001202114650001702126650001802143650002002161650002802181650002102209650001102230650001502241650001802256650001102274650001402285650001902299650002302318650002102341650001702362650001702379650001202396650001002408650002702418651001002445700001502455700002002470700001702490700002102507700001702528773011002545856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60088692420221119153913.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008869242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.njas.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsei-Amponsah, C.10aProcessing practices of small-scale palm oil producers in the Kwaebibirem District, Ghana: A diagnostic study  ap. 49-56.  aGhana produces about 2,000,000 metric tons of oil palm fruits annually, and small-scale processors contribute about 60% of crude palm oil production. The country is not self-sufficient in the fats and oils needed for industrial use and home consumption. A large percentage of the palm oil produced by small-scale processors cannot be utilized by the larger scale industries in Ghana or abroad because of its poor quality. There is an urgent need to explore the causes and to identify ways to address the situation. We carried out a diagnostic study in the Kwaebibirem District using key informant interviews, focus group discussions and surveys based on a semi-structured questionnaire to assess the processing practices of small-scale oil palm fruit processors, and to analyse the rationale behind these practices and their effects on the quality of palm oil produced. The processing practices identified included storage of loosened fruits for long periods before boiling, disposal of effluent into drains, use of spent tyres for boiling fruits and no clarification of the oil. About 54% of the processors store oil palm fruits for 1–3 weeks before processing, possibly allowing some fermentation, to increase extractability and reduce labour costs. This practice may reduce the quality of palm oil by increasing the levels of free fatty acids. The effects of the storage period on the quality and quantity of palm oil, the seasonal oil content of oil palm fruits, and the types of linkages and interactions amongst actors in the oil palm industry were identified together with stakeholders as issues for further research. Innovation in small-scale oil palm fruit processing is revealed as a multi-stakeholder, multiple-scale, and interdisciplinary process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aboiling 3afermentation 3afood industry 3afood processing 3afood processing quality 3afree fatty acids 3afruits 3ainterviews 3alipid content 3alipids 3apalm oils 3aquestionnaires 3aseasonal variation 3asmall businesses 3astakeholders 3astorage time 3asurveys 3atires 3awages and remuneration 3aGhana1 aVisser, L.1 aAdjei-Nsiah, S.1 aStruik, P.C.1 aSakyi-Dawson, O.1 aStomph, T.J.0 tNetherlands journal of agricultural science.g2012 Dec., v. 60-63 p.49-56dElsevier B.V.x1573-52147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.njas.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003600113040001800149100002400167245010300191300001000294500000900304520102200313592002801335650001601363650001301379650002001392650001401412650002201426650001801448650002501466651001601491773010801507852000901615856011201624856008301736961001301819655001201832IND4380621220221121220339.0191122e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438062122DNAL7 a10113/118962hdl7 a10.1094/CM-2005-0421-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeatherly, Larry G.10aSoybean Development in the Midsouthern USA Related to Date of Planting and Maturity Classification  ap. 0.  aepub  aSoybean (Glycine max) is planted from late March through June in the midsouthern USA. Different developmental patterns that result from this range in planting dates will affect management decisions. Irrigated field studies were conducted at Stoneville, MS (33° 26'N) from 1979 through 2003 to determine effect of late March through June planting dates on developmental patterns of maturity group (MG) IV through MG VI soybean. In all plantings, time from planting to beginning bloom (R1) increased as MG increased from IV to VI. Time from R1 to full seed (R6; pod cavity filled) was sometimes but not always different among the MGs, and differences were always ≤ 7 days. The major difference in the length of growing season among cultivars of different MGs occured before reproductive development began regardless of planting date. Thus, performance of soybean cultivars of disparate MGs should not be affected by differences in time between stages of reproductive development, but rather by when the stages occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3amaturity groups 3acultivars 3aplant development 3aplanting date 3adevelopmental stages 3aMississippi0 tCrop management.g2005 Apr., v. 4, no. 1 p.0-0dPlant Management NetworkwJournal:6161x1543-78337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/118963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CM-2005-0421-01-RS3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03449naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013800161500001900299500002000318520140400338592002801742596007601770596005801846596007801904596005801982650002602040650002102066650002702087650002002114650001202134650001602146650002302162650002002185650001402205650001402219650001802233650001502251650001402266650003002280650000902310650001502319650000902334650001802343650001302361650001502374650001902389650001902408650001702427700005202444700001702496700001402513700001302527700001802540700001302558700001402571773013902585856007802724852000902802655001202811IND60735466720221122043559.0210426e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546672DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2020009222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhenzhen10aTherapeutic and Prebiotic Effects of Five Different Native Starches on Dextran Sulfate Sodium‐Induced Mice Model of Colonic Colitis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: The availability of studies related to the effects of natural macronutrients on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain relatively limited. This study investigates whether and to what extent the consumption of five different native starches alleviate the clinical symptoms and dysbiosis of gut microbiota associated with colitis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)‐induced mouse model of colitis, the potential effects of native potato starch (PS), pea starch (PEAS), corn starch (CS), Chinese yam starch (CYS), and red sorghum starch (RSS) on the clinical manifestations and dysbiosis of gut microbiota are studied. Compared to CS and RSS, the consumption of PEAS, PS, and CYS significantly diminishes clinical enteritis symptoms, including reduced disease activity index, and the alleviated degree of colonic histological damage. Furthermore, the analysis of gut microbiota reveals the significant prebiotic characteristics of PEAS, PS and CYS, as indicated by the maintenance of gut microbiota hemostasis and the inhibition of typically pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Helicobacter hepaticus. CONCLUSION: Starches from potato, pea, and Chinese yam alleviate colitis symptoms in a mouse model, and also show significant prebiotic characteristics. These findings suggest a cost‐effective and convenient dietary strategy for the management of IBD.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YYSP010cKey Research and Development Plan of the Shandong Province  atsqn20161067cSpecial foundation for Taishan Scholars  aKFKT‐ZJ‐201804cChina‐Canada Joint Lab of Food Nutrition and Health  cChina‐Canada Joint Lab of Food Nutrition and Health 3aDioscorea polystachya 3aEscherichia coli 3aHelicobacter hepaticus 3aSorghum bicolor 3acolitis 3acorn starch 3acost effectiveness 3adextran sulfate 3adysbiosis 3aenteritis 3afood research 3ahemostasis 3ahistology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3apea starch 3apeas 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aprebiotics 3asodium sulfate 3asorghum starch 3atherapeutics1 aLiu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0358-805X1 aZhang, Yuhan1 aZhang, Di1 aQiu, Bin1 aWang, Xianshu1 aLiu, Jie1 aLiu, Lina0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2021 Apr., v. 65, no. 8 p.e2000922-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2020009223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011500163300001800278500001900296520181400315592002802129650001502157650002602172650001702198650002102215650000802236650001902244650001902263650001502282650001902297650001502316650001202331650001102343650001502354650001102369651001102380700001902391700002002410700001902430700002602449700002502475773013102500856007402631852000902705655001202714IND60704327320221117182344.0200723e20200722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070432732DNAL7 a10.1039/d0em00097c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagné, Kristin R.10aComposition and photo-reactivity of organic matter from permafrost soils and surface waters in interior Alaska  ap. 1525-1539.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aYedoma permafrost soils are especially susceptible to abrupt thaw due to their exceptional thickness and high ice content. Compared to other mineral soils, yedoma has a high organic carbon content, which has shown to be particularly biolabile. The organic carbon in these deposits needs to be characterised to provide an identification toolkit for detecting and monitoring the thaw, mobilisation and mineralisation of yedoma permafrost. This study characterised organic carbon isolates from thermokarst lakes (either receiving inputs from thaw of original yedoma or refrozen-thermokarst deposits, or lacking recent thaw) during winter and summer seasons within the Goldstream Creek watershed, a discontinuous permafrost watershed in interior Alaska, to identify the extent to which thermokarst-lake environments are impacted by degradation of yedoma permafrost. Waters from lakes of varied age and thermokarst activity, as well as active layer and undisturbed yedoma permafrost soils were isolated and characterised by functional group abundance (multiCP-MAS ¹³C and SPR-W5-WATERGATE ¹H NMR), absorbance and fluorescence, and photobleaching ability. DOM isolated from winter and summer seasons revealed differing composition and photoreactivity, suggesting varied active layer and permafrost influence under differing ground water flow regimes. Water extractable organic matter isolates from permafrost leachates revealed variation in terms of photoreactivity and photolability, with the youngest sampled permafrost isolate being the most photoreactive and photolabile. As temperatures increase, release of permafrost organic matter is inevitable. Obtaining a holistic understanding of DOM composition and photoreactivity will allow for a better prediction of permafrost thaw impacts in the coming decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aenvironmental science 3afluorescence 3agroundwater flow 3aice 3amineralization 3aorganic carbon 3apermafrost 3aphotobleaching 3aprediction 3astreams 3asummer 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aAlaska1 aEwers, Sara C.1 aMurphy, Carl J.1 aDaanen, Ronald1 aWalter Anthony, Katey1 aGuerard, Jennifer J.0 tEnvironmental science.g2020 July 22, v. 22, no. 7 p.1525-1539dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0em00097c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006800174300001800242520077700260592002801037650002901065650001101094650002301105650002301128650001401151650001201165650001701177650001101194650001301205650001201218651001501230700001501245700002001260773012601280856008501406852000901491655001201500IND60477499620221123015402.0151225e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047749962DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2015.10825182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerales, K.

A combination of anecdotal evidence and survey data suggests that successful spawning by Chinook Salmon reared in California reservoirs could be common. The planted juveniles are often from different basins and are genetically distinguishable from local salmon populations below reservoirs. Consequently, the possibility of behavioral and genetic interactions may lead to complications of restoration efforts via trap and haul programs. The full extent of this phenomenon needs to be documented before trap and haul programs are initiated to reintroduce salmon above reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3abasins 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ajuveniles 3arearing 3areproduction 3asalmon 3aspawning 3asurveys 3aCalifornia1 aRowan, Jay1 aMoyle, Peter B.0 tNorth American Journal of Fisheries Management.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 35, no. 6 p.1101-1105dTaylor & Francisx1548-86757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.10825183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245003700171300001600208520162900224592002801853650000801881650000901889650001201898650001901910650001401929650001901943650001101962650001001973650002701983650001002010650002402020650001902044650002102063650002002084650001502104650001102119650001302130650001302143650001402156650001602170650001902186650001702205650001802222650002602240650001002266650001002276650001002286650002302296650001102319650001102330653001302341653001402354653001802368653001302386653001002399653002402409653001402433700001602447700002402463700002202487773010902509856008602618852000902704655001202713IND60605363820221121111143.0190401e20180714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColla, Giuseppe10aNitrate in fruits and vegetables  ap. 221-238.  aThe current article provides an updated review of scientific advances regarding nitrate accumulation in plant tissues and a critical examination of the genetic, agroenvironmental and postharvest factors that can modulate nitrate levels in a wide range of horticultural crops, including herbs, roots and tubers, inflorescences, buds, seeds, stems, and leafy vegetables, fungi as well as fruits. A refined classification of horticultural crops is presented according to the nitrate content of their edible product. The role of plant cultivar/morphotype and tissue age in nitrate accumulation is discussed along with the physiological role of nitrate as osmoticum in maintaining turgor and driving leaf expansion under conditions of variable photosynthetic capacity. Nitrate accumulation is examined in respect to key cultural practices, such as the timing-rate-form of N application and the use of plant biostimulants (natural substances and microbial inoculants), as well as the potential interaction with other nutrients (e.g., P, Ca, Mo and Cl). The influence of environmental conditions during plant growth (light intensity, spectral quality, photoperiod, air and root-zone temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration), harvest stage and diurnal timing of harvest is assessed. Postharvest storage conditions (temperature, light, and duration) are discussed in respect to their effects on the putative endogenous conversion of nitrate residues to nitrites. Several approaches that may be adopted to reduce nitrate content in vegetables, fruits and herbs are analysed and warranted future research subjects are identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuds 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acultivars 3afruit products 3afruits 3afungi 3agreen leafy vegetables 3aherbs 3ahorticultural crops 3ainflorescences 3aleaf development 3alight intensity 3amolybdenum 3amorphs 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anutrients 3aphotoperiod 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3aroot zone temperature 3aroots 3aseeds 3astems 3astorage conditions 3atubers 3aturgor 0aNitrates 0aGenotypes 0aFertilization 0aSalinity 0aLight 0aHorticultural crops 0aMushrooms1 aKim, Hye-Ji1 aKyriacou, Marios C.1 aRouphael, Youssef0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 July 14, v. 237 p.221-238dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015300166300001600319500001900335520114600354592002801500650002201528650003501550650001401585650001401599650001601613650001201629650001401641650002001655650002201675650002601697650001301723700002301736700002101759700001801780700001801798773011701816856008101933852000902014655001202023IND60734664720221117094027.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466472DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527210200802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKravets, E.

It was found that the main cytomictic events are associated with the early prophase of meiosis and are obligatory (constitutive) for the examined species. In metaphase microsporocytes, the so-called extra chromosomes, presumably of cytomictic origin, were identified. They are characterized by weakening of synapsis and/or disintegration of homologues and associations with bivalents of the basic karyotype with the formation of secondary associations of chromosomes. Extra chromosomes are present not only in hyperchromosomal but also in eu- and hypochromosomal microsporocytes. The majority of extra chromosomes seem to be a “genetic ballast” for the cell, which it gets rid of using a wide range of cellular tools, in particular, chromosomal rearrangements, chromatin diminution, asymmetry of division, cytomixis, and programmed cell death. Nevertheless, some extra chromosomes can participate in the rearrangement of the karyotype of microsporocytes and microspores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium fistulosum 3aLilium bulbiferum var. croceum 3aasymmetry 3achromatin 3akaryotyping 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3amicrosporocytes 3amicrosporogenesis 3aprogrammed cell death 3aprophase1 aPlohovskaya, S.

The AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol-type dataset was used for the target variables. Satellite input variables with many missing data or low mean-decrease accuracy were excluded from the final input variable set, and good performance in aerosol-type classification was achieved. The performance of the RF-based model was evaluated on the basis of the wavelength dependence of single-scattering albedo (SSA) and fine-mode-fraction values from AERONET. Typical SSA wavelength dependence for individual aerosol types was consistent with that obtained for aerosol types by the RF-based model. The spatial coverage of the RF-based model was also compared with that of previously developed models in a global-scale case study. The study demonstrates that the RF-based model allows satellite aerosol classification with improved spatial coverage, with a performance similar to that of previously developed models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3adata collection 3agovernmental programs and projects 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3asatellites 3awavelengths1 aLee, Hanlim 1 aKim, Daewon 1 aKim, Serin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 26, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130712683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245010200209300001600311520171000327592002802037650001402065650001302079650001102092650001802103650001102121650001202132651001702144653002502161653001502186653001802201653001902219700002502238773012202263856008302385852000902468655001202477IND60751866820221122124941.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075186682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeet, Jan-Hendrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2610-941012aA rapid survey of naturalized and invasive eucalypt species in southwestern Limpopo, South Africa  ap. 339-346.  aNumerous eucalypts (species in the genera Eucalyptus, Angophora and Corymbia) have been introduced to South Africa over the past two centuries. Several species have become naturalized or invasive and are the focus of control programmes. Because many eucalypts are difficult to identify in the field, the distribution patterns of many species in the country are poorly documented. A recent assessment of the distribution of E. camaldulensis highlighted two invasion hotspots in South Africa: the Western Cape, and the Modimolle region in southwestern Limpopo. Records for all eucalypts (many of which list only “Eucalyptus sp.”) show similar hotspots. We conducted a rapid assessment to determine the species identity, extent of plantings, and invasive tendencies of eucalypt species at 113 localities in southwestern Limpopo. We recorded five species at the various localities, two of which have not been recorded in this area previously: E. blakelyi Maiden and E. distans Brooker, Boland & Kleinig. Two other species (E. camaldulensis and E. grandis) were observed invading river courses at numerous localities and are of concern. The South African Plant Invaders Atlas (SAPIA) and iNaturalist have only 73 records of eucalypts known from this area, in contrast to the 113 we recorded in this study. Besides providing new records of species, the survey highlighted the paucity of information on the identity and introduction status of eucalypts in South Africa. A systematic study to provide an inventory of eucalypts and their introduction status for the entire country is needed to serve as the foundation for strategies to manage species to capitalize on their benefits and minimize their impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngophora 3aCorymbia 3abotany 3arapid methods 3arivers 3asurveys 3aSouth Africa 0aBiological invasions 0aEucalyptus 0aRapid surveys 0aTree invasions1 aRichardson, David M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Jan., v. 144 p.339-346dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2021.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012200154300001800276520142800294592002801722650002601750650002101776650001401797650001901811650002501830650002301855650003901878650001901917650001601936650001301952650001901965650002401984650001902008650001702027650002102044700001502065700001302080700001402093700001202107700001802119773014202137856007402279852000902353655001202362IND60642437120221122235358.0190507e20160720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064243712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb01040g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Chao10aWell-defined labile diselenide-centered poly(ε-caprolactone)-based micelles for activated intracellular drug release  ap. 5059-5067.  aWell-defined diselenide-centered biodegradable tri-block copolymers methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG–PCL–Se)₂ were precisely synthesized by the combination of ring opening polymerization using di(1-hydroxyethylene) diselenide as a new initiator and a facile coupling reaction. The amphiphilic block copolymers enabled the formation of self-assembled micelles which revealed an excellent reductive response to glutathione (GSH) due to the unique reduction-responsive cleavage of the diselenide bond. Such GSH response ensured an enhanced release of anticancer drugs (DOX) from the micelles in simulative tumor microenvironments; moreover, the drug release could be changed to some extent through fine-tuning the chemical composition of the copolymers. Flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) measurements confirmed that the DOX-loaded micelles could be efficiently taken up by oral squamous carcinoma (HN30) cells and DOX was released into the nuclei of cancer cells following 4 h of incubation. The cell viability assays showed the diselenide-containing polymers were nontoxic up to a tested concentration (400 μg mL⁻¹), while the DOX-loaded micelles exhibited an evident inhibition toward HN30 cells. Therefore, the reduction-labile biodegradable (mPEG–PCL–Se)₂ may offer an alternative platform for tumor-targeting therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiodegradability 3acarcinoma 3acell viability 3achemical composition 3acomposite polymers 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aflow cytometry 3aglutathione 3amicelles 3aneoplasm cells 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3atherapeutics 3aviability assays1 aZhang, Yan1 aXu, Heng1 aXu, Ying,1 aXu, Yue1 aLang, Meidong0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2016 July 20, v. 4, no. 29 p.5059-5067dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6tb01040g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245020200161500001400363520175600377592002802133650001102161650001502172650001302187650002002200650002302220650001502243650001802258650001102276650001502287650001602302650002102318650001502339650002502354650001202379651001302391700002302404700002402427700002502451700001902476700002002495700002702515773012802542856007402670852000902744655001202753IND60733640320221120072058.0210410e20210326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073364032DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130712712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelis, Jorge  A.10aFrom Standard Weather Stations to Virtual Micro-Meteorological Towers in Ungauged Sites: Modeling Tool for Surface Energy Fluxes, Evapotranspiration, Soil Temperature, and Soil Moisture Estimations  aNAL-light  aOne of the benefits of training a process-based, land surface model is the capacity to use it in ungauged sites as a complement to standard weather stations for predicting energy fluxes, evapotranspiration, and surface and root-zone soil temperature and moisture. In this study, dynamic (i.e., time-evolving) vegetation parameters were derived from remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and coupled with a physics-based land surface model (tin-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS)) at four eddy covariance (EC) sites in south-central U.S. to test the predictability of micro-meteorological, soil-related, and energy flux-related variables. One cropland and one grassland EC site in northern Oklahoma, USA, were used to tune the model with respect to energy fluxes, soil temperature, and moisture. Calibrated model parameters, mostly related to the soil, were then transferred to two other EC sites in Oklahoma with similar soil and vegetation types. New dynamic vegetation parameter time series were updated according to MODIS imagery at each site. Overall, the tRIBS model captured both seasonal and diurnal cycles of the energy partitioning and soil temperatures across all four stations, as indicated by the model assessment metrics, although large uncertainties appeared in the prediction of ground heat flux, surface, and root-zone soil moisture at some stations. The transferability of previously calibrated model parameters and the use of MODIS to derive dynamic vegetation parameters enabled rapid yet reasonable predictions. The model was proven to be a convenient complement to standard weather stations particularly for sites where eddy covariance or similar equipment is not available.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acomplement 3acropland 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3agrasslands 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aprediction 3arhizosphere 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3atime series analysis 3aweather 3aOklahoma1 aMoreno, Hernan  A.1 aBasara, Jeffrey  B.1 aMcPherson, Renee  A.1 aCosh, Michael 1 aOchsner, Tyson 1 aXiao, X.q(Xiangming),0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Mar. 26, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130712713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245011000207300001800317506007600335520123500411592002801646506003701674650001601711650001501727650001901742650001101761650002301772650002001795650001701815650002301832700002001855700005801875773013501933856008002068852000902148655001202157IND60685027720221207142209.0200227e20200206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068502772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c004452doi7 aPMC70500112pmcid7 a320266762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckers, Daniel10aImpact of Nanoscale Hindrances on the Relationship between Lipid Packing and Diffusion in Model Membranes  ap. 1487-1494.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembrane models have allowed for precise study of the plasma membrane’s biophysical properties, helping to unravel both structural and dynamic motifs within cell biology. Freestanding and supported bilayer systems are popular models to reconstitute membrane-related processes. Although it is well-known that each have their advantages and limitations, comprehensive comparison of their biophysical properties is still lacking. Here, we compare the diffusion and lipid packing in giant unilamellar vesicles, planar and spherical supported membranes, and cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles. We apply florescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), spectral imaging, and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion FCS to study the diffusivity, lipid packing, and nanoscale architecture of these membrane systems, respectively. Our data show that lipid packing and diffusivity is tightly correlated in freestanding bilayers. However, nanoscale interactions in the supported bilayers cause deviation from this correlation. These data are essential to develop accurate theoretical models of the plasma membrane and will serve as a guideline for suitable model selection in future studies to reconstitute biological processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiffusivity 3aguidelines 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3aphysical chemistry 3aplasma membrane 3aspectroscopy 3atheoretical models1 aUrbancic, Dunja1 aSezgin, Erdinc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4915-388X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Feb. 06, v. 124, no. 8 p.1487-1494dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c004453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245005900158300001800217520097200235592002801207650002301235650002201258650001301280650001301293650002201306650001301328700002301341773011801364856007501482852000901557655001201566IND60550103820221117211328.0160909e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055010382DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302448h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMocilac, Pavle10aTrezimides and Tennimides: New Imide-Based Macrocycles  ap. 2355-2361.  aThe reaction of isophthaloyl dichloride with 2-aminopyridine or 2-aminopyrimidine provides a facile entry into a new class of imide-based “3 + 3” macrocyclic trimer (trezimide), together with the known tetramer scaffold (tennimide). The trezimides can adopt two distinct asymmetric conformations in the solid state, isolated as (P) in (IO)₃ (from 2-aminopyridine) and (R) in (26IO)₃ (from 2-aminopyrimidine). The tennimide crystal structure (26IO)₄ (from 2-aminopyrimidine) exhibits three discrete conformational states, highlighting subtle geometric changes with the tennimide channel (pore) open (o) and/or closed (c), as noted by three macrocycle conformations with their channel pores observed as cc/oc/oo. Macrocycle formation (though in competition with oligomer/polymer formation) relies on the o-pyr(im)idine N functionality and preorganized imide hinge (the “CO···CO” twist) together with the inherent flexibility of the isophthaloyl groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acrystal structure 3ageometry 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3apolymers1 aGallagher, John F.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 78, no. 6 p.2355-2361dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo302448h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011100165520137200276592002801648650001701676650001101693650001401704650001201718650001101730650002101741650001701762653001701779653002101796653003001817653001601847653001801863700001901881700001301900700001401913700002001927773009001947856005102037852000902088655001202097IND60790526820221122051618.0220824e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079052682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1250882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jianxi10aHybrid modelling and simulation of thermal systems of in-service power plants for digital twin development  aDigital twin is a core technology for smart power plants aiming to increase the safety and efficiency of power generation in low-carbon transitions. High-precision modelling of in-service power plant thermal systems plays a key role to develop digital twins, but remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-precision modelling for in-service power plant thermal systems over the full working ranges. This work proposes a hybrid modelling framework combining physical mechanism and operation data to develop grey-box models of thermal systems. Key equipment characteristics are figured out through historical operation data. Moreover, system models consisting of mass and energy balances, process mechanism equations and characteristic equations are implemented. An in-service 660 MW ultra-supercritical double reheat power plant, one of the most advanced thermal power generation technologies, is selected as a case study. The grey-box model of high- and intermediate-pressure thermal system is established. An average simulation error of the model of 0.79% over the full working ranges is achieved. Furthermore, key system characteristics are quantified through the model. It demonstrates the high precision of the proposed modelling method over the full working ranges and provides necessary model support for the digital twin development of thermal power plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aequipment 3ahybrids 3amodels 3apower generation 3apower plants 0aDigital twin 0aHybrid modelling 0aThermal system simulation 0aPower plant 0aDouble reheat1 aPetersen, Nils1 aLiu, Pei1 aLi, Zheng1 aWirsum, Manfred0 tEnergy.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 260 p.125088-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.125088  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008400169300001600253520204900269592002802318650001102346650006002357650001702417650001102434650002302445650001002468650001402478650001002492650001502502650002102517650001202538650001702550650001202567650002002579650002202599650001602621650001102637651001102648700004002659700003502699773016802734856008402902852000902986655001202995IND60488303020221120122016.0160226e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048830302DNAL7 a10.1894/0038-4909-60.4.2992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharruau, Pierre10aReptiles of Banco Chinchorro: Updated List, Life History Data, and Conservation  ap. 299-312.  aOne of the most useful strategies for biological conservation is the creation of protected natural areas. In addition, periodic updates of management plans are necessary to modify or improve the information and make it accessible to future research. Banco Chinchorro Biosphere Reserve is a protected atoll situated 31 km eastward from the southern coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico. A management plan published in 2000 contains a list of reptiles inhabiting the four islands of the atoll, but concerns about errors contained on the list necessitated updates and corrections. Herein, we clarify and update this list and present new life-history data for some species. We used four approaches to improve the list: interviews with staff, fishermen, and professional visitors; literature review; scientific collections; and field work conducted from 2011 to 2013. Thirteen species (1 crocodilian, 4 marine turtles, 2 iguanas, 2 geckos, 2 anoles, 1 whiptail lizard, and 1 snake) were observed in comparison to 14 species previously recorded in the management plan. Of the 13 species currently noted, 9 (69%) species appear in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (7 with a threatened status), 7 (54%) are in Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Appendices, and 9 (69%) are protected by Mexican law. One invasive species (Anolis sagrei) seems to have adapted and found its niche; whereas another (Hemidactylus frenatus) represents a threat for another species (Aristelliger georgensis), and efforts to eradicate it are strongly recommended. Banco Chinchorro is the only site in Mexico where Anolis allisoni is present. It also hosts the most distant and isolated population of the parthenogenetic lizard Aspidoscelis maslini from the mainland. After this study, we promoted the inclusion of both species in the Mexican protected species list based on ecological and distribution information. Finally, we discuss considering the reptiles of the reserve as Evolutionarily Significant Units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnolis 3aConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species 3aHemidactylus 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3afauna 3afishermen 3aflora 3ainterviews 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3alife history 3alizards 3aparthenogenesis 3aprotected species 3asea turtles 3asnakes 3aMexico1 aDíaz de la Vega Pérez, Aníbal H.1 aMéndez de la Cruz, Fausto R.,0 tSouthwestern naturalist.g2015 Dec., v. 60, no. 4 p.299-312dThe Southwestern Association of Naturalists Southern Illinois University Edwardsvillex1943-62627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1894%2F0038-4909-60.4.2993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245008300208300001800291506007600309520117900385592002801564506003701592650001701629650001201646650002701658650001901685650001101704650004401715650001301759650001401772650001501786650001701801653002601818653002101844653002801865653002301893653002501916700001201941700003101953700002301984700001902007700001602026700002102042700002802063700001302091700001902104700001502123700002002138700002302158773019102181856007902372852000902451655001202460IND60331741720221207075804.0150727e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033174172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15049711122doi7 aPMC45002452pmcid7 a260562892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallis, Robert J.10aPre-TCR ligand binding impacts thymocyte development before αβTCR expression  ap. 8373-8378.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdaptive cellular immunity requires accurate self- vs. nonself-discrimination to protect against infections and tumorous transformations while at the same time excluding autoimmunity. This vital capability is programmed in the thymus through selection of αβT-cell receptors (αβTCRs) recognizing peptides bound to MHC molecules (pMHC). Here, we show that the pre-TCR (preTCR), a pTα-β heterodimer appearing before αβTCR expression, directs a previously unappreciated initial phase of repertoire selection. Contrasting with the ligand-independent model of preTCR function, we reveal through NMR and bioforce-probe analyses that the β-subunit binds pMHC using Vβ complementarity-determining regions as well as an exposed hydrophobic Vβ patch characteristic of the preTCR. Force-regulated single bonds akin to those of αβTCRs but with more promiscuous ligand specificity trigger calcium flux. Thus, thymic development involves sequential β- and then, αβ-repertoire tuning, whereby preTCR interactions with self pMHC modulate early thymocyte expansion, with implications for β-selection, immunodominant peptide recognition, and germ line-encoded MHC interaction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautoimmunity 3acalcium 3acell-mediated immunity 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3areceptors 3athymocytes 3athymus gland 0apre–T-cell receptor 0aNMR spectroscopy 0abiomembrane force probe 0athymic development 0arepertoire selection1 aBai, Ke1 aArthanari, H.q(Haribabu),1 aHussey, Rebecca E.1 aHandley, Maris1 aLi, Zhenhai1 aChingozha, Loice1 aDuke-Cohan, Jonathan S.1 aLu, Hang1 aWang, Jia-Huai1 aZhu, Cheng1 aWagner, Gerhard1 aReinherz, Ellis L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 July 7, v. 112, no. 27 p.8373-8378dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15049711123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014400169300001600313520118200329592002801511650001801539650001201557650002001569650002501589650003601614650001901650650002101669650001501690650002001705650001101725650001701736650001101753650001401764650001501778650001101793650001301804650001901817650002901836650001901865650001101884650001001895653000701905653000701912653000601919653000801925653000701933653000701940653000901947653000701956653000701963653000701970653000901977653000901986653000801995653001502003653001802018653001102036653001902047653002502066700002202091700002102113700002702134700001802161700002502179700002802204700001802232700002002250773010902270856008602379852000902465655001202474IND60605364120221122032803.0190401e20180714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito, Cátia10aKaolin and salicylic acid foliar application modulate yield, quality and phytochemical composition of olive pulp and oil from rainfed trees  ap. 176-183.  aOlive orchards, rainfed managed, are threatened by the current and predicted adverse environmental conditions, which change the yield and quality of olive products, largely known for its benefits to human health. To mitigate these problems, it is highly recommended to perform some adjustments in agronomic practices, such as the use of foliar sprays that cloud help the trees to cope with climate change. During two consecutive years, olive trees were pre-harvest sprayed with kaolin (KL) and salicylic acid (SA) to attenuate the adverse effects of summer stress. Olive yield was increased by 97% and 72% with KL and SA, respectively. Phenolics and antioxidant capacity of both olives and olive oil increased and decreased in the first and second year, respectively, in a closely association with the prevailing climatic conditions. The foliar sprays did not significantly affect the oil quality indices, free acidity, peroxide value and K232 coefficient and decreased the K270 coefficient. This study strongly suggests that the applied products might be effective in mitigating the adverse environmental conditions, without substantial changes in fruit and olive oil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aacidity 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical constituents of plants 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop yield 3afoliar spraying 3afruits 3ahuman health 3akaolin 3aolive oil 3aolive pulp 3aolives 3aorchards 3aperoxide value 3aplant cultural practices 3asalicylic acid 3asummer 3atrees 0aSA 0aKL 0aC 0aCsb 0aMI 0aTP 0ao-DP 0aFl 0aFA 0aPV 0aK232 0aK270 0aΔK 0aOlive tree 0aSummer stress 0aFrosts 0aPhytochemicals 0aAntioxidant capacity1 aDinis, Lia-Tânia1 aSilva, Ermelinda1 aGonçalves, Alexandre,1 aMatos, Carlos1 aRodrigues, Manuel A.1 aMoutinho-Pereira, José1 aBarros, Anna,1 aCorreia, Carlos0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 July 14, v. 237 p.176-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001700150245014100167300001600308520156200324592002801886650001101914650001601925650002201941650001301963650000901976650001301985650002501998650002302023650001102046650001402057650002502071650002702096650001302123650001402136650001502150650002402165650001702189700001402206700001702220700001602237773008902253856008602342852000902428655001202437IND4445101020221120041018.0141111e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444510102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.09.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, R.J.10aEffect of storage time and temperature of milk protein concentrate (MPC85) on the renneting properties of skim milk fortified with MPC85  ap. 944-952.  aThis study investigated the effect of storage temperature (20–50°C) and time (0–60days) on the renneting properties of milk protein concentrate with 85% protein (MPC85). Reconstituted skim milk was fortified with the MPC85 (2.5% w/w) and the renneting properties of the skim milk/MPC85 systems were investigated using rheology. It was found that the final complex modulus (final G∗) and the yield stress of the rennet-induced skim milk/MPC85 gels decreased exponentially with storage time of the MPC85 for storage temperatures greater than 20°C, with a greater effect at the higher storage temperatures. Changes in the solubility of MPC85 with storage time were correlated with the rheological properties. The primary phase of renneting (cleavage of κ-casein) was not affected by the storage of the MPC85; hence the effect was related to the secondary stage of renneting (aggregation/coagulation of rennet-treated casein micelles). Using a temperature–time superposition method, a master curve was formed from the final G∗, yield stress and solubility results. This suggested that the same physical processes affected the solubility and rennet gelation properties of the milks. It is proposed that the MPC85 protein in rennet-treated skim milk/MPC85 solutions may transform from an interacting material, when solubility is high, to an inert or weakly interacting material, when solubility is low, and that this results in the reduced final G∗ and yield stress of the rennet gels when MPC85 is stored at elevated temperatures for long periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acasein 3acoagulation 3aconcentrated milk 3agelation 3agels 3amicelles 3aprotein concentrates 3areconstituted milk 3arennet 3arenneting 3arenneting properties 3arheological properties 3arheology 3askim milk 3asolubility 3astorage temperature 3astorage time1 aHemar, Y.1 aPinder, D.N.1 aAnema, S.G.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 125, no. 3 p.944-952dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.09.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245019500166520117900361592002801540650002201568650002001590650002101610650002201631650002601653650002401679650001101703650001701714650001001731650001201741650002801753650002101781650001501802650001301817653003601830653002401866653001901890700001801909700005801927700005901985773012202044856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60745965820221116163136.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074596582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1122292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Jun Xian10aUse of Centella asiatica extract in reducing microbial contamination and browning effect in fresh cut fruits and vegetables during storage: A potential alternative of synthetic preservatives  aThe study was focused on the effectiveness of Centella asiatica extract in microbial reduction and retarding browning formation of the samples obtained from fresh-cut fruits and vegetables (FCFV) during room temperature displayed (RTD) and chilled storage (CS). The microbial and color analyses were done in hour-basis (room temperature displayed) and daily basis (chilled storage). Candida albicans (6.77 log CFU/mL), Bacillus cereus (6.34 log CFU/mL), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (6.46 log CFU/mL) and Aspergillus niger (5.34 log CFU/mL) were specifically inoculated in apple, potato, lettuce, and pineapple, respectively. In room temperature displayed samples, the population of survival microorganisms ranged from 4.44 to 6.90 log CFU/g. In chilled stored samples, only A. niger was survived in chilled pineapple (3.00 log CFU/g) when storage end. Browning indexes in room temperature displayed and chilled stored samples ranged from 8.06 to 9.26 and 5.00 to 12.68, respectively. In short, low temperature and sufficient extract-treated periods may effectively inhibit microbial growth and browning index to prevent quality deterioration of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus cereus 3aCandida albicans 3aCentella asiatica 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aambient temperature 3aapples 3acold storage 3acolor 3alettuce 3amicrobial contamination 3amicrobial growth 3apineapples 3apotatoes 0aFresh-cut fruits and vegetables 0aMicrobial reduction 0aBrowning index1 aRamli, Suzita1 aDesa, Shakinaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0897-04501 aChen, Sook Ngoh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8625-02830 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Nov., v. 151 p.112229-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1122293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010300164300001600267520130200283592002801585650001901613650000801632650003401640650001601674650001401690650001901704650001001723650002401733650002201757650003301779650001801812650002101830650002001851650001301871650002601884653000801910653002501918653001001943653000901953653002801962653001101990700001902001700001602020700001802036700001502054700002002069773010902089856008602198852000902284655001202293IND60605364220221122032648.0190401e20180714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tong13aAn R2R3-MYB transcription factor, SlMYB28, involved in the regulation of TYLCV infection in tomato  ap. 192-200.  aTomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), which is one of the most critical plant diseases, is transmitted by Bemisia tabaci. TYLCV is a devastating disease of tomato, seriously affecting the growth of infected tomato plants. MYB transcription factors play central roles in plant development and pathogen defense response, but their functions in tomato defense response to TYLCV infection remain incompletely understood. In this study, a tomato MYB gene, SlMYB28 was identified. The open reading frame of SlMYB28 gene spans 702 bp, encoding 233 amino acids. SlMYB28 is an R2R3-MYB transcription factor. Nuclear localization assays revealed that SlMYB28 protein localizes to the nucleus. In the promoter region of SlMYB28 gene, a few cis-elements related to plant development or environmental stress responses were observed. SlMYB28 expression was strongly induced by TYLCV infection in TYLCV-susceptible cultivar ‘Jinpeng-1’and TYLCV-resistant cultivar ‘Zheza-301’. We further investigated the function of SlMYB28 in response to TYLCV by using virus-induced gene silencing. DNA content of TYLCV in SlMYB28-silenced tomato plant was lower than that of the negative control line. These results imply the involvement of SlMYB28 as a negative regulator in regulation of TYLCV infection in tomato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aDNA 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aamino acids 3acultivars 3agene silencing 3agenes 3aopen reading frames 3aplant development 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3apromoter regions 3astress response 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 0aMYB 0aTranscription factor 0aTYLCV 0aVIGS 0aDefense stress response 0aTomato1 aZhang, Xin-Yue1 aHuang, Ying1 aXu, Zhi-Sheng1 aWang, Feng1 aXiong, Ai-Sheng0 tScientia horticulturae.g2018 July 14, v. 237 p.192-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014300170300001800313520169700331592002802028596009802056596009102154596013202245650002202377650003702399650001502436650001902451650001802470650002802488650002102516650004902537650001102586650003702597650001902634650001902653650001902672650001302691650001702704700001702721700001902738700001302757700001802770700005302788700001702841700001602858700001702874700001302891773012002904856008803024852000903112655001203121IND60784355520221122070033.0220726e20220707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c017272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yunfei10a3D/0D Cu₃SnS₄/CeO₂ Heterojunction Photocatalyst with Dual Redox Pairs Synergistically Promotes the Photocatalytic Reduction of CO₂  ap. 7763-7774.  aAs an inexpensive bimetallic sulfide with a narrow band gap, Cu₃SnS₄ has been widely used in solar-energy-driven catalytic reactions. However, the traditional tetragonal Cu₃SnS₄ has the inherent defect of fewer surface active sites and poor photogenerated carrier transport performance, which requires further modification to improve the CO₂ photocatalytic reduction performance of tetragonal Cu₃SnS₄. In this work, the Cu₃SnS₄/CeO₂ binary composites with dual redox pairs of Ce⁴⁺/Ce³⁺ and Cu²⁺/Cu⁺ were successfully designed and prepared via a simple solvothermal method as a bridge for the synthesis of composite materials. A series of characterizations, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), photocurrent (PC), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), etc., have confirmed that dual redox pairs and heterojunction synergistically improve the photochemical properties of hybrid Cu₃SnS₄/CeO₂. Because of the unique three-dimensional/zero-dimensional (3D/0D) hierarchical structure of Cu₃SnS₄/CeO₂, the splendid light absorption characteristic of Cu₃SnS₄ was retained, and the specific surface area of CC1 composite was improved. In addition, the water static contact angle experiments showed that the hydrophilicity of composites is inhibited. As a consequence, the fabricated CC1 composite with dual redox pairs acquires CO evolution that is 2.63 times greater than that observed for pristine Cu₃SnS₄. The innovative study will provide a feasible orientation for the field of solar energy-driven CO₂ reduction reaction.  aPublisher supplied data  a52076126cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22010501500cProjects of Shanghai Science and Technology Committeedhttps://doi.org/NA  aNAcKey Laboratory of Clean Power Generation and Environmental Protection Technology in Mechanical Industrydhttps://doi.org/NA 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acontact angle 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric current 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrophilicity 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asulfides 3asurface area1 aZhao, Xuying1 aWei, Quanzhong1 aHe, Ping1 aCheng, Zhihai1 aWu, Jiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7039-89721 aQi, Yongfeng1 aSun, Yijing1 aSong, Jingyu1 aYang, Wu0 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 07, v. 36, no. 14 p.7763-7774dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c017273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011300160300001800273500001900291520178200310592002802092650002002120650002402140650002502164650002602189650001502215650001102230650002102241650001502262650002102277650002002298650001302318650001502331650001802346700002102364700002002385700002202405700001802427700002002445700001702465700001702482700002302499700001702522700001802539773013102557856007402688852000902762655001202771IND60704327820221117165450.0200723e20200722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070432782DNAL7 a10.1039/d0em00147c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCousins, Ian T.10aStrategies for grouping per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to protect human and environmental health  ap. 1444-1460.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGrouping strategies are needed for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in part, because it would be time and resource intensive to test and evaluate the more than 4700 PFAS on the global market on a chemical-by-chemical basis. In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called “P-sufficient” approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g. determining use in products vs. setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions. This assessment provides the necessary context for grouping strategies such that they can be adopted as they are, or built on further, to protect human and environmental health from potential PFAS-related effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3acumulative exposure 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental science 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3amotivation 3apharmacokinetics 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aworld markets1 aDeWitt, Jamie C.1 aGlüge, Juliane1 aGoldenman, Gretta1 aHerzke, Dorte1 aLohmann, Rainer1 aMiller, Mark1 aNg, Carla A.1 aScheringer, Martin1 aVierke, Lena1 aWang, Zhanyun0 tEnvironmental science.g2020 July 22, v. 22, no. 7 p.1444-1460dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0em00147c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011000163300001600273520130400289592002801593650001901621650001201640650002301652650001901675650001701694650002601711650000901737650002601746650001901772650002401791650001301815653003101828653002401859653002601883653002601909700001301935700001501948700001701963700001401980700001301994773012202007856008302129852000902212655001202221IND60766251820221120182656.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076625182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Peng10aDNA-Templated ultrasmall bismuth sulfide nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging of myocardial infarction  ap. 475-484.  aPhotoacoustic imaging (PAI) has shown great clinical potential in diagnosing various diseases due to its noninvasive, cost-effective, and real-time imaging properties but is limited by the lack of contrast agents with high sensitivity for deep tissue imaging. Here, DNA-templated ultrasmall bismuth sulfide (Bi₂S₃) nanoparticles (NPs) were reported as a photoacoustic (PA) probe for imaging myocardial infarction. We present a simple synthesis strategy of ultrasmall NPs via self-assembly of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)/metal ion complexes. The in vivo imaging results showed a dramatically enhanced PA signal in the region of myocardial infarction after intravenous injection of DNA-Bi₂S₃ NPs in the myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) mouse model. Further near infrared fluorescence imaging indicated that Bi₂S₃ NPs mainly accumulated in the infarcted area, leading to enhancement of PA signals. Moreover, such hybrid NPs possess a well-defined nanostructure, superior photobleaching resistance, excellent water dispersibility and negligible acute toxicity. These results not only demonstrate that ultrasmall DNA-Bi₂S₃ NPs are a potent PA probe for imaging the infarcted region but also provide a new avenue for preparing ultrasmall-sized PA probes by using ssDNA as a template.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3abismuth 3acost effectiveness 3adispersibility 3afluorescence 3aintravenous injection 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3aphotobleaching 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asulfides 0aUltrasmall bismuth sulfide 0aSingle-stranded DNA 0aPhotoacoustic imaging 0aMyocardial infarction1 aLi, Bing1 aLi, Yingxu1 aChen, Leshan1 aWang, Hao1 aYe, Ling0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.475-484dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245014100166300001800307520048000325592002800805596009800833596009800931596011301029596010201142650001901244650001401263650003001277650001101307650001801318650001101336650001101347700005501358700005801413773012001471856008801591852000901679655001201688IND60784355620221122125110.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c018202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhe10aComputational Design of a CoCu-Modified Indium Oxide Catalyst Promoting CO₂ Activation and Hydrogenation through Electronic Regulation  ap. 7915-7920.  aDensity functional theory calculations identified a CoCu₃-cluster-modified In₂O₃ catalyst promoting CO₂ activation and hydrogenation through electronic regulation.

Elucidating the shape of growth curves may reveal novel genetic controls that single‐time‐point (STP) analyses do not because, in theory, infinite numbers of growth curves can result in the same final measurement. We measured leaf lengths and widths in Brassica rapa recombinant inbred lines (RILs) throughout ontogeny. We modeled leaf growth and allometry as function valued traits (FVT), and examined genetic correlations between these traits and aspects of phenology, physiology, circadian rhythms and fitness. We used RNA‐seq to construct a SNP linkage map and mapped trait quantitative trait loci (QTL). We found genetic trade‐offs between leaf size and growth rate FVT and uncovered differences in genotypic and QTL correlations involving FVT vs STPs. We identified leaf shape (allometry) as a genetic module independent of length and width and identified selection on FVT parameters of development. Leaf shape is associated with venation features that affect desiccation resistance. The genetic independence of leaf shape from other leaf traits may therefore enable crop optimization in leaf shape without negative effects on traits such as size, growth rate, duration or gas exchange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa 3aadverse effects 3aallometry 3achromosome mapping 3acircadian rhythm 3acorrelation 3agas exchange 3agenetic correlation 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3amodels 3aontogeny 3aphenology 3aprediction 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aLeong, Wen Fung1 aBrock, Marcus T.1 aMarkelz, R.

In the present study, direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) is employed to elucidate the precise localization of nanoparticles within cells owing to its superiority of nanometric resolution, multicolour ability and minimal invasiveness. The localization of the Cy5 labelled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs-Cy5) in MCF-7 cells are monitored by dSTORM and conventional fluorescence microscopy, respectively. The dSTORM images demonstrate much higher spatial resolution for locating MSNs-Cy5 within cells compared to that of the conventional fluorescence images. Moreover, the distribution of MSNs-Cy5 within three cell lines over time are obtained. For the MCF-7 and HeLa cells, MSNs-Cy5 nanoparticles distribute nearly all around the cytoplasm after 5 h incubation. In contrast, MSNs-Cy5 nanoparticles within NIH 3T3 cells are quite different that they are found to be either attached to or embedded into cell membranes, without penetrating into the cytoplasm. Overall, we provide a practical method to reveal the in situ precise imaging of nanoparticles in cells with nanometric resolution precision. This method may open up new opportunities for organelle-specific targeting drug delivery to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3ananomedicine 3aporous media 3asilica 3atherapeutics 0aNanoparticles 0aSuper-resolution microscopy imaging 0adSTORM 0aCellular uptake 0aDistribution1 aJia, Yi1 aWang, Chenlei1 aXia, Jiarui1 aCao, Hongqian1 aDai, Luru1 aLi, Chunmei1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aLi, Junbai0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.248-255dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.01.1963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010700170300001800277520144000295592002801735596009801763596010201861650001601963650003101979650002102010650002202031650001602053650001102069700001702080700001402097700005402111700001502165700005202180773012002232856008802352852000902440655001202449IND60784355820221122130635.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c018822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuman10aOrdered Interface Engineering Enabled High-Performance Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene Fiber-Based Supercapacitors  ap. 7898-7907.  aThe advanced design of heterostructured fibers with ordered transport channels and porous frameworks for high-speed ions/electrons kinetics is principally fundamental for high-performance fiber-based supercapacitors (FSCs). However, typically low energy-storage performances restrict their substantive applications due to a fibrous restacking phenomenon and poor interfacial charge transfer. Here, we develop an ordered core–shell fiber, wherein the porous zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedron shell is uniformly loaded on a highly conductive Ti₃C₂Tₓ core via a versatile microfluidic method. Due to the improved porous generation, ordered porous pathways, large exposed surface, and in situ interfacial electron transfer, the ZIF-67@Ti₃C₂Tₓ fiber displays excellent volumetric capacitance (972 F cm–³) and long-term cycling stability (90.8% capacitive retention after 20 000 cycles) in 1 M KOH electrolytes. Meanwhile, the flexible solid-state ZIF-67@Ti₃C₂Tₓ FSCs maintain a good capacitance, large bending/wearable stabilities, and steady temperature-dependent capability. Based on those significant electrochemical performances, the supercapacitors can impressively power various electrical devices [e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs), displays, electric fans, pinwheels, and rolling bells], which will guide the practical progress of miniaturized energy technologies and smart electronics.  aPublisher supplied data  a21706120cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBK20211592cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aelectronics 3aenergy1 aZhu, Xiaolin1 aSun, Suya1 aGuo, Qirui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7153-03541 aXu, Meigui1 aWu, Guan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0025-812X0 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 12, v. 36, no. 14 p.7898-7907dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c018823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04079naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015300162300001800315520196400333592002802297650001802325650001502343650001702358650002302375650000902398650001702407650002602424650001602450650004102466650001902507650003002526650002202556650001602578650001702594650001702611650001502628650003102643650001102674650001602685653002202701653001902723653001902742653001102761653000802772653000802780653000902788653000802797653000802805653000702813653000802820653000802828653000702836653000802843653000802851653001202859653001102871653000902882653000702891653000802898653000702906653000802913653001002921653000702931653000902938653001402947700001402961700001502975700001302990700001503003700001203018700001403030773011303044856008303157852000903240655001203249IND60751867520221122221726.0220621e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075186752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yiwei10aEffects of gut microbiota and fatty acid metabolism on dyslipidemia following weight-loss diets in women: Results from a randomized controlled trial  ap. 5511-5520.  aIn our early feeding trial among overweight and obese Chinese women, both low-carbohydrate (LC) and calorie-restricted (CR) diets reduced weight and fat mass, but only the LC diet significantly improved dyslipidemia. We aimed to investigate the impacts of altered gut microbiota, fatty acid (FAs), and acylcarnitines, markers of mitochondrial function on blood lipids. Fecal and blood samples from 48 participants at baseline and the end of a 12-week trial were used to perform metagenomics and targeted-metabolomics including erythrocyte FAs and plasma acylcarnitines, respectively. The two diets altered microbial structure and co-abundance gene clusters (CAGs) at different magnitudes. After a 12-week intervention, the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio increased significantly in the LC diet (P = 0.015) but not in the CR diet, which only showed an increased trend (P = 0.28). At the microbial function level, the LC group showed lower branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and higher serine biosynthesis than the CR group. Moreover, the LC diet reduced levels of 14:0 and 16:1n-7 FAs in the de novo lipogenesis pathway, but increased 20:5n-3 compared with the CR diet. Both groups had increased plasma acylcarnitines except that the LC group had larger elevated short-chain acylcarnitines. After backward stepwise selection, a cluster of changed CAGs, FAs and acylcarnitines were found to be associated with improved lipid profile. However, changed CAGs showed higher contribution rates in elevating HDL-cholesterol (81.6%) and reducing triglycerides (89.3%) than changed FAs and acylcarnitines. The two weight-loss diets induced different changes of gut microbiota, plasma acylcarnitines, and erythrocyte FAs. Changes in gut microbiota rather than FA or acylcarnitine profiles showed greater contribution to improved lipid profile in these overweight and obese Chinese women. The trial was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01358890.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3abiosynthesis 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acid metabolism 3afatty acids 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid composition 3alipogenesis 3ametagenomics 3amitochondria 3aoverweight 3arandomized clinical trials 3aserine 3aweight loss 0aWeight-loss diets 0aGut microbiota 0aAcylcarnitines 0aLipids 0aALT 0aAST 0aBCAA 0aBMI 0aCAG 0aCR 0aDNL 0aEPA 0aFA 0aGGT 0aHDL 0aHOMA-IR 0aHOMA-B 0aKEGG 0aKO 0aLBP 0aLC 0aLDL 0aMAFLD 0aMO 0aNMDS 0aPERMANOVA1 aSun, Yidi1 aSun, Liang1 aLiu, Xin1 aZeng, Rong1 aLin, Xu1 aLi, Yixue0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.5511-5520dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009600169300001600265500001900281520104100300592002801341650001701369650001701386650001101403650001401414650001401428700002201442773011701464856008101581852000901662655001201671IND60734665620221117095120.0210421e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073466562DNAL7 a10.3103/S00954527210201222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolishchuk, L.

The nucleotide sequences of crt-clusters in 100 Streptomyces strains have been analyzed using the BLASTn programs. Some schemes in the organization of crt-clusters in streptomycetes were determined. A set of the main trends in the localization and organization of crt-clusters in Streptomyces has been specified. Similarities in the organization of crt-clusters in the genomes of microorganisms belonging to different strains of the same Streptomyces species have been shown. The study has confirmed the possibility of using the information about the organization of crt-clusters in Streptomyces (additionally to the traditionally employed genetic and phenotypic characteristics) in the classification of microorganisms within lower taxa (clades, species, and subspecies).  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3acell biology 3agenome 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny1 aLukyanchuk, V.

The diterpene structures were elucidated using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry data. Furthermore, a DFT/NMR procedure was used to suggest the relative configuration of several compounds. The labdane-derived skeletons, namely, ent-atisane, ent-beyerene, ent-trachylobane, and ent-kaurene, were identified. The extracts, fractions, and pure compounds were then tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola, and Lactobacillus plantarum. One diterpenoid, namely, psiadin, showed an additive effect with the antiseptic chlorhexidine, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index of less than 1. Additionally, psiadin showed a prospective inhibition activity for bacterial efflux pumps.  aPublisher supplied data  a22UQU4320529DSR02cUmm Al-Qura Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006701  aNAcUniversit? degli Studi di Salernodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007065 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aPsiadia 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aTreponema denticola 3aadditive effect 3aantimicrobial properties 3achlorhexidine 3aditerpenoids 3aflavonoids 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aSaudi Arabia1 aChini, Maria Giovanna1 aParisi, Valentina1 aMensitieri, Francesca1 aMalafronte, Nicola1 aBifulco, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1788-51701 aBisio, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7559-77321 aDe Tommasi, Nunziatina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1707-41561 aBader, Ammar0 tJournal of natural products.g2022 June 24, v. 85, no. 7 p.1667-1680dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c010933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015000168520184800318592002802166650001102194650001702205650001602222650001302238650001302251650002002264650001602284650002802300650001902328650001302347650001602360650003002376650001002406650001002416650001102426650002402437650002102461653002102482653000902503653002702512700002502539773009802564856008202662852000902744655001202753IND60745966420221116163438.0210904e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074596642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1198562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalama, Samir A.10aGalangin mitigates iron overload-triggered liver injury: Up-regulation of PPARγ and Nrf2 signaling, and abrogation of the inflammatory responses  aHepatotoxicity is a critical consequence of the iron overload conditions such as hemochromatosis and blood transfusion-requiring anemia. Iron induces hepatotoxicity largely through disruption of cellular redox homeostasis and induction of inflammatory responses. The present work explored the hepatoprotective activity of the bio-active flavone galangin against iron-evoked hepatotoxicity.Iron overload model was established in male Wistar rats via intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg iron-dextran subdivided over a ten-day experimental period. Galangin was administered in a daily oral dose of 15 mg/kg throughout the experimental period. Blood and liver tissue samples were collected on day eleven and subjected to biochemical and molecular investigations.Galangin significantly reduced liver iron content and serum ferritin level, and alleviated the iron-evoked oxidative stress. It enhanced the liver cell integrity as reflected by decreased serum activity of the liver enzymes. Mechanistically, galangin up-regulated the redox-regulating transcription factor Nrf2 and its responsive proteins HO-1 and NQO1. Interestingly, galangin up-regulated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protein PPARγ and serum hepcidin levels under the iron overload conditions. Equally important, it diminished the nuclear shift of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB p65 and down-regulated the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β.The results of the present study highlight the mitigating activity of galangin against iron-induced hepatotoxicity. The study accentuated targeting of Nrf2, PPARγ, and NF-κB signaling as potential contributing mechanisms. While clinical studies are still required, the current study supports the possible implementation of galangin in controlling iron overload-associated hepatotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3aferritin 3aflavones 3ahemochromatosis 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahepcidin 3ahomeostasis 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aliver 3amales 3amodels 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 0aHeme oxygenase 1 0aNQO1 0aNuclear factor kappa B1 aElshafey, Mostafa M.0 tLife sciences.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 283 p.119856-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1198563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245013900210300001800349506007600367520150700443592002801950506003701978650001202015650001502027650000902042650002502051650001102076650002602087650002102113650001502134650004402149650001102193650001502204650001002219650002002229650000902249653002102258653003902279653002302318653001302341653002202354700001802376700002302394700002402417700003002441700002802471700002802499700002102527700002302548773019102571856007902762852000902841655001202850IND60331742320221207053508.0150727e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6033174232DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15060111122doi7 aPMC45002782pmcid7 a261061602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomek, Katarzyna M.12aA retro-biosynthetic approach to the prediction of biosynthetic pathways from position-specific isotope analysis as shown for tramadol  ap. 8296-8301.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTramadol, previously only known as a synthetic analgesic, has now been found in the bark and wood of roots of the African medicinal tree Nauclea latifolia . At present, no direct evidence is available as to the biosynthetic pathway of its unusual skeleton. To provide guidance as to possible biosynthetic precursors, we have adopted a novel approach of retro-biosynthesis based on the position-specific distribution of isotopes in the extracted compound. Relatively recent developments in isotope ratio monitoring by ¹³C NMR spectrometry make possible the measurement of the nonstatistical position-specific natural abundance distribution of ¹³C (δ ¹³C ᵢ) within the molecule with better than 1‰ precision. Very substantial variation in the ¹³C positional distribution is found: between δ ¹³C ᵢ = −11 and −53‰. Distribution is not random and it is argued that the pattern observed can substantially be interpreted in relation to known causes of isotope fractionation in natural products. Thus, a plausible biosynthetic scheme based on sound biosynthetic principals of precursor–substrate relationships can be proposed. In addition, data obtained from the ¹⁸O/ ¹⁶O ratios in the oxygen atoms of the compound add support to the deductions made from the carbon isotope analysis. This paper shows how the use of ¹³C NMR at natural abundance can help with proposing a biosynthetic route to compounds newly found in nature or those difficult to tackle by conventional means.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNauclea 3aanalgesics 3abark 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3aisotope fractionation 3amedicinal plants 3amonitoring 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3aroots 3astable isotopes 3awood 0aNMR spectrometry 0aposition-specific isotope analysis 0aretro-biosynthesis 0atramadol 0aNauclea latifolia1 aNun, Pierrick1 aRemaud, Gérald S.1 aSilvestre, Virginie1 aTaéïwe, Germain Sotoing1 aLecerf-Schmidt, Florine1 aBoumendjel, Ahcéïène1 aDe Waard, Michel1 aRobins, Richard J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 July 7, v. 112, no. 27 p.8296-8301dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15060111123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245010700182300001800289520130000307592002801607596009201635596008101727650001301808650001401821650002501835650002601860650002601886650001701912650001201929650002101941650002101962650002901983650001702012651001302029700002202042700002002064700002002084700001702104700005502121773017302176856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60784356120220726000000.0220726e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078435612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c000552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBitchagno, Gabin Thierry M.10aSesquiterpene Lactones from Vernonia tufnelliae: Structural Characterization and Biological Evaluation  ap. 1681-1690.  aThe genus Vernonia is an extremely rich source of biologically active sesquiterpene lactones. The present report describes the spectroscopic structure elucidation and the cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties of five hitherto unknown germacranolide-like sesquiterpenoids and several known compounds. These new derivatives include a compound (1) with an unprecedented 10/5/5/6 tetracyclic framework featuring a hexahydro-1H,3H,7H-furo[3′,4′:3,4]furo[3,2-c]pyridin-1-one core resulting from an intramolecular cyclization cascade involving a methacrylate substituent and a low molecular weight amine. Furthermore, an elemane–germacranolide hybrid (2) and three amino acid-derived lactones (3–5) were characterized. A plausible biosynthetic pathway to the key alkaloid is presented, while shielding tensor calculations using DFT in combination with the DP4+ method were applied to elucidate its stereostructure. The newly characterized compounds along with ten known sesquiterpene lactones and phenolic compounds have been isolated from Vernonia tufnelliae, a medicinal plant from the western region of Cameroon. Their structures were consistent with spectroscopic and spectrometric data recorded. The present report is the first investigation of the chemistry and biology of V. tufnelliae.  aPublisher supplied data  a57381410cDeutscher Akademischer Austauschdienstdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001655  aNAcRhineland Palatinate Natural Producs Research Centerdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aVernonia 3aalkaloids 3abiochemical pathways 3abiological assessment 3acyclization reactions 3acytotoxicity 3ahybrids 3amedicinal plants 3amolecular weight 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3aspectroscopy 3aCameroon1 aSchüffler, Anja,1 aGross, Jonathan1 aKrumb, Matthias1 aTane, Pierre1 aOpatz, Till1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3266-40500 tJournal of natural products.g2022 June 15, v. 85, no. 7 p.1681-1690dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c000553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001700146245008700163300001600250520183000266592002802096650001102124650001002135650000802145650001502153650001602168650001902184650001102203650002502214650001702239650001002256650000902266650001102275650002402286650001302310650001202323650000902335650001902344650001702363650001202380650001502392650001302407650001902420650001302439650001402452650001202466650001602478700001302494700001702507700001702524700002102541700002302562700001802585700001802603700002302621700001802644773010302662856008202765852000902847655001202856IND4471772720221120024529.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447177272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, C.M.C.10aEquid Herpesvirus Type-1 Exhibits Neurotropism and Neurovirulence in a Mouse Model  ap. 202-210.  aIntranasal inoculation of equid herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) Brazilian strains A4/72 and A9/92 induced an acute and lethal infection in four different inbred mouse strains. Clinical and neurological signs appeared between the 2nd and 3rd day post inoculation (dpi) and included weight loss, ruffled fur, a hunched posture, crouching in corners, nasal and ocular discharges, dyspnoea, dehydration and increased salivation. These signs were followed by increased reactivity to external stimulation, seizures, recumbency and death. The virus was recovered consistently from the brain and viscera of all mice with neurological signs. Histopathological changes consisted of leptomeningitis, focal haemorrhage, ventriculitis, neuronal degeneration and necrosis, neuronophagia, non-suppurative inflammation, multifocal gliosis and perivascular infiltration of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated that EHV-1 strains A4/72 and A9/92 replicated in neurons of the olfactory bulb, the cortex and the hippocampus. In contrast, mice inoculated with the EHV-1 Brazilian strain A3/97 showed neither weight loss nor apparent clinical or neurological signs; however, the virus was recovered consistently from their lungs at 3 dpi. These three EHV-1 strains showed distinct degrees of virulence and tissue tropism in mice. EHV-1 strains A4/72 and A9/92 exhibited a high degree of central nervous system tropism with neuroinvasion and neurovirulence. EHV-1 strain A3/97 was not neurovirulent despite being detected in the brains of infected BALB/c nude mice. These findings indicate that several inbred mouse strains are susceptible to neuropathogenic EHV-1 strains and should be useful models for studying the pathogenesis and mechanisms contributing to EHV-induced myeloencephalopathy in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acortex 3adeath 3afur 3ahemorrhage 3ahippocampus 3ahistopathology 3ahorses 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amice 3amodels 3amyeloencephalopathy 3anecrosis 3aneurons 3anose 3aolfactory bulb 3apathogenesis 3aposture 3asalivation 3aseizures 3atissue tropism 3atropisms 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aweight loss1 aMori, E.1 aFavaro, L.L.1 aSantos, C.R.1 aLara, M.C.C.S.H.1 aVillalobos, E.M.C.1 aCunha, E.M.S.1 aBrandao, P.E.1 aRichtzenhain, L.J.1 aMaiorka, P.C.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2012 , v. 146, no. 2-3 p.202-210dElsevier Ltdx0021-99757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011100155300001800266500001400284520102700298592002801325650002201353650001601375650001001391650002401401650002701425650002401452650001301476650001601489650001501505650001701520700001901537700001901556700001601575700001301591700001101604773012501615856007401740852000901814655001201823IND60704328420221123015923.0200723e20200722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070432842DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo00161a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Sining10aUp-regulation of neprilysin mediates the protection of fructo-oligosaccharides against Alzheimer's disease  ap. 6565-6572.  aNAL-light  aFructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), an important prebiotic, have been proved to have a beneficial effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the specific mechanism remains to be confirmed. Senile plaques are one of the main neuropathological features of AD and the core of senile plaques mainly consists of extracellular beta-amyloid (Aβ). Reducing Aβ accumulation in the brain is an important therapeutic strategy for AD. Neprilysin (NEP), a major Aβ-degrading enzyme, has been found to be decreased in the AD brain. Evidence has shown that the expression of NEP is associated with histone acetylation levels. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are the key enzymes in the modulation of histone acetylation modification. Importantly, several metabolites of FOS have been demonstrated to be pan-HDAC inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrate that FOS ameliorate cognitive impairment and alleviate Aβ accumulation in the brain of AD model mice. The regulation of HDAC2 on NEP plays an important role in the anti-AD effect of FOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aacetylation 3abrain 3acognitive disorders 3afructooligosaccharides 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3ametabolites 3aprebiotics 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Jingzhu1 aJiang, Congmin1 aWang, Sihui1 aQue, Ran1 aAn, Li0 tFood & function.g2020 July 22, v. 11, no. 7 p.6565-6572dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo00161a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04462naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245011200207300001800319506010400337506007600441520228100517592002802798506003702826650002802863650002302891650002302914650003702937650001402974650001502988650002403003650002003027650002403047653001803071653002103089653001403110653004203124653002403166653001503190653000803205653000803213653000803221653000803229653000603237653000703243653000803250653000803258653002803266700002203294700002103316700001603337700001803353700006203371700001803433700001703451700002203468700002103490700002103511700001803532700002103550773011303571856008303684852000903767655001203776IND60751867920221207081231.0220621e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075186792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawakami, Ryoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8211-155310aDevelopment and validation of a simple anthropometric equation to predict appendicular skeletal muscle mass  ap. 5523-5530.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA limited number of studies have developed simple anthropometric equations that can be implemented for predicting muscle mass in the local community. Several studies have suggested calf circumference as a simple and accurate surrogate maker for muscle mass. We aimed to develop and cross-validate a simple anthropometric equation, which incorporates calf circumference, to predict appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Furthermore, we conducted a comparative validity assessment of our equation with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and two previously reported equations using similar variables. ASM measurements were recorded for 1262 participants (837 men, 425 women) aged 40 years or older. Participants were randomly divided into the development or validation group. Stepwise multiple linear regression was applied to develop the DXA-measured ASM prediction equation. Parameters including age, sex, height, weight, waist circumference, and calf circumference were incorporated as predictor variables. Total error was calculated as the square root of the sum of the square of the difference between DXA-measured and predicted ASMs divided by the total number of individuals. The most optimal ASM prediction equation developed was: ASM (kg) = 2.955 × sex (men = 1, women = 0) + 0.255 × weight (kg) − 0.130 × waist circumference (cm) + 0.308 × calf circumference (cm) + 0.081 × height (cm) − 11.897 (adjusted R² = 0.94, standard error of the estimate = 1.2 kg). Our equation had smaller total error and higher intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values than those for BIA and two previously reported equations, for both men and women (men, total error = 1.2 kg, ICC = 0.91; women, total error = 1.1 kg, ICC = 0.80). The correlation between DXA-measured ASM and predicted ASM by the present equation was not significantly different from the correlation between DXA-measured ASM and BIA-measured ASM. The equation developed in this study can predict ASM more accurately as compared to equations where calf circumference is used as the sole variable and previously reported equations; it holds potential as a reliable and an effective substitute for estimating ASM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioelectrical impedance 3acalf circumference 3aclinical nutrition 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aequations 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3askeletal muscle 3awaist circumference 0aAnthropometry 0aBody composition 0aBody size 0aDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan 0aPrediction equation 0aSarcopenia 0aASM 0aBIA 0aDXA 0aICC 0ar 0aR2 0aROC 0aSEE 0aWASEDA’S Health Study1 aMiyachi, Motohiko1 aTanisawa, Kumpei1 aIto, Tomoko1 aUsui, Chiyoko1 aMidorikawa, Taishi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7985-19051 aTorii, Suguru1 aIshii, Kaori1 aSuzuki, Katsuhiko1 aSakamoto, Shizuo1 aHiguchi, Mitsuru1 aMuraoka, Isao1 aOka, Kōichirō,0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.5523-5530dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245014800162520142200310592002801732650000901760650001501769650001801784650004901802650001601851650001101867650001801878650001901896650001101915650001701926650002701943650001801970650001701988650002102005650001602026653002302042653003202065653001602097653001902113653001702132653003202149700001202181700001502193700001802208700005702226700001702283700001402300700002002314700001902334700001902353773009002372856008502462852000902547655001202556IND60790527820221120075413.0220906e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079052782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1251382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Wei10aExperimental study on inhibition of spontaneous combustion of different-rank coals by high-performance m-Cresol water-based inhibitor solutions  aA kind of simple and efficient m-Cresol water-based inhibitor was proposed. The inhibitory effects of its solutions on the spontaneous combustion of different-rank coals were discussed. Furthermore, the micromorphology and wetting characteristics of different-rank coals were analyzed through a scanning electron microscope and a contact angle meter, respectively. Besides, the weight loss rates, oxidation characteristics, pore structure characteristics and free radical changes of different coal samples were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer, temperature-programmed experiments, a surface area analyzer and an electron spin resonance spectrometer, respectively. The results indicate that the prepared inhibitor solution at the 0.3 wt% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) not only boasts good emulsification and wetting performance, but also plays a role in permeability enhancement. The m-Cresol/SDS solution can wet the coal surface and permeate the inner pore surface, forming a uniform inhibitor layer on both the coal surface and the inner pore surface to isolate oxygen, retain water and inhibit free radical generation. Moreover, it can not only effectively reduce the weight loss rate, CO production, specific surface areas and free radical concentration in the oxidation process of CoalXLH, CoalBLT and CoalYQ, but also improve the inhibition rate (to 79.1%, 67.4% and 54.3% at 170 °C respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acombustion 3acontact angle 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aemulsifying 3aenergy 3afree radicals 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aspectrometers 3asurface area 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss 0aPhenolic inhibitor 0aDifferent-rank coal samples 0aWettability 0aPore structure 0aFree radical 0aCoal spontaneous combustion1 aGao, Ao1 aSun, Weili1 aLiang, Yuntao1 aHe, Zhenglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8088-85931 aLi, Jinliang1 aSun, Yong1 aSong, Shuanglin1 aMeng, Shaocong1 aCao, Yingjiazi0 tEnergy.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 261 p.125138-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1251383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009300160300001800253520079900271592002801070650001501098650001701113650001801130650002201148650001001170700001601180700002201196773011801218856007501336852000901411655001201420IND60550104820221117211402.0160909e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055010482DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302531g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Shoji10aFluorescence of Diimidazo[1,2-a:2′,1′-c]quinoxalinium Salts Under Various Conditions  ap. 2397-2404.  aThe synthesis and photophysical properties of diimidazo[1,2-a:2′,1′-c]quinoxalinium salts were examined for different counteranions. The ethyl-substituted diimidazo[1,2-a:2′,1′-c]quinoxalinium salt with tosylate anion (categolized in ionic liquid) showed good fluorescence (ΦF = 0.77) in organic solvent. The 3,10-diphenyldiimidazo[1,2-a:2′,1′-c]quinoxalinium salts showed absorption and fluorescence peaks resembling those of the former diimidazoquinoxaline. The salt also emitted under various conditions such as in organic solvents, water, and even in the solid state, while retaining a good fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.5–0.8). Furthermore, the fluorescence was quenched efficiently through the introduction of an electron-donating substituent on the alkyl side chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3afluorescence 3aionic liquids 3aorganic chemistry 3asalts1 aAbe, Hajime1 aAkazome, Motohiro0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 78, no. 6 p.2397-2404dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo302531g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010300173520097400276592002801250650002901278650002201307650002101329650001501350650000901365651001001374653003001384653002001414653002501434653001501459653006001474700001701534700001601551700001401567773010601581856008801687852000901775655001201784IND60745966820221116163252.0211001e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074596682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1127442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiubartseva, S.10aStochastic oil spill modeling for environmental protection at the Port of Taranto (southern Italy)  aWe performed stochastic simulations of hypothetical oil spills from a single-point buoy mooring and subsea pipeline for the Port of Taranto given that this port is an essential strategic hub in the European logistic chain. Our methodology integrates (1) the MEDSLIK-II oil spill model coupled to a high-resolution hydrodynamic model run on an unstructured grid in operational forecasting mode; (2) a hypothetical oil spill scenario based on a historical pipeline rupture at the Port of Genoa, 2016; and (3) randomly sampling the environmental conditions over 2018–2020. The main oil drift was found to be directed southwesterly towards the outlet to the open sea. When oil is transported by highly variable currents, waves and turbulent mixing, it is exposed to multiple strandings and washing-offs from concrete constructions in the port. Consequently, oil tends to be dispersed almost isotropically over the Mar Grande, indicating low to moderate pollution indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3ahydrologic models 3amarine pollution 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aItaly 0aSingle-point buoy mooring 0aSubsea pipeline 0aAccidental oil spill 0aMEDSLIK-II 0aHigh-resolution unstructured-grid hydrodynamic modeling1 aFederico, I.1 aCoppini, G.1 aLecci, R.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Oct., v. 171 p.112744-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1127443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245016500167300001800332506010400350506007600454520175500530592002802285506003702313650001302350650001602363650002802379650002302407650000902430650001702439650001402456650001402470650001402484650004302498650001302541653002002554653002102574653002902595653000802624653000802632653000802640653000902648653000902657653001002666653000802676653001202684653001202696653000802708653000802716700002602724700006202750700003902812700001802851700003102869700001702900700002902917700001902946700006402965700006003029773011303089856008303202852000903285655001203294IND60751868120221207092603.0220621e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075186812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashid, Mardin14aThe effect of monomeric and oligomeric FLAVAnols in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (FLAVA-trial): A double-blind randomized controlled trial  ap. 5587-5594.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroalbuminuria is an early sign of vascular complications of type 2 diabetes and predicts cardiovascular disease and mortality. Monomeric and oligomeric flavanols (MOFs) are linked to improved vascular health. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 3 months MOFs on albuminuria and endothelial function markers in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. Patients with type 2 diabetes received either 200 mg MOFs or placebo daily on top of their habitual diet and medication. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference of the change in 24-h Albumin Excretion Rate (AER) over three months. Secondary endpoints were the between-group differences of the change in plasma levels of different markers of endothelial dysfunction. Mixed-modelling was applied for the longitudinal analyses. Participants (n = 97) were 63.0 ± 9.5 years old; diabetes-duration was 15.7 ± 8.5 years. Median baseline AER was 60 (IQR 20–120) mg/24 h. There was no within-group difference in median change of AER from baseline to 3 months in the intervention (0 (-35-21) mg/24 h, p = 0.41) or the control group (0 (-20-10) mg/24 h, p = 0.91). There was no between-group difference in the course of AER over three months (log-transformed data: β = −0.02 (95%CI -0.23-0.20), p = 0.88), nor in the plasma levels of the endothelial dysfunction markers. Daily 200 mg MOFs for three months on top of habitual diet and usual care did not reduce AER and plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction compared to placebo, in patients with long-term type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. NTR4669, www.trialregister.nl.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3aalbuminuria 3acardiovascular diseases 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3adrug therapy 3aexcretion 3aflavanols 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aplacebos 0aType 2 diabetes 0aMicroalbuminuria 0aEndothelial cell markers 0aAER 0aARB 0aCVD 0aeGFR 0aMOFs 0aRAS-I 0aRCT 0asICAM-1 0asVCAM-1 0aT2D 0avWF1 aVerhoeven, Adrie J.M.1 aMulder, Monique T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0460-36451 aTimman, R.q(Reinier),d1917-1975,1 aOzcan, Behiye1 avan Beek-Nieuwland, Yvonne1 aChow, Lei M.1 avan de Laar, Roel J.J.M.1 aDik, Willem A.1 aSijbrands, Eric J.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8857-73891 aBerk, Kirsten A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-47850 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Nov., v. 40, no. 11 p.5587-5594dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014000167300001400307520088600321592002801207650001901235650000801254650002501262650001301287650002501300650002501325650001001350650001601360650001401376650000801390650001401398650001501412650001401427650002201441650001801463650001101481650002201492650001101514651002101525651001801546651001001564651001301574700002001587700002001607700001901627700002101646700001801667773008501685856004801770852000901818655001201827IND50063203620221123004335.0130324e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006320362DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617130100372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanaeva, T.

This study investigates the above topic with novelty in contributing new knowledge and updating the existing literature gap in the upstream petroleum industry, using qualitative and quantitative techniques. The authors innovatively designed a microeconomic model together with expert judgement technique after obtaining and coding the primary data to investigate the externalities prevalent in petroleum-producing communities in Ghana. The analysis shows that the upstream petroleum industry negatively impacts fishers' and fishmongers' livelihoods. Also, farmers' crop yields are damaged, and some have not received any compensation from the petroleum companies. The results further showcase that oil and natural gas operations have adversely impacted the coastal dweller's economic, social and environment, particularly through damaging public and sacred lands and marine ecosystem. Nevertheless, the industry also contributes positively to the socio-economic benefits regarding social amenities, infrastructure and development. Presently, the social benefits provided by the upstream petroleum companies as a source of corporate social responsibilities fall below the host communities' prior expectations toward development. The implication is that petroleum hosting communities usually have conditional expectations on community development in accepting petroleum production companies. In conclusion, the finding suggests that the current exposure to negative externalities in the host communities are greater than the overall positive externalities. This analysis provides relevant firsthand information for future upstream exploration & development in Ghana. Consequently, the authors have offered intuitive policy recommendations in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity development 3aenergy 3agrowth and development 3aissues and policy 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3anatural gas 3anatural resource management 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3aGhana 0aUpstream petroleum externality 0aSocio-economic impact assessment 0aDeadweight loss 0aSustainable livelihood framework 0aEnvironmental externality1 aCai, Xiangyu1 aLin, Boqiang0 tEnergy.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 260 p.125139-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1251393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010400172300001400276520167200290592002801962650002001990650001702010650001402027650001702041650001902058650002002077650002702097650001502124650001002139650001002149650000902159650001302168650002302181650001002204653002002214653001702234653001202251653001002263653001402273653001102287700002902298700002002327700002002347773011602367856008202483852000902565655001202574IND60605365020221120050614.0190401e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060536502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2018.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanaki, Anastasia10aEssential oil variation of Thymbra spicata L. (Lamiaceae), an East Mediterranean “oregano” herb  ap. 63-69.  aThis is the first account of the essential oils of wild Greek plants of Thymbra spicata, an East Mediterranean species used as a culinary herb and herbal tea. In particular, the yield and composition of the essential oil of Th. spicata from Chios Island is recorded and compared between two seasons. Considering that Chios provides the westernmost studied material of Th. spicata, the geographical variation in the main essential oil compounds in the total natural range of the species in relation to its systematics is also discussed. The essential oil yield of the Chios plants ranged from 2.4 to 4.8 mL 100 g−1 dry weight (aerial parts without stems). Carvacrol (responsible for the “oregano” scent) was dominant in considerably high amounts (67.5%–88.3% of the total oil) and without significant seasonal differences. Other main compounds were p-cymene (0.7%–17.4%), γ-terpinene (0.1%–6.9%) and caryophyllene oxide (0.9%–2.5%). Τhymol (responsible for the “thyme” scent) was always very low (0.3%–0.7%). Throughout the East Mediterranean, carvacrol is dominantly the major essential oil compound of Th. spicata. p-Cymene, γ-terpinene and other, more minor, compounds contribute to local differences in the species' essential oils in its total range. The thymol-chemotype is scarce throughout the species' range and not related to the local Turkish subspecies intricata as previously suggested. Despite the closer taxonomic affinities with the genus Thymus and the thyme-related vernacular names attributed to Th. spicata, this species can be characterized as an “oregano” with regard to its essential oil composition and herbal use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThymbra spicata 3aaerial parts 3acarvacrol 3acommon names 3aessential oils 3agamma-terpinene 3ageographical variation 3aherbal tea 3aherbs 3aodors 3aoils 3ap-cymene 3aseasonal variation 3astems 0aAromatic plants 0aChios Island 0aOregano 0aThyme 0aCarvacrol 0aThymol1 aCook, Catherine Margaret1 aLanaras, Thomas1 aKokkini, Stella0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2018 Oct., v. 80 p.63-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2018.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012500168300001600293520161900309592002801928650002201956650002301978650002102001650001702022650001302039650002402052650001502076650000702091650001502098650001502113653003202128653002002160653003202180653002002212653001302232700001602245700001702261700001702278700001702295773012202312856008302434852000902517655001202526IND60766252620221120142525.0220523e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076625262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tiantian10aHeterostructured CoP·CoMoP nanocages as advanced electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution over a wide pH range  ap. 465-474.  aA sustainable and environmental-friendly method to produce hydrogen with high purity is the electrochemical water splitting, but its commercialization is challenged due to lack of cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide pH range. Herein, a series of CoP·xCoMoP heterostructured nanocages (NCs) were prepared via a dissolution-regrowth and subsequent phosphorization process using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as template. The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of CoP·xCoMoP is constituted by the heterostructured nanosheets composed with CoP and CoMoP phase. These noble-metal-free earth-abundant transition metal phosphide (TMP) catalysts show a pH-universal HER activity with high efficiency. Under the optimal atom ratio of Co and Mo (6:5), CoP·5CoMoP NC catalysts can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² at the overpotential of 72 mV with a Tafel slope of 60.3 mV dec⁻¹ in 1.0 M KOH solution. The same current output requires overpotential of 44 mV in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ solution and 151 mV in1.0 M phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively. The superior HER activity of CoP·5CoMoP NC catalysts can be comparable to or even better than most of noble metal-free HER electrocatalysts reported recently. In addition, CoP·5CoMoP NC catalysts also show a fairly high HER stability over a wide pH range, and their HER activity can be well kept without significant loss for long-term electrolysis. The 3D CoP·5CoMoP heterostructured catalysts hold promise as efficient and low-cost catalysts for water splitting devices over a wide pH range.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolysis 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphides 0aTransition metal phosphides 0aWater splitting 0aHydrogen evolution reaction 0aHeterostructure 0aNanocage1 aWang, Yihui1 aYuan, Junhua1 aFang, Keming1 aWang, Ai-jun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 June, v. 615 p.465-474dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171100002200189245002600211300001300237506007600250520173100326592002802057506003702085650001502122650001302137650001802150650001502168650001502183650002302198650001302221650002702234650002502261650002002286650001202306650001102318650001402329650001502343650001302358650001202371650002402383650001202407650003302419650003602452650003202488650002502520650003002545650001302575650001102588650003302599650002702632650001302659650001302672650001302685650003002698773010702728856008402835852000902919655001202928IND4446648120221207083530.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444664812DNAL7 a208168432pmid7 aPMC30050342pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoolan, Denise L.10aPlasmodium immunomics  ap. 3-20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, is an excellent model for immunomic-based approaches to vaccine development. The Plasmodium parasite has a complex life cycle with multiple stages and stage-specific expression of ∼5300 putative proteins. No malaria vaccine has yet been licensed. Many believe that an effective vaccine will need to target several antigens and multiple stages, and will require the generation of both antibody and cellular immune responses. Vaccine efforts to date have been stage-specific and based on only a very limited number of proteins representing <0.5% of the genome. The recent availability of comprehensive genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic datasets from human and selected non-human primate and rodent malarias provide a foundation to exploit for vaccine development. This information can be mined to identify promising vaccine candidate antigens, by proteome-wide screening of antibody and T cell reactivity using specimens from individuals exposed to malaria and technology platforms such as protein arrays, high throughput protein production and epitope prediction algorithms. Such antigens could be incorporated into a rational vaccine development process that targets specific stages of the Plasmodium parasite life cycle with immune responses implicated in parasite elimination and control. Immunomic approaches which enable the selection of the best possible targets by prioritising antigens according to clinically relevant criteria may overcome the problem of poorly immunogenic, poorly protective vaccines that has plagued malaria vaccine developers for the past 25years. Herein, current progress and perspectives regarding Plasmodium immunomics are reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium 3aPrimates 3aT-lymphocytes 3aalgorithms 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3adevelopmental stages 3aimmune response 3amalaria 3amodels 3aparasites 3aprediction 3aproteins 3arodents 3avaccine development 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aAntigens, Protozoanximmunology 2aBiomedical Researchxtrends 2aEpitopesximmunology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenomics 2aHumans 2aMalaria Vaccinesximmunology 2aPlasmodiumximmunology 2aPrimates 2aProteome 2aRodentia 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2011 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.3-20dElsevier Ltdx0020-75197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012700159300001800286520039100304592002800695650001200723650002300735650002300758650002300781650002200804650003000826650002200856700002100878773011800899856007501017852000901092655001201101IND60550104920221117211335.0160909e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055010492DNAL7 a10.1021/jo302545n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Biswajit10aGold Catalysis: Regio- and Stereoselective Total Synthesis of Xyloketals D and G and the Related Natural Product Alboatrin  ap. 2413-2421.  aA new and efficient one-pot desilylation–gold-catalyzed cycloisomerization of alkynes containing a silyl-protected phenolic −OH and a free alcoholic −OH unit leads selectively to the formation of tetrahydrofuranobenzopyran ring system.

The field was inoculated with six isolates of P. infestans taken from another potato field where sexual reproduction of the pathogen was suspected. Three weeks after inoculation single‐lesion leaflets were sampled and the resulting isolates characterized using microsatellites (SSRs) and mating type as markers. Among the 151 isolates analysed, the inoculum genotypes constituted more than 80% of the genotypes found, with three other genotypes making up the remainder. The following year, P. infestans obtained from soil samples taken from this field were analysed, and six novel genotypes were identified. Genotypes from the previous summer’s population were not detected. Analysis of the genotypes recovered was consistent with them being recombinants, with the previous summer’s population acting as parents. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oospores produced during a summer epidemic in Sweden can overwinter and cause infection the next year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3adisease outbreaks 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3ainoculum 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoospores 3aparents 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3asexual reproduction 3asoil sampling 3asummer 3aSweden1 aAndersson, B.1 aSandström, M.1 aYuen, J.

Agouti ovarian fragments were placed, for 10 min, in a solution containing MEM and fetal bovine serum plus 1.5 M dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol (EG) or propanediol (PROH); some of those fragments were subsequently cryopreserved in a programmable freezer. After exposure and/or thawing, all samples were fixed in Carnoy prior to histological analysis. To evaluate ultrastructure, follicles from the control and all cryopreserved treatments were fixed in Karnovsky and processed for transmission electron microscopy. After exposure and freezing, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of morphologically normal preantral follicles in all treatments when compared to the control (92.67 ± 2.79, mean ± SD). However, there were no significant difference when the exposure and freezing procedures were compared using the same cryoprotectant. Moreover, there was no significant difference among cryoprotectants at the time of exposure (DMSO: 64.7 ± 3.8; EG: 70.7 ± 11.2, PROH: 63.3 ± 8.5) or after freezing (DMSO: 60.6 ± 3.6, EG: 64.0 ± 11.9; PROH: 62.0 ± 6.9). However, only follicles frozen with PROH had normal ultrastructure. In conclusion, preantral follicles enclosed in agouti ovarian tissue were successfully cryopreserved using 1.5 M PROH, with satisfactory maintenance of follicle morphology and ultrastructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgouti 3aDasyprocta 3aanimal ovaries 3acryopreservation 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethylene glycol 3aexposure duration 3afetal bovine serum 3afreezing 3athawing 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aDimethyl Sulfoxide 2aEndangered Species 2aEthylene Glycol 2aFemale 2aHearing 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmissionxveterinary 2aModels, Animal 2aOvarian Folliclexphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aPropylene Glycols 2aRodentiaxanatomy & histology 2aTissue Preservationxmethodsxveterinary.1 aMachado Luz, Hiédely Kenia1 aFaustino, Luciana Rocha1 aLima, Isadora Machado Teixeira1 aLopes, Cláudio Afonso Pinho1 aSilva, Alexandre Rodrigues1 aBáo, Sônia Nair1 aCampello, Claudio Cabral1 aRodrigues, Ana Paula Ribeiro1 ade Figueiredo, José Ricardo0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 77, no. 2 p.260-267dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245011100175300001600286520180300302592002802105653001102133653003002144653001502174653002702189653002002216653002002236653001302256653002302269700003602292700003702328700002302365700001802388700002302406700002402429700002102453773009402474856008002568852000902648655001202657IND60130685820221117222821.0151127e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013068582DNAL7 a10.1525/auk.2011.101422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPap, Pééter Láászlóó14aThe Effect of Coccidians on the Condition and Immune Profile of Molting House Sparrows (Passer domesticus)  ap. 330-339.  aFeather molt is recognized as an energetically costly activity for birds, and parasite infestation during molt has the potential to reduce host fitness because parasites sequester essential nutrients and stimulate the immune system. We manipulated the coccidian parasite load of captive male House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) by suppressing the natural infection of control birds with an anticoccidial drug and infecting experimental birds with coccidian oocysts. Following infestation, the effect of chronic coccidian infection on individual condition, molt and 12 indices of physiological and immunological function was assessed. We found a significant positive relationship between infestation and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio measured at capture, indicating infectioninduced stress. We also found that coccidians negatively affected feather growth during molt: the increase in wing length of the noninfected birds was significantly higher than that of infected birds. In comparison to control birds, infected birds showed a significantly higher concentration of white blood cells and greater blood bactericidal activity. There was also a positive correlation between infection intensity, agglutination and lysis of blood in the experimentally infested birds, which indicated activation of the constitutive innate immune system during infection. Finally, the total antioxidant capacity of the blood increased significantly, while the carotenoid concentration decreased significantly in infected compared with control birds. Therefore, we showed that coccidians stimulated several measures of the constitutive innate immunity, including the bactericidal activity of the blood, and that coccidians can have significant negative effects on the health and possibly fitness of molting House Sparrows.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaviary 0abacteria killing capacity 0acomplement 0aexperimental infection 0afeather quality 0aimmune response 0aIsospora 0anatural antibodies1 aVáágáási, Csongor Istváán1 aCzirjáák, Gáábor ÁÁrpáád1 aTitilincu, Adriana1 aPintea, Adela1 aOsvááth, Gergely1 aFüülööp, Attila1 aBarta, Zoltáán0 tAuk.g2011 Apr., v. 128, no. 2 p.330-339dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2011.101423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024002200148040001800170100002300188245008800211300001600299506007600315520121400391592002801605506003701633650000801670650001801678650001101696650000901707650001001716650001101726650000901737650001401746650001501760650002101775650003501796650002901831650002601860650002401886650001201910650001801922650002101940650002301961650000901984650003101993650001102024650001102035650002802046650001402074650003902088650003002127650002002157650001302177650004902190653001102239653003902250653002502289700001902314773010202333856008102435961001302516852000902529655001202538IND60088679220221207085055.0161024e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008867922DNAL7 a234339592pmid7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2012.10.0042doi7 aPMC43577882pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBickhart, Derek M.10aIdentification of Candidate Transcription Factor Binding Sites in the Cattle Genome  ap. 195-198.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA resource that provides candidate transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) does not currently exist for cattle. Such data is necessary, as predicted sites may serve as excellent starting locations for future omics studies to develop transcriptional regulation hypotheses. In order to generate this resource, we employed a phylogenetic footprinting approach—using sequence conservation across cattle, human and dog—and position-specific scoring matrices to identify 379,333 putative TFBSs upstream of nearly 8000 Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) annotated genes within the cattle genome. Comparisons of our predictions to known binding site loci within the PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC promoter regions revealed 75% sensitivity for our method of discovery. Additionally, we intersected our predictions with known cattle SNP variants in dbSNP and on the Illumina BovineHD 770k and Bos 1 SNP chips, finding 7534, 444 and 346 overlaps, respectively. Due to our stringent filtering criteria, these results represent high quality predictions of putative TFBSs within the cattle genome.

Prescribed high wheat quality, which is enforced via cultivar release criteria, is believed to have negatively influenced the productivity and competitiveness of producers. The main hypothesis is that producers deliver lower yields because of high quality requirements and are not compensated for this high quality since prices are still determined by the lowest import parity price. Whether or not this is actually the case must be determined, firstly, by identifying the factors that influence the price of wheat, and secondly, by identifying the factors that do not influence the price of wheat but nevertheless have an adverse effect on producers’ productivity. In this study, a hedonic price model, built on the premise that price is a function of all the characteristics that the product possesses, is used to precisely determine the factors that impact – or otherwise – on price levels in the South African wheat industry. The authors apply the hedonic price model using a three-step process to obtain the best-fitting model for the available data. The results reveal that variations in price are mainly a function of Colour, P/L, Defects and Fall, and that these factors should form the basis of the prescribed quality to producers. By knowing the wheat characteristics that must be included in, and excluded from, the release criteria (prescribed quality) system, producers will be able to produce goods that positively impact their productivity as well as their competitiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acultivars 3aimports 3aindustry 3amodels 3aparity prices 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 0awheat prices 0aproductivity 0acompetitiveness 0ahedonic price model 0aC61 0aD021 aCloete, Philippus Christoffel1 aVan Schalkwyk, Herman Daniel,0 tAgrekon.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 55, no. 4 p.411-435dRoutledgex2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2016.12430613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009100164300002000255520118700275592002801462650001401490650002101504650001701525650001401542650000901556650001601565650001101581650001101592700001601603700002301619773012901642856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60565971620221122001139.0170330e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056597162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b076332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoga, Hiroaki10aDensity Functional Theory Study of Active Oxygen at the Perimeter of Au/TiO2 Catalysts  ap. 25907-25916.  aIn spite of numerous efforts, the nature of active oxygen generated at the perimeter of Au/TiO₂ catalysts remains elusive; e.g., it is unclear whether the active species is atomic or molecular oxygen. Using plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) and rutile (110)-supported Au rod models, we have examined various oxygen species for their stability and reactivity to CO. Our calculation finds that O₂ attached endon to a pentacoordinate Ti site (Ti⁵ᶜ) as well as to the Au perimeter (Ti-OO-Au) is a transient state, turning into states with both O attached to Ti⁵ᶜ. The latter are quite stable (< −1.5 eV) without O vacancies and bonding with the Au perimeter. The stability of O₂ on Ti⁵ᶜ improves with increasing Au/oxide contact area per O₂ because the contact is the origin of electrons used in adsorbing and activating O₂. Even O–O bond dissociation between two Ti⁵ᶜ sites is probable at low O₂ concentration. Both O and O₂ on Ti⁵ᶜ readily react with CO, although the adatom is rather unreactive to CO(g). The active oxygen is thus dissociated or undissociated O₂ on Ti⁵ᶜ, depending on O₂ population relative to the contact area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3adissociation 3aelectrons 3agold 3amethodology 3amodels 3aoxygen1 aTada, Kohei1 aOkumura, Mitsutaka0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 119, no. 46 p.25907-25916dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b076333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245014300197300001800340506007600358520058700434592002801021506003701049650001801086650001301104650002801117700002001145773010501165856007501270852000901345655001201354IND60578698820221207074434.0170813e20140516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057869882DNAL7 a10.1021/ol501101f2doi7 aPMC40336302pmcid7 a247867572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneko, Miho10aScope and Limitations of 2-Deoxy- and 2,6-Dideoxyglycosyl Bromides as Donors for the Synthesis of β-2-Deoxy- and β-2,6-Dideoxyglycosides  ap. 2776-2779.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is shown that 2-deoxy- and 2,6-dideoxyglycosyl bromides can be prepared in high yield (72–94%) and engaged in glycosylation reactions with β:α selectivities ≥6:1.

EHY was isolated from Erhai Lake. To obtain high productivity of biomass and lipids, a joint strategy comprising salinity stress and chemical induction and two-stage cultivation was developed to improve the production of lipids. Coupling salinity stress and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or CaCl₂ addition increased the lipid content to 56.47 ± 1.56% or 59.52 ± 0.00%, which was 1.24 or 1.31 times greater than that of the control, respectively (p < 0.05). The maximum energy yield was achieved under GABA and salt stress conditions of 95.78 kJ L⁻¹. Further data revealed that the combined application of salt stress and GABA or CaCl₂ increased the levels of cellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) and lipogenesis genes, accompanied by a further increase in lipids. The quality of the algal lipid-derived biodiesel was within the biodiesel quality ranges for advanced commercial standards. These results suggest that combined application of GABA or CaCl₂ and salt stress can stimulate microalgae biolipid synthesis for the production of renewable biodiesel. This work proposes an efficient potential biotechnological method for biolipid production by a novel Ankistrodesmus sp. strain via combined induction of chemical and salt stress under two-stage cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnkistrodesmus 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3alakes 3alipid content 3alipogenesis 3amicroalgae 3asalt stress 0aAnkistrodesmus sp.

However, the interaction of dissolved constituents with struvite is rarely evaluated. Removal of heavy metals and total organic carbon (TOC) in a greenhouse wastewater (GW) by struvite was investigated. Presynthesized struvite was added to GW and removal of Zn (689 μg/L), Cu (151 μg/L), and TOC (51 mg/L) monitored from 1 to 26 d. Metal uptake in sodium nitrate solutions was used to assess competition, and the influence of other GW constituents on sorption. Struvite was also directly precipitated from GW (PPT). Recovered GW solids had 64–247 mg/kg Zn, 12–54 mg/kg Cu, and 1721–8806 mg/kg TOC, with lowest loadings for PPT and highest for 26 d solids. X-ray absorption spectroscopy detected polymerized Zn-phosphate, induced by dissolved phosphorus in GW, and Cu copolymerization, initially limited by aqueous Cu-organic complexation. Sorbed Cu shifts Fourier transform infrared-sensitive phosphate bands and changes the intensities of reflections in X-ray diffraction patterns of struvite more so than Zn. Struvite from GW is more susceptible to thermal decomposition than unreacted struvite, evolving CO(g), CO₂(g), NH₃(g), and H₂O(g). Therefore, struvite from GW sorbs metals and organics, and can release sorbed and structural components to the aqueous and gas phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acopolymerization 3acopper 3agases 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3aphosphorus 3asodium nitrate 3asorption 3athermal degradation 3awastewater 3azinc 0aSTA-FTIR 0aXAFS 0aFTIR 0aOrganic carbon 0aGreenhouse gases 0aStruvite 0aHeavy metals1 aRamlogan, Marlon V.1 aRabinovich, Alon0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Mar. 07, v. 4, no. 3 p.1319-1327dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b013483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245011500183300001300298520180400311592002802115650002002143650002002163650001502183650001202198650001202210650002202222650002302244650001702267650000902284650001202293650001602305650001502321650003402336650003502370650003002405650001402435650000902449650001902458650001802477650001702495651001102512700003002523700003702553700003102590700003302621700003102654700003102685773015302716856008202869852000902951655001202960IND60119318420221120094353.0191003e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011931842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4119-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Vazquez, Francisco Javier10aConcentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals in soil from San Luis Potosí, México  ap. 4119.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and four heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) in soil from the city of San Luis Potosí in Mexico. In order to confirm the presence of the previously mentioned compounds, outdoor surface soil samples were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer for PBDEs, PCBs, DDT, and DDE. Meanwhile, heavy metals were quantified using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry technique. The total PBDEs levels ranged from 5.0 to 134 μg/kg dry weight (dw), with a total mean PBDEs level of 22.0 ± 32.5 μg/kg dw (geometric mean ± standard deviation). For PCBs, the total mean level in the studied soil was 21.6 ± 24.7 μg/kg dw (range, <LOD to 80.5). An important finding in our study was that all soil samples (100 %) had detectable levels of the metabolite DDE. Moreover, the total mean DDT level (∑ DDT and DDE) was approximately 5.50 ± 4.50 μg/kg dw. The mean levels for arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead in soil samples were 7.20 ± 10.7 (range, 15.0 to 265 mg/kg dw), 0.45 ± 0.48 (range, <LOD to 2.50 mg/kg dw), 3.00 ± 3.00 (range, 1.00–13.0 mg/kg dw), and 108 ± 105 (range, 25.0 to 435 mg/kg dw), respectively. This screening study provides us with concentration data for the occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and four heavy metals in soil samples from the city of San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and considering that soil is an important pathway of exposure for people, a biomonitoring program for the surveillance of the general population in the city of San Luis Potosi is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aabsorption 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3aexposure pathways 3agas chromatography 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3ascreening 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3aspectroscopy 3aMexico1 aFlores Ramírez, Rogelio,1 aOchoa-Martinez, Angeles Catalina1 aOrta-Garcia, Sandra Teresa1 aHernández Castro, Berenice,1 aCarrizalez-Yañez, Leticia1 aPérez-Maldonado, Iván N.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Jan., v. 187, no. 1 p.4119-4119dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4119-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010500170520096700275592002801242650002101270650002001291650001401311650001501325650001601340650001101356650001701367650001701384700002601401700002001427700002601447773009401473856008101567852000901648655001201657IND60725040520221120083116.0210124e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072504052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1037282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAckermann, Kathrin10aData on autophagy markers in human macrophages exposed to oxLDL and growth differentiation factor-15  aGrowth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily, identical to MΦ-inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1). GDF-15 is associated with e.g. cardiovascular disease, inflammation and development of atherosclerosis and is highly expressed in macrophages (MΦ) of atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, there exists an indication for the involvement of oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake and autophagic processes by MΦ regarding arteriosclerotic progression. Thus, we were interested to investigate a potential regulatory effect of GDF-15 on autophagy signaling pathway in human MΦ during foam cell formation. Here, we present western blot data of ATG5, ATG12/ATG5-complex and p62 regarding the GDF-15 concentration.

A total of 984 farming households were randomly selected from four districts of KwaZulu-Natal, and data were analysed using the double-hurdle model. The econometric results indicated that use of social grants had a positive impact on the level of fertiliser use, while increasing dependency on social grants had no significant negative impact. The positive influence of social grants on the amount of inorganic fertiliser used suggests that these grants play a significant role in alleviating the liquidity constraints faced by poor farmers. This result is consistent with the presence of credit constraints that limit poor households’ ability to invest in modern farming technologies. To increase technology adoption among the poor, the study recommends that policymakers should address imperfections in the rural credit markets, increase smallholders’ assets in order to increase their risk-bearing capacity and improve the expected profitability of using inorganic fertiliser.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acredit 3aeconometrics 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3agrants 3ahouseholds 3ainnovation adoption 3amarkets 3amineral fertilizers 3amodels 3aprofitability 3aSouth Africa 0asocial grants 0ainorganic fertiliser 0adouble-hurdle model 0asmallholder farming 0aKwaZulu-Natal 0aSouth Africa1 aMudhara, Maxwell1 aEdilegnaw Wale,0 tAgrekon.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 55, no. 4 p.436-457dRoutledgex2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2016.12430633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03717naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245010000175300001800275500001900293500002000312520194200332592002802274650002802302650001402330650001502344650001802359650002502377650001002402650001602412650002002428650001702448650001802465650001902483650001102502650001402513650001502527650002702542650004302569650001402612700001802626700001802644700002302662700001902685700001902704700002102723700001802744700002102762700002202783700006102805700006402866773012702930856007303057852000903130655001203139IND60735463920221122043017.0210426e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073546392DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.231052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadid, Mahdieh Farhoudi Sefidan10aMelatonin increases the anticancer potential of doxorubicin in Caco‐2 colorectal cancer cells  ap. 1061-1069.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aColorectal cancer (CC) is an important human malignancy with high cancer related death worldwide. The chemotherapy using doxorubicin hydrochloride is one of the most common cancer therapeutic methods. However, drug resistance lowers the treatment efficacy in CC patients. The combination therapies seem to be more promising by taking the advantage of synergistic effects. The present study aimed to evaluate a new strategy to enhance the anticancer activity of doxorubicin in Caco‐2 CC cell line by co‐administration of melatonin. The effects of doxorubicin, melatonin, and their combinations (Dox‐Mel) were investigated on the proliferation and viability, morphological alterations, and tumor spheroid formation. Flow cytometry was employed to compare the apoptotic situation of the cells in study groups. Changes in metastatic potential of the cells were assessed by wound healing assay and trans‐well migration assays. Moreover, expression of BAX, SMAC, BCL‐2, SURVIVIN, MMP‐2, and MMP‐9 genes were evaluated by quantitative real time PCR and western blotting. Our study showed that doxorubicin, melatonin, and Dox‐Mel significantly decreased the proliferation and viability, tumor spheroid formation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, the changes were in a concentration and time dependent manner. There was an increase in apoptosis rate in the treatment groups. Expression of genes involved in apoptosis and cell motility were altered significantly. It was observed that anticancer activity of Dox‐Mel combination was significantly more than doxorubicin and melatonin treatments alone. We showed an enhanced apoptotic and anticancer activity of doxorubicin and melatonin combination chemotherapy on CC cell line than doxorubicin or melatonin treatments alone. This combination could promote the treatment efficiency and alleviate the un‐intended side effects by lowering the dose of doxorubicin prescription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acell movement 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adeath 3adoxorubicin 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3aecotoxicology 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3amelatonin 3ametastasis 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviability1 aAghaei, Elnaz1 aTaheri, Elham1 aSeyyedsani, Nasrin1 aChavoshi, Reza1 aAbbasi, Samane1 aKhorrami, Afshin1 aGoleij, Pouya1 aHajazimian, Saba1 aTaefehshokr, Sina1 aIsazadeh, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8781-11771 aShanehbandi, Dariush1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9449-06070 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2021 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.1061-1069dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl57773x1520-40817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.231053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03892naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024002200148040001800170100001400188245010900202300001600311506007600327520178200403592002802185506003702213650001502250650001902265650002002284650001002304650001302314650001002327650002202337650001802359650001502377650002002392650002202412650001302434650004302447650004902490650002302539650006402562650002102626650004402647650004302691650001102734650005402745650002902799650001802828653002602846653000802872653002602880653001802906653003302924700001402957700001902971700001702990700001703007700001403024773010203038856008103140852000903221655001203230IND60088679620221207084929.0161024e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008867962DNAL7 a235841282pmid7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2013.04.0012doi7 aPMC43577912pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lei10aQuantitative Evaluation of Aldo–keto Reductase Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Cell Lines  ap. 230-240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe involvement of aldo–keto reductases (AKRs) in tumorigenesis is widely reported, but their roles in the pathological process are not generally recognized due to inconsistent measurements of their expression. To overcome this problem, we simultaneously employed real-time PCR to examine gene expression and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of mass spectrometry (MS) to examine the protein expression of AKRs in five different hepatic cell lines. These include one relatively normal hepatic cell line, L-02, and four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, HepG2, HuH7, BEL7402 and SMMC7721. The results of real-time PCR showed that expression of genes encoding the AKR1C family members rather than AKR1A and AKR1B was associated with tumor, and most of genes encoding AKRs were highly expressed in HuH7. Similar observations were obtained through MRM. Different from HuH7, the protein abundance of AKR1A and AKR1B was relatively consistent among the other four hepatic cell lines, while protein expression of AKR1C varied significantly compared to L-02. Therefore, we conclude that the abundant distribution of AKR1C proteins is likely to be associated with liver tumorigenesis, and the AKR expression status in HuH7 is completely different from other liver cancer cell lines. This study, for the first time, provided both overall and quantitative information regarding the expression of AKRs at both mRNA and protein levels in hepatic cell lines. Our observations put the previous use of AKRs as a biomarker into question since it is only consistent with our data from HuH7. Furthermore, the data presented herein demonstrated that quantitative evaluation and comparisons within a protein family at both mRNA and protein levels were feasible using current techniques.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3acarcinogenesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatoma 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3amonitoring 3aoxidoreductases 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxanalysisxgenetics. 2aAldehyde Reductase 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularxchemistryxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic 2aHumans 2aLiver Neoplasmsxchemistryxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aTranscriptome 0aAldo–keto reductase 0aHCC 0aQuantitative analysis 0aReal-time PCR 0aMultiple reaction monitoring1 aZhang, Ju1 aZhang, Shenyan1 aDong, Weiwei1 aLou, Xiaomin1 aLiu, Siqi0 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2013 Aug., v. 11 p.230-240dElsevier Ltdx1672-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024002200148040001800170100002300188245010800211300001600319506007600335520149200411592002801903506003701931650001301968650002101981650001402002650001002016650001802026650003302044650002302077650001302100650002202113650003702135650004302172650004102215650003702256650002002293653003802313653001202351653003002363653003202393653003902425653003602464700002702500700002702527700002102554700002402575773010202599856008102701852000902782655001202791IND60088679720221207085056.0161024e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008867972DNAL7 a238965182pmid7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2013.03.0022doi7 aPMC43577872pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Arindam Atanu10aPepBind: A Comprehensive Database and Computational Tool for Analysis of Protein–peptide Interactions  ap. 241-246.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein–peptide interactions, where one partner is a globular protein (domain) and the other is a flexible linear peptide, are key components of cellular processes predominantly in signaling and regulatory networks, hence are prime targets for drug design. To derive the details of the protein–peptide interaction mechanism is often a cumbersome task, though it can be made easier with the availability of specific databases and tools. The Peptide Binding Protein Database (PepBind) is a curated and searchable repository of the structures, sequences and experimental observations of 3100 protein–peptide complexes. The web interface contains a computational tool, protein inter-chain interaction (PICI), for computing several types of weak or strong interactions at the protein–peptide interaction interface and visualizing the identified interactions between residues in Jmol viewer. This initial database release focuses on providing protein–peptide interface information along with structure and sequence information for protein–peptide complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Structures in PepBind are classified based on their cellular activity. More than 40% of the structures in the database are found to be involved in different regulatory pathways and nearly 20% in the immune system. These data indicate the importance of protein–peptide complexes in the regulation of cellular processes.

Low phytic acid (lpa) mutants exhibit decreases in seed InsP₆with corresponding increases in inorganic P which, unlike phytic acid P, is readily utilized by humans and monogastric animals. Since InsP₆may also reduce the bioavailability of essential mineral cations, development of lpa seed crops for animal feeds and whole-grain consumers is of significant interest and requires better understanding of the metabolism of InsP₆and the role it plays in other plant processes. To date, well over 20 lpa mutants have been reported in a number of species, most of which have been identified through forward genetic screens. In this study, we used a publicly available rice Targeting of Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) resource to identify four novel lpa mutations, two in one member of the inositol(1,3,4)P₃5/6-kinase (ITPK) gene family (LOC_Os09g34300) and two in a multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene (LOC_Os03g04920). The mutations in the ITPK gene resulted in significant reductions in InsP₆(46 and 68 %), while those found in MRP gene were more modest (20 and 30 %). Evaluation of these lines indicates that one of the ITPK mutants (46 % InsP₆reduction) and both MRP mutants are similar to wild-type plants in seed weight, germination, and seedling growth. The four mutants identified here represent new resources for the genetic dissection of phytic acid metabolism in rice and the development of germplasm and strategies for breeding lpa rice varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acations 3agenes 3agermination 3agermplasm 3ametabolism 3amutants 3amutation 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3arice 3aseedling growth 3aseeds1 aTai, Thomas H.0 tMolecular breeding.g2014 Dec., v. 34, no. 4 p.1717-1729dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-014-0127-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01530naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245007100156300001800227520051000245592002800755650002300783650001200806650001100818650001500829650001400844650001200858650001500870700002100885700001800906700003000924700001600954773012800970856007301098852000901171655001201180IND60657315420221118133623.0190816e20021104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065731542DNAL7 a10.1039/b208392m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, S.

The poverty trap is a self-reinforcing mechanism in the market in which small variances in initial conditions can result in bimodality into differential economic steady-states resulting in multiple equilibria. Reasons for this include the savings trap, creating locally increasing rates return due to indivisible lumpy capital inputs; the technological trap in which the diminishing marginal rates of technological substitution diminishes productivity growth; the demographic trap in which population growth reduces the capital-labour ratio, increasing consumption and pure time costs; the stochastic returns trap in which producers without access to risk smoothing mechanisms assume greater risks; and the liquidity trap in which present and future capital values exceed current agricultural revenues. The study demonstrates that the failure of land reform and small-scale agriculture assistance programmes is thus a product of market failures, not policies. The analysis indicates that locally increased returns, symptomatic of the savings trap exists with initial average expenditures of smaller firms exceeding the average incomes. The technology trap is also evident with average incomes of small firms is also very low relative to the average capital asset values. The mean productivity of workers in terms of revenue per employee supports the argument for productivity declines in small firms due to the demographic trap. Initial declines in income per ton outputs of smaller firms validate the stochastic returns poverty trap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acapital 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland reform 3amarkets 3apopulation growth 3apoverty 3arisk 3asmall-scale farming0 tAgrekon.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 55, no. 4 p.356-376dRoutledgex2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2016.12437533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245009600205300001800301506007600319520046500395592002800860506003700888650001400925650001500939650001100954650001600965650001400981650002300995650001101018650001101029650001201040650001301052650001701065700002201082700002601104700002201130773010601152856007501258852000901333655001201342IND60578699120221207085444.0170813e20140606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057869912DNAL7 a10.1021/ol50141532doi7 aPMC40514312pmcid7 a248700522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGietter, Amber

A parabolic trough collector (PTC) system seems the best option to produce clean thermal energy at higher temperatures than those that can be achieved from the already widely used flat plate collectors on the island. This paper presents a simulation model built to investigate the performance of the first industrial PTC system in Cyprus, installed at the Cyprus biggest soft drinks factory. The simulation model is built in TRNSYS and is validated using data from the real PTC system installed at the factory. The results show a very good fitting between the operating parameters and the power output of the Solar Field (SF), Concrete Thermal Storage System (CTES), and the Steam Generator (SG). The average percentage relative error of the system's contribution to the process is less than 6.32% for the daily steam production and during a week did not exceed 6.45%. The novelty of this study is the development of a design tool that can be used by potential interested industries to identify the suitable system that fits their needs. All data are provided in the form of graphs and allow anyone to use as input data the thermal energy demand and required steam temperature of the industry to retrieve information about the size of a suitable system which satisfies these requirements depending on each case.

The in-situ intercalation of potassium ions onto the catalyst surface under negative polarization leads to hydrogen activation and an increase in the production rate under all explored conditions, observing a reproducible, controllable and reversible effect. Under ethanol partial oxidation conditions, the ions migration promotes oxidation dehydrogenation route vs. ethanol dehydration one. Moreover, the steam addition is evaluated through different reaction conditions: steam reforming, partial oxidation and autothermal reforming. The steam reforming reaction exhibits the highest initial catalytic activity; although a strong deactivation of the catalyst occurs due to carbonaceous species deposition. Comparing partial oxidation and autothermal reforming, the latter one presents the highest catalytic activity and the strongest electrochemical activation effect. These findings contribute to the Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis phenomenon application to operando tuning the catalyst conversion towards hydrogen production, therefore expanding its application to hydrogen technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aelectrochemistry 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aoxidation 3apotassium 3arenewable energy sources 3asteam 0aElectrochemical promotion 0aEthanol partial oxidation 0aEthanol autothermal reforming 0aEthanol steam reforming1 aRuiz-López, Estela1 aDorado, Fernando1 aBaranova, Elena A.1 ade Lucas-Consuegra, Antonio0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Jan., v. 183 p.515-523dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015800166300001600324520137400340592002801714653001101742653002201753653002501775653002801800653001801828653001601846653001201862700002101874700002201895700002201917773009401939856008002033852000902113655001202122IND60130686920221117222918.0151127e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013068692DNAL7 a10.1525/auk.2011.102312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConklin, Jesse R.10aGeographic Variation in Morphology of Alaska-Breeding Bar-Tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) is Not Maintained on their Nonbreeding Grounds in New Zealand  ap. 363-373.  aAmong scolopacid shorebirds, Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) have unusually high intra- and intersexual differences in size and breeding plumage. Despite historical evidence for population structure among Alaska-breeding Bar-tailed Godwits (L. l. baueri), no thorough analysis, or comparison with the population's nonbreeding distribution, has been undertaken. We used live captures, field photography, museum specimens, and individuals tracked from New Zealand to describe geographic variation in size and plumage within the Alaska breeding range. We found a north-south cline in body size in Alaska, in which the smallest individuals of each sex occurred at the highest latitudes. Extent of male breeding plumage (proportion of nonbreeding contour feathers replaced) also increased with latitude, but female breeding plumage was most extensive at mid-latitudes. This population structure was not maintained in the nonbreeding season: morphometrics of captured birds and timing of migratory departures indicated that individuals from a wide range of breeding latitudes occur in each region and site in New Zealand. Links among morphology, phenology, and breeding location suggest the possibility of distinct Alaska breeding populations that mix freely in the nonbreeding season, and also imply that the strongest selection for size occurs in the breeding season.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlaska 0aBar-tailed Godwit 0ageographic variation 0aLimosa lapponica baueri 0amorphometrics 0aNew Zealand 0aplumage1 aBattley, Phil F.1 aPotter, Murray A.1 aRuthrauff, Dan R.0 tAuk.g2011 Apr., v. 128, no. 2 p.363-373dUniversity of California Pressx1938-42547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fauk.2011.102313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012900171300001400300520162300314592002801937650001201965650001101977650002301988650002802011650001002039650002102049650001102070650002602081650001502107650001102122650001302133650001402146650000902160650000702169650002502176650001702201653003002218653001302248653002202261653001902283653002402302653002402326700002302350700001802373700006202391773009302453856008402546852000902630655001202639IND60560693120221119111609.0190416e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056069312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekirogullari, M.10aProduction of lipid-based fuels and chemicals from microalgae: An integrated experimental and model-based optimization study  ap. 78-87.  aCultivation of microalgae is a promising long-term, sustainable candidate for biomass and oil for the production of fuel, food, nutraceuticals and other added-value products. Attention has been drawn to the use of computational and experimental validation studies aiming at the optimisation and the control of microalgal oil productivity either through the improvement of the growth mechanism or through the application of metabolic engineering methods to microalgae. Optimisation of such a system can be achieved through the evaluation of organic carbon sources, nutrients and water supply, leading to high oil yield. The main objective of this work is to develop a novel integrated experimental and computational approach, utilising a microalgal strain grown at bench-scale, with the aim to systematically identify the conditions that optimise growth and lipid production, in order to ultimately develop a cost-effective process to improve the system economic viability and overall sustainability. To achieve this, a detailed model has been constructed through a multi-parameter quantification methodology taking into account photo-heterotrophic biomass growth. The corresponding growth rate is based on carbon substrate concentration, nitrogen and light availability. The developed model also considers the pH of the medium. Parameter estimation was undertaken using the proposed model in conjunction with an extensive number of experimental data taken at a range of operating conditions. The model was validated and utilised to determine the optimal operating conditions for bench-scale batch lipid oil production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic sustainability 3afuels 3afunctional foods 3alipids 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoils 3apH 3avalue-added products 3awater supply 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 0aBiofuels 0aKinetic modelling 0aMicroalgal oil 0aNitrogen starvation 0aAcetate utilization1 aFragkopoulos, I.S.1 aPittman, J.K.1 aTheodoropoulos, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3249-04220 tAlgal research.g2017 Apr., v. 23 p.78-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013300171520056900304592002800873650001500901650001900916650001600935650000700951650001600958651000900974653001400983653002000997653001101017653003101028653002701059700002001086700002101106700002301127700002501150773009401175856008101269852000901350655001201359IND60725041320221120083139.0210124e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072504132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.1037362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehghani, Mansooreh10aData on the trend of corrosivity and scale formation potential of Shiraz groundwater drinking water resources during 2001–2007  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the corrosivity and scale formation potential of groundwater drinking water resources for the time period of 2001 to 2007 in Shiraz, Iran.

Our objectives were to estimate genetic parameters for teat cup attachment failures (AtF), incomplete milkings (IM), and handling time (HT), and their genetic correlations with box time (BT), udder traits and temperament. Teat coordinates were to measure udder conformation and teat placement. Genetic correlations were estimated between these traits and linear classification traits. Data on Swedish Holstein and Swedish Red cows in 19 AMS herds and 74 herds with conventional milking parlors were analyzed. HT and IM had low heritabilities, but that of AtF was 0.21–0.31. Genetic correlations between AtF and temperament were 0.44–0.71 (calm cows having low AtF). Short BT was weakly genetically associated with shallow udders with short and thin teats. High genetic correlations (0.91–0.98) were found between teat coordinate traits and linear classification traits. Thus, AMS records can be effectively used to select for improved milkability and temperament.  aPublisher supplied data 3amilking parlors 3aherds 3atemperament 3agenetic correlation 3ateats 3aHolstein 3acows 3aheritability 3amilking 3audders 0aMilking speed 0arecords 0audder and teat conformation1 aStrandberg, E.1 aPettersson, G.1 aJohansson, K.1 aStålhammar, H.1 aPhilipsson, J.0 tActa agriculturæ Scandinavica.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 66, no. 2 p.75-83dTaylor & Francisx1651-19727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064702.2016.12601533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008600166300001600252520104600268592002801314650001601342650003001358650001501388650001001403650002401413650001001437650001801447650001101465650001201476650002001488650001301508650001901521650001101540653001101551653003301562653003001595653002501625653002301650653003001673700001501703700001301718700001901731773009501750856008401845852000901929655001201938IND60560693320221119111546.0190416e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056069332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Xiaowen10aInvolvement of Chlamydomonas DNA damage tolerence gene UBC2 in lipid accumulation  ap. 148-159.  aThe Lys-63–linked polyubiquitination of target proteins is considered a fundamentally different process from conventional Lys-48–linked polyubiquitination. This process is deemed analogous to other post-translational regulatory processes, such as phosphorylation and sumoylation, which alter target protein activities and are reported to be involved in several cellular processes. In this study, we report that CrUBC2, a yeast and Arabidopsis MMS2/UEV homolog gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is able to functionally rescue yeast mms2 mutant, leading to increased DNA damage tolerance. The overexpression of the CrUBC2 improves the algal ability to tolerate DNA damage, while silencing CrUBC2 sensitizes cells to DNA damage, indicating that CrUBC2 is involved in DNA-damage response in Chlamydomonas. Moreover, the overexpression of CrUBC2 increases algal cell lipid, while the silencing of CrUBC2 gene decreases lipid content, implying that a protein substrate of CrUBC13–CrUBC2 polyubiquitination is involved in lipid accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aDNA damage 3aalgae 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3alipid content 3alipids 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3aproteins 3aubiquitination 3ayeasts 0aCrUBC2 0aUbiquitin conjugating enzyme 0aLys-63 polyubiquitination 0aDNA damage tolerance 0aLipid accumulation 0aChlamydomonas reinhardtii1 aLi, Xinhan1 aLi, Ping1 aDeng, Xiaodong0 tAlgal research.g2017 Mar., v. 22 p.148-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245010600213520107100319592002801390653001201418653001201430653001901442653002101461653001801482700002701500700002801527700005601555773010601611856008801717852000901805655001201814IND60662821220221117110332.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066282122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurtado, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9123-129810aBody feather mercury and arsenic concentrations in five species of seabirds from the Falkland Islands  aSeveral pollutants, including heavy metals, magnify along the food chain, and top predators such as seabirds can be used to monitor their trends in the marine environment. We studied mercury and arsenic contamination in body feathers in penguins, petrels and cormorants in three islands of the Falklands Islands. There were significant differences among species and sites in the concentration of trace elements in feathers. Black-browed albatrosses and gentoo penguins had consistently high mercury concentrations on New Island, while Rockhopper penguins and imperial shags presented considerably higher concentrations at Beauchene Island. Mercury levels in black-browed albatrosses increased since 1986 on one of the islands, probably reflecting world-wide emission trends. Rockhopper penguins exhibited high arsenic levels, but levels were less variable among species, and were not correlated with mercury levels, suggesting low biomagnification. These results provide a reference line for bioindication studies using feathers from species on the Falkland Islands.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMercury 0aArsenic 0aSouthern Ocean 0aPatagonian Shelf 0aTrophic level1 aPereira, Maria Eduarda1 aGranadeiro, José Pedro1 aCatry, Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3000-05220 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Dec., v. 149 p.110574-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013700164500002000301520144900321592002801770596008101798596008101879596007501960650001602035650002802051650001402079650001802093650001902111650003602130650002002166650001702186650003002203650001502233650002602248650002202274650001802296650001602314650000902330650001302339650001402352650001802366650001702384650003202401650003702433700001602470700001902486700002002505700002802525700001902553700006102572773014002633856007802773852000902851655001202860IND60674062720221123000539.0191023e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067406272DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2019005142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoh, Yen‐Chun10aPrevention of Vascular Inflammation by Pterostilbene via Trimethylamine‐N‐Oxide Reduction and Mechanism of Microbiota Regulation  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: A gut‐microbiota‐dependent metabolite of L‐carnitine, trimethylamine‐N‐oxide (TMAO), has been recently discovered as an independent and dose‐dependent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aims to investigate the effects of pterostilbene on reducing TMAO formation and on decreasing vascular inflammation in carnitine‐feeding mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice are treated with 1.3% carnitine in drinking water with or without pterostilbene supplementation. Using LC‐MS/MS, the result shows that mice treated with 1.3% carnitine only significantly increased the plasma TMAO and pterostilbene supplementation group can reverse it. Additionally, pterostilbene decreases hepatic flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) mRNA levels compared to carnitine only group. It appears that pterostilbene can alter host physiology and create an intestinal microenvironment favorable for certain gut microbiota. Gut microbiota analysis reveals that pterostilbene increases the abundance of Bacteroides. Further, pterostilbene decreases mRNA levels of vascular inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM‐1), and E‐selectin). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that amelioration of carnitine‐induced vascular inflammation after consumption of pterostilbene is partially mediated via modulation of gut microbiota composition and hepatic enzyme FMO3 gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data  a105‐2320‐B‐002‐031‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan  a105‐2628‐B‐002‐003‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan  a107‐2321‐B‐002‐050cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3aBacteroides 3acardiovascular diseases 3acarnitine 3adose response 3adrinking water 3aflavin-containing monooxygenase 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3amice 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apterostilbene 3arisk factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular cell adhesion molecules1 aLi, Shiming1 aChen, Pei‐Yu1 aWu, Jia‐Ching1 aKalyanam, Nagabhushanam1 aHo, Chi‐Tang1 aPan, Min‐Hsiung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5188-70300 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Oct., v. 63, no. 20 p.e1900514-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019005143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010800169520136500277592002801642650002201670650001101692650001501703650002001718650001301738650001501751653001201766653001101778653001201789653002501801653001701826653002701843700001601870700001501886700001801901700001501919773012301934856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60662821320221117105844.0190906e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066282132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1093452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevendal, T.C.10aOrdovician carbonate mud mounds of the Baltoscandian Basin in time and space – A geophysical approach  aCarbonate mud mounds developed within the Baltoscandian Basin, an epicratonic basin on the Baltica palaeocontinent, during the Ordovician. In the Upper Ordovician succession of the Baltoscandian Basin, a large number of mud mounds are present at three stratigraphic levels namely, the Kullsbergs mounds (late Sandbian-early Katian), Nabala and Rakvere mounds (middle Katian), and the Boda mounds (late Katian). These formed in a subtropical-tropical carbonate platform environment, covered by a shallow epicontinental sea. The mud mounds at these stratigraphic levels beneath and around Gotland have been characterized using a comprehensive seismic and well dataset acquired during a period of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation which began more than 30 years ago. Interpretation of the largely unpublished seismic data in this study provides details on the distribution of mound complexes in the basin and constraints on the geometry of the mounds. Detailed structure contour maps of the top and the base of the Ordovician succession beneath Gotland based on the seismic interpretation are presented. The results give a comprehensive characterization of carbonate mud mound generation on Gotland which may help in understanding the distribution patterns of similar mound complexes in other parts of the Ordovician world formed in similar environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrdovician period 3abasins 3acarbonates 3adata collection 3ageometry 3ageophysics 0aBaltica 0aSweden 0aGotland 0aCarbonate mud mounds 0aOPAB dataset 0aSeismic interpretation1 aLehnert, O.1 aSopher, D.1 aErlström, M.1 aJuhlin, C.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 535dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1093453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009100155300002000246520094000266592002801206650001401234650001301248650001801261650003101279650001801310650001101328650001201339650002201351700001601373700001901389700001201408773012501420856007401545852000901619655001201628IND60666743920221123021932.0190919e20140930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066674392DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06705c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lizhu14aThe preparation of a three-layer “core–shell” structured epoxy-acrylate emulsion  ap. 47184-47190.  a“Core–shell” structured epoxy-acrylate emulsions with different contents of epoxy resins were synthesized. Styrene (St), butyl acrylic (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and epoxy resin (E-51) were used as the main raw materials. The fine control of the epoxy content was the key approach to design the morphologies of the emulsion. Due to the different epoxy contents, there was a transition of the particle morphologies from irregular structure, to two-layer core–shell structure to three-layer core–shell structure. The particle size became larger and then smaller again, and the thermal stability of the emulsion decreased with the increase of the epoxy content. The emulsion with clear three-layer “core–shell” structures and uniform particle size distribution could be prepared when the content of epoxy resin was 30 wt%. The corresponding film prepared by the emulsion had the characteristic of self-stratification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsions 3aepoxides 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3araw materials 3aresins 3astyrene 3athermal stability1 aLi, Jinfeng1 aZhang, Xiaorui1 aJin, Ke0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 30, v. 4, no. 88 p.47184-47190dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06705c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006800169300001800237520088600255592002801141650000801169650001801177650002501195650002001220650002901240650002901269650002101298650001701319650001701336650001501353653003001368653001501398653001901413653002501432700002001457773011901477856008501596852000901681655001201690IND60550789920221120075552.0161210e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055078992DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2016.11832062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fu-Kwun10aEvaluating the efficiency of green vehicles and diesel vehicles  ap. 1163-1174.  aOne of the major interests of governments in the area of environmental protection is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants’ emissions (HC, CO, NO ₓ, PM, and SO ₓ) from vehicles.

The results show that the efficiency of each type of vehicle hardly differed in 2008 and 2009, but the gap between green and diesel vehicles became significant in 2010–2012. The results also indicate that larger automotive companies and smaller green vehicles show higher efficiency in recent years, whereas the type of green vehicles and the origin of automotive companies are not significantly related to the efficiency score of green vehicles. These findings provide more information for understanding differences in green vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon monoxide 3aenvironmental protection 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrocarbons 3anitric oxide 3apollutants 0aData envelopment analysis 0aefficiency 0agreen vehicles 0atruncated regression1 aSaitō, Masaya,0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 13, no. 11 p.1163-1174dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2016.11832063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01631naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012700167300001600294520059700310592002800907650001400935650001600949650001800965653003000983653001801013653003101031700002301062700002701085773011101112856008501223852000901308655001201317IND60479827920221119063310.0160123e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047982792DNAL7 a10.1556/CRC.34.2006.2-3.2282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozak, Marcin13aAn approach to analyzing a response variable as affected by its additive components: Example for spring barley grain yield  ap. 981-988.  aA problem of decomposing a response variable into a sum of other variables (so-called additive components) is presented in the paper.

In order to achieve the correlation, fifty-one honey samples, of different botanical origins (acacia, polyfloral, sunflower, honeydew, and tilia), were investigated. The honey samples were analysed from physicochemical (moisture content, fructose, glucose and sucrose content) and rheological point of view (dynamic viscosity—loss modulus G″, elastic modulus G′, complex viscosity η*, shear storage compliance—J′ and shear loss compliance J″). The rheological properties were predicted using the Artificial Neural Networks based on moisture content, glucose, fructose and sucrose. The models which predict better the rheological parameters in function of fructose, glucose, sucrose and moisture content are: MLP-1 hidden layer is predicting the G″, η* and J″, respectively, MLP-2 hidden layers the J′, while MLP-3 hidden layers the G′, respectively. The physicochemical and rheological parameters were submitted to statistical analysis as follows: Principal component analysis (PCA), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Artificial neural network (ANN) in order to evaluate the usefulness of the parameters studied for honey authentication. The LDA was found the suitable method for honey botanical authentication, reaching a correct cross validation of 94.12% of the samples.  aPublisher supplied data  aCNFIS-FDI-2018-058cNational Council for Higher Education Funding, CNFIS,0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcacia 3aHelianthus annuus 3aTilia 3acompliance 3adiscriminant analysis 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahoney 3ahoneydew 3amodulus of elasticity 3aneural networks 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asucrose 3aviscosity 3awater content1 aRopciuc, Sorina1 aPaduret, Sergiu0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.4711-4718dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-018-3415-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100009100150245019000241500002200431520165000453592002802103650001302131650002002144650001102164650002002175650001502195650001102210651001002221653001802231653002602249653002302275653002302298653001702321700001802338773011702356856008502473852000902558655001202567IND60662821520221117110325.0190906e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066282152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1093612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Can1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9785-3637 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9785-363710aCarbonate carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and U-Pb zircon geochronology of the Liuchapo Formation in South China: Constraints on the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in deep-water sequences  aPre-press version  aThe Ediacaran-Cambrian transition was one of the most significant intervals in geological history, witnessing the origin of the metazoans and major environmental changes. Establishing a precise chronostratigraphic framework for the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition has great significance for understanding the geological and evolutionary processes during this transition. An integrated study on carbonate carbon isotopes and U-Pb zircon dating was conducted within the Liuchapo Formation in the Sifangjing section in northeastern Guizhou Province, South China to recognize the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in slope facies of the Yangtze Block. A substantial negative carbonate carbon isotope excursion was recognized within the lower part of the Liuchapo Formation. Moreover, a weighted-mean U-Pb zircon age of 540.7 ± 3.8 (±6.6) Ma was obtained from a tuffaceous interlayer approximately 2 m above the interval of the negative carbon isotope excursion. The carbon isotope and age-dating results indicate that the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary within the Sifangjing section should be placed in the lower part of the Liuchapo Formation. Additionally, in the Sifangjing section, a distribution of Horodyskia minor extends up to the basal Cambrian, while the last appearance datum (LAD) of Palaeopascichnus jiumenensis correlates to the large negative carbon isotope excursion within the Liuchapo Formation. This relationship indicates that the LAD of the Palaeopascichnus jiumenensis is a potential tool for the stratigraphic correlation of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary successions in slope and deep-water basin settings of the Yangtze Block.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aCambrian period 3abasins 3acarbon isotopes 3acarbonates 3azircon 3aChina 0aYangtze Block 0aTuffaceous interlayer 0aSifangjing section 0aDengying Formation 0aSlope facies1 aFeng, Qinglai0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Aug. 30, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1093613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245009100198300002000289506007600309520085100385592002801236506003701264650002101301650001801322650001101340650001701351650001901368650002101387650001401408650001501422700001801437700002601455700002101481700002601502700002501528700002001553773017501573856008301748852000901831655001201840IND4481625220221207132809.0120502e20111108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448162522DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11127581082doi7 aPMC32150082pmcid7 a220428492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Li10aLong-term RNA interference gene therapy in a dominant retinitis pigmentosa mouse model  ap. 18476-18481.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing is a potential therapeutic strategy for dominant retinal degeneration disorders. We used self-complementary (sc) AAV2/8 vector to develop an RNAi-based gene therapy in a dominant retinal degeneration mouse model expressing bovine GCAP1(Y99C). We established an in vitro shRNA screening assay based on EGFP-tagged bovine GCAP1, and identified a shRNA that effectively silenced the bovine GCAP1 transgene with ∼80% efficiency. Subretinal injection of scAAV2/8 carrying shRNA expression cassette showed robust expression as early as 1 wk after injection. The gene silencing significantly improved photoreceptor survival, delayed disease onset, and increased visual function. Our results provide a promising strategy toward effective RNAi-based gene therapy by scAAV2/8 delivery for dominant retinal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aanimal models 3acattle 3agene therapy 3aphotoreceptors 3aretinal diseases 3ascreening 3atransgenes1 aZhang, Houbin1 aDizhoor, Alexander M.1 aBoye, Shannon E.1 aHauswirth, William W.1 aFrederick, Jeanne M.1 aBaehr, Wolfgang0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Nov. 8, v. 108, no. 45 p.18476-18481dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11127581083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245011800154520138000272592002801652650001401680650002001694650002201714650002301736650001101759650001501770650001201785650002901797650001901826650002101845650001801866650001501884700001901899700001701918700001901935700002201954700002001976773011801996856007202114852000902186655001202195IND60653147720221119065532.0190714e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065314772DNAL7 a10.3390/w80702922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Jichul10aDevelopment of Field Pollutant Load Estimation Module and Linkage of QUAL2E with Watershed-Scale L-THIA ACN Model  aThe Long Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA) model was previously improved by incorporating direct runoff lag time and baseflow. However, the improved model, called the L-THIA asymptotic curve number (ACN) model cannot simulate pollutant loads from a watershed or instream water quality. In this study, a module for calculating pollutant loads from fields and through stream networks was developed, and the L-THIA ACN model was combined with the QUAL2E model (The enhanced stream water quality model) to predict instream water quality at a watershed scale. The new model (L-THIA ACN-WQ) was applied to two watersheds within the Korean total maximum daily loads management system. To evaluate the model, simulated results of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were compared with observed water quality data collected at eight-day intervals. Between simulated and observed data for TN pollutant loads in Dalcheon A watershed, the R2 and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were 0.81 and 0.79, respectively, and those for TP were 0.79 and 0.78, respectively. In the Pyungchang A watershed, the R2 and NSE were 0.66 and 0.64, respectively, for TN and both statistics were 0.66 for TP, indicating that model performed satisfactorily for both watersheds. Thus, the L-THIA ACN-WQ model can accurately simulate streamflow, instream pollutant loads, and water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3adata collection 3ahydrologic models 3amanagement systems 3arunoff 3astatistics 3astreams 3atotal maximum daily load 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3awatersheds1 aJang, Won Seok1 aKim, Jonggun1 aJung, Younghun1 aEngel, Bernard A.1 aLim, Kyoung Jae0 tWater.g2016 July 15, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w80702923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300001800270520111200288592002801400650001501428650002201443650001501465650001201480650001201492650001401504650001201518650001501530650001301545700001201558700001701570700001201587773014201599856007401741852000901815655001201824IND60641748020221120211803.0190506e20160329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064174802DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta00343e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lijin12aA mercapto functionalized magnetic Zr-MOF by solvent-assisted ligand exchange for Hg²⁺ removal from water  ap. 5159-5166.  aA facile preparation of magnetic MOF composites with flexible mercapto group pendants in their pores is realized through solvent-assisted ligand exchange (SALE) under mild conditions in water, and terephthalate in UIO-66 is replaced with mercaptoacetic acid (MAA). After the SALE processing, the crystallinity, porosity, and superparamagnetism of the mercapto functionalized magnetic Zr-MOF (MFC-S) are well maintained, and the obtained MFC-S exhibits a higher adsorption capacity (282 mg g⁻¹) for Hg²⁺ than that of the magnetic Zr-MOF (MFC-O). Furthermore, the prepared MFC-S can be regenerated easily by liquid desorption after adsorption of metal ions and be reused more than 5 times without obvious decrease in removal performance. The proposed SALE method for the preparation of mercapto functionalized magnetic MOF composites (MFCs) is easy-to-operate and low cost, providing not only a reliable porous MFC platform for the removal of metal ions, but also a simple and efficient synthesis route for the preparation of functionalized MFCs which cannot be achieved through conventional approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acrystal structure 3adesorption 3aligands 3aliquids 3amagnetism 3amercury 3ametal ions 3aporosity1 aHe, Man1 aChen, Beibei1 aHu, Bin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Mar. 29, v. 4, no. 14 p.5159-5166dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta00343e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05666naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245008100205300001200286520377600298592002804074650001804102650002704120650001004147650000904157650001204166650002004178650001104198650001304209650001804222650001104240650001504251650001004266650001004276650002004286650003304306650001904339650001304358650001404371650003104385650001304416650001404429650001604443650001304459650002204472650001304494650002204507650002404529650001704553650001304570650001204583650001004595650001004605650001204615650001404627650001204641651001004653700001604663700005104679700005304730773010504783856008304888852000904971655001204980IND60627009920221119021351.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062700992DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-18-1048-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, J.

Macadamia nut contributes an estimated 30,000 metric tons of kernel to the international tree nut trade production (https://www.nutfruit.org/), and its production is increasing worldwide. In 2016, husk rot symptoms were observed in macadamia tree in Guangxi Province, China. Husk rot symptoms are characteristically diffuse soft and spongy black lesions up to 10 mm in diameter clearly discrete on the green fruit pericarp (Akinsanmi et al. 2017). Then cracking occurs, resulting in fruit drop, seriously affecting the yield of macadamia nut. The rotten fruits were surface sterilized in sodium hypochlorite (1% for 3 to 4 min) followed by washing with sterile distilled water. After surface drying, small pieces (3 to 4 mm) from the infected tissue were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) modified with 0.015% streptomycin sulfate and incubated at 25°C. Colonies developed from the symptomatic tissues after 3 days of incubation. The mycelium was initially white, later converting into dark gray. Based on colony morphology, isolates were tentatively identified as a member of the Botryosphaeriaceae family. Pycnidia were produced on sterilized pine needles on 2% water agar after 5 weeks of incubation at 25°C under continuous near-ultraviolet light. Conidia were ellipsoidal, initially hyaline, unicellular, becoming dark brown, and developing a thick wall, a central septum, and longitudinal striations with age. Conidia measured 25 to 30.5 μm long and 12.5 to 16.5 μm wide. On the basis of morphological characteristics, the fungus was identified as Lasiodiplodia sp., a member of the family Botryosphaeriaceae (Phillips et al. 2013). For further identification, primers ITS1/ITS2, Bt2a/Bt2b, and EF1-688F/EF1-1251R were used to amplify and subsequently sequence the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and parts of the β-tubulin (BT) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-α) gene regions, respectively. BLAST results revealed 99.79% homology with Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae for ITS KF234559, 99.52% for BT EU673111, and 99.58% for TEF1-α KF226722. The sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MH487656, MH487654, and MH487655). The combined phylogenetic analyses (TEF1-α, ITS, and BT) showed that the sequence of the tested strain and the corresponding sequence of L. pseudotheobromae (CBS116459, COAD1785, and CMM3887) in GenBank are located on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree. Based on morphological characters, DNA sequencing, and the phylogenetic tree, the husk rot isolates from macadamia nut (GXJG4.5) were then identified as L. pseudotheobromae (Alves et al. 2008). For the confirmation of Koch’s postulates, pathogenicity tests of isolate GXJG4.5 were conducted twice using a wound inoculation technique. Twelve surface-disinfected freshly wounded fruits (Macadamia integrifolia) and leaves per isolate were inoculated by placing 5-mm² mycelium plugs taken from the margins of a 7-day-old culture. The same number of control fruits and leaves were inoculated with sterile PDA plugs, and wounds of all fruits and leaves were sealed with wet degreasing cotton. Fruits and leaves were maintained at 25°C in growth chamber (at 95% relative humidity) for 5 to 7 days under humid conditions. Symptom development followed by reisolation and reidentification of the pathogen on the basis of morphology and resequencing confirmed the pathogenicity of the fungus, whereas no symptoms were observed on control fruits and leaves. This study shows L. pseudotheobromae to be highly virulent on macadamia nut, and to our knowledge this is the first report of L. pseudotheobromae on this host in the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasiodiplodia 3aMacadamia integrifolia 3aPinus 3aagar 3aconidia 3aconifer needles 3acotton 3acracking 3aculture media 3adrying 3afruit drop 3afungi 3agenes 3agrowth chambers 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amacadamia nuts 3amycelium 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3apericarp 3aphylogeny 3aplantations 3apycnidia 3arelative humidity 3aseed rot 3asequence analysis 3asodium hypochlorite 3astreptomycin 3asulfates 3atissues 3atrade 3atrees 3atubulin 3avirulence 3awashing 3aChina1 aZhan, R.

The genotypes of the tetraploid species did not differ significantly among themselves in the volume density of the analysed tissues of the flag leaf. Among the hexaploid species, the results showed highly significant differences in volume density of the photosynthetic tissue and volume density of the mechanical tissue; and significant differences for the volume density of the vascular tissue. The analysis of the main vein of the flag leaf showed smaller volumes of the vascular tissue in hexaploid species — of the phloem and parenchyma of the main vein. The analysed species showed the greatest difference in the volume of the main vein, the parenchyma of the main vein and the mechanical tissue. When compared to the volume and volume density of the xylem of the main vein, the tetraploid species had greater volumes and volume densities of the mechanical tissue of the main vein. With hexaploid species the results were reverse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum 3adurum wheat 3agenotype 3ahexaploidy 3aleaves 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3atetraploidy 3axylem 0awheat 0aflag leaf 0astereology0 tCereal research communications.g2006 June 1, v. 34, no. 2-3 p.1005-1012dAkadémiai Kiadóx0133-37207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FCRC.34.2006.2-3.2313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04727naa a2201273 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001600189245008000205300001600285506007600301520143200377592002801809506003701837650000801874650001601882650002401898650002501922650001701947650001901964650001601983650002001999650001602019650001002035650000902045650001902054650001602073650001602089650001402105650001502119650001802134650004702152650003702199650001202236650005202248650003102300650002302331650002802354650002002382650002802402650002802430650001902458650004802477650000902525650000902534650002102543650002802564650003002592650004002622650002502662650004002687653001002727653000802737653000902745653001002754653000902764653000902773653000902782653000802791653001002799653001002809653001102819653000902830653001002839653001102849653000802860653000802868653001002876653001102886653000802897653001402905653001202919653000902931653000802940653000902948653000902957653000702966653001002973653001002983653000702993653000903000653001003009653001003019653001403029653001203043653001503055653002003070653000903090700001803099700001703117700001703134700001803151700001503169700002003184700001203204700001303216700001303229700001703242700001703259773007403276856008203350852000903432655001203441IND60099021320221207045158.0161021e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009902132DNAL7 aPMC35145792pmcid7 a231237292pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Shibing10aADAR1 ablation decreases bone mass by impairing osteoblast function in mice  ap. 101-110.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBone mass is controlled through a delicate balance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. We show here that RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is critical for proper control of bone mass. Postnatal conditional knockout of Adar1 (the gene encoding ADAR1) resulted in a severe osteopenic phenotype. Ablation of the Adar1 gene significantly suppressed osteoblast differentiation without affecting osteoclast differentiation in bone. In vitro deletion of the Adar1 gene decreased expression of osteoblast-specific osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization, suggesting a direct intrinsic role of ADAR1 in osteoblasts. ADAR1 regulates osteoblast differentiation by, at least in part, modulation of osterix expression, which is essential for bone formation. Further, ablation of the Adar1 gene decreased the proliferation and survival of bone marrow stromal cells and inhibited the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards osteoblast lineage. Finally, shRNA knockdown of the Adar1 gene in MC-4 pre-osteoblasts reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin A1 expression and cell growth. Our results identify ADAR1 as a new key regulator of bone mass and suggest that ADAR1 functions in this process mainly through modulation of the intrinsic properties of osteoblasts (i.e., proliferation, survival and differentiation).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aRNA editing 3aadenosine deaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3abone resorption 3acell growth 3agenes 3amice 3amineralization 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aphenotype 3astem cells 3astromal cells 2aAdenosine Deaminasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBone Diseases, Metabolicxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCell Proliferation 2aCell Survivalxgenetics 2aCells, Cultured 2aCyclin A1xbiosynthesis 2aCyclin D1xbiosynthesis 2aGene Silencing 2aIntegrin-Binding Sialoproteinxbiosynthesis 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aOsteoblastsxmetabolism 2aOsteocalcinxbiosynthesis 2aOsteogenesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aTranscription Factorsxbiosynthesis 0aADAR1 0aAlp 0aAMPA 0aANOVA 0aATF4 0aBMSC 0aBrdU 0aBsp 0aCat K 0aCFU-F 0aCFU-OB 0aμCT 0aGapdh 0aGluR-B 0aIHC 0aMSC 0aMmp-9 0aNfatc1 0aOcn 0aOc.Nb/BPm 0aOc.S/BS 0a4OHT 0aOsx 0aqPCR 0aRank 0aRT 0aRunx2 0ashRNA 0aTM 0aTRAP 0aTUNEL 0aADAR1 0aCyclin D1 0aOsterix 0aOsteoblast 0aDifferentiation 0aBone1 aSharma, Rohit1 aNie, Daibang1 aJiao, Hongli1 aIm, Hee-Jeong1 aLai, Yumei1 aZhao, Zhongfang1 aZhu, Ke1 aFan, Jie1 aChen, Di1 aWang, Qingde1 aXiao, Guozhi0 tGene.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 513 p.101-110dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014000162300001600302520121700318592002801535650001601563650001601579650001801595650001601613650001301629650002201642650001301664650001301677650001701690650004201707650001101749650002601760650002101786650002501807650001401832650001401846650001801860650001801878650001501896700001201911700001501923700001301938773013001951856008102081852000902162655001202171IND60518218220221118192404.0160409e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051821822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-016-0830-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yiwen10aChanges of microbial composition during wastewater reclamation and distribution systems revealed by high-throughput sequencing analyses  ap. 539-547.  aThis study employed 454-pyrosequencing to investigate microbial and pathogenic communities in two wastewater reclamation and distribution systems. A total of 11972 effective 16S rRNA sequences were acquired from these two reclamation systems, and then designated to relevant taxonomic ranks by using RDP classifier. The Chao index and Shannon diversity index showed that the diversities of microbial communities decreased along wastewater reclamation processes. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in reclaimed water after disinfection, which accounted for 83% and 88% in two systems, respectively. Human opportunistic pathogens, including Clostridium, Escherichia, Shigella, Pseudomonas and Mycobacterium, were selected and enriched by disinfection processes. The total chlorine and nutrients (TOC, NH₃-N and NO₃-N) significantly affected the microbial and pathogenic communities during reclaimed water storage and distribution processes. Our results indicated that the disinfectant-resistant pathogens should be controlled in reclaimed water, since the increases in relative abundances of pathogenic bacteria after disinfection implicate the potential public health associated with reclaimed water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia 3aMycobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aShigella 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacteria 3achlorine 3adisinfection 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3amicrobial communities 3anitrate nitrogen 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrients 3apathogens 3apublic health 3aribosomal RNA 3awastewater1 aLi, Dan1 aZeng, Siyu1 aHe, Miao0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2016 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.539-547dHigher Education Pressx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-016-0830-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011000164300001800274520092400292592002801216650004401244650001401288650002101302650001701323650001501340650001801355650004401373650001301417650001601430700001401446700001801460700002001478700003201498700002401530700002701554700001901581700001601600773014101616856007401757852000901831655001201840IND60641748220221120211820.0190506e20160517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064174822DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta00368k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Azhar Hussain10aEnhancement of ‘dry’ proton conductivity by self-assembled nanochannels in all-solid polyelectrolytes  ap. 7615-7623.  aProton transport has been recognized as an essential process in many biological systems, as well as electrochemical devices including fuel cells and redox flow batteries. In the present study, we address the pressing need for solvent-free proton conducting polymer electrolytes for high-temperature PEM fuel cell applications by developing a novel all-solid polyelectrolyte membrane with a self-assembled proton-channel structure. We show that this self-assembled nanostructure endows the material with exciting ‘dry’ proton conductivity at elevated temperatures, as high as 0.3 mS cm⁻¹ at 120 °C, making it an attractive candidate for high-temperature PEM fuel cell applications. Based on the combined investigation of solid-state NMR, FTIR and conductivity measurements, we propose that both molecular design and nano-scale structures are essential for obtaining highly conductive anhydrous proton conductors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3ananomaterials 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aLi, Jiaye1 aYang, Hengrui1 aRana, Usman Ali1 aRanganathan, Vijayaraghavan1 aSiddigi, Humaira M.1 aMacFarlane, Douglas R.1 aForsyth, Maria1 aZhu, Haijin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 May 17, v. 4, no. 20 p.7615-7623dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta00368k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017700166300001600343520170400359592002802063650002202091650001602113650001202129650001502141650001102156650001302167650003602180650002402216650003302240650001302273650001302286650001402299650000902313650002102322653003602343653001702379653001902396653001502415653002102430653000902451700001602460700001302476700002702489700001702516700001902533700001902552773011602571856008702687852000902774655001202783IND60569445520221123022750.0170529e20160304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056944552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b008052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Dongli10aGlobal Proteome Analyses of Lysine Acetylation and Succinylation Reveal the Widespread Involvement of both Modification in Metabolism in the Embryo of Germinating Rice Seed  ap. 879-890.  aRegulation of rice seed germination has been shown to mainly occur at post-transcriptional levels, of which the changes on proteome status is a major one. Lysine acetylation and succinylation are two prevalent protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) involved in multiple biological processes, especially for metabolism regulation. To investigate the potential mechanism controlling metabolism regulation in rice seed germination, we performed the lysine acetylation and succinylation analyses simultaneously. Using high-accuracy nano-LC–MS/MS in combination with the enrichment of lysine acetylated or succinylated peptides from digested embryonic proteins of 24 h after imbibition (HAI) rice seed, a total of 699 acetylated sites from 389 proteins and 665 succinylated sites from 261 proteins were identified. Among these modified lysine sites, 133 sites on 78 proteins were commonly modified by two PTMs. The overlapped PTM sites were more likely to be in polar acidic/basic amino acid regions and exposed on the protein surface. Both of the acetylated and succinylated proteins cover nearly all aspects of cellular functions. Ribosome complex and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis-related proteins were significantly enriched in both acetylated and succinylated protein profiles through KEGG enrichment and protein–protein interaction network analyses. The acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA metabolism-related enzymes were found to be extensively modified by both modifications, implying the functional interaction between the two PTMs. This study provides a rich resource to examine the modulation of the two PTMs on the metabolism pathway and other biological processes in germinating rice seed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aacetylation 3aenzymes 3aimbibition 3alysine 3apeptides 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein composition 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aribosomes 3arice 3aseed germination 0apost-translational modification 0aacetyllysine 0asuccinyllysine 0ametabolism 0aseed germination 0arice1 aWang, Qiong1 aLi, Ming1 aDamaris, Rebecca Njeri1 aYi, Xingling1 aCheng, Zhongyi1 aYang, Pingfang0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2016 Mar. 04, v. 15, no. 3 p.879-890dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b008053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300002000280520162600300592002801926650000801954650001801962650002801980650001902008650001002027650001502037650002002052650001602072650001102088650001802099650002602117650001702143650001502160650001502175650001002190700002202200700002202222700002002244700001902264700002302283773014902306856008102455852000902536655001202545IND60522936920221120175956.0170724e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052293692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6424-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafa, Ehab10aPhysical properties of particulate matter from animal houses—empirical studies to improve emission modelling  ap. 12253-12263.  aMaintaining and preserving the environment from pollutants are of utmost importance. Particulate matter (PM) is considered one of the main air pollutants. In addition to the harmful effects of PM in the environment, it has also a negative indoor impact on human and animal health. The specific forms of damage of particulate emission from livestock buildings depend on its physical properties. The physical properties of particulates from livestock facilities are largely unknown. Most studies assume the livestock particles to be spherical with a constant density which can result in biased estimations, leading to inaccurate results and errors in the calculation of particle mass concentration in livestock buildings. The physical properties of PM, including difference in density as a function of particle size and shape, can have a significant impact on the predictions of particles’ behaviour. The aim of this research was to characterize the physical properties of PM from different animal houses and consequently determine PM mass concentration. The mean densities of collected PM from laying hens, dairy cows and pig barns were 1450, 1520 and 2030 kg m⁻³, respectively, whilst the mass factors were 2.17 × 10⁻³, 2.18 × 10⁻³ and 5.36 × 10⁻³ μm, respectively. The highest mass concentration was observed in pig barns generally followed by laying hen barns, and the lowest concentration was in dairy cow buildings. Results are presented in such a way that they can be used in subsequent research for simulation purposes and to form the basis for a data set of PM physical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aanimal and human health 3aanimal housing 3abarns 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3alaying hens 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aprediction 3aswine1 aNannen, Christoph1 aHenseler, Jessica1 aDiekmann, Bernd1 aGates, Richard1 aBuescher, Wolfgang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 12 p.12253-12263dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6424-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008600165300001400251520166900265592002801934650001101962650001101973650000901984650001301993650000802006650001802014650001102032650003302043650001302076650002302089650002202112650001102134650001102145650001202156650001602168650002602184651001002210700002102220700001502241773010502256856004802361852000902409655001202418IND4465359520221120184915.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446535952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-011-9812-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordaan, Adrian10aLinkages among physical and biological properties in tidepools on the Maine Coast  ap. 13-23.  aTidepools experience significant gradients in ecologically relevant physical variables along the transition from ocean to terrestrial habitat (vertical axis) and from open coast to inner bays (horizontal axis). Associations amongst physical and biological variables, divided into algal, invertebrate and vertebrate (fish) groups, were examined in a tidepool survey dataset. Physical variables and the three biological groups were submitted separately to a principal component analysis (PCA). PCA scores were evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients across the sampling units (tidepools) to identify significant correlations. Initially little structure in the data and no correlation amongst variables was present. At the onset of summer, correlations were confined amongst physical variables and algal and invertebrate components, followed in the late summer with correlations between invertebrate and fish components. By the fall, correlations were confined to fish and algal/invertebrate components. Species relationships followed a seasonal cycle with a succession from little to no structure, the forming of low trophic level relationships in the early summer to high trophic level relationships in late summer-fall, and deconstruction of structure with the onset of fall-winter storms and ice scour. The seasonal pattern, and well established vertical gradient, has nested within it species composition changes along a horizontal wave energy gradient. The horizontal gradient results in a shift from species which are physiologically adapted to extreme salinities and temperatures to those which are physically adapted to high wave-energy environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aenergy 3afish 3ahabitats 3aice 3ainvertebrates 3aoceans 3aprincipal component analysis 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3astorms 3asummer 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 3aMaine1 aCrocker, Jeffrey1 aChen, Yong0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2011 Sept., v. 92, no. 1 p.13-23dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9812-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245016900210300001600379506007600395520156600471592002802037506003702065650000802102650001202110650002502122650002402147650002402171650001702195650002902212650002602241653002802267653003402295653002602329653001102355653000802366700002602374700002302400773007502423856008402498852000902582655001202591IND60552229220221207105304.0161020e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055222922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.0062doi7 aPMC44022812pmcid7 a257788402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Pankaj10aInhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) acts as an inhibitor of ID-1, -2 and -3 and promotes basic helix loop helix (bHLH) E47 DNA binding and transcriptional activity  ap. 139-150.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe four known ID proteins (ID1-4, Inhibitor of Differentiation) share a homologous helix loop helix (HLH) domain and act as dominant negative regulators of basic-HLH transcription factors. ID proteins also interact with many non-bHLH proteins in complex networks. The expression of ID proteins is increasingly observed in many cancers. Whereas ID-1, ID-2 and ID-3, are generally considered as tumor promoters, ID4 on the contrary has emerged as a tumor suppressor. In this study we demonstrate that ID4 heterodimerizes with ID-1, -2 and -3 and promote bHLH DNA binding, essentially acting as an inhibitor of inhibitors of differentiation proteins. Interaction of ID4 was observed with ID1, ID2 and ID3 that was dependent on intact HLH domain of ID4. Interaction with bHLH protein E47 required almost 3 fold higher concentration of ID4 as compared to ID1. Furthermore, inhibition of E47 DNA binding by ID1 was restored by ID4 in an EMSA binding assay. ID4 and ID1 were also colocalized in prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. The alpha helix forming alanine stretch N-terminal, unique to HLH ID4 domain was required for optimum interaction. Ectopic expression of ID4 in DU145 prostate cancer line promoted E47 dependent expression of CDKNI p21. Thus counteracting the biological activities of ID-1, -2 and -3 by forming inactive heterodimers appears to be a novel mechanism of action of ID4. These results could have far reaching consequences in developing strategies to target ID proteins for cancer therapy and understanding biologically relevant ID-interactions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aalanine 3abioactive properties 3amechanism of action 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aDNA-Protein interaction 0aProtein–protein interaction 0aTumor suppressor gene 0aCancer 0aID41 aChinaranagari, Swathi1 aChaudhary, Jaideep0 tBiochimie.g2015 May, v. 112 p.139-150dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006700170520102700237592002801264650002301292650002601315650001901341650003001360650001501390650002201405653001901427653002401446653002801470653002901498653002701527700002201554773010301576856008101679852000901760655001201769IND60717165720221122000142.0201108e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071716572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esg.2020.1000432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReynolds, Jesse L.13aAn earth system governance perspective on solar geoengineering  aSolar geoengineering appears capable of reducing climate change and the associated risks. In part because it would be global in effect, the governance of solar geoengineering is a central concern. The Earth System Governance (ESG) Project includes many researchers who, to varying degrees, utilize a common vocabulary and research framework. Despite the clear mutual relevance of solar geoengineering and ESG, few ESG researchers have considered the topic in substantial depth. To stimulate its sustained uptake as a subject within the ESG research program, we identify significant contributions thus far by ESG scholars on the subject of solar geoengineering governance and survey the wider solar geoengineering governance literature from the perspective of the new ESG research framework. Based on this analysis, we also suggest specific potential lines of inquiry that we believe are ripe for research by ESG scholars: nonstate actors’ roles, polycentricity, public engagement and participation, and the Anthropocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3acitizen participation 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental engineering 3agovernance 3aresearch programs 0aGeoengineering 0aClimate engineering 0aEarth system governance 0aEnvironmental governance 0aEnvironmental politics1 aHorton, Joshua B.0 tEarth system governance.g2020 Mar., v. 3 p.100043-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27266x2589-81167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esg.2020.1000433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010800167300002000275520178700295592002802082650003502110650001502145650001602160650003602176650001602212650001002228650001602238650001102254650001002265650001402275650002302289650001102312650001802323650000902341650001002350700001802360700001502378700001602393700001602409700001902425700001302444700001202457700002002469700001602489700001402505700001402519700001702533700001702550773014902567856008102716852000902797655001202806IND60522937020221120180158.0170724e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052293702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6420-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Guiqiang10aManganese accumulation in hair and teeth as a biomarker of manganese exposure and neurotoxicity in rats  ap. 12265-12271.  aManganese (Mn) is an essential trace element to humans. However, excessive Mn causes cognitive impairment resulting from injury to the central nervous system within the hippocampus. No ideal biomarker is currently available for evaluating Mn exposure and associated neurotoxicity in the body. Hence, this study used Mn levels in the serum (MnS), teeth (MnT), and hair (MnH) as biomarkers for evaluating the association between Mn exposure and cognitive impairment in Mn-treated rats. A total of 32 male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups, received 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/(kg day) of MnCl₂·4H₂O for 5 days a week for 18 weeks, respectively. Lifetime Mn cumulative dose (LMCD) was used to evaluate external Mn exposure. Hippocampus, serum, teeth, and hair specimens were collected from the rats for Mn determination by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Learning and memory functions were assessed using the Morris water maze test. Results showed that chronic Mn exposure increased the hippocampus (MnHip), MnS, MnT, and MnH levels, as well as impaired learning and memory function in rats. MnHip, MnT, and MnH levels were positively correlated with LMCD (r = 0.759, r = 0.925, and r = 0.908, respectively; p < 0.05), escape latency (r = 0.862, r = 0.716, and r = 0.814, respectively; p < 0.05), and the number of platform crossings (r = −0.734, r = −0.514, and r = −0.566, respectively; p < 0.05). No association was observed between MnS levels and the number of platform crossings (r = −0.286, p > 0.05). Thus, MnT and MnH detected long-term low-dose Mn exposure. These parameters can be reliable biomarkers for Mn exposure and associated neurotoxicity in Mn-treated rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acentral nervous system diseases 3acorrelation 3ahairs 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3amales 3amanganese 3amanganese chloride 3amemory 3aneurotoxicity 3arats 3ateeth1 aZhang, Li’e1 aMa, Shuyan1 aLv, Yingnan1 aQin, Huiyan1 aHuang, Xiaowei1 aQing, Li1 aLi, Qin1 aChen, Kangcheng1 aXiong, Feng1 aMa, Yifei1 aNong, Jie1 aYang, Xiaobo1 aZou, Yunfeng0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 12 p.12265-12271dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6420-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009900157300002000256520042400276592002800700650002200728650001900750650001300769700002000782700001800802700001800820773012500838856007400963852000901037655001201046IND60666744620221121115327.0190919e20140919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066674462DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06728b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang, Yvonne10aFabrication of nanopatterned polymeric microparticles using a diatom as a sacrificial template  ap. 44418-44422.  aNatural structures with complex hierarchical architecture are employed as biotemplates to fabricate constructs with both nano- and micro-scale features.

Enzyme inhibitors are used as a therapeutic agent with organic molecules, that interact with their targets through the weak linkages of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. These reduce the undesirable side effects and allow more non-specific interactions with non-target molecules. Benzimidazole acts as an enzyme inhibitor that may interact with different proteins and enzymes and has inspired chemists to carry out various structural variations of it. This review discusses the development of distinct benzimidazoles with an array of enzyme inhibitors viz., aurora kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitors, polo like kinase inhibitors, Tie kinase inhibitors, lymphocyte specific kinase inhibitors etc., also highlighting the molecular interaction with enzyme inhibitors. Various derivatives of benzimidazole, with different inhibitory activities, have been described on the basis of substitution around the central moiety, with an aim to help medicinal chemists to develop structure–activity relationships. The reviews in the literature till now are focused only on the biological activities of benzimidazole viz., antiviral, anticancer and antifungal, but the present review focuses on the latest work, describing the inhibitor aspects and the potential of the benzimidazole ring. This discussion will further help in the development of novel benzimidazole compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abenzimidazole 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahydrogen bonding 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aproteins 3astructure-activity relationships 3atherapeutics 3avan der Waals forces1 aLuxami, Vijay1 aPaul, Kamaldeep0 tRSC advances.g2014 Feb. 27, v. 4, no. 24 p.12422-12440dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra46304d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245008100205300001800286506007600304520110900380592002801489506003701517650001801554650002001572650002101592650001401613650001401627650001101641650001801652650002001670650001501690650001601705700002101721773013301742856008101875852000901956655001201965IND60620785520221207132415.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062078552DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-018-3440-32doi7 aPMC62334272pmcid7 a304829972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Zeynab10aPreparation and characterization of nanoemulsion based β-carotene hydrogels  ap. 5014-5024.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to develop β-carotene hydrogels using nanoemulsions, with increased β-carotene aqueous solubility, bioavailability and improved physical and chemical stabilities. The nanoemulsion of β-carotene was prepared using a solvent-displacement technique and converted into hydrogels using sodium alginate as stabilizer and calcium chloride as cross-linker. The effects of formulation parameters, mainly, the effects sodium alginate and calcium chloride concentrations on the physicochemical properties of hydrogels were evaluated using a surface response methodology. The second order polynomial equations, subsequently, were suggested to predict the changes of studied physicochemical characteristics of hydrogels, with relatively high regression of coefficients values. Based on numerical multiple optimization, it was concluded that using 4.1 g/l sodium alginate and 5.7 g/l calcium chloride, resulted in a hydrogel with the most desired physicochemical characteristics. No significant differences between the measured and predicted data, reconfirmed the accuracy of the models.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-carotene 3abioavailability 3acalcium chloride 3aequations 3ahydrogels 3amodels 3ananoemulsions 3asodium alginate 3asolubility 3astabilizers1 aAnarjan, Navideh0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.5014-5024dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-018-3440-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017400160300001800334520195600352592002802308650002002336650001402356650001402370650002302384650001502407650003102422650001202453650001502465650000902480650001902489650001902508650001302527650001802540650001502558650001402573650001302587650001002600700001602610700002302626700002002649700002002669773014102689856007402830852000902904655001202913IND60641748720221120174612.0190506e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064174872DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta00379f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDatta, Saumena,10aFabrication of dog-bone shaped Au NRcₒᵣₑ–Pt/Pdₛₕₑₗₗ trimetallic nanoparticle-decorated reduced graphene oxide nanosheets for excellent electrocatalysis  ap. 3765-3776.  aHerein, a wet-chemical synthetic approach has been adopted, taking advantage of electrostatic interactions between positively charged [CTA]⁺ capped Au NRs and negative functionalities of graphene oxide (GO), to fabricate dog-bone shaped Au NRcₒᵣₑ–Pt/Pdₛₕₑₗₗ decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (GMTs) for efficient ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). This new strategy is based on an exceptionally efficient immobilization of trimetallic nanoparticles onto rGO sheets. It is important to note that the sequential addition of Pt and Pd precursor salts into the reaction mixture evolves Pd as the surface layer in the trimetallic assembly (described as GMT-1), whereas reversal of the sequence of addition results in spongy Pt NPs at the outer surface (designated as GMT-2), and thus two different types of Aucₒᵣₑ–Pt/Pdₛₐₙdwᵢcₕ–Pd/Ptₛₕₑₗₗ nanoparticle-decorated rGO nanocomposites have been fabricated. The well recognized electrocatalytic performance of Pt is improved towards EOR by controlled assembling of Au and Pd in the rGO support in both the GMTs, exceeding the performance of the corresponding bimetallic composites. The presence of Pd and rGO decreases the CO poisoning of Pt and rGO supports restrict the aggregation of the nanoparticles during CV cycles. Thus the durability of the GMT catalysts has been improved in contrast to other related materials. Interestingly, the exposed spongy Pt NPs, present at the exterior of the trimetallic particles in GMT-2, help to exhibit better EOR activity (∼1.22 times) but lower durability (∼10%) in comparison to its analogue, GMT-1. The observed electrocatalytic efficiencies of GMTs are superior to commercial Pt/C (more than 6 times better mass utilization and ∼40% higher durability) and most of the recently reported related materials, which suggest cost-effective and efficient practical fuel cell application of GMTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3achemistry 3acost effectiveness 3adurability 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aethanol 3afuel cells 3agold 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3asalts1 aRay, Chaiti1 aSasmal, Anup Kumar1 aNegishi, Yuichi1 aPal, Tarasankar0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Mar. 1, v. 4, no. 10 p.3765-3776dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta00379f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010500162300002000267520169500287592002801982650002302010650002102033650001202054650001202066650001602078650001102094650002002105650001102125650002702136650001702163650001902180650001002199650001102209650001602220650001302236700001302249700001902262700001202281773014902293856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60522937420221120180032.0170724e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052293742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6264-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Dongyu10aEffects of biochar amendment on relieving cadmium stress and reducing cadmium accumulation in pepper  ap. 12323-12331.  aBiochar is widely used in agricultural soils or heavy metal-polluted soils to improve the quality of the soils, which would affect the growth of the plant. However, the information of biochars’ effect on the plant growth was still lacking, especially for the physiological response of the plant. Pot experiments were used to examine the effect of willow-derived biochars at two temperatures (450 and 600 °C) on cadmium (Cd) accumulation in pepper and to reveal the response of physiological parameters to exogenous Cd stress (1 and 5 mg/kg). The results showed that the accumulation of Cd in pepper roots was higher than that in pepper shoots. For low level of Cd treatments, high additional rates of the biochars could obviously reduce the accumulation of Cd in the pepper roots. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the C content of the biochar-amended soils and the Cd content of the pepper root, suggesting that the application of biochar to the soil decreased the Cd accumulation in the root. A positive relationship between the H/C ratios of biochar-amended soils and their corresponding Cd concentrations in pepper root indicated that low thermal temperature-derived biochar could play an important role in immobilizing Cd in the soil. Furthermore, on the condition of low Cd level of treatments, the malondialdehyde content decreased in biochar-amended soils, especially at high biochar application rate. The chlorophyll content increased with increasing the rates of the biochar application. The physiological parameters indirectly proved that the application of biochar did not always alleviate the toxic effects of Cd on pepper leaves at high Cd concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3apepper 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3aroots 3ashoots 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aZhao, Ye1 aZhou, Huaidong1 aGao, Bo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 12 p.12323-12331dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6264-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245012000184300001800304520190900322592002802231650002402259650002002283650001102303650002002314650002302334650001902357650003302376650002002409650003102429650001102460650002002471650001702491650001702508650001802525650001502543650001302558650002602571650001402597650004302611700001502654700001802669700001802687700002002705700001902725700001802744773010002762856008102862852000902943655001202952IND60112850820221116192857.0141111e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011285082DNAL7 a252179772pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-4127-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPak, Jhang Ho10aInduction of cancer-related microRNA expression profiling using excretory-secretory products of Clonorchis sinensis  ap. 4447-4455.  aClonorchis sinensis is a carcinogenic human liver fluke by which chronic infection is strongly associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Although this cholangiocarcinoma is caused by both physical and chemical irritation from direct contact with adult worms and their excretory–secretory products (ESPs), the precise molecular events of the host–pathogen interactions remain to be elucidated. To better understand the effect of C. sinensis infection on cholangiocarcinogenesis, we profiled the kinetics of changes in cancer-related microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cholangiocarcinoma cells (HuCCT1) treated with C. sinensis ESPs for different periods. Using miRNA microarray chips containing 135 cancer-related miRNAs, we identified 16 miRNAs showing differentially altered expression following ESP exposure. Of these miRNAs, 13 were upregulated and 3 were downregulated in a time-dependent manner compared with untreated controls. Functional clustering of these dysregulated miRNAs revealed involvement in cell proliferation, inflammation, oncogene activation/suppression, migration/invasion/metastasis, and DNA methylation. In particular, decreased expression of let-7i, a tumor suppressor miRNA, was found to be associated with the ESP-induced upregulation of TLR4 mRNA and protein, which contribute to host immune responses against liver fluke infection. Further real-time quantitative PCR analysis using ESP-treated normal cholangiocytes (H69) revealed that the expressions of nine miRNAs (miR-16-2, miR-93, miR-95, miR-153, miR-195, miR-199-3P, let7a, let7i, and miR-124a) were similarly regulated, indicating that the cell proliferation and inhibition of tumor suppression mediated by these miRNAs is common to both cancerous and non-cancerous cells. These findings constitute further our understanding of the multiple cholangiocarcinogenic pathways triggered by liver fluke infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClonorchis sinensis 3aDNA methylation 3aadults 3acarcinogenicity 3acell proliferation 3adirect contact 3aexcretory-secretory products 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aliver flukes 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amicroRNA 3amicroarray technology 3aoncogenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aKim, In Ki1 aKim, Seon Min1 aMaeng, Sejung1 aSong, Kyoung Ju1 aNa, Byoung-Kuk1 aKim, Tong-Soo0 tParasitology research.g2014 Dec., v. 113, no. 12 p.4447-4455dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-4127-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245026500166300001300431520143800444592002801882650001201910650001101922650001401933650001001947650002401957650001901981650001902000650001002019650001102029650001602040650002302056650001902079651001202098653001302110653001502123653001402138653001602152653001602168653001702184653002702201653002002228700002802248700002002276700001702296773009302313856008102406852000902487655001202496IND60699250620221121004106.0210117e20130903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069925062DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.328.57632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkkari, Nesrine10aRevolving SEM images visualising 3D taxonomic characters: application to six species of the millipede genus Ommatoiulus Latzel, 1884, with description of seven new species and an interactive key to the Tunisian members of the genus (Diplopoda, Julida, Julidae)  ap. 5-45.  aA novel illustration technique based on scanning electron microscopy is used for the first time to enhance taxonomic descriptions. The male genitalia (gonopods) of six species of millipedes are used for construction of interactive imaging models. Each model is a compilation of a number of SEM images taken consecutively while rotating the SEM stage 360°, which allows the structure in question to be seen from all angles of view in one plane. Seven new species of the genus Ommatoiulus collected in Tunisia are described: Ommatoiulus chambiensis , Ommatoiulus crassinigripes , Ommatoiulus kefi , Ommatoiulus khroumiriensis , Ommatoiulus xerophilus , Ommatoiulus xenos , and Ommatoiulus zaghouani spp. n. Size differences between syntopic adult males of Ommatoiulus chambiensis and Ommatoiulus xerophilus spp. n. from Châambi Mountain are illustrated using scatter diagrams. A similar diagram is used to illustrate size differences in Ommatoiulus crassinigripes , Ommatoiulus khroumiriensis spp. n. and Ommatoiulus punicus (Brölemann, 1894). In addition to morphological differences, the latter three species display allopatric distribution and different habitat preferences. A dichotomous interactive key with a high visual impact and an intuitive user interface is presented to serve identification of the 12 Ommatoiulus species so far known from Tunisia.

Crucial for this regulation is the integrity of endothelial cell–cell junctions. Various molecular mechanisms control junctional integrity of the endothelial layer including GTPases, modulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of junctional proteins. Several kinases and phosphatases have been identified that are good candidates for the regulation of the endothelial barrier function. For some of them, in vivo evidence has recently been presented that highlights their importance in either the regulation of vascular permeability or leukocyte extravasation. This review will summarize current knowledge about the regulation of endothelial junctions by kinases and phosphatases. In particular, the role of the endothelial specific phosphatase VE-PTP in the context of endothelial cell contact stability will be highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aproteins 3aendothelial cells 3acytoskeleton 3asolutes 3ablood vessels 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphosphorylation 3ablood 3adephosphorylation 3apermeability 0akinases1 aVockel, Matthias1 aNottebaum, Astrid F.1 aVestweber, Dietmar0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Mar., v. 355, no. 3 p.577-586dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1812-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009800166300001600264520160200280592002801882650002501910650001901935650002301954650002301977650001402000650002102014650001502035650001202050650001902062650002002081650001802101650003002119653002502149653001402174653001402188653002002202653003602222653002702258700002702285700002302312773011802335856008402453852000902537655001202546IND60634761820221118055509.0190325e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063476182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArhab, Yani10aPlant phospholipase D mining unravels new conserved residues important for catalytic activity  ap. 688-703.  aPhospholipase D (PLD) is a key enzyme involved in numerous processes in all living organisms. Hydrolysis of phospholipids by PLD allows the release of phosphatidic acid which is a crucial intermediate of multiple pathways and signaling reactions, including tumorigenesis in mammals and defense responses in plants. One common feature found in the plant alpha isoform (PLDα), in some PLD from microbes and in all PLD from eukaryotes, is a duplicated motif named HKD involved in the catalysis. However, other residues are strictly conserved among these organisms and their role remains obscure. To gain further insights into PLD structure and the role of these conserved residues, we first looked for all the plant PLDα sequences available in public databases. With >200 sequences retrieved, a generic sequence was constructed showing that 138 residues are strictly conserved among plant PLDα, with some of them identical to residues found in mammalian PLDs. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the PLDα from Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrated that mutation of some of these residues abolished the PLD activity. Moreover, mutation of the residues around both HKD motifs enabled us to re-define the consensus sequence of these motifs. By sequential deletions of the N-terminal extremity, the minimum length of the domain required for catalytic activity was determined. Overall, this work furthers our understanding of the structure of eukaryotic PLDs and it may lead to the discovery of new regions involved in the catalytic reaction that could be targeted by small molecule modulators of PLDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acarcinogenesis 3acatalytic activity 3aconsensus sequence 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahydrolysis 3amammals 3amicroorganisms 3aphospholipase D 3aphospholipids 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aC2 domain 0aHKD motif 0aPhospholipase D 0aPost-translational modification 0aTransphosphatidylation1 aAbousalham, Abdelkarim1 aNoiriel, Alexandre0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 May, v. 1864, no. 5 p.688-703dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245009200194500002000286520138200306592002801688596005701716596005701773596013101830650002501961650002401986650002202010650002202032650001802054650002502072650001602097650002202113650001002135650002402145650001402169650002602183650002002209650003102229650001002260650001702270650001202287650001102299650001602310650002402326650001402350650005202364650001702416700001502433700001702448700001602465700001802481700001502499700001402514773014702528856007402675852000902749655001202758IND60645905120221117175939.0190604e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064590512DNAL7 a10.1002/arch.215542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5392-503710aMolecular and functional properties of two Spodoptera exigua acetylcholinesterase genes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a vital enzyme that hydrolyzes acetylcholine. Here, full‐length complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of two acetylcholinesterase genes (SeAce1 and SeAce2) were obtained from Spodoptera exigua, a widespread phytophagous pest in agriculture. The complete SeAce1 cDNA comprised 5447 nucleotides including an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 694 amino acids, while SeAce2 cDNA encompassed a 1917‐bp ORF which would likely yield 638 amino acids. Both SeAce1 and SeAce2 contained specific characteristics of functional AChE. A phylogenetic tree of all lepidopteran insect Aces showed S. exigua clustered with S. litura, Helicoverpa assulta, and H. armigera, all of which are Noctuidae. In S. exigua, SeAce1 gene expression levels (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT‐PCR] and quantitative RT‐PCR) were markedly increased compared with SeAce2 in all developmental phases and tissue types. Both genes were down regulated by inserting the corresponding dsRNAs in 5th instar larvae, which resulted in 56.7% (SeAce1) and 24.6% (SeAce2) death. Downregulation of both SeAce1 and SeAce2 significantly reduced fecundity and vitellogenin gene expression in S. exigua. These results revealed the biological functions of the two Ace genes (SeAce1 and SeAce2), providing novel insights into the development of strategies for controlling insect pests.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐15–18cChinese Agricultural Research System  aCARS‐15‐18cChinese Agricultural Research System  a2017YFD0201900cIntegration research and demonstration of the technology of cotton fertilizer and pesticide reduction of China 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aHelicoverpa assulta 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aSpodoptera litura 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aamino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3adeath 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afecundity 3afunctional properties 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainsect pests 3ainstars 3alarvae 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avitellogenin1 aHao, Dejun1 aXiao, Liubin1 aTan, Yongan1 aJiang, Yiping1 aBai, Lixin1 aWang, Kai0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2019 July, v. 101, no. 3 p.e21554-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34835x0739-44627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.215543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245011100156300001800267500001900285520189400304592002802198650002102226650002902247650001402276650002502290650001702315650001102332650002102343650001802364650002002382650003102402650002802433650004202461650001702503650002402520650001202544650004302556650001202599650001802611650002002629653002602649653002202675700001602697700001502713700001302728700001802741773015202759856007602911852000902987655001202996IND60705399220221118045015.0200804e20200729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070539922DNAL7 a10.11158/saa.25.7.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jia10aTranscriptome analysis of Tetranychus cinnabarinus responses to exposure of an insecticide (diflubenzuron)  ap. 1329-1342.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDiflubenzuron, a benzoylphenylurea insecticide that interferes with chitin biosynthesis, causes arthropods to moult abnormally and die. However, its mechanism of action in Tetranychus cinnabarinus is still unclear. In order to explore the effects of different sublethal concentrations of diflubenzuron on T. cinnabarinus, we conducted a high-throughput RNA-seq technology to identify the variations in transcriptomic profile of T. cinnabarinus larvae. The results revealed that 470 and 49 differentially expressed genes were identified in LC₅₀- and LC₇₀-treated groups, comparing with the control. We also identified and analyzed the detoxification enzymes involved in the transcritome of T. cinnabarinus, including 34 cytochrome P450 genes, 17 glutathione-s-transferase genes (GSTs), 12 acetylcholinesterase genes (AChEs) and 9 ABC transporter genes. In addition, differentially expressed genes analysis showed that the gene expression levels of detoxification enzymes were generally enhanced. At the same time, seven and 11 genes were involved in chitin synthesis and degradation ways, respectively. The expression level of most genes involved in chitin synthesis and degradation pathway were generally up-regulated after exposure to sublethal concentrations of diflubenzuron. Moreover, for transcriptome validation, the mRNA expression results of ten specially expressed genes by quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that these gene expression trends were consistent with that of the transcriptome data. Together, all these results suggested that sublethal concentrations of diflubenzuron exposure affected gene expression of major detoxification enzymes and chitin metabolism genes in T. cinnabarinus. These findings may be helpful to further understand the possible molecular mechanism of benzoylphenylurea insecticides in T. cinnabarinus, as well as in other spider mites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aTetranychus cinnabarinus 3aacarology 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiosynthesis 3achitin 3acytochrome P-450 3adiflubenzuron 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione transferase 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsecticides 3amechanism of action 3amolting 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspiders 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0adetoxification enzyme 0achitin metabolism1 aYe, Xianyan1 aWang, Jing1 aXia, Bin1 aXin, Tianrong0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2020 July 29, v. 25, no. 7 p.1329-1342dSystematic and Applied Acarology SocietywJournal:23061x1362-19717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.11158/saa.25.7.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011200170300001600282520179500298592002802093650002202121650001102143650001902154650001502173650001102188650002602199650001702225650001102242650001802253650001802271653001202289653001802301653002302319653002202342653002102364653002502385700002402410773010502434856008502539852000902624655001202633IND60612962620221119092940.0200121e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061296262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemp, Alan E.S.14aThe case of the diatoms and the muddled mandalas: Time to recognize diatom adaptations to stratified waters  ap. 138-149.  aModels used to predict future ocean ecosystem and biogeochemical behaviour depend on simplified ecological frameworks allowing the definition of plankton functional types. Foremost among such frameworks has been the mandala of Margalef. His 1978 paper has been increasingly referred to in the past decade as simplified ecological schemes have been sought to help predict the effect of climate change on phytoplankton. However, the mandala is based on an understanding of the subject that is over 40 years old, when observational studies were largely limited to the coastal ocean and to near surface waters. Furthermore, most recent reproductions of the mandala are significant oversimplifications of Margalef’s original. In these simplified mandala-type constructs, diatoms, in particular, have commonly been cast as a single plankton functional type that thrive in turbulent waters and decrease in abundance with increasing stratification. On this basis, it is widely predicted that diatom productivity and hence the effectiveness of the marine biological carbon pump will decrease with climate change that is driving increased stratification of the oceans. But Margalef’s original took a more refined approach and depicted diatom genera that were adapted to more stratified conditions such as those characteristic of the subtropical oligotrophic gyres. If we now draw on the vast advances in observational oceanography of recent decades it is evident that diatoms may thrive, bloom and generate significant export even in the most intensely stratified and apparently oligotrophic conditions. Indeed, some diatom species have unique adaptations to such environments. We therefore suggest that it is time to abandon oversimplified schemes and recognize the diverse ecology of diatoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3amodels 3aobservational studies 3aoceanography 3aoceans 3aphytoplankton 3asurface water 0aDiatoms 0aPhytoplankton 0aPrimary production 0aOcean circulation 0aClimatic changes 0aOcean stratification1 aVillareal, Tracy A.0 tProgress in oceanography.g2018 Oct., v. 167 p.138-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013500161300001800296500001900314520132300333592002801656650002201684650001101706650002601717650001401743650002201757650002801779650001301807650001401820700002201834700002001856700001801876700001901894700002001913773012301933856007402056852000902130655001202139IND60726463520221122083021.0210205e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072646352DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra08587a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZorainy, Mahmoud10aSynthesis of a novel Ce(iii)/melamine coordination polymer and its application for corrosion protection of AA2024 in NaCl solution  ap. 6330-6345.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe present the synthesis of a new cerium(iii)–melamine coordination polymer (CMCP) by a mixed-solvothermal method and its characterization. Characterization techniques included Raman, Fourier Transformation Infra-Red (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), in which the change in the electronic environment and the crystallinity were tracked. The characterization results confirm the coordination of cerium(iii) with melamine through –NH₂ groups, instead of the N atoms of the triazine ring, for which we propose a mechanism of interaction. In addition, Biovia Materials Studio package was applied to determine and investigate the molecular structure of the CMCP. All simulations were done using COMPASS force-field theory and atom-based method for summation of electrostatic and van de Waals forces. The application of the CMCP for the corrosion inhibition of AA2024 in 3.5% NaCl solution was tested using the potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The results point out that the presence of cerium as cerium(iii) in the CMCP structure plays the fundamental role of inhibition, whereby the inhibition mechanism occurs by cathodic oxidation of Ce(iii) to Ce(iv) and cyclic reduction of Ce(iv) to Ce(iii) by melamine part of CMCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acerium 3acoordination polymers 3acorrosion 3acrystal structure 3adielectric spectroscopy 3amelamine 3aoxidation1 aBoffito, Daria C.1 aGobara, Mohamed1 aBaraka, Ahmad1 aNaeem, Ibrahim1 aTantawy, Hesham0 tRSC advances.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 11, no. 11 p.6330-6345dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08587a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009600210300001600306500001900322520177700341592002802118650002402146650003102170650001902201650001102220650001302231650001202244650001402256650001102270650001402281650001602295650001302311650001802324650001402342650001002356650002002366650001302386650001302399650001502412650001102427651001102438700002702449700001902476700003102495773013402526856008202660852000902742655001202751IND60722512620221116220928.0210105e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072251262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02123-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, Leonardo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4793-475110aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. actinidiae associated with canker on pear trees in Brazil  ap. 219-226.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn summer of 2016, cankers were observed on 8-year-old pear trees (Pyrus communis L.) cv. Yali grafted on the Caleriana rootstock, in a commercial orchard in Monte Castelo, SC. Eight hundred out of 1200 trees died and the rest of the orchard was eradicated. Affected plants showed cankers on trunks and twigs with exudation; the branches turned brown and slowly died. Bacterial colonies were isolated on King’s B medium from infected tissues. Pathogenicity, biochemical tests were conducted and some isolates selected for whole genome sequencing using Ion Personal Genome Machine™ (PGM™) System (ThermoFisher Scientific). PCR with Y1/Y2 and PcaF/PcaR primers, specific for Pectobacterium carotovorum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. actinidiae, respectively, were also carried out. The section of inoculated apple and pear branches showed longitudinal darkening, with wilt and leaf blight. Shoots of kiwifruit Actinidia deliciosa cv. Hayward inoculated with the bacterium showed no symptoms. The bacterium was re-isolated from all symptomatic tissues, satisfying Koch’s postulates. Selected isolates were gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped and exhibited a strong pectolytic activity in potato and carrot disks, and showed similar biochemical profile using a BIOLOG GEN III MicroPlate. The pathogen of the symptoms observed on pear trees in Brazil show highest genome (87.1%; DDH analysis) and proteome identity (99.8%; Patric analysis) with P. carotovorum subsp. actinidiae. A product of the expected size was obtained in both specific PCR (Y1/Y2 (434 bp) and PcaF/PcaR (343 bp) primer pairs). Results from the present study clearly show that P. carotovorum subsp. actinidiae was associated with canker on pear trees in Santa Catarina, Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia deliciosa 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3aPyrus communis 3aapples 3abacteria 3acarrots 3aexudation 3agenome 3akiwifruit 3aleaf blight 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apears 3aplant pathology 3apotatoes 3aproteome 3arootstocks 3asummer 3aBrazil1 aCardoza, Yuliet Franco1 aDuarte, Valmir1 ade Moraes, Marcelo Gravina0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2021 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.219-226dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-020-02123-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245007800189300001600267520067100283592002800954650001300982650001800995650001801013650001601031650001501047650001701062650002001079700002101099700001701120773010001137856008101237852000901318655001201327IND50074405720221120131846.0150214e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007440572DNAL7 a245957392pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1820-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido-Urbani, S.10aTight junction dynamics: the role of junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs)  ap. 701-715.  aJunctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) are a family of adhesion molecules localized at the tight junction of polarized cells and on the cell surface of leukocytes. The last 20 years of research in this field has shown that several members of the family play an important role in the regulation of cell polarity, endothelium permeability and leukocytes migration. They mediate these pleiotropic functions through a multitude of homophilic and heterophilic interactions with intrafamily and extrafamily partners. In this article, we review the current status of the JAM family and highlight their functional role in tight junction dynamics and leukocyte transmigration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell movement 3acell polarity 3aendothelium 3aleukocytes 3apermeability 3atight junctions1 aBradfield, P.

Three different wall materials including skim milk powder (SMP), SMP+Tween 80, and SMP+maltodextrin were used for emulsion preparation. The prepared emulsions were analyzed for droplet size and stability. The emulsions were then dried in a pilot-scale spray dryer equipped with a two-fluid nozzle at different inlet drying air temperatures and feed atomization pressures in order to determine the optimal drying conditions for maximizing the microencapsulation efficiency. The microencapsulation efficiency, particle size distribution, sphericity, moisture content, bulk density, and morphology of produced microcapsules were also measured experimentally. In addition, the microcapsules with the highest microencapsulation efficiency obtained from each wall material were subjected to surface coverage of oil test using electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) after 60days of storage at room temperature. The emulsion prepared using SMP and Tween 80 combination as wall material resulted in the highest microencapsulation efficiency (91.01%) at drying air temperature of 180°C and feed atomization pressure of 3bar. The lowest surface coverage of oil was also observed for microcapsules covered by SMP and Tween 80 combination. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations showed almost no cracks or fissures on the surface of microcapsules produced using SMP and Tween 80 combination at the optimal drying condition.Walnut oil contains highly valuable constituents such as essential fatty acids, tocopherols, and phytosterols. However, a direct application of this functional oil in processed foods is problematic due to its low solubility and susceptibility to oxidation. These issues could be greatly overcome by using microencapsulation technology. Nowadays, this technology has received an increasing attention in food and pharmaceutical industries due to its unique features in protecting the functionality of ingredients. Spray drying technology is one of the most frequently used techniques for this aim. However, comprehensive studies need to be carried out in order to determine suitable operational conditions of spray drying system for improving physicochemical properties of finished powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3aatomization 3abulk density 3achemical analysis 3adried skim milk 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3aessential fatty acids 3afood industry 3aingredients 3amicroencapsulation 3aoxidation 3aparticle size distribution 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphytosterols 3apolysorbates 3aprocessed foods 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aspray drying 3astorage temperature 3atocopherols 3awalnut oil 3awater content 0aElectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) 0aMicroencapsulation efficiency 0aWalnut oil 0aSkim milk powder (SMP) 0aSpray drying 0aScanning electron microscopy (SEM)1 aSeiiedlou, Seyed Sadegh1 aAghbashlo, Mortaza1 aTsotsas, Evangelos1 aKharaghani, Abdolreza0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2017 Feb., v. 39 p.101-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2016.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024004300134040001800177100001500195245008900210506007600299506003100375520133100406592002801737596004701765596000901812506003701821650001901858650002001877650001401897650001101911650001101922650001501933650002201948700002001970773008601990856008702076852000902163655001202172IND60734997720221207083304.0220901e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073499772DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa6482doi7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa6482chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Xiyu10aAmpliCI: a high-resolution model-based approach for denoising Illumina amplicon data  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aMotivation Next-generation amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for investigating microbial communities. One main challenge is to distinguish true biological variants from errors caused by PCR and sequencing. In the traditional analysis pipeline, such errors are eliminated by clustering reads within a sequence similarity threshold, usually 97%, and constructing operational taxonomic units, but the arbitrary threshold leads to low resolution and high false positive rates. Recently developed “denoising” methods have proven able to resolve single-nucleotide amplicon variants, but they still miss low frequency sequences, especially those near abundant variants, because they ignore the sequencing quality information. Results We introduce AmpliCI, a reference-free, model-based method for rapidly resolving the number, abundance and identity of error-free sequences in massive Illumina amplicon datasets. AmpliCI takes into account quality information and allows the data, not an arbitrary threshold or an external database, to drive conclusions. AmpliCI estimates a finite mixture model, using a greedy strategy to gradually select error-free sequences and approximately maximize the likelihood. We show that AmpliCI is superior to three popular denoising methods, with acceptable computation time and memory usage.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3adata collection 3adatabases 3amemory 3amodels 3amotivation 3asequence homology1 aDorman, Karin S0 tBioinformatics.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl56649x1367-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa6483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013900154300001800293500001900311520158400330592002801914650002401942650001101966650003001977650002002007650002802027650001302055650001902068650002102087700001802108700001902126700001602145700001302161700001402174773012302188856007402311852000902385655001202394IND60726463620221122083125.0210205e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072646362DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra08832c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bin12aA highly sensitive ppb-level H₂S gas sensor based on fluorophenoxy-substituted phthalocyanine cobalt/rGO hybrids at room temperature  ap. 5993-6001.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe peripheral and non-peripheral substitution of 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy groups in the design of gas sensing phthalocyanine cobalt/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids with two different positions of the substituents was realized. Tetra-α(β)-(4-trifluoromethylphenoxy)phthalocyanine cobalt/reduced graphene oxide (3(4)-cF₃poPcCo/rGO) hybrids were prepared through noncovalent interaction, and were analyzed by FT-IR, UV-vis, TGA and SEM. The gas sensing performance of the cF₃poPcCo/rGO hybrid gas sensors towards ppb hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) was measured at room temperature. The results show that the 4-cF₃poPcCo/rGO sensor has better sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility than the 3-cF₃poPcCo/rGO sensor, as well as a perfect linear response to the concentration of H₂S. For the 4-cF₃poPcCo/rGO sensor, the response sensitivity to 1 ppm H₂S is as high as 46.58, the response and recovery times are 600 s and 50 s for 1 ppm H₂S, and the detection limit is as low as 11.6 ppb. This is mainly due to the loose and porous structure of the cF₃poPcCo/rGO hybrids, the fact that graphene is an excellent conductive agent, and the fact that the electron-withdrawing capability of the trifluoromethyl group can increase the holes of rGO and PcCo. In addition, through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and I–V curves, and density functional theory, the influence of different positions of the substituents of cF₃poPcCo/rGO on the sensing performance and the sensing mechanism for improving sensitivity were discussed and confirmed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen sulfide1 aWang, Xiaolin1 aGuo, Zhijiang,1 aGai, Shijie1 aLi, Yong1 aWu, Yiqun0 tRSC advances.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 11, no. 11 p.5993-6001dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08832c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245005500135300001300190506002800203520216700231592002802398506003702426650001402463650002202477650001002499650001102509650002402520650001902544650001602563650002302579700003302602700003002635700002602665700002802691700002902719773011902748852000902867655001202876IND60784905120221207134620.0141014e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078490512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiassi, Leonardo10aModelagem fuzzy em parâmetros de bem-estar humano  ap. 8-12.  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Diante das preocupações com o ambiente de trabalho e consequentemente com o bem-estar dos trabalhadores, objetivou-se com o presente trabalho avaliar a utilização da modelagem matemática fuzzy, na avaliação da salubridade de trabalhadores agrícolas, relacionada ao ambiente térmico e acústico.

The present study was made to explore the potential metabolites of actinomycetes and endophytes of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and to assay the induced defence reactions in rice plants against bacterial blight (BB) of rice (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). In-vitro studies revealed that few promising rhizospheric Streptomyces (S. fimicarius and S. laurentii) and endophytes (Pseudomonas putida and Metarhizium anisopliae) could suppress Xoo effectively in dual culture assay. P. putida + S. fimicarius + S. laurentii showed the highest (58.71%) inhibition of BB. Multiple growth promoting characteristics were assayed for these effective isolates. The effectiveness of the cell suspension (10⁷ cfu/ml) of P. putida, M. anisopliae, S. fimicarius and S. laurentii in suppressing BB of rice was tested in planta by applying as seed treatment, root treatment, soil treatment and spray application. Lowest disease incidence was observed in plants treated with the combination of P. putida + S. fimicarius + S. laurentii (10.29%) as compared to other treatments. To understand the resistance mechanisms of rice plants against Xoo, few effective secondary metabolites were assayed where the total phenol content of the treated plants showed higher concentration (2.52%). Antibiotics were recorded at a higher peak of retention time, such as pyrisulfoxin B (12.26 min), APHE 4 (13.42 min), kanamycin C (22.22 min), nitracidomycin B (15.40 min), clavulanic acid (7.89 min), neothramycin A (16.22 min), nitracidomycin A (17.78 min) and furaquinocin E (24.74 min).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aOryza sativa 3aPseudomonas putida 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3abiological control 3ablight 3aclavulanic acid 3adisease incidence 3adisease resistance 3aecosystems 3aendophytes 3akanamycin 3aphenols 3aplant growth 3aplant pathology 3arice 3asecondary metabolites 3aseed treatment 3asoil treatment 3asustainable agriculture1 aBora, L.

Additionally, products of the oxidative reaction, especially involving lipids (e.g., malondialdehyde – MDA), may be even more harmful to sperm. Carnosine, previously reported to be present in seminal plasma of several species, may be a key factor on sperm tolerance to biotechniques by counterattacking the deleterious influence of MDA. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the levels of carnosine present in equine seminal plasma and relate these findings with sperm function and oxidative status during cooling and cryopreservation. Thus, semen samples were collected from 40 stallions in duplicate (N = 80) and then submitted to cooling and cryopreservation. Samples were then allocated into groups of high and low tolerance to refrigeration and cryopreservation (bad cooler and good cooler/bad freezer and good freezer, respectively), and in groups of different concentrations of carnosine (High, Medium-high, Medium-low and Low carnosine). Samples were evaluated for sperm kinetics patterns, function of sperm structures and oxidative status. In good cooler samples, it was observed higher concentrations of carnosine (Good cooler: 224.98 ± 19.16 ng/mL; Bad cooler: 159.72 ± 15.99 ng/mL; p = 0.0056), ROS production (Good cooler: 26.40 ± 18.33%; Bad cooler: 18.33 ± 1.84%; p = 0.001) and lipid peroxidation rates (Good cooler: 193.23 ± 18.22 ng/mL; Bad cooler: 131.92 ± 12.25; p = 0.0064). Groups of samples with higher carnosine concentrations had lower levels of malondialdehyde (High: 79.33 ± 6.72 ng/mL; Medium-high: 140.45 ± 11.70 ng/mL; Medium-low: 202.57 ± 16.30 ng/mL and Low: 231.02 ± 32.35 ng/mL; p < 0.05), demonstrating that carnosine was effective in removing lipid peroxidation products. Due to the removal of seminal plasma during the cryopreservation process, no differences occurred in carnosine levels between bad and good freezer groups. In this context, this study provides relevant data for future therapies using carnosine during cryopreservation, aiming to replace the levels lost due to the necessary removal of seminal plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarnosine 3acryopreservation 3afreezers 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3amalondialdehyde 3arefrigeration 3aseminal plasma 3asperm quality 3astallions 0aCryopreservation 0aCryobiology 0aOxidative stress 0aSpermatozoa 0aSeminal plasma1 aKawai, Giulia Kiyomi Vechiato1 ade Agostini Losano, João Diego1 aAngrimani, Daniel de Souza Ramos1 aRui, Bruno Rogério1 ade Cássia Bicudo, Luana1 ada Silva, Bárbara do Carmo Simões1 aAlonso, Maria Augusta1 aMendes, Camilla Mota1 aOrtiz D'Avila Assumpção, Mayra Elena1 aPereira, Ricardo José Garcia1 aBarnabé, Valquiria Hyppolito,1 aNichi, Marcilio0 tTheriogenology.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 119 p.10-17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2018.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245007900164300001800243500001900261520049700280592002800777650001100805650002300816650002100839650001400860650001200874651000900886653001200895653001300907653001800920653001000938653001800948653001500966700002900981700002301010700002101033700002501054773015101079856007501230852000901305655001201314IND60705399520221117032746.0200804e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070539952DNAL7 a10.11158/saa.25.7.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLotfollahi, Parisa10aTwo new Aceria species (Acari: Eriophyidae) from Lorestan province of Iran  ap. 1169-1177.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring a survey of the eriophyoid mites in Lorestan province of Iran two new eriophyoid mites described and illustrated: Aceria poldokhtariensis Lotfollahi & Bahirai sp. nov. from Populus euphratica Oliv.

New advances are being driven by measurement approaches allowing sampling with high density in both space and time. Using in situ soil water vapour probe techniques, combined with conventional soil and plant water vacuum distillation extraction, we monitored the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition of soil and plant waters at paired sites dominated by grasses and Gambel's oak (Quercus gambelii) within a semiarid montane ecosystem over the course of a growing season. We found that sites spaced only 20 m apart had profoundly different soil water isotopic and volumetric conditions. We document patterns of depth‐ and time‐explicit variation in soil water isotopic conditions at these sites and consider mechanisms for the observed heterogeneity. We found that soil water content and isotopic variability were damped under Q. gambelii, perhaps due in part to hydraulic redistribution of deep soil water or groundwater by Q. gambelii in these soils relative to the grass‐dominated site. We also found some support for H isotope discrimination effects during water uptake by Q. gambelii. In this ecosystem, the soil water content was higher than that at the neighbouring Grass site, and thus, 25% more water was available for transpiration by Q. gambelii compared with the Grass site. This work highlights the role of plants in governing soil water variation and demonstrates that they can also strongly influence the isotope ratios of soil water. The resulting fine‐scale heterogeneity has implications for the use of isotope tracers to study soil hydrology and evaporation and transpiration fluxes to improve understanding of water cycling through the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐AC52‐07NA27344cU.S. Department of Energy (Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Solar Energy Technology Program)  aEF‐1241286cNSF  aIIA 1208732cNSF EPSCoR 3aQuercus gambelii 3aecosystems 3aevaporation 3agrasses 3agroundwater 3agrowing season 3ahydrogen 3aisotope labeling 3aoxygen 3aoxygen isotopes 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3aspace and time 3atranspiration 3avacuum distillation 3awater uptake 3awater vapor1 aBowen, Gabriel J.0 tHydrological processes.g2019 June 15, v. 33, no. 12 p.1724-1738dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.134343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01314naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245016700171300001600338520026800354592002800622650001300650650001300663650001700676653002000693653003100713653001300744700001600757773015200773856007800925852000901003655001201012IND60522520120221117222809.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052252012DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1973-7-8132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Anna-Katharina10aKetocarotinoide in den Früchten von Lonicera webbiana und Lonicera ruprechtiana / Ketocarotinoids of the Berries from Lonicera webbiana and Lonicera ruprechtiana  ap. 437-438.  aThe main pigments of red Lonicera berries are Rhodoxanthin and two hitherto unknown ketocarotinoids named Loniceraxanthin and Webbiaxanthin.

Therefore, comparing species traits in a multidimensional space can help to better understand invader impacts, but novel methods are needed to effectively measure multiple traits across diverse plant communities. The main aim was to assess biochemical leaf parameters based on field spectra in a whole‐community approach. Our specific objectives were to assess (1) biochemical differentiation within the plant community, (2) accuracy of spectroscopic prediction models of biochemical parameters, and (3) ability to depict the multivariate differentiation using field spectroscopy. LOCATION: Mediterranean dune ecosystems, Atlantic coast, southwest Portugal. METHODS: We analysed leaf biomass of 18 species, including two invasive acacias, for C, δ¹³C, N, δ¹⁵N, lignin, fibre and tannin. Additionally, we collected leaf and canopy field spectra of each sampled plant. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to predict biochemical parameters from field spectra. Further, we assessed the biochemical differentiation of the species using PCA based on wet chemically determined as well as spectroscopically predicted values. RESULTS: We found high biochemical variation among species and, in particular, marked trait dissimilarity between invasive Acacia spp. and native species, primarily with respect to N content. Biochemical parameters were predicted successfully based on field spectra. Prediction accuracies were particularly high with C, δ¹³C, N and tannin. A PCA of biochemical parameters showed that invasive Acacia spp. were distinct from native species of the same life form, but grouped with native dwarf shrubs. This pattern was accurately reproduced by a PCA using spectroscopically predicted values. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive Acacia spp. have different leaf traits compared to native species of similar growth form. Their trait dissimilarity likely exacerbates their impacts on the ecosystem. This trait dissimilarity in leaf biochemistry can be accurately predicted with hyperspectral whole‐community models. Thus, field spectroscopy can substantially increase the spatial and temporal resolution of measurements and hence facilitate assessments of ecosystem functioning and invader impacts at ecosystem scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3abiochemistry 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aleast squares 3aleaves 3alignin 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplant communities 3aprediction 3ashrubs 3aspectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3aPortugal1 aHellmann, Christine1 aThiele, Jan1 aOldeland, Jens1 aWerner, Christiane0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2018 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.325-335dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.126083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011700169300001400286500001900300520139600319592002801715650002201743650002501765650002501790650001501815650001701830650002301847650002101870650001401891650001501905650003801920650001001958650002301968650001501991650002002006650001202026650002502038650001202063650002902075700006102104700002002165773013202185856008202317852000902399655001202408IND60722513020221116220457.0210105e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072251302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02142-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaha, Mohamed A.10a6-pentyl-α-pyrone from Trichoderma koningii induces systemic resistance in tobacco against tobacco mosaic virus  ap. 81-93.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed at evaluating the ability of 6-pentyl-α-pyrone (6PP) isolated from Trichoderma koningii CTX1172 (AUMC 11520), an endophytic fungal strain to induce systemic resistance in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. White Burley) plant against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). 6PP exhibited 10–60% symptoms inhibition at low concentrations (10–30 μg mL⁻¹) achieving 100% biocontrol efficacy at high concentrations (40 and 50 μg mL⁻¹), compared with control. Using DAS-ELISA technique for detection of TMV (expressed by decreasing in absorbance value), the TMV detection was significantly reduced in plants treated with 6PP at low concentrations compared with plants inoculated with TMV only and it was almost undetectable in plants treated with high concentrations, as well as healthy control plants. Application of 6PP not only increased the accumulation of proline as a non-enzymatic antioxidant compound, but also increased the activities of pathogenesis-related enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase), indicating that 6PP acts as elicitor for induction of resistance in tobacco against TMV. On the molecular level, plants treated with 6PP also showed augmented and rapid expression of defense-related genes including PR-a, PR-b and PR-10. This study was the first to imply the potential of a pyrone compound in biocontrol of plant viral disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aTrichoderma koningii 3aabsorbance 3aantioxidants 3abiological control 3acatechol oxidase 3aelicitors 3aendophytes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afungi 3ainduced resistance 3aperoxidase 3aplant pathology 3aproline 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atobacco 3aviral diseases of plants1 aIsmaiel, Ahmed A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4235-93321 aAhmed, Rania M.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2021 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.81-93dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-020-02142-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245022400160300001600384520038600400592002800786650001400814650001900828650002300847650001000870650004400880650001300924650001000937653002600947653002100973653001900994773015201013856007801165852000901243655001201252IND60522520220221117222953.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052252022DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1973-7-8142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImre, Sedat10aIsochrysophanol-8-methyläther und 5-Hydroxydigitolutein, zwei neue Anthrachinone aus Digitalis viridiflora * / Isochrysophanol-8-methyl-ether and 5-Hydroxydigitolutein, Two New Anthraquinones from Digitalis viridiflora  ap. 439-441.  aDigitolutein and two new anthraquinones were isolated from the roots of Digitalis viridiflora.

The operation of such a reservoir network can serve as a significant source of variability in the local hydrological regime and should be included in research to better understand the interaction between multiple hydrological processes and watershed management. In this study, a reservoir network module that included reservoirs of multiple sizes was developed and fully integrated into the coupled land surface and distributed hydrologic model system (CLHMS), for a detailed description of the hydrological impact of a reservoir network. A generalized release scheme was employed to determine the outflow of both large and small reservoirs. The integrated model was then evaluated against observations and reanalysis data, which indicate that the model can reasonably reconstruct the reservoir operation, streamflow, and other hydrological variables. Results quantitatively demonstrate that a reservoir network can result in an increased streamflow in dry seasons, a decreased streamflow in wet seasons, a generally larger groundwater discharge, higher groundwater level, a slightly damper soil condition, and a larger amount of evapotranspiration at the basin level. With the integrated model, it is feasible to achieve more sustainable watershed planning and management.  aPublisher supplied data  a51709271cNational Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China  a51421006cNational Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China  a2016YFC0402710cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41323001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41761134090cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51539003cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abasins 3adams (hydrology) 3adry season 3aevapotranspiration 3afarms 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3aplanning 3asoil quality 3astream flow 3awater table 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aChina1 aYu, Zhongbo1 aYang, Chuanguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1751-21601 aYang, Mingxiang1 aWang, Wenzhuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3878-09680 tHydrological processes.g2019 June 15, v. 33, no. 12 p.1709-1723dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.134333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011500167300001600282520173300298592002802031650001502059650001502074650002002089650001102109650002702120650002102147650000702168650001902175650001502194650001702209650001402226650001602240650001502256650001302271653004002284653001202324653003102336653001902367653002502386700001802411700001402429700001902443700001302462773008202475856008402557852000902641655001202650IND60545258320221119162450.0170719e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054525832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Yunrong10aSequential shape-selective adsorption and photocatalytic transformation of acrylonitrile production wastewater  ap. 216-225.  aAcrylonitrile production wastewater has been widely recognized as one type of refractory organic wastewater because of its complicated composition and low bioavailability. It usually contains plenty of micromolecular nitrile and pyridine, resulting in high chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. In this study, a novel microporous zeolite, CS-Z1, was developed as an adsorbent for rapidly shape-selective adsorption of the micromolecular pollutants from the acrylonitrile production wastewater, and a visible light-driven Ti-β-Bi2O3 photocatalysis was introduced to sequentially treat the residual macromolecular pollutants for complete purification. The adsorption processes by CS-Z1 were mostly achieved within the first 5 min, and the equilibrium was reached quickly after 30 min, where the CODCr, TOC and TN removal efficiencies of the wastewater were as high as 93.5%, 92.2% and 96.8%, respectively, much higher than those by other adsorbents. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiencies of CS-Z1 were barely affected by the variation of pH value and temperature, which was mainly attributed to the shape-selective adsorption mechanism of the CS-Z1 zeolite. The Ti-β-Bi2O3 photocatalysis could remove more than 95% of the residual macromolecular pollutants in the wastewater, where a synergistic mechanism of reduction–oxidation/polymerization was proposed. In a 108 h of CS-Z1 adsorption and Ti-β-Bi2O3 photocatalysis sequential process, the CODCr, TOC and TN concentrations was reduced to below 20, 7 and 5 mg L−1, respectively, demonstrating the excellent practical potential of the sequential treatment system for acrylonitrile production wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3anitrogen content 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3aporous media 3apyridines 3atemperature 3awastewater 3azeolites 0aAcrylonitrile production wastewater 0aZeolite 0aShape-selective adsorption 0aPhotocatalysis 0aSequential treatment1 aSong, Yonghui1 aTu, Xiang1 aJiang, Yanpeng1 aYuan, Yu0 tWater research.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 85 p.216-225dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100001300193245008600206506007600292506003100368520142300399592002801822596000801850596004901858596000801907596000901915596000901924596003501933506003701968650001502005650001602020650001402036650001902050650002202069650002002091650001202111650001102123650001102134650003002145650001102175650001502186650001302201650002002214650001502234700001502249700001902264700002202283700001602305773008602321856008602407852000902493655001202502IND60734998120221207110505.0220901e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073499812DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btz9082doi7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btz9082chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jing10aeCAMI: simultaneous classification and motif identification for enzyme annotation  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aMotivation Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are extremely important to bioenergy, human gut microbiome, and plant pathogen researches and industries. Here we developed a new amino acid k-mer-based CAZyme classification, motif identification and genome annotation tool using a bipartite network algorithm. Using this tool, we classified 390 CAZyme families into thousands of subfamilies each with distinguishing k-mer peptides. These k-mers represented the characteristic motifs (in the form of a collection of conserved short peptides) of each subfamily, and thus were further used to annotate new genomes for CAZymes. This idea was also generalized to extract characteristic k-mer peptides for all the Swiss-Prot enzymes classified by the EC (enzyme commission) numbers and applied to enzyme EC prediction. Results This new tool was implemented as a Python package named eCAMI. Benchmark analysis of eCAMI against the state-of-the-art tools on CAZyme and enzyme EC datasets found that: (i) eCAMI has the best performance in terms of accuracy and memory use for CAZyme and enzyme EC classification and annotation; (ii) the k-mer-based tools (including PPR-Hotpep, CUPP and eCAMI) perform better than homology-based tools and deep-learning tools in enzyme EC prediction. Lastly, we confirmed that the k-mer-based tools have the unique ability to identify the characteristic k-mer peptides in the predicted enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSF  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cNSF  cUSDA  cUSDA  cUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aamino acids 3abioenergy 3abioinformatics 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aenzymes 3agenome 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amemory 3amotivation 3apeptides 3aplant pathogens 3aprediction1 aZhang, Han1 aZheng, Jinfang1 aDovoedo, Philippe1 aYin, Yanbin0 tBioinformatics.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl56649x1367-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz9083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245006400186300001600250520112200266592002801388650001401416650002201430650001601452650002401468650001701492650001301509650002101522650001401543650001801557650002201575700003101597700001701628700002401645773010001669856004801769852000901817655001201826IND50074406220221120162432.0140402e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007440622DNAL7 a246268112pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1850-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Silvia10aImpact of extracellular RNA on endothelial barrier function  ap. 635-645.  aDifferent types of high and low molecular weight extracellular RNA (eRNA) are liberated from cells upon conditions of tissue damage or vascular diseases and have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro to influence the integrity and barrier function of the vascular endothelium. Among the types of self eRNA studied in this respect, ribosomal RNA appears to engage cytokines to promote hyperpermeability, while counteracting RNase1 serves as a potent vessel-protective factor. Different microRNAs may change the expression program of endothelial cells with consequences for cellular contacts and stability. Non-self viral RNAs are recognized by Toll-like receptors that transmit intracellular inflammation signals to disturb the vascular barrier function, largely in connection with infectious diseases. Although derived from the same nucleotide building blocks, the various forms of eRNA exhibit a multitude of molecular interactions with the endothelium that may drastically change its phenotypical characteristics. The impact of eRNA on vascular integrity in health and disease is summarized in this concise review.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytokines 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3ainfectious diseases 3ainflammation 3amicroRNA 3amolecular weight 3areceptors 3aribosomal RNA 3avascular diseases1 aCabrera-Fuentes, Hector A.1 aNoll, Thomas1 aPreissner, Klaus T.0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Mar., v. 355, no. 3 p.635-645dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1850-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012800167300001300295520156100308592002801869650002001897650002901917650001501946650001701961650001601978650001301994650001202007650001402019650001002033650001402043650001602057650001202073650001402085650001202099650001802111650001902129650002502148650000902173650002302182651001302205653000902218653000802227653001702235653001502252653001402267700002302281700002402304700002102328773009302349856008102442852000902523655001202532IND60699251320221116195555.0210117e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069925132DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.330.57502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeneva, Vlada K.10aDescription of Longidorus cholevae sp. n.

The position of L. cholevae sp. n. among other species of the genus was elucidated by using morphological and molecular data. Phylogenetic analyses were performed of D2-D3 expansion domains of the 28S rRNA and the partial ITS1 containing regions by Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods. The species is characterised by a female body length of 6.1–8.1 mm; long odontostyle (106–129 μm); lip region wide (21.5–24 μm) rounded and continuous with the body profile; amphidial pouches short and wide, funnel-shaped; a posteriorly situated guide ring (30–37 μm); normal arrangement of pharyngeal glands, and short bluntly rounded to hemispherical tail. Four juvenile stages indentified, first stage with elongate conoid tail. Males with 2–4 adanal pairs and a row of 11–13 single ventromedian supplements, spicules 96–120 μm long. Based both on morphological and molecular data the new species appearred to be the most similar witha group of species distributed in Europe sharing common charcters such as amphidial fovea, lip region and tail shapes, and having similar odontostyle and body length: L. poessneckensis, L. caespiticola, L. macrososma, L. helveticus, L. carniolensis and L. pius.

Although significant advances have been achieved for the diagnosis of malaria, these technologies are still far from ideal, being time consuming, complex and poorly sensitive as well as requiring separate assays for sample processing and detection. Therefore, the development of a fast and sensitive method that can integrate sample processing with detection of malarial infection is desirable. Here, we report a two-stage sample-to-answer system based on nucleic acid amplification approach for detection of malaria parasites. It combines the Dimethyl adipimidate (DMA)/Thin film Sample processing (DTS) technique as a first stage and the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer-Isothermal solid-phase DNA Amplification (MZI-IDA) sensing technique as a second stage. The system can extract DNA from malarial parasites using DTS technique in a closed system, not only reducing sample loss and contamination, but also facilitating the multiplexed malarial DNA detection using the fast and accurate MZI-IDA technique. Here, we demonstrated that this system can deliver results within 60min (including sample processing, amplification and detection) with high sensitivity (<1 parasite μL⁻¹) in a label-free and real-time manner. The developed system would be of great potential for better diagnosis of malaria in low-resource settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adisease control 3agene amplification 3amalaria 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aparasites 0aMalaria parasites 0aTropical disease 0aSample processing 0aMach-Zehnder interferometer 0aIsothermal DNA amplification1 aNam, Jeonghun1 aKim, Sangho1 aLim, C.

Since the last reclassification of Anaplasmataceae twenty years ago, two new Anaplasma species have been identified. To date, the genus includes eight Anaplasma species (A. phagocytophilum, A. marginale, A. centrale, A. ovis, A. bovis, A. platys, A. odocoilei, and A. capra) and a large number of unclassified genovariants that cannot be assigned to known species. Members of the genus can cause infection in humans and a wide range of domestic animals with different degrees of severity. Long-term persistence which, in some cases, is manifested as cyclic bacteremia has been demonstrated for several Anaplasma species. Zoonotic potential has been shown for A. phagocytophilum, the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and for some other Anaplasma spp. that suggests a broader medical relevance of this genus. Genetic diversity of Anaplasma spp. has been intensively studied in recent years, and it has been shown that some Anaplasma spp. can be considered as a complex of genetically distinct lineages differing by geography, vectors, and host tropism. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge concerning the natural history, pathogenic properties, and genetic diversity of Anaplasma spp. and some unclassified genovariants with particular attention to their genetic characteristics. The high genetic variability of Anaplasma spp. prompted us to conduct a detailed phylogenetic analysis for different Anaplasma species and unclassified genovariants, which were included in this review. The genotyping of unclassified genovariants has led to the identification of at least four distinct clades that might be considered in future as new candidate species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIxodidae 3aanaplasmosis 3abacteremia 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ageography 3ahumans 3anatural history 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomic revisions 3azoonoses 0aAnaplasma spp. 0aReservoir hosts 0aIxodidae 0aPathogenicity 0aGenetic diversity 0aPhylogeny1 aTkachev, Sergey1 aTikunova, Nina0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 July, v. 91 p.104833-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1048333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010300159300001600262520051700278592002800795650001100823650001600834650001400850650002000864653002400884653001700908653001400925653002500939700002000964773015200984856007801136852000901214655001201223IND60522520520221117222917.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052252052DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1973-7-8172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoltz, J.,10aBürzeldrüsensekrete von Webervögeln (Ploceidae) / The Uropygial Gland Secretion of Weaver-birds  ap. 452-455.  aThe uropygial gland wax of the genus Ploceus is found to be mainly one wax consisting of 2,4- dimethyl-heptanoic acid and n-octadecanol.

The β-glucosidase gene bglC from Thermobifida fusca YX was cloned into a cell surface display vector pGV3, resulting in pGV3-bglC. Recombinant E. coli JM109 harboring the pGV3-bglC showed β-glucosidase activity (18.9 ± 5.7 U/OD600), indicating the cell surface functioning of mutant β-glucosidase. pH-stat cultivation using d-lactic acid producer E. coli BW25113 (ΔpflA) harboring pGV3-bglC in minimum medium with 10 g/L cellobiose in a jar fermentor under anaerobic condition resulted in 5.2 ± 0.1 g/L of d-lactic acid was obtained after 84 h cultivation, indicating that the engineered E. coli produced d-lactic acid directly from cellobiose. For continuous d-lactic acid production, cell recycle fermentation was conducted under anaerobic condition and the culture was continuously ultrafiltrated with a hollow fiber cartridge. The permeate was drawn to the reservoir and a minimum medium containing 10 g/L cellobiose was fed to the fermentor at the same rate (dilution rate, 0.05 h−1). Thus, this system maintained the d-lactic acid production (4.3–5.0 g/L), d-lactic acid production rate (0.22–0.25 g/L/h), and showed no residual cellobiose in the culture during 72 h operation. Interestingly, the d-lactic acid production rate in cell recycle fermentation was more than 3 times higher than that in the batch operation (0.06 ± 0.00 g/L/h).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aThermobifida fusca 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellobiose 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3afermenters 3aformate C-acetyltransferase 3agenes 3alactic acid 3amutants 0aCellobiose 0aCell recycle 0aEscherichia coli 0aLactic acid 0aSurface display1 aTsubaki, Mikikazu1 aDang Long, Bui Hoang1 aMurakami, Ryo1 aNagata, Keisuke1 aOkano, Hirohisa1 aPhuong Dung, Ngo Thi1 aOhara, Hitomi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4235-80570 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2019 Apr., v. 127, no. 4 p.441-446dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245010000185300001400285520123100299592002801530650001501558650001101573650002001584650001001604650001401614650002901628650001001657650001201667650002501679650004701704650003901751650004601790650004101836650003401877650004301911650004001954700001801994700001402012700001602026700002002042700002402062700001602086700001902102773007902121856008202200852000902282655001202291IND60098937620221121175038.0141105e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009893762DNAL7 a221929132pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadar, Neuman12aA screen identifying genes responsive to Dpp and Wg signaling in the Drosophila developing wing  ap. 65-72.  aMorphogens control developmental decisions by regulating the expression of different sets of target genes in specific regions. The products of these genes drive the region specific developmental program and lead to the formation of different adult structures. Therefore, identification of the morphogens downstream target effectors is an essential step in deciphering the mechanisms underlying organ development. In the Drosophila developing wing, signaling by the morphogens Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless (Wg) plays global roles in controlling differentiation, growth, and survival. However, only a handful of their downstream target genes have been identified. Here, we describe a screening method designed to quickly search through large collections of P-Gal4 enhancer-traps for candidate genes that are transcriptionally regulated by Dpp or Wg signaling. Using this screening method, we screened a small collection of lethal P-Gal4 insertion lines that are expressed in the wing disc. We identified 10 novel putative Dpp and/or Wg target genes in the developing wing. Further study of the roles of the genes recognized in this screen should shed light on how morphogens control various processes in organ development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3agene expression 3agenes 3ascreening 3atranscription (genetics) 3awings 2aAnimals 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aImaginal Discsxgrowth & development 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aWingxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism 2aWnt1 Proteinxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aYaron, Suissa1 aOren, Ziv1 aElly, Ordan1 aItamar, Weisman1 aJohnathan, Grossman1 aTama, Dinur1 aOffer, Gerlitz0 tGene.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 494, no. 1 p.65-72dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011200166300001100278500001900289520117900308592002801487596007001515596006301585596010501648596007701753596010701830650002301937650002201960650001601982650001901998650001702017650003102034650001902065650001202084650002102096650001002117700001702127700001802144700001502162700001302177700001502190700001502205700001402220700001902234700001902253700001502272700002002287700001702307700005302324773010602377856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60722513420221116221202.0210115e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072251342DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-020-02744-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shujie10aKASP markers to detect sub-chromosomal arm translocations between 6VS of Haynaldia villosa and 6AS of wheat  ap. 10.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWild relatives represent an important genetic pool for crop improvement. In wheat, a popular strategy for the introduction of alien genes is by manipulation of the Ph1 gene, to induce recombination between homoeologous chromosomes. However, the frequency of such homoeologous recombination is low and requires screening of large progeny samples. Consequently, the efficiency of selection of homoeologous recombinants is important. In this study, we developed two kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers specific for chromosome arms 6VS of Haynaldia villosa L. and 6AS of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., one close to the terminal regions and the other near the centromeres. Of the 121 progeny from plants heterozygous for the 6VS·6AL translocation and homozygous for ph1b screened by the two KASP markers, three (2.5%) have shown an exchange of markers, and their recombinant nature was confirmed by in situ DNA hybridization. A recombinants chromosome with a small 6VS fragment carrying the powdery mildew resistance gene (Pm21) would be useful in wheat breeding. The two KASP markers tested here can be used for efficient detection of recombinants between 6AS and 6VS.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0102000cthe National Key Research and Development Program  a31601300cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a31971884cInnovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a16ZA0028cthe Key Projects of Sichuan Provincial Department of Education  a2019YJ0415cthe Applied Basic Research Programs of Science & technology Department of Sichuan Province 3aDasypyrum villosum 3aTriticum aestivum 3acentromeres 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apowdery mildew 3aprogeny 3aresistance genes 3awheat1 aFan, Chaolan1 aLuo, Jiangtao1 aHuang, Lei1 aXie, Die1 aLi, Yazhou1 aChen, Zhuo1 aJiang, Bo1 aNing, Shunzong1 aYuan, Zhongwei1 aHuang, Lin1 aZhang, Lianquan1 aLiu, Dengcai1 aHao, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2693-38640 tEuphytica.g2021 Jan., v. 217, no. 1 p.10-10dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-020-02744-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017700157300001800334500001900352520163300371592002802004650002102032650001902053650002102072650001702093650001602110650001002126650001902136650001802155650001902173650001902192650001502211700001602226700001402242700001702256773012302273856007402396852000902470655001202479IND60726464320221120085734.0210205e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072646432DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra09147b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haishuai10aFabrication of AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/graphitic carbon nitride heterojunctions for enhanced visible light photocatalytic decomposition of methylene blue, methylparaben and E. coli  ap. 6383-6394.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, a novel ternary nanocomposite AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/g-C₃N₄ was successfully synthesized via sedimentation precipitation and ion exchange method. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/g-C₃N₄ nanocomposite was investigated via photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB), methylparaben (MPB) and inactivation of E. coli under visible light irradiation. The AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/g-C₃N₄ composite presented the optimal photocatalytic performance, degrading almost 100% MB and 100% MPB, respectively. The excellent stability of AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/g-C₃N₄ was also verified in the cycle operations; the degradation efficiency of MPB could still be maintained at 85.3% after five cycles of experiments. Moreover, the AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/g-C₃N₄ composite displayed more superior photocatalytic inactivation efficiency with 100% removal of E. coli (7-log) in 20 min under visible light irradiation. The efficient photo-generated charge separation originated from a strong interaction in the intimate contact interface, which was confirmed by the results of photocurrent and EIS measurements. In addition, radical trapping experiments revealed that hole (h⁺) was the predominant active species in the photocatalytic system. Based on the experimental results, a photocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of parabens over AgCl/Ag₃PO₄/g-C₃N₄ was also proposed. We believe that this work provides new insights into the multifunctional composite materials for the applications in solar photocatalytic degradation of harmful organic compounds and common pathogenic bacteria in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acarbon nitride 3aelectric current 3aion exchange 3airradiation 3alight 3amethylene blue 3amethylparaben 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3awastewater1 aCai, Linlin1 aWang, Xin1 aShi, Huixian0 tRSC advances.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 11, no. 11 p.6383-6394dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra09147b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016600168300001300334520219800347592002802545650002202573650001402595650001402609650001502623650001102638650001002649650002002659653002902679653003302708653002302741653001102764653002502775700005502800700005802855700001702913773010102930856008403031852000903115655001203124IND60612963320221119094437.0190328e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061296332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHampel, Andrea10aFinite-element modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA): Use of elastic foundations at material boundaries versus the geometrically non-linear formulation  ap. 1-14.  aCommercial finite-element software packages like ABAQUS are widely used for geodynamic modelling, which usually requires considering isostatic effects, for example, to calculate displacements and stresses resulting from glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Since Wu (Geophysical Journal International, 158, 401–408, 2004) proposed that models created with commercial finite-element software need to implement elastic ("Winkler") foundations at all external and internal material boundaries to account for restoring forces, this approach has been applied by many GIA and other geoscientific studies. However, there is no consensus about the necessity of implementing elastic foundations, which have the disadvantage that the stress output needs post-processing to obtain meaningful results. Here we demonstrate that the elastic-foundation approach was derived from an Eulerian formulation of the equation of motion for elastic and viscoelastic materials. Finite-element codes like ABAQUS, however, use a Lagrangian formulation, which renders the implementation of elastic foundations at all material boundaries unnecessary if the geometrically non-linear formulation (NLGEOM) is used. Results from viscoelastic half-space models show that for incompressible viscoelastic materials models with elastic foundations (but no NLGEOM) and models with NLGEOM (but no elastic foundations) yield vertical displacements underneath the load that differ by less than 1% from the analytical solution. Both models reach a state of isostatic equilibrium. In contrast, models without NLGEOM and elastic foundations do not reach isostatic equilibrium, i.e. the model surface continuously subsides under the load. Models with both NLGEOM and elastic foundations behave overly stiff and yield wrong displacement fields. Results from models based on Archimedes' principle demonstrate that restoring forces are correctly calculated when using NLGEOM, which has the advantage that the stress output can be used without post-processing and that negative density contrasts (e.g. between salt and surrounding rocks) can be taken into account within the model domain, which is impossible when using elastic foundations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3aequations 3ageophysics 3amodels 3arocks 3aviscoelasticity 0aFinite-element modelling 0aGlacial isostatic adjustment 0aElastic foundation 0aABAQUS 0aGeodynamic modelling1 aLüke, Jens1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5712-01801 aKrause, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4304-71541 aHetzel, Ralf0 tComputers & geosciences.g2019 Jan., v. 122 p.1-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245012900188300001800317520162700335592002801962650001601990650001902006650001602025650001402041650001902055650001002074650002002084650000902104650002002113650001702133650002102150650001702171650001302188650002002201700002102221700002302242700002202265773010002287856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60112851820221116193225.0141111e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011285182DNAL7 a252662172pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-014-4141-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmoud, Tamer Y.10aPropolis enhances the effectiveness of praziquantel in experimental schistosomiasis: biochemical and histopathological study  ap. 4513-4523.  aDespite the wide current use of praziquantel (PZQ) in treatment of schistosomiasis, low cure rates have been recorded in many studies. The aim of this study was directed to evaluate the curative effect of propolis (Pps) alone or in combination with PZQ on biochemical, immunological, parasitological, and histological changes associated with experimental schistosomiasis in mice. Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice were divided into two experimental sets, each with four subgroups: (i) untreated, (ii) treated with Pps/day p.o for 4 weeks, (iii) treated with PZQ p.o 2 × 500 mg/kg bd wt, and (iv) treated with Pps + PZQ as in group ii and iii; all treatments started on the 8th week postinfection, in addition to uninfected group as control for the previous groups. Treatment of infected mice with Pps, although failed to eradicate the worm, significantly reduced the hepatic granuloma number, their lymphocytic infiltration and aggregation, hepatic and splenic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and plasma, and liver and thymus nitric oxide (NOx) levels together with normalization of plasma proteins and alleviation of oxidative stress in the examined tissues as evidenced by reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and normalization of glutathione (GSH). Promising results were obtained when Pps was given in combination with PZQ, where the anti-schistosomal activity of PZQ was markedly potentiated with complete alleviation and amelioration of the histological and biochemical alteration associated with schistosomiasis. This study highlights the potential usefulness of Pps as an adjunct to PZQ in schistosomiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma 3ablood proteins 3aglutathione 3agranuloma 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apraziquantel 3apropolis 3aschistosomiasis1 aRizk, Sherine M.1 aMaghraby, Amany S.1 aShaheen, Amira A.0 tParasitology research.g2014 Dec., v. 113, no. 12 p.4513-4523dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-014-4141-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245011100187300001600298520160100314592002801915650001001943650001301953650001001966650001801976650002201994650001602016650001502032650002802047650001902075650001602094650001202110700002102122700003102143700002302174700002002197700002002217773010002237856004802337852000902385655001202394IND50074406520221120204232.0140402e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007440652DNAL7 a246436782pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-014-1856-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnittler, Hans10aActin filament dynamics and endothelial cell junctions: the Ying and Yang between stabilization and motion  ap. 529-543.  aThe vascular endothelium is a cellular interface between the blood and the interstitial space of tissue, which controls the exchange of fluid, solutes and cells by both transcellular and paracellular means. To accomplish the demands on barrier function, the regulation of the endothelium requires quick and adaptive mechanisms. This is, among others, accomplished by actin dynamics that interdependently interact with both the VE-cadherin/catenin complex, the main components of the adherens type junctions in endothelium and the membrane cytoskeleton. Actin filaments in endothelium are components of super-structured protein assemblies that control a variety of dynamic processes such as endo- and exocytosis, shape change, cell–substrate along with cell–cell adhesion and cell motion. In endothelium, actin filaments are components of: (1) contractile actin bundles appearing as stress fibers and junction-associated circumferential actin filaments, (2) actin networks accompanied by endocytotic ruffles, lamellipodia at leading edges of migrating cells and junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia (JAIL) that dynamically maintain junction integrity, (3) cortical actin and (4) the membrane cytoskeleton. All these structures, most probably interact with cell junctions and cell–substrate adhesion sites. Due to the rapid growth in information, we aim to provide a bird’s eye view focusing on actin filaments in endothelium and its functional relevance for entire cell and junction integrity, rather than discussing the detailed molecular mechanism for control of actin dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadhesion 3ablood 3acell adhesion 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3aexocytosis 3aintercellular junctions 3amicrofilaments 3apseudopodia 3asolutes1 aṬāhā, Muná,1 aSchnittler, Maria Odenthal1 aTaha, Abdallah Abu1 aLindemann, Nico1 aSeebach, Jochen0 tCell and tissue research.g2014 Mar., v. 355, no. 3 p.529-543dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-014-1856-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013700162300001400299520142100313592002801734650000801762650001501770650001601785650002001801650002601821650002101847650001101868653003101879653002401910653001201934653002001946653001401966700001501980700001701995700001502012700002102027700001502048700001902063773010902082856008302191852000902274655001202283IND60553564020221118030315.0180831e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055356402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aToehold enabling stem-loop inspired hemiduplex probe with enhanced sensitivity and sequence-specific detection of tumor DNA in serum  ap. 32-39.  aThe sensitivity of structure-switchable electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensors is generally limited by the irremovable redox labels that are close to or distant from the sensing interface. To address this issue, we design a semiduplex probe inspired by the stem-loop structure, in which the “nicked loop” domain can serve as toehold to mediate a target-responsive strand-displacement reaction. Such a reaction can fundamentally eliminate the post-responsive background current that arises from the irremovable probe, and thus improve the sensitivity. This novel toehold E-DNA (tE-DNA) sensor is able to achieve a detection limit as low as 0.2pM, which is lower than that of the classic stem-loop structured sensor by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the toehold domain endows the sensor an excellent selectivity against a single-base mismatched sequence and high binding kinetics. By combining this heterogeneous surface-based dynamic self-assembly design with a homogeneous enzyme amplification strategy, the sensitivity can be further improved by three orders of magnitude to sub-femtomolar level. Additionally, this unique biosensor presents reliable reusability, and is capable of probing low abundance of target DNA directly in complex matrices, such as human serum, with minimal interference. These advantages make our tE-DNA sensor a promising contender in the E-DNA sensor family for clinical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 0aElectrochemical DNA sensor 0aStem-loop structure 0aToehold 0aExonuclease Ⅲ 0aTumor DNA1 aWang, Siqi1 aZhang, Yulin1 aTang, Lina1 aJin, Dan,d1930-1 aNing, Yong1 aZhang, Guo-Jun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2016 Aug. 15, v. 82 p.32-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245012500192300001800317500002000335520146300355592002801818596005901846596005901905596005901964596005902023596012502082596011202207596007602319596008702395650001302482650001402495650001302509650001002522650001502532650001202547650001402559650001102573650002102584650001602605650001302621650002202634650002002656650001202676650001802688650002302706650001502729651001502744700001502759700002102774700001702795700001302812700001202825700001202837700001702849773013002866856007302996852000903069655001203078IND60645906020221117160234.0190604e20190615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064590602DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.134292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Huawu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3938-576710aSpatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) in surface waters of arid, mountainous Central Asia  ap. 1658-1669.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCharacterization of spatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes (δ¹⁸O and δ²H) of surface waters is essential to interpret hydrological processes and establish modern isotope–elevation gradients across mountainous terrains. Here, we present stable isotope data for river waters across Kyrgyzstan. River water isotopes exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity among different watersheds in Kyrgyzstan. Higher river water isotope values were found mainly in the Issyk‐Kul Lake watershed, whereas waters in the Son‐Kul Lake watershed display lower values. Results show a close δ¹⁸O–δ²H relation between river water and the local meteoric water line, implying that river water experiences little evaporative enrichment. River water from the high‐elevation regions (e.g., Naryn and Son‐Kul Lake watershed) had the most negative isotope values, implying that river water is dominated by snowmelt. Higher deuterium excess (average d = 13.9‰) in river water probably represents the isotopic signature of combined contributions from direct precipitation and glacier melt in stream discharge across Kyrgyzstan. A significant relationship between river water δ¹⁸O and elevation was observed with a vertical lapse rate of 0.13‰/100 m. These findings provide crucial information about hydrological processes across Kyrgyzstan and contribute to a better understanding of the paleoclimate/elevation reconstruction of this region.  aPublisher supplied data  a41701036cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41861022cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1603242cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41671200cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  c“One‐Three‐Five” Strategic Planning of Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2018‐KF‐03cOpen Project of State Key Laboratory of Plateau Ecology and Agriculture, Qinghai University  aXDA2006030101cPan‐Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road  aNIGLAS2017GH07cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aaltitude 3adeuterium 3aglaciers 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amelting 3amountains 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3ariver water 3asnowmelt 3aspatial variation 3astable isotopes 3astreams 3asurface water 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds 3aKyrgyzstan1 aWu, Jinglu1 aSakiev, Kadyrbek1 aLiu, Jinzhao1 aLi, Jing1 aHe, Bin1 aLiu, Ya1 aShen, Beibei0 tHydrological processes.g2019 June 15, v. 33, no. 12 p.1658-1669dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.134293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011000168300001600278520069200294592002800986650003101014650001401045650001601059650001701075650001601092650001901108650002201127653001101149653002401160653001601184653001701200700001501217700002201232700001701254700001901271773008201290856008401372852000901456655001201465IND60545258820221119162210.0170719e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054525882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.08.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafuka, Akira10aInteractions of dissolved humic substances with oppositely charged fluorescent dyes for tracer techniques  ap. 193-198.  aTo investigate interactions between oppositely charged fluorescent dyes and dissolved humic substances, fluorescence quenching of fluorescein and rhodamine 6G with dissolved humic substances was performed. Binding coefficients were obtained by the Stern–Volmer equation. The fluorescence of rhodamine 6G was largely quenched by the addition of humic acid and a non-linear Stern–Volmer plot was obtained. This strong quenching may be caused by the electrostatic interaction between cationic rhodamine 6G and humic acid and strengthened by the hydrophobic repulsion. In contrast, the quenching and interactive effects of dissolved humic substances for fluorescein were relatively weak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aequations 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophobicity 3atracer techniques 0aTracer 0aStern–Volmer plot 0aFluorescein 0aRhodamine 6G1 aDing, Qing1 aYamamura, Hiroshi1 aYamada, Koji1 aSatoh, Hisashi0 tWater research.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 85 p.193-198dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01637naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006700161300001600228520053700244592002800781650000800809650002000817650002000837650001000857650002300867650001200890653001600902653002000918653001800938653002100956653001200977700001700989700001801006773015201024856007801176852000901254655001201263IND60522520820221117222918.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052252082DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1973-7-8202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLutz, Dieter10aMethylation of Deoxyribonucleic Acid in Regenerating Rat Liver  ap. 463-465.  aIn double label pulse experiments DNA methylation was compared to DNA synthesis after partial hepatectomy. 24 hours after the operation the highest ¹⁴C-thymidine incorporation rates were found as well as the highest 5-methylcytosine labelling derived from (³H-methyl) -methionine.

Independent and combined effects of P4 and E2 on endometrium and pituitary were evaluated. In a preliminary study, an exogenous hormone model of proestrus was created by removal of corpus luteum and follicles ≥5 mm followed by gradual removal of intravaginal P4 implants during 18 h and treatment with increasing doses of estradiol benzoate during 48 h to mimic proestrus using high E2 (n = 9) or low E2 (n = 9). Decreased P4, increased E2, and increased endometrial area (EA) simulated proestrus in high-E2 cows and this was used subsequently. The main experiment used a 2 × 2 factorial design with: high E2 and low P4 (n = 11); high E2 and high P4 (n = 11); low E2 and high P4 (n = 11); low E2 and low P4 (n = 10). At 48 h, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release was determined. Variables were analyzed using PROCMIXED of Statistical Analysis System. The EA increased dramatically during 48 h only in high-E2 and low-P4 cows. For FSH, high-E2 cows had greater area under the curve (AUC) and FSH peak after GnRH than low E2, with mild negative effects of high P4. For LH, concentration at peak and AUC were 2-fold greater in high E2 compared to low-E2 groups, with low P4 also 2-fold greater than high-P4 groups. Thus, maximal changes in uterus and pituitary during proestrus depend on both low P4 and high E2, but different physiologic responses are regulated differently by E2 and P4. Changes in endometrium depend on low P4 and high E2, whereas GnRH-induced FSH secretion primarily depends on high E2, and GnRH-induced LH secretion is independently increased by high E2 or reduced by high P4.  aPublisher supplied data  cFAPESP  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorpus luteum 3aendometrium 3aestradiol 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aluteinizing hormone 3amodels 3aproestrus 3aprogesterone 3astatistical analysis1 aMadureira, Guilherme1 aSilva, Lucas O1 aAlves, Rodrigo L O R1 aSilvestri, Mayara1 aDrum, Jéssica N1 aConsentini, Carlos E C1 aPrata, Alexandre B1 aPohler, Ky G1 aWiltbank, Milo C1 aSartori, Roberto0 tBiology of Reproduction.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl1102x0006-33637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioaa0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245017000155300001800325500001900343520124400362592002801606650001801634650001601652650001501668650001501683650001401698650001901712650001301731650001501744650002301759650001401782650001401796700001701810700001801827700001301845700001801858700001401876700001901890700002101909700001801930700001201948773012301960856007402083852000902157655001202166IND60726464520221122042344.0210205e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072646452DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra09389k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yuan10aControlled preparation of a MCC-g-AM/EDA/PA loaded Fe(iii) adsorbent by the pre-radiation grafting method and its application for the adsorption removal of phosphate  ap. 6173-6181.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new spherical cellulose-based adsorbent and high phosphate removal rate microcrystalline cellulose-g-acrylamide/ethylenediamine/phthalic anhydride (MCC-g-AM/EDA/PA) loaded Fe(iii) adsorbent was prepared by a pre-radiation grafting and chemical modification method. Fe(iii) was successfully introduced into the modified grafted chains of the MCC-g-AM/EDA/PA resin, and characterized by FTIR, TG, XRD, SEM and XPS. The optimized conditions for the grafting reaction of acrylamide (AM) onto MCC were 20% AM emulsion at an absorbed dose of 30 kGy, and a grafting rate as high as 247%. In addition, the adsorption performance of the adsorbent was tested by static adsorption experiments with phosphate. The adsorbent resin showed excellent adsorption performance under alkaline conditions, contributions to the synergetic effect of precipitation, and inner-sphere surface complex reactions. The adsorption efficiency can reach 89.7% at low concentration. In summary, the neotype spherical cellulose-based adsorbent has the advantages of being separation-free in bulk materials, avoiding secondary pollution, and being easy to recycle, and it could be employed as an environmentally friendly adsorbent for phosphate removal in eutrophic water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbed dose 3aacrylamides 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aemulsions 3aeutrophication 3aneotypes 3aphosphates 3aphthalic anhydride 3apollution 3asynergism1 aYang, Jin-Yu1 aLi, Ting-Ting1 aLiu, Guo1 aWang, Ya-Yang1 aJiang, Yu1 aWang, Zheng-Xi1 aZhang, Fang-Fang1 aLi, Yue-Sheng1 aLiu, Yi0 tRSC advances.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 11, no. 11 p.6173-6181dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra09389k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024003500126040001800161100000300179245011900182506007600301506003100377520174100408592002802149596004702177506003702224650001802261650001402279650002002293650001402313650001702327650001602344650001702360650002102377650001402398650001402412700000302426700000302429700000302432700000302435700000302438773007702441856007902518852000902597655001202606IND60734998620221207105654.0221002e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073499862DNAL7 a10.1093/biolre/ioaa1322doi7 a10.1093/biolre/ioaa1322chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 10aPig conceptuses secrete interferon gamma to recruit T cells to the endometrium during the peri-implantation period  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe emerging paradigm in the immunology of pregnancy is that implantation of conceptuses does not progress in an immunologically suppressed environment. Rather, the endometrium undergoes a controlled inflammatory response during implantation as trophectoderm of elongating and implanting pig conceptuses secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFNG). Results of this study with pigs revealed: (1) accumulation of immune cells and apoptosis of stromal cells within the endometrium at sites of implantation during the period of IFNG secretion by conceptuses; (2) accumulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive T cells within the endometrium at sites of implantation; (3) significant increases in expression of T cell co-signaling receptors including programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1), CD28, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), as well as chemokines CXCL9, 10, and 11 within the endometrium at sites of implantation; (4) significant increases in T cell co-signaling receptors, PDCD1 and ICOS, and chemokine CXCL9 in the endometrium of cyclic gilts infused with IFNG; and (5) identification of CD4+ (22.59%) as the major T cell subpopulation, with minor subpopulations of CD8+ (1.38%), CD4+CD25+ (1.08%), and CD4+CD8+ (0.61%) T cells within the endometrium at sites of implantation. Our results provide new insights into the immunology of implantation to suggest that trophectoderm cells of pigs secrete IFNG to recruit various subpopulations of T cells to the endometrium to contribute to a controlled inflammatory environment that supports the active breakdown and restructuring of the endometrium in response to implantation of the conceptus.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3achemokine CXCL9 3aconceptus 3acytotoxicity 3aendometrium 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3apregnancy 3asecretion1 1 1 1 1 0 tBiology of Reproduction.dOxford University Press (OUP)x0006-33637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioaa1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009400166300001300260520098300273592002801256650001801284650002301302651001101325653001101336653001101347653001401358653001501372653001801387653001401405653001301419653001401432653001601446773009401462856008101556852000901637655001201646IND60699251720221116195533.0210117e20130919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069925172DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.332.47902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurth, David G.10aDiversity of Alticinae in Oaxaca, Mexico: A preliminary study (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae)  ap. 1-32.  aThis is a preliminary study of the diversity of the Flea Beetles (Alticinae) of the Mexican state of Oaxaca based on fieldwork by the author in 1991, 1997, and 2010, the literature, and specimens in several institutional collections. The number of genera and species for Mexico as well as for Oaxaca increased significantly from previous studies. There are now 625 species in 90 genera recorded from Mexico with 275 species in 68 genera recorded from Oaxaca. There are 113 species known only from the state of Oaxaca and another 38 species known only from Oaxaca and the surrounding states. Oaxaca has a relatively high diversity as well as a high percentage of endemism. This study also demonstrates the effects of how even a small amount of fieldwork together with extracting specimen data from institutional collections can significantly increase the total faunistic and diversity knowledge of an area. A complete list of the genera and species known from Oaxaca is included.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomelidae 3aindigenous species 3aMexico 0aMexico 0aOaxaca 0adiversity 0aColeoptera 0aChrysomelidae 0aAlticinae 0aendemism 0afieldwork 0acollections0 tZooKeys.g2013 Sept. 19, v. 332 p.1-32dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.332.47903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010000164520165600264592002801920650001501948650001101963650001101974650001401985650001301999650001002012650002002022650002002042650001602062650001702078650002102095650002402116650001102140650001602151650001502167650001902182650001402201650001302215650001702228650001302245650001402258650002402272650001702296653001502313653001602328653001402344653003002358700001702388700001602405700001702421700001802438700002002456700002102476773009202497856008602589852000902675655001202684IND60719337520221116143956.0210624e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071933752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1219182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Juan10aDeacetylation-activated construction of single quantum dot-based nanosensor for sirtuin 1 assay  aSirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an important histone deacetylase that regulates biological functions ranging from DNA repair to metabolism. The alteration of SIRT1 is associated with a variety of diseases including diabetes, inﬂammation, aging-related diseases, and cancers. Consequently, the detection of SIRT1 activity is of great therapeutic importance. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the deacetylation-activated construction of single quantum dot (QD)-based nanosensor for sensitive SIRT1 assay. This nanosensor is composed of a Cy5-labeled peptide substrate and a streptavidin-coated QD. The peptide with one lysine acetyl group acts as both the Cy5 fluorophore carrier and the substrate for sensing SIRT1. In the presence of SIRT1, it removes the acetyl group in the acetylated peptide, and the resultant deacetylated peptide can react with the NHS-activated biotin reagent (sulfo-NHS-biotin) to form the biotinylated peptide. The multiple biotinylated peptides can assemble on single QD surface via biotin-streptavidin interaction, inducing efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the QD to Cy5, generating distinct Cy5 signal which can be simply quantified by total internal reflection fluorescence-based single-molecule detection. This single QD-based nanosensor can sensitively detect SIRT1 with a detection limit of as low as 3.91 pM, and it can be applied for the measurement of enzyme kinetic parameters and the screening of SIRT1 inhibitors. Moreover, this nanosensor can be used to detect the SIRT1 activity in cancer cells, providing a powerful platform for epigenetic research and SIRT1-targeted drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aassays 3abiotin 3adetection 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3aenergy transfer 3aenzyme kinetics 3aepigenetics 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahistone deacetylase 3alysine 3ameasurement 3ametabolism 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3aquantum dots 3aresearch 3ascreening 3asensors (equipment) 3atherapeutics 0aNanosensor 0aQuantum dot 0aSirtuin 1 0aSingle-molecule detection1 aPan, Li-yuan1 aLi, Yueying1 aZou, Xiaoran1 aLiu, Bing-jie1 aJiang, Binghua,1 aZhang, Chun-yang0 tTalanta.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 224 p.121918-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1219183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245009900179300001600278500001900294520107200313592002801385650001401413650001201427650001901439651001801458653001501476653001401491653001701505653002101522653001601543700003101559773012301590856008401713852000901797655001201806IND60705400420221121154435.0200804e20200724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070540042DNAL7 a10.5252/zoosystema2020v42a202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Campos, Lucas Denadai14aThe Paroecanthini crickets (Orthoptera: Grylloidea: Gryllidae: Oecanthinae) from French Guiana  ap. 355-398.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe crickets of the tribe Paroecanthini Gorochov, 1986 (Orthoptera, Grylloidea, Gryllidae, Oecanthinae) present in the collections of the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris, are studied, including those collected during the “La Planète Revisitée – Mitaraka 2015″ biological survey.

Among the Citrus species, the dried peels of C. japonica, C. maxima, and C. trifoliata are found to be adulterants and substitutes of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Citri Unshius Pericarpium. In order to develop a simple and reliable DNA method for authentication of these two medicinal materials, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was targeted for molecular analysis. A host of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were detected among ITS sequences of five Citrus species. From two SNP sites, two modified specific primers were designed for authentication of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Citri Unshius Pericarpium using multiplex PCR. The established multiplex allele-specific PCR system was proven to be effective for simultaneous authentication of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Citri Unshius Pericarpium. The scheme used in this study could be adapted for determination of the botanical identity and origin of other medicinal materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDNA 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aadulterated products 3aherbal medicines 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aBase Sequence 2aCitrusxgenetics 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxanalysis 2aMedicine, East Asian Traditional 2aMultiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSequence Alignment1 aKim, Min-Kyeoung1 aKim, Yeon-Ju1 aLee, Hee-Neoung1 aJin, Haizhu1 aChen, Jiayu1 aYang, Deok-Chun0 tGene.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 494, no. 1 p.92-95dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100003000156245011000186300001600296506002800312520035100340592002800691506003700719650003500756650001100791650001600802650001100818650001100829650001800840650002500858650000900883650001100892773016500903856009101068852000901159655001201168IND60784906420221207123550.0170815e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078490642DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.1(7).2008.646912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aБараболя, О.

Affinity chromatography methods for immobilization of agrochemicals have been widely used to identify and confirm new targets. However, this method often requires modification of the active molecules which can affect or damage its biological activity, and biomacromolecules, particularly most natural products, are hard to be modified either. In order to overcome the shortcomings of molecular modification, label-free technology has been developed based on evaluating responses to thermal or proteolytic treatments. Combined with the chemical biology technology and molecular biology technology, it has been used in the development of drugs and agrochemicals. Herein, common methods of label-free technology for identification of direct target of agrochemicals are reviewed, including the principle, advantages, limitations and applications in the research of agrochemicals in the last decade. And the methods for validation of candidate targets obtained by the label-free methods are also reviewed, which are important to obtain the accurate and reliable targets. Combined application of these methods will greatly reduce the experimental costs and shorten the period for the new target identification and validation by improving its accuracy, which will provide a systematic solution for new ecological agrochemicals research and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3aagrochemicals 3abioactive properties 3afood production 3amolecular biology 3aproteolysis 3aresearch and development 0aTarget discovery 0aTarget validation1 aLiu, Ning1 aChen, Lai1 aGeng, Shuo1 aFan, Zhijin1 aXing, Jihong0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.1475-1483dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.2373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011100165300001100276500001900287520218700306592002802493596005902521650001602580650002302596650002302619650001802642650001202660650001002672650002102682650001302703650002402716650002502740650001702765650002402782650000902806700001402815700001702829700001402846700002102860700001902881700005602900773010602956856008303062852000903145655001203154IND60722513920221116221025.0210115e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072251392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-020-02737-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Wenqing10aQuantitative trait loci analysis of nitrate-nitrogen content in Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)  ap. 15.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aItalian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) is widely cultivated in temperate regions owing to its excellent producibility and digestibility. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth; however, the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers can lead to excessive accumulation of nitrate-nitrogen in Italian ryegrass, which can prove to be lethal for ruminants. To study the genetic control of the nitrate-nitrogen content in Italian ryegrass, an Italian ryegrass line LNG8 (with low 0.12% dry matter (DM) of nitrate-nitrogen) and a second line JFIR12 (with a “normal” 0.20% DM of nitrate-nitrogen) were pair-crossed and 190 F₂ individuals derived from these were used to construct an SSR-based linkage map for conducting QTL analysis. A linkage map was constructed based on 212 Lolium SSR markers. The female parental map consisted of seven linkage groups (LGs) and had a total length of 714.1 cM with 178 loci and an average map density of 4.0 cM. The male parental map consisted of 7 LGs and had a total length of 737.4 cM with 199 loci and an average map density of 3.7 cM. We measured the nitrate-nitrogen content of the mapping population in three replicates (including the main stem and two tillers separated from the main stem) at the six-leaf stage. The nitrate-nitrogen content of the mapping population followed a normal distribution with a marginal skewness toward the lower parent. Our analysis revealed the presence of six QTLs on three LGs. A major QTL on LG1 was detected in all three replicates in both two-parental maps, which could explain 19.4%–29.9% of the phenotypic variation. Furthermore, based on the information of model plant species such as rice and Arabidopsis, we cloned six nitrogen metabolism-related genes and attempted to locate these on our linkage maps; however, none of these six genes were located in the demarcated QTL regions. These results will be useful for understanding the genetic bases of nitrate-nitrogen content in Italian ryegrass and the molecular cloning of QTLs for determination of nitrate-nitrogen content. The flanking markers of the QTLs will be helpful for breeding Italian ryegrass with low nitrate-nitrogen content.  aPublisher supplied data  a31571733cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aLolium multiflorum 3achromosome mapping 3adigestibility 3afemales 3amales 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anormal distribution 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant growth 3aquantitative traits 3arice1 aZhang, Di1 aYuyama, Nana1 aChen, Jun1 aSugita, Shinichi1 aKawachi, Tahei1 aCai, Hongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4082-66270 tEuphytica.g2021 Jan., v. 217, no. 1 p.15-15dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-020-02737-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245010400184300001600288520095400304592002801258650002701286650003801313650000901351650000901360650002201369650000901391650001001400650001401410650001001424650001001434650001101444650001301455650001401468650003801482650003101520650004101551650003201592650001101624650002001635650004301655650002201698700001701720700001801737700001901755700001701774700002001791700001701811700001601828773008101844856008201925852000902007655001202016IND60098938120221121182349.0141105e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009893812DNAL7 a221787652pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seungok10aGenotype–phenotype correlation of a 5q22.3 deletion associated with craniofacial and limb defects  ap. 105-108.  aWe describe here a newborn with a de novo 22.6Mb interstitial deletion of chromosome 5q22.3.

From statistical and graphical analyses, it is concluded that the probability of earthquake occurrence is maximum when the defined parameter lies within the range of 0–75 (lower range). In the higher ranges, earthquake occurrence probability gradually decreases. A probable explanation is also suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3aearthquakes 3aprobability 3amonitoring 0aearth system science1 aMIDYA, S K0 tJournal of earth system science.g2014 Feb., v. 123, no. 1 p.63-71dSpringer-Verlagx0253-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-013-0372-1  aDNAL 7aarticle04367naa a2201573 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245016100206520101300367592002801380650001601408650001001424650001301434650002201447650001101469650001401480650001701494650002001511650001501531650001001546650002001556650002101576650002501597650001801622650001501640650000901655653001501664653003001679653002201709653003901731653001801770653003001788653001801818653002101836653001301857653000701870653000901877653000801886653000801894653000901902653000801911653000901919653000701928653000901935653000801944653000801952653000901960653000801969653000801977653000801985653000801993653000902001653000702010653000802017653000902025653000802034653000902042653000802051653000802059653000802067653000802075653000902083653000702092653000902099653000802108653000802116653000902124653000902133653001302142653000902155653000902164653000802173653000902181653000802190653000802198653000902206653000802215653001202223653000902235653000702244653000802251653001102259653000802270653000802278653000802286653000802294653000902302653000802311653001202319653000802331653000802339653000802347653000802355653000802363653000802371653000802379653000802387653000802395653000802403653000802411653000802419653000802427653000802435653000802443653000902451653000902460653000702469653000602476653000702482653000702489653000702496653000602503653000702509653000602516653000702522653000602529653000702535653000602542653000702548653000602555653000702561653000602568653000702574653000702581653000602588773009202594856008602686852000902772655001202781IND60719337820221116144015.0210624e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071933782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1219222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTůma, Petr1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3489-954710aDetermination of amino acids by capillary and microchip electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection – Theory, instrumentation and applications  aThis review article summarises aspects of the determination of amino acids using capillary and chip electrophoresis in combination with contactless conductivity detection from their historical beginnings to the present time.

In this article, we have, for the first time, fabricated a 3D printed scaffold with carbohydrate based self-healing interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels-based monolith construct for load bearing meniscus tissue. 3D printed PLA scaffold was surface functionalized and embedded with self-healing IPN hydrogel for interfacial bonding further characterized by micro CT. Using collagen (C), alginate (A) and oxidized alginate (ADA), we developed self-healing IPN hydrogels with dual crosslinking (Ca2+ based ionic crosslinking and Schiff base (A-A, A-ADA)) capability and studied their physicochemical properties. Further, we studied human stem cells behaviour and chondrogenic differentiation potential within these IPN hydrogels. In-vivo heterotopic implantation confirmed biocompatibility of the monolith showing the feasibility of using carbohydrate based IPN hydrogel embedded in 3D printed scaffold for meniscal tissue development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abioprinting 3acalcium 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3achondrogenesis 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aschiff bases 3astem cells 3athree-dimensional printing 3atissue engineering 3atissue scaffolds 3atissue transplantation 0aAlginate 0aIPN hydrogel 0a3D printing 0aMeniscus tissue engineering1 aSharma, Akriti1 aVasantha Kumar, J.1 aSharma, Vineeta1 aGupta, Piyush Kumar1 aVerma, Rama Shanker0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 162 p.1358-1371dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.07.2383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013000167300002000297520160900317592002801926650001501954650001501969650002301984650002502007650002002032650001802052650002102070650001702091650001502108650002502123650001802148700001702166700001802183700002202201700001602223700001702239773014902256856008102405852000902486655001202495IND60522933720221120185040.0170724e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052293372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6399-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhongbing10aPreliminary investigation on the effect of earthworm and vegetation for sludge treatment in sludge treatment reed beds system  ap. 11957-11963.  aSewage sludge treatment is becoming one of the most significant challenges for domestic wastewater management. Optimization of sludge management for reducing sludge handling cost in wastewater treatment plant is highly demanded. Sludge treatment reed bed system (STRB) is an eco-environmentally friendly technology which has a low investment input and reduced costs for operation and maintenance. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of earthworm assistant STRB in terms of sludge dewatering and stabilization of surplus sludge. The results show that draining and evapotranspiration (ET) take the main role for sludge dewatering; with maximum of 77 and 43 % water was removed through draining and ET, respectively. Plants improved ET rate up to 13.1 % in the planted STRB compare with the unplanted STRB. The combination of plants and earthworms increased ET rate of 20.9 % more than the control STRB (unplanted without earthworms). The planted STRB with earthworm reached the lowest water content in accumulated sludge of 46 %. There was a systematic increase of total solids (TS) concentration from 0.5 % in the influent to 25–54 % in the accumulated sludge. Earthworms enhanced the sludge stabilization dramatic with the ratio of volatile solids (VS)/TS decreased from 49 % in the influent to 18 % in the accumulated sludge in the earthworm assistant STRB. The results demonstrated a good efficiency for sludge dewatering and stabilization with the assistant of earthworms in STRBs, which can be an alternative technology for sludge treatment in wastewater treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3adewatering 3aearthworms 3aevapotranspiration 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoperating costs 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3atotal solids 3avegetation 3awastewater treatment 3awater content1 aHu, Shanshan1 aHu, Chengxiao1 aHuang, Liangliang1 aLiu, Hongbo1 aVymazal, Jan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 June, v. 23, no. 12 p.11957-11963dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6399-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011700153300002000270520089700290592002801187650001101215650002001226650002101246650001101267650001701278650001501295650001901310650000701329650002401336650002201360650001101382700001801393700001701411700001301428773012401441856007401565852000901639655001201648IND60664770920221119182735.0190912e20140307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066477092DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra46239k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, He10aSpecific Cu(ii) detection using a novel tricarbazolyl-tristriazolotriazine based on photoinduced charge transfer  ap. 13161-13166.  aTricarbazolyl-tristriazolotriazine, a novel Cu(ii)-sensing and selective fluorescent sensor, was designed and synthesised on the basis of the mechanism of photoinduced charge transfer. The synthesised compound exhibits highly sensitive and significant fluorescence decline response towards Cu²⁺ over other metal ions, with a detection limit of 0.2 μM in THF–H₂O (9 : 1, v/v) at neutral pH. Its optical, thermal, electrochemical and morphological properties were studied. The results demonstrate that the compound has high relative fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.99) in xylene solution, excellent thermal stability (Td = 325 °C, Tg = 99.9 °C), wide energy gap (Eg = 4.09 eV), desirable triplet energy (ET = 2.98 eV) and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy (−5.67 eV).

Typically in translational control, an RNA-binding protein binds to a unique sequence in the mRNA to regulate protein synthesis by the ribosomes. Alternatively, a protein may bind to or modify a translation factor to globally regulate protein synthesis by the cell. Here, we review translational control by the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the absence of which causes the neurological disease, fragile X syndrome (FXS).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-binding proteins 3abacteria 3agene expression 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3anervous system diseases 3anucleotide sequences 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics) 0aFragile X syndrome 0aFragile X mental retardation protein 0aRibosome 0aTranslation 0aRNA 0aNeuron1 aJoseph, Simpson0 tBiochimie.g2015 July, v. 114 p.147-154dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2015.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009800155500001900253520183600272592002802108650002302136650002002159650001402179650001502193650001302208650001302221650002302234650001702257650001702274650001302291700002102304773012002325856007302445852000902518655001202527IND60738935920221120193232.0210524e20210507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073893592DNAL7 a10.3390/v130508492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanj, Saly 10aConvalescent Plasma Transfusion for the Treatment of COVID-19 in Adults: A Global Perspective  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMore than one year into the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare systems across the world continue to be overwhelmed with soaring daily cases. The treatment spectrum primarily includes ventilation support augmented with repurposed drugs and/or convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) from recovered COVID-19 patients. Despite vaccine variants being recently developed and administered in several countries, challenges in global supply chain logistics limit their timely availability to the wider world population, particularly in developing countries. Given the measured success of conventional CPT in treating several infections over the past decade, recent studies have reported its effectiveness in decreasing the duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. In this review, we conduct a literature search of published studies investigating the use of CPT to treat COVID-19 patients from January 2020 to January 2021. The literature search identified 181 records of which 39 were included in this review. A random-effects model was used to aggregate data across studies, and mortality rates of 17 vs. 32% were estimated for the CPT and control patient groups, respectively, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.49. The findings indicate that CPT shows potential in reducing the severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms. However, early intervention (preferably within 3 days), recruitment of donors, and plasma potency introduce major challenges for its scaled-up implementation. Given the low number of existing randomized clinical trials (RCTs, four with a total of 319 patients), unanticipated risks to CPT recipients are highlighted and discussed. Nevertheless, CPT remains a promising COVID-19 therapeutic option that merits internationally coordinated RCTs to achieve a scientific risk–benefit consensus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3ahealth services 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3apandemic 3apatients 3astatistical models 3asupply chain 3atherapeutics 3avaccines1 aAl-Omari, Basem 0 tViruses.g2021 May 07, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130508493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014900174520173000323592002802053650002002081650001702101650003102118650001502149650001102164650002002175650000902195650001402204653003102218653002602249653004102275700002402316700002502340700002202365700002202387700006102409700002402470773009802494856008202592852000902674655001202683IND60662819020221117110450.0211129e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066281902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1168332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalabresi, Marcos F.F.10aChanges in colonic contractility in response to inflammatory bowel disease: Long-term assessment in a model of TNBS-induced inflammation in rats  aInflammatory bowel disease is a chronic relapsing inflammation that affects the gastrointestinal tract, causing changes in colonic motility. The evolution of these changes is not completely understood and possibly related to symptoms that appear in different degrees of the intestinal inflammation. Therefore, our aim is evaluate during 14 days of assessment aspects of colonic contractility using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model of inflammation in rats and associate the inflammatory process with colonic motility.Contractility and inflammatory parameters were assessed in the same animal in six different moments: before intestinal inflammation induction, 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 days after induction. The mechanical activity was determined by alternating current biosusceptometry (ACB) and subdivided into rhythmic propagating ripples (RPR) and rhythmic propulsive motor complexes (RPMC). We assessed inflammation by determining myeloperoxidase activity in feces.Transient and permanent changes were observed in colonic motility as a function of the inflammatory process evaluated through myeloperoxidase activity. We identified two contraction profiles: RPR and RPMC. The microscopic analysis demonstrated a depth of damage caused by an injury that was associated with changes in motility.We implemented a robust and adequate (specific) signal processing to quantify two measured colonic frequency patterns. Thus, we performed a detailed temporal analysis of the consequences of TNBS-induced inflammation on colonic motility in rats. Our approach enables further long-term assessments in the same animal with different mechanisms and duration of injury, remission, treatments and their motor consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestines 3amodels 3amyeloperoxidase 3arats 3aremission 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aColonic contractility 0aAlternating current biosusceptometry1 aTanimoto, Alexandre1 aPróspero, André G.1 aMello, Fabio P.F.1 aSoares, Guilherme1 aDi Stasi, Luiz C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7864-10731 aMiranda, José R.A.0 tLife sciences.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 236 p.116833-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1168333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04111naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245008700185300001600272520209600288592002802384650001302412650001502425650002002440650001302460650000902473650001202482650001002494650002202504650001402526650001202540650001302552650001902565650001302584650002502597650002702622650001002649650005502659650004602714650002102760650000902781650004602790650005802836650004602894650001102940650001102951650001102962650000902973650004502982650002903027650002703056650001903083650003203102650002303134700001803157700001303175700001603188700001503204700001803219773012403237856005503361852000903416655001203425IND4470757420221120121617.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447075742DNAL7 a223208892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01229.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, S.10aFeeding difficulties in children with inherited metabolic disorders: a pilot study  ap. 209-216.  aHow to cite this article: Evans S., Alroqaiba N., Daly A., Neville C., Davies P. & MacDonald A. (2012) Feeding difficulties in children with inherited metabolic disorders (IMD): a pilot study. J Hum Nutr Diet. 25, 209–216 ABSTRACT: Background: In children with inherited metabolic disorders (IMD), feeding difficulties are often assumed to be inherent, although there is little evidence describing their frequency or severity. The present study aimed to describe feeding patterns/difficulties among children with IMD on protein‐restricted diets from one centre. Methods: Data from an observational, pilot study of 20 IMD children, nine females (median age, 2.7 years; range, 1–6 years) were compared with data obtained from a retrospective historical group of 15 healthy children (HC), 12 females, aged 1–5 years (median 3.0 years). Caregivers completed a feeding assessment questionnaire, and three separate video recordings were taken of each child eating at home. Results: The main feeding problems identified by the caregivers’ questionnaire in the IMD group (compared to HC) were: poor appetite (55% versus 7%; P = 0.004), limited food variety (55% versus 27%; P = 0.04) and lengthy mealtimes (70% versus 20%; P = 0.006). During mealtimes, children from the IMD group were more likely to vomit, exhibit negative behaviour, get distracted and self‐feed less often. From video recordings of meals, although the median meal duration was similar for the two groups (18 min IMD versus 16 min HC), the HC ate twice the quantity of food (3.4 mouthfuls min−1 versus 1.5 mouthfuls min−1; P < 0.001). During mealtimes, IMD caregivers were less likely to talk to their children (median parent to child communications: IMD group, seven in 10 min; HC, 17 in 10 min). Eighty‐three percent of IMD children regularly ate alone. Conclusions: In children with IMD on protein restrictions, severe feeding difficulties were common. Caregivers need to focus more attention on the social aspects of feeding. Further larger scale studies are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3acaregivers 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3adiet 3afemales 3afoods 3agenetic disorders 3aingestion 3aparents 3aproteins 3aquestionnaires 3avomiting 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aCaregiversxpsychology 2aChild 2aChild Nutrition Disordersxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiet 2aDiet, Protein-Restrictedxadverse effects 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMetabolism, Inborn Errorsxcomplications 2aNutritional Requirements 2aParent-Child Relations 2aPilot Projects 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSocial Environment1 aAlroqaiba, N.1 aDaly, A.1 aNeville, C.1 aDavies, P.1 aMacDonald, A.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2012 June, v. 25, no. 3 p.209-216dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-38717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-277X.2012.01229.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245004800204300002000252506007600272520169500348592002802043506003702071650001002108650001102118650001202129650002002141650001302161650001002174650001102184700002002195700002202215700001802237700001802255773017702273856008302450852000902533655001202542IND4481145520221207100030.0120502e20110913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448114552DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10106541082doi7 aPMC31745982pmcid7 a214029482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolkow, Nora D.10aAddiction: Beyond dopamine reward circuitry  ap. 15037-15042.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDopamine (DA) is considered crucial for the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, but its role in addiction is much less clear. This review focuses on studies that used PET to characterize the brain DA system in addicted subjects. These studies have corroborated in humans the relevance of drug-induced fast DA increases in striatum [including nucleus accumbens (NAc)] in their rewarding effects but have unexpectedly shown that in addicted subjects, drug-induced DA increases (as well as their subjective reinforcing effects) are markedly blunted compared with controls. In contrast, addicted subjects show significant DA increases in striatum in response to drug-conditioned cues that are associated with self-reports of drug craving and appear to be of a greater magnitude than the DA responses to the drug. We postulate that the discrepancy between the expectation for the drug effects (conditioned responses) and the blunted pharmacological effects maintains drug taking in an attempt to achieve the expected reward. Also, whether tested during early or protracted withdrawal, addicted subjects show lower levels of D2 receptors in striatum (including NAc), which are associated with decreases in baseline activity in frontal brain regions implicated in salience attribution (orbitofrontal cortex) and inhibitory control (anterior cingulate gyrus), whose disruption results in compulsivity and impulsivity. These results point to an imbalance between dopaminergic circuits that underlie reward and conditioning and those that underlie executive function (emotional control and decision making), which we postulate contributes to the compulsive drug use and loss of control in addiction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acortex 3acraving 3adecision making 3adopamine 3adrugs 3ahumans1 aWang, Gene-Jack1 aFowler, Joanna S.1 aTomasi, Dardo1 aTelang, Frank0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Sept. 13, v. 108, no. 37 p.15037-15042dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10106541083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011200153300002000265520111700285592002801402650002901430650002001459650001301479650001401492650001201506650002101518650002601539650000901565650001501574650001901589650001301608650001601621650001401637700001601651700001601667700001701683700001301700700001601713700001501729773012401744856007401868852000901942655001201951IND60664771220221119182531.0190912e20140225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066477122DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra46244g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Min10aUltrafine dispersion of a phosphate nucleating agent in a polypropylene matrix via the microemulsion method  ap. 11931-11938.  aTo reduce the nucleator's size and improve its dispersion, microemulsions of sodium 2,2′-methylene bis-(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (NA11) and NA11–sodium benzoate (SB) composite nucleators were prepared by choosing ethanol as NA11's solvent. NA11 nucleator within ethanol was dispersed on the interface of droplets, whose size is ca. tens of nanometers as characterized by dynamic light scattering and cryo-TEM. Investigations on PP's crystallization behavior as well as on the mechanical properties indicate that NA11's nucleation efficiency can be further improved using the microemulsion method. However, the blank microemulsion can adversely affect PP's crystallization and mechanical properties due to its residual oil and surfactant components in the PP matrix. A synergistic effect was found in the NA11–SB composite microemulsion, which shows a smaller size of the dispersed phase and an improvement to PP's stiffness. A possible dispersion mechanism of the nucleator microemulsions in the final PP matrix is proposed according to the microemulsions' structure and their nucleation effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acryo-electron microscopy 3acrystallization 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aethanol 3alight scattering 3amechanical properties 3aoils 3aphosphates 3apolypropylenes 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3asynergism1 aZhang, Yang1 aLi, Jinqing1 aPan, Guoyuan1 aYan, Hao1 aLuo, Yunjun1 aLiu, Yiqun0 tRSC advances.g2014 Feb. 25, v. 4, no. 23 p.11931-11938dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra46244g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011600168520068200284592002800966650002200994650001501016650001501031650001601046650000901062650001001071650003501081650002301116650001701139650001901156650001201175651001001187653001801197653001801215653001501233653001801248653001501266653001301281700001801294700002401312700002401336700001601360700001601376700001901392700001901411700001601430700001501446700001601461773014101477856008401618852000901702655001201711IND60767111920221123020946.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076711192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2022.1017692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Cataldo, S.12aA serosurvey for spotted fever group Rickettsia and Coxiella burnetii antibodies in rural dogs and foxes, Chile  aAntibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) Rickettsia and Coxiella burnetii, investigated through indirect antibody immunofluorescence tests, were detected in serum samples from 3.1% and 0% of 358 rural dogs, respectively, and in none of 32 wild foxes tested.

This point mutation (c.938C>G) was identified in a 45-year-old male with familial DCM and severe impairment of left-ventricular function, but was absent in 300 healthy control subjects. However, its functional significance in the context of heart failure is unclear, as this amino acid substitution was predicted to be without disease-causing effects. In this report, we confirm the low prevalence of mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding sequence of the human melusin gene in patients with DCM, ruling out the possibility that genetic variations in this myocardially transcribed gene may have a significant impact on the epidemiology of DCM-induced heart failure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aamino acid substitution 3acardiomyopathy 3aepidemiology 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aheart failure 3ahumans 3amissense mutation 3apatients 3apoint mutation 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aCardiomyopathy, Dilatedxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aHeart Failurexepidemiologyxetiologyxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMuscle Proteinsxgenetics 2aMutation, Missense 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0aCHORD 0addF 0aDGGE 0aDCM 0aECG 0aEF 0aEYA4 0aITGB1BP2 0aLVEDD 0aMAPK 0aMYBPC3 0aMYPN 0aPCR 0aPolyPhen-2 0aRFLP 0aSSCP 0aTAC 0aDilated cardiomyopathy 0aMelusin 0aGenetic variation 0aMutations1 aMeyer, Thomas1 aRichter, Anette1 aMaisch, Bernhard1 aPankuweit, Sabine0 tGene.g2013 Jan. 10, v. 512 p.206-210dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014300171300001600314520118500330592002801515650002101543650002501564650001601589650001401605650001201619650001101631650001101642650001701653650002201670650001401692650003001706650002501736651001001761700002701771700002301798773011101821856008101932852000902013655001202022IND50089704320221118041039.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008970432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-014-2174-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Ramesh Kumar10aCarotenoid content in vegetative and reproductive parts of commercially grown Moringa oleifera Lam. cultivars from India by LC–APCI–MS  ap. 971-978.  aNon-availability of standards is the main problem in quantification of carotenoids from plants. In this regard, six major carotenoids, i.e. all-E-luteoxanthin, 13-Z-lutein, all-E-lutein, all-E-zeaxanthin, 15-Z-β-carotene and all-E-β-carotene, were purified using open-column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. Using these purified standards, carotenoids from fresh leaves, flowers and fruits of eight commercially grown cultivars of Moringa oleifera were quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. All-E-lutein was found as the major carotenoid in leaves and fruits and accounted for 53.6 and 52.0 % of the total carotenoids, respectively. Among the eight cultivars screened, the cultivar Bhagya (KDM-1) had the maximum amount of all-E-zeaxanthin, all-E-β-carotene and total carotenoids. The methodology used in the present investigation for purification and quantification of carotenoids is simplified and hence finds use in screening of carotenoids in other plants. Results also explore the M. oleifera leaves as a rich source of carotenoids, which is significant for its implications in malnutrition programme to alleviate the vitamin A deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aasexual reproduction 3acarotenoids 3acultivars 3aflowers 3afruits 3aleaves 3amalnutrition 3amass spectrometry 3ascreening 3athin layer chromatography 3avitamin deficiencies 3aIndia1 aShetty, Nandini Prasad1 aGiridhar, Parvatam0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2014 June, v. 238, no. 6 p.971-978dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-014-2174-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014300163300001200306520134300318592002801661650004401689650001501733650001201748650001401760650001601774650003001790650001601820650001901836650000901855650001801864650001301882650002201895700001801917700001701935700001601952773012301968856008102091852000902172655001202181IND60518215920221118193115.0160518e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051821592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2832-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Pinhua10aDual Effects of Humic Acid in Trichloroethylene Removal from Groundwater by Zero-Valent Iron: Hydrophobic Partition and Surface Adsorption  ap. 137.  aNatural organic matter (NOM) in groundwater is a factor of concern in long-term operation of Fe⁰ permeable reactive barrier (PRB). In this study, humic acid, a major component of NOM, showed dual effects in trichloroethylene (TCE) removal from simulated groundwater by Fe⁰ in batch and column experiments. In the initial stage of contacting with Fe⁰, humic acid promoted TCE removal due to its hydrophobic partitioning towards TCE and the subsequent fast adsorption onto Fe⁰ surfaces. In a long run, humic acid inhibited TCE removal because the buildup of adsorbed humic acid on Fe⁰ surfaces passivated Fe⁰ reactivity and limited TCE mass transfer. Ca²⁺ enhanced the co-aggregation of humic acid with Fe⁰ corrosion products and led to a faster depletion of TCE removal capacity by diminishing Fe⁰ matrix porosity. Revealed by FTIR analysis, part of TCE removed through hydrophobic partitioning was retained in humic acid accumulated on Fe⁰ surfaces rather than reductively degraded by Fe⁰. It raises a concern of using Fe⁰ PRB to treat organic contaminants in NOM-rich groundwater. Releasing back of NOM retained organic contaminants might take place once the accumulated NOM is desorbed or detached from Fe⁰ surfaces, resulting in a rebound of organic contaminants in the groundwater beyond the confine of PRB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acorrosion 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophobicity 3airon 3amass transfer 3aporosity 3atrichloroethylene1 aLiu, Tongzhou1 aLiang, Xihua1 aDing, Guoyu0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 May, v. 227, no. 5 p.137-137dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2832-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008500160300001800245520181200263592002802075650002302103650002502126650001302151650001302164650002202177700002002199773012202219856007402341852000902415655001202424IND60664771420221119182539.0190912e20140122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066477142DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra46247a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaruah, Anupaul10aDesigning sequences with varied flexibility and stability through pair mutations  ap. 8031-8038.  aIntrinsic conformational flexibility is a consequence of the rugged energy landscape of the protein which is encoded in its amino acid sequence. In this work, a self-consistent mean-field based theory is developed and applied on lattice and real proteins to design sequences with varying foldability and desired flexibility. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the conformational flexibility of the designed sequences in terms of the relative propensity of the sequence to choose the native state among the ensemble of near-native conformations. The mutation of specific residue pairs in the designed sequences affects their conformational flexibility. Site pairs which exhibit a greater deviation from the corresponding random values of the residue probabilities may be preferentially selected for pair mutation of residues to modulate the flexibility. The mutation of such residue pairs due to evolution may lead to significantly altered conformational flexibility and stability while retaining its sequence identity. This result is supported by experimental evidence [Lehmann et al., Protein Eng., 2000, 13, 49], which suggests that the conserved residues in a set of homologous protein sequences contribute more to the stability of the protein. Mutations of such residue pairs by decreasing the foldability lead to higher flexibility and may mimic protein evolution [Tomatis et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2008, 105, 20605]. The spatial distance between any two residues is minimally correlated to the generation of the mutations. However, long ranged correlation between residue pairs may also be important for specific residue pairs. A higher correlation between residue pairs is noted to be sufficient but not a necessary condition for accommodating higher generations of mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aamino acid sequences 3amutation 3aproteins 3asequence analysis1 aBiswas, Parbati0 tRSC advances.g2014 Jan. 22, v. 4, no. 16 p.8031-8038dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra46247a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019400168300001800362520166900380592002802049650001302077650001202090650001602102650001102118650001302129650001202142650002402154650000902178650000902187650001902196651001002215653002702225653002802252653001002280653002102290653001502311700001602326700001202342700001802354700001502372700001702387773013302404856008502537852000902622655001202631IND60550788220221120075643.0160912e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055078822DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2016.12061202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huihui10aEstimation of Ammonia Volatilization from a Paddy Field after Application of Controlled-Release Urea Based on the Modified Jayaweera–Mikkelsen Model Combined with the Sherlock–Goh Model  ap. 1630-1643.  aThe continuous airflow enclosures with an acid trap method was widely used to investigate ammonia (NH ₃) volatilization in field; however, it could be time-consuming for the estimation of NH ₃ volatilization in field with the application of controlled-release urea (CRU) because NH ₃ volatilization with CRU application could occur during the entire crop growth period. An NH ₃ volatilization estimation method based on the modified Jayaweera–Mikkelsen (J-M) model combined with the Sherlock–Goh model was used to simulate NH ₃ volatilization in a paddy field after 255 kg N ha ⁻¹ as CRU (polymer-coated urea with the concentration of 43% nitrogen, 100% for basal) and urea (70% for basal, 30% for topdressing) during the rice growth period including flooded and non-flooded periods in Wuxi, China. Results indicated that NH ₃ volatilization can be modeled with the proposed measure because no significant difference (P< 0.001) was observed between the simulated values and the observed values; the correlation coefficient (r ²) was 0.615 for CRU and 0.840 for urea during the flooded period, and 0.991 for CRU and 0.946 for urea during the non-flooded period. Compared with urea, NH ₃ volatilization was minimized by 43.2% with the application of CRU based on simulated value within the rice growth period, which was 40.40 kg N ha ⁻¹ for CRU and 78.62 kg N ha ⁻¹ for urea during the flooded period, and 5.52 kg N ha ⁻¹ for CRU and 2.33 kg N ha ⁻¹ for urea during the non-flooded period. Therefore, CRU could be a promising nitrogen fertilizer to prevent NH ₃ losses in the rice paddies at the investigated area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aammonia 3acorrelation 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apaddies 3apolymer-coated urea 3arice 3aurea 3avolatilization 3aChina 0aAmmonia volatilization 0acontrolled-release urea 0amodel 0arice paddy field 0aTaihu Lake1 aHu, Zhengyi1 aLu, Jia1 aLiu, Xiaoning1 aWen, Guoqi1 aBlaylock, A.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2016 Aug. 5, v. 47, no. 13-14 p.1630-1643dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2016.12061203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007600169300001600245520144300261592002801704650001301732650001101745650002501756650001701781650001901798650002301817650001501840650001301855650001801868650001901886650001401905650001801919650001501937650001801952651001701970651001201987700002201999700002602021700002302047700002302070773011102093856008102204852000902285655001202294IND60518216120221118193100.0160409e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051821612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-016-9482-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHribljan, John A.10aPeatland carbon stocks and accumulation rates in the Ecuadorian páramo  ap. 113-127.  aThe páramo is a high altitude tropical Andean ecosystem that contains peatlands with thick horizons of carbon (C) dense soils. Soil C data are sparse for most of the páramo, especially in peatlands, which limits our ability to provide accurate regional and country wide estimates of C storage. Therefore, the objective of our research was to quantify belowground C stocks and accumulation rates in páramo peatland soils in two regions of northeastern Ecuador. Peatland soil cores were collected from Antisana Ecological Reserve and Cayambe-Coca National Park. We measured soil C densities and ¹⁴C dates to estimate soil accumulation rates. The mean peatland soil depth across both regions was 3.8 m and contained an estimated mean C storage of 1282 Mg ha⁻¹. Peatlands older than 3000 cal. year BP had a mean long-term C accumulation rate of 26 g m⁻² year⁻¹, with peatlands younger than 500 cal. year BP displaying mean recent rates of C accumulation of 134 g m⁻² year⁻¹. These peatlands also receive large inputs of mineral material, predominantly from volcanic deposition, that has created many interbedded non-peat mineral soil horizons that contained 48 % of the soil C. Because of large C stocks in Ecuadorian mountain peatlands and the potential disturbance from land use and climate change, additional studies are need to provide essential baseline assessments and estimates of C storage in the Andes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aland use 3amineral soils 3anational parks 3apeatlands 3aradionuclides 3asoil depth 3asoil horizons 3aAndes region 3aEcuador1 aSuárez, Esteban,1 aHeckman, Katherine A.1 aLilleskov, Erik A.1 aChimner, Rodney A.0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2016 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.113-127dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-016-9482-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014900160500002200309520157500331592002801906650001801934650001601952650001601968650001901984650003102003650001402034650002002048650001702068650001802085650000902103650001602112650001502128650001702143650005202160650001102212650001702223650002602240653002802266653001402294653001502308653002802323653001502351653002502366700001402391700001802405700001702423700001602440773008302456856008202539852000902621655001202630IND60662819520221117110213.0190906e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066281952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1168382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Bin13aIL-10-producing B cells attenuate cardiac inflammation by regulating Th1 and Th17 cells in acute viral myocarditis induced by coxsackie virus B3  aPre-press version  aThis work aimed to evaluate the regulatory function of IL-10-producing B cells in viral myocarditis (VMC).We adoptively transferred purified IL-10-producing B cells to VMC mice via the tail vein. We observed the inflammatory responses and cardiac lesions by histological analysis, examined the proportions of spleen Th1 and T17 cells by flow cytometry and expression levels of related transcription factors (T-bet and RORγt) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and calculated the cardiac pathological scores and the mean survival times.IL-10-producing B cells were found to be T cell-dependent in the pathogenesis of VMC. They mainly downregulated T-bet and RORγt mRNA levels to decrease the proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells, thereby restraining the inflammation and damage in the myocardium in B cell-deficient VMC mice. Adoptive transfer of IL-10-producing B cells before VMC induction also normalized the inflammatory responses and prolonged the survival time in wild-type (WT) VMC mice. While the transfer of IL-10-producing B cells on day 3 of VMC alleviated the severity of disease, it did not extend the mean survival time of VMC mice. By contrast, IL-10-producing B cells showed no effect on day 7 of VMC. In conclusion, IL-10-producing B cells downregulate the proportion of Th1 and Th17 cells to alleviate inflammatory damage in the myocardium during VMC before the induction or the early phase of disease.These findings suggest that IL-10-producing B cells may be a new therapeutic target for modulating the immune response in VMC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aEnterovirus 3acaudal vein 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3ahistology 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amyocarditis 3amyocardium 3apathogenesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors 0aIL-10-producing B cells 0aTh1 cells 0aTh17 cells 0aAcute viral myocarditis 0aRegulation 0aCardiac inflammation1 aDeng, Yan1 aHuang, Yanlan1 aGao, Xingcui1 aWu, Weifeng0 tLife sciences.g2019 Sept. 03, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1168383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008000166300001600246520080700262592002801069650001301097650003001110650001601140650001101156650002201167650001501189650001501204700001701219700002001236773012801256856008101384852000901465655001201474IND60614240520221119170905.0181002e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061424052DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674180401582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalugin, A.

Water balance is represented as the result of changes in its components with time. Atmospheric precipitation and its interception on the surface by plants, water accumulation in depressions on the slope, infiltration, and slope runoff are simulated in combination with the processes of vertical water flow to groundwater in the context of system dynamics. Analytical modeling is used as a basis for the representation of the system dynamics in the mode of a simulation modeling of hydrological processes of soil moisture accumulation. Modeling of vertical water flow is based on the semiempirical description of moisture conductivity and retention in the aeration zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aatmospheric precipitation 3agroundwater 3arunoff 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3awater flow1 aKulik, A.

The SLMs were produced by spray chilling with an active material and carrier ratio of 1:5 and 1:10 and in two feed preparations: emulsion and suspension. The rheological parameters of the feeds produced by emulsions were studied, morphological characteristics of the SLMs were examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy, the particle size and distribution were measured via laser light diffraction, and the structural properties of the SLMs were characterized via infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM images showed that SLMs were spherical and agglomerated. The analysis of X-ray diffraction indicated that the microparticles after 90days of storage had β polymorphic form. The preparation methods for feeds, emulsion and suspension, had no influence on the rheological parameters, and the median particle size of the SLMs and interactions between the ingredients were not detected via FTIR spectroscopy; however, the SLMs prepared by emulsion contained pores and had a higher incorporation efficiency of HP. The spray chilling technique is suitable method for microencapsulation of soy protein hydrolysate. So, this technique could be useful for attenuating HP unpleasant taste, for its protection and also for promoting its release in the intestine, during fat digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acold treatment 3aconfocal microscopy 3aemulsions 3afeeds 3aingredients 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amicroencapsulation 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arheological properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoy protein 3ataste 0aSpray chilling 0aSpray cooling 0aSpray congealing 0aRheology 0aEncapsulation 0aPrilling1 aThomazini, Marcelo1 aPelaquim, Fernanda P.1 aUrbano, Alexandre1 aMoraes, Izabel C.F.1 aFavaro-Trindade, Carmen S.0 tFood research international.g2015 Oct., v. 76 p.689-696dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245010000203300001600303506007600319520112200395592002801517506003701545650002801582650002301610650002201633650002601655650001701681650001001698650001101708650001901719650001901738650001901757650002101776700002001797700002301817700002301840773010501863856007501968852000902043655001202052IND60532711420221207143527.0160728e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271142DNAL7 a10.1021/bm201443m2doi7 aPMC38788152pmcid7 a222428972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolinsky, Jesse

In this study, we investigated the structure–property effects of conjugating various hydrophobic biocompatible side chains to poly(glycerol-co-caprolactone) copolymers with the goal of achieving prolonged and controlled release of a chemotherapeutic agent. The choice of side chain significantly affected the resulting polymer properties including thermal transitions, relative crystallinity (ΔHf), and hydrophobicity. Drug-loaded films cast from solutions of polymer and 10-hydroxycamptothecin demonstrated prolonged release from four to over seven weeks depending upon side chain structure without initial burst release behavior. Use of the stearic acid-conjugated poly(glycerol-co-caprolactone) films afforded substantial anticancer activity in vitro for at least 50 days when exposed to fresh cultures of A549 human lung cancer cells over 24 h intervals, correlating well with the measured drug release kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic activity 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aphase transition1 aYohe, Stefan T.1 aColson, Yolonda L.1 aGrinstaff, Mark W.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 13, no. 2 p.406-411dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm201443m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005200152245012100204300001400325520108200339592002801421653002701449653001501476653001101491653003001502653002701532653001501559653003801574653001501612653001201627653003701639653003801676653001601714700005601730700002601786773011601812856008601928852000902014655001202023IND60602562820221118225153.0180711e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060256282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6518-418410aExperimental investigation on energy and exergy performance of adsorption cold storage for space cooling application  ap. 23-35.  aThe adsorption cold thermal energy storage (TES) system was investigated for space cooling application by considering both energy and exergy analysis. With regeneration temperature of 70 °C, ambient temperature of 30 °C, heat transfer fluid (HTF) inlet temperature for evaporator 30 °C, the cold energy storage density (ESD) achieved was approximately 400 kJ kg⁻¹ with energy efficiency of 44.6%. In addition, the exergy efficiency was 4.5%, and the loading difference was 0.165 (adsorbate/adsorbent). As the HTF mass flow rate of the evaporator was decreased, the evaporator HTF outlet temperature decreased, and the exergy efficiency increased. As the evaporator HTF inlet temperature and the regeneration temperature were increased, the cold ESD, cold thermal efficiency and cold exergy destruction all increased. As the adsorption HTF inlet temperature was decreased, the cold ESD, and recovered exergy increased. The evaporator chamber HTF inlet temperature affected more on energy and exergy performances than that of the evaporator chamber HTF mass flow rate.  aPublisher supplied data 0aThermal energy storage 0aAdsorption 0aExergy 0aFin-coated heat exchanger 0aEnergy storage density 0aEfficiency 0aAccumulation d'énergie thermique 0aAdsorption 0aExergie 0aEchangeur de chaleur à ailettes 0aDensité de l'énergie accumulée 0aEfficacité1 aHwang, Yunho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0439-01791 aRadermacher, Reinhard0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Aug., v. 44 p.23-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245019500184300001600379520185500395592002802250650004302278650003002321650001902351650001702370650002702387650001102414650001602425650002802441650001002469650001302479650001102492650001602503650001202519650001502531650002202546650001702568650001702585650001202602650001402614653001802628653001702646653002302663653002502686653001502711700002202726700004202748700004502790700002502835700002102860700002902881700003502910700002802945773011002973856008603083852000903169655001203178IND60543153920221122075104.0190410e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054315392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeira, Quênia Gramile Silva10aEffects of added Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis probiotics on the quality characteristics of goat ricotta and their survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions  ap. 828-838.  aThis study evaluated the effects of incorporating the probiotics Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 (B. lactis) or Lactobacillus acidophilus La-05 (L. acidophilus) into goat ricotta on the technological, physicochemical, physical and sensory parameters of this product during refrigerated storage, as well as the protective effects of the goat ricotta on the survival of the tested probiotics during exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Incorporating the tested probiotics did not affect the yield or syneresis of the obtained goat ricotta. The counts of L. acidophilus and B. lactis during the chosen storage period were approximately 6 log CFU/g. The ricotta samples containing a probiotic strain presented smaller and greater amounts of lactose and lactic acid, respectively, and exhibited greater hardness and lower brightness after storage compared with the samples lacking a probiotic. No differences were observed in the fatty acid profiles of the goat ricotta containing or not containing a probiotic. All of the ricotta samples were described as a soft cheese with a homogeneous texture; however, the goat ricotta cheeses containing L. acidophilus or B. lactis were described as having a more acidic flavor. At the end of a challenge using experimental human digestive conditions, the counts of each of the tested probiotic strains were approximately 6 log CFU/g if it had been incorporated into goat ricotta. These results demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating L. acidophilus or B. lactis into goat ricotta because these probiotics did not negatively affect the quality characteristics of this product and suggested that goat ricotta is an efficacious food matrix for maintaining the viability of these probiotics during storage and under the stressful conditions imposed by the human gastrointestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aRicotta cheese 3acold storage 3afatty acid composition 3aflavor 3afood matrix 3agastrointestinal system 3agoats 3ahardness 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3alactose 3aprobiotics 3aprotective effect 3asoft cheeses 3astorage time 3atexture 3aviability 0aGoat products 0aFresh cheese 0aLactobacillus spp. 0aBifidobacterium spp. 0aProbiotics1 aMagnani, Marciane1 ade Medeiros Júnior, Francisco Cesino1 aQueiroga, Rita de Cássia Ramos do Egito1 aMadruga, Marta Suely1 aGullón, Beatriz1 aGomes, Ana Maria Pereira1 aPintado, Maria Manuela Estevez1 ade Souza, Evandro Leite0 tFood research international.g2015 Oct., v. 76 p.828-838dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245008500169300001400254520164900268592002801917650001101945650002001956650001401976650001901990650001302009650001302022650001902035650002602054650002202080650001202102650001002114650001802124651001302142653001802155653001702173653002202190653001302212653001902225653002202244700002602266700002102292700001702313700002402330773010802354856009002462852000902552655001202561IND60615704920221120212050.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061570492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Chao10aLand use and socio-economic determinants of urban forest structure and diversity  ap. 10-21.  aThe spatial distribution of urban greenness within a city is largely influenced by land use configuration and social factors. This study builds upon previous research focusing on urban forest patterns in relation to land use and socio-economic determinants, while expanding the set of measures used to represent the forest structure. Instead of focusing on canopy cover alone, this study examines two additional attributes, stem density and species diversity, and evaluates the relative importance of land use and socio-economic indicators in determining the urban forest structure in Cook County, Illinois. A combination of remotely sourced data sets and tree records from field surveys are used collectively in addressing the following hypotheses: (H0) Canopy cover alone sufficiently describes the predominant forest patterns in Cook County, (H1) Forest structure measured as described by canopy cover, stem density, and species diversity, varies across census tracts, and (H2) Spatial variability is explained by the land use distributions and a defined set of socio-economic variables. Our results show that the land use and socio-economic factors are better correlates with canopy cover and stem density than species diversity. Overall, Cook County’s urban forest is unevenly distributed across census tracts, with wealth, education, racial composition, and home ownership playing different roles in shaping the forest structure. Our study also identifies the many challenges the urban forest is currently facing and highlights key priorities for future planning and management efforts towards a healthier, more diverse regional forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aeducation 3ahome ownership 3aland use 3aplanning 3asocial factors 3asocioeconomic factors 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atrees 3aurban forests 3aIllinois 0aUrban forests 0aStem density 0aSpecies diversity 0aLand use 0aSocio-economic 0aSocial inequality1 aJohnston, M.q(Mark),1 aDarling, Lindsay1 aScott, Lydia1 aLiao, Felix Haifeng0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2019 Jan., v. 181 p.10-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2018.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009500162300001400257520208300271592002802354650001102382650001402393650001202407650002402419650002602443650001602469650001502485650002302500650002302523650002102546650001602567650002402583650001902607650002002626650002602646651001602672653002902688653003802717653002102755653003002776653001902806700002202825700002302847700002202870700002402892773009402916856008003010852000903090655001203099IND60698712920221118053914.0200615e20150723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069871292DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.26.44052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHock, Maria10aEffects of UV-B radiation on germination characteristics in invasive plants in New Zealand  ap. 21-37.  aUV-B radiation represents a potentially selective, yet little studied environmental factor for plant invasions, especially with respect to germination characteristics and seedling establishment in areas of high UV-B exposure such as New Zealand. To explain invasive potential of plant species pre-adaptation and local adaptation to selection factors in the invaded range are two frequently consulted concepts. To test for the relevance of these mechanisms, it is necessary to compare both invasive and non-invasive species, as well as native and exotic origins of invasive species. In the present study, germination success of two congeneric species pairs of the genera Verbascum (Scrophulariaceae) and Echium (Boraginaceae) were investigated under high UV-B intensities. Each genus comprised one species that has successfully invaded New Zealand grasslands and one species that was introduced but has not been invasive in New Zealand. In an among-species approach, pre-adaptation was tested by comparing germination success of native (European) origins of all four species in relation to their different invasive success in New Zealand. In a within-species comparison, native (European) and exotic (New Zealand) origins of the two invasive species were compared to test for local adaptation to UV-B in the invaded range. In both approaches, UV-B radiation inhibited the germination success of all study species. However, the comparison of invasive and non-invasive species of the two genera showed no UV-B-specific pre-adaptation of invasive species to high UV-B intensities. Higher germination success of invasive species probably led to an establishment advantage during colonization of the invaded range. Although local adaptation of exotic populations to UV-B could not be demonstrated in the within-species approach, a genetic shift in germination velocity between native and exotic origins was found. These differences may be ascribed to other relevant environmental factors, e.g. overall irradiation and drought, inducing similar plant responses as under UV-B radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchium 3aVerbascum 3adrought 3aecological invasion 3aenvironmental factors 3agermination 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3airradiation 3aplant establishment 3aplant response 3aplants (botany) 3aultraviolet radiation 3aNew Zealand 0aCongeneric species pairs 0ainvasive vs. non-invasive species 0alocal adaptation 0anative vs. exotic origins 0apre-adaptation1 aBeckmann, Michael1 aHofmann, Rainer W.1 aBruelheide, Helge1 aErfmeier, Alexandra0 tNeoBiota.g2015 July 23, v. 26 p.21-37dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.26.44053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013000161300001600291520143300307592002801740596005801768596006401826596005901890596007601949650002702025650001902052650002202071650002102093650001202114650001702126650002402143650001002167650001602177650001702193650001502210700001802225700001702243700001802260700001902278700001702297700001402314773016202328856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60614156520221118011519.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061415652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-018-2063-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Liqiu10aOverexpression of cytochrome p450 125 in Mycobacterium: a rational strategy in the promotion of phytosterol biotransformation  ap. 857-867.  aAndrost-4-ene-3, 17-dione (AD) and androst-1, 4-diene-3, 17-dione (ADD) are generally produced by the biotransformation of phytosterols in Mycobacterium. The AD (D) production increases when the strain has high NAD⁺/NADH ratio. To enhance the AD (D) production in Mycobacterium neoaurum TCCC 11978 (MNR M3), a rational strategy was developed through overexpression of a gene involved in the phytosterol degradation pathway; NAD⁺ was generated as well. Proteomic analysis of MNR cultured with and without phytosterols showed that the steroid C27-monooxygenase (Cyp125-3), which performs sequential oxidations of the sterol side chain at the C27 position and has the oxidative cofactor of NAD⁺ generated, played an important role in the phytosterol biotransformation process of MNR M3. To improve the productivity of AD (D), the cyp125-3 gene was overexpressed in MNR M3. The specific activity of Cyp125-3 in the recombinant strain MNR M3C3 was improved by 22% than that in MNR M3. The NAD⁺/NADH ratio in MNR M3C3 was 131% higher than that in the parent strain. During phytosterol biotransformation, the conversion of sterols increased from 84 to 96%, and the yield of AD (D) by MNR M3C3 was increased by approximately 18% for 96 h fermentation. This rational strain modification strategy may also be applied to develop strains with important application values for efficient production of cofactor-dependent metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data  a213004AcKey Project of Chinese Ministry of Education  a21276196cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a21406167cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a15ZCZDSY00510)cTianjin Programs for Science and Technology Development 3aMycobacterium neoaurum 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3abiotransformation 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ametabolites 3aphytosterols 3aproteomics1 aShen, Yanbing1 aXia, Menglei1 aShang, Zhihua1 aXu, Shuangping1 aAn, Xingjuan1 aWang, Min0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2018 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.857-867dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-018-2063-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245019800176300001600374520151100390592002801901650001701929650001301946650001501959650002601974650001902000650002702019650002102046650002702067650001502094650001102109650001502120650002102135650002102156650001602177650001902193653002902212653003102241653002502272653002702297653002002324700001602344700001702360700002402377700001602401700001802417773009102435856009002526852000902616655001202625IND60615974920221119132448.0201230e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061597492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordin, Noradiba10aElucidating the effects of different photoanode materials on electricity generation and dye degradation in a sustainable hybrid system of photocatalytic fuel cell and peroxi-coagulation process  ap. 614-622.  aThe hybrid system of photocatalytic fuel cell – peroxi-coagulation (PFC-PC) is a sustainable and green technology to degrade organic pollutants and generate electricity simultaneously. In this study, three different types of photocatalysts: TiO₂, ZnO and α-Fe₂O₃ were immobilized respectively on carbon cloth (CC), and applied as photoanodes in the photocatalytic fuel cell of this hybrid system. Photocatalytic fuel cell was employed to drive a peroxi-coagulation process by generating the external voltage accompanying with degrading organic pollutants under UV light irradiation. The degradation efficiency of Amaranth dye and power output in the hybrid system of PFC-PC were evaluated by applying different photoanode materials fabricated in this study. In addition, the effect of light on the photocurrent of three different photoanode materials was investigated. In the absence of light, the reduction of photocurrent percentage was found to be 69.7%, 17.3% and 93.2% in TiO₂/CC, ZnO/CC and α-Fe₂O₃/CC photoanodes, respectively. A maximum power density (1.17 mWcm⁻²) and degradation of dye (93.8%) at PFC reactor were achieved by using ZnO/CC as photoanode. However, the different photoanode materials at PFC showed insignificant difference in dye degradation trend in the PC reactor. Meanwhile, the degradation trend of Amaranth at PFC reactor was influenced by the recombination rate, electron mobility and band gap energy of photocatalyst among different photoanode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamaranth dye 3ahematite 3afuel cells 3aultraviolet radiation 3aphotocatalysis 3asustainable technology 3atitanium dioxide 3aelectricity generation 3apollutants 3acarbon 3azinc oxide 3aelectric current 3aperfluorocarbons 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 0aPhotocatalytic fuel cell 0aPeroxi-coagulation process 0aPhotoanode materials 0aElectricity generation 0aDye degradation1 aHo, Li-Ngee1 aOng, Soon-An1 aIbrahim, Abdul Haqi1 aLee, Sin-Li1 aOng, Yong-Por0 tChemosphere.g2019 Jan., v. 214 p.614-622dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100007300138245007400211300001600285500002000301520130500321592002801626650002901654650002101683650001401704650001601718650002301734700001901757773013301776856007201909852000901981655001201990IND60681332520221122155045.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133252DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.35422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelaziz, Ahmed Abouelfetouh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5418-806X10aEffect of abutment aspect ratio on clear‐water scour in floodplains  ap. 148-160.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aScour around abutments is recognized as one of the main reasons of bridge foundations failure. This paper presents the experimental results of the effects of abutment width and length on the scour development up to its equilibrium condition around 45° wing‐wall setback abutments in a compound channel. The developing scour hole characteristics are tested for three different lengths and widths at different time intervals until its equilibrium scour conditions. The findings showed that the abutment width has a profound effect on the characteristics of the scour hole, contradicting the results of previous studies. Generally, an increase in the relative abutment width leads to a reduction in the scour depth and width. However, the scour length, area, and volume initially increase with an increase in the relative abutment width, Lc/yf, from 1.33 to 10.67, where Lc is the abutment width and yf is the floodplain flow depth, and then these characteristics decrease significantly with a much wider abutment, Lc/yf, from 10.67 to 21.33. Overall, the effects of the abutment width on abutment scour should be accounted. To this end, empirical equations are proposed to predict the scour hole characteristics. Scour data from previous studies are also used to compare with the proposed equations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abridges (infrastructure) 3aempirical models 3aequations 3afloodplains 3amanmade structures1 aLim, Siow Yong0 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.148-160dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.35423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010100176500001900277520143600296592002801732650005201760650001601812650001101828650001901839650001501858650000901873650001401882650001501896650001901911651001301930653001401943653002501957653002601982653001602008653000802024700003202032700002302064700003102087773011002118856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60716114920221122030415.0210212e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071611492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalogun, Abdul-Lateef10aOil spill trajectory modelling and environmental vulnerability mapping using GNOME model and GIS  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study develops an oil spill environmental vulnerability model for predicting and mapping the oil slick trajectory pattern in Kota Tinggi, Malaysia. The impact of seasonal variations on the vulnerability of the coastal resources to oil spill was modelled by estimating the quantity of coastal resources affected across three climatic seasons (northeast monsoon, southwest monsoon and pre-monsoon). Twelve 100 m³ (10,000 splots) medium oil spill scenarios were simulated using General National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Operational Oil Modeling Environment (GNOME) model. The output was integrated with coastal resources, comprising biological, socio-economic and physical shoreline features. Results revealed that the speed of an oil slick (40.8 m per minute) is higher during the pre-monsoon period in a southwestern direction and lower during the northeast monsoon (36.9 m per minute). Evaporation, floating and spreading are the major weathering processes identified in this study, with approximately 70% of the slick reaching the shoreline or remaining in the water column during the first 24 h (h) of the spill. Oil spill impacts were most severe during the southwest monsoon, and physical shoreline resources are the most vulnerable to oil spill in the study area. The study concluded that variation in climatic seasons significantly influence the vulnerability of coastal resources to marine oil spill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aevaporation 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apollution 3ashorelines 3asocioeconomics 3aMalaysia 0aOil spill 0aTrajectory modelling 0aVulnerability mapping 0aGNOME model 0aGIS1 aYekeen, Shamsudeen Temitope1 aPradhan, Biswajeet1 aWan Yusof, Khamaruzaman B.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 268 p.115812-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245007000167300001600237500000900253520164500262592002801907650001501935650002401950650002301974650001201997650002002009650002602029650001502055650001302070650000702083650002702090650001402117650001802131650001902149650001302168650001802181650001202199650001502211700001602226700002302242773019202265856008002457852000902537655001202546IND60666433620221120133053.0191028e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643362DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2001.302470x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGadelle, Frederic10aRemoval of Uranium(VI) from Contaminated Sediments by Surfactants  ap. 470-478.  aepub  aUranium(VI) sorption onto a soil collected at the Melton Branch Watershed (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN) is strongly influenced by the pH of the soil solution and, to a lesser extent, by the presence of calcium, suggesting specific chemical interactions between U(VI) and the soil matrix. Batch experiments designed to evaluate factors controlling desorption indicate that two anionic surfactants, AOK and T77, at concentrations ranging from 60 to 200 mM, are most suitable for U(VI) removal from acidic soils such as the Oak Ridge sediment. These surfactants are very efficient solubilizing agents at low uranium concentrations: ca. 100% U(VI) removal for [U(VI)]ₒ,ₛₒᵣbₑd = 10⁻⁶ mol kg⁻¹ At greater uranium concentrations (e.g., [U(VI)]ₒ,ₛₒᵣbₑd = ca. 10⁻⁵ mol kg⁻¹), the desorption efficiency of the surfactant solutions increases with an increase in surfactant concentration and reaches a plateau of 75 to 80% of the U(VI) initially sorbed. The most probable mechanisms responsible for U(VI) desorption include cation exchange in the electric double layer surrounding the micelles and, to a lesser extent, dissolution of the soil matrix. Limitations associated with the surfactant treatment include loss of surfactants onto the soil (sorption) and greater affinity between U(VI) and the soil matrix at large soil to liquid ratios. Parallel experiments with H₂SO₄ and carbonate–bicarbonate (CB) solutions indicate that these more conventional methods suffer from strong matrix dissolution with the acid and reduced desorption efficiency with CB due to the buffering capacity of the acidic soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aanionic surfactants 3abuffering capacity 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3achemical interactions 3adesorption 3amicelles 3apH 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asoil solution 3asolubilization 3asorption 3asulfuric acid 3auranium 3awatersheds1 aWan, Jiamin1 aTokunaga, Tetsu K.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2001 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.470-478dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2001.302470x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245005200197500002000249520135800269592002801627596007901655650001101734650001401745650000901759650002001768650002001788650001101808650001801819651001201837651001301849651001001862700001901872773013201891856007502023852000902098655001202107IND60789323720221119073039.0220819e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078932372DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.127212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcher, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0007-633412aA historical flash flood chronology for Britain  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe chronology provides a record of flash flood events in Britain based on data collated mainly between 1700 and 2020. The primary purpose of the chronology is to improve the risk assessment of flash floods of given magnitude. It is divided into 18 regions of the country and contains descriptions of nearly 8000 events. It extends a previous chronology covering northern and southwest England which is provided as an online resource in (http://ceg-fepsys.ncl.ac.uk/outputs/). Flash floods have had a variety of previous definitions but are here defined in terms of the speed of onset which can apply to both river floods and surface water floods. The chronology for the first time provides a comprehensive list of surface water floods and their recorded impact on cities, towns and villages. It also draws attention to the prevalence of very rapid rates of rise in river level either as ‘walls of water’, or at a rate likely to endanger life as a result of intense rainfall. Nearly 300 such events have been identified mainly in upland areas of northern England, Wales and Scotland. Practical and theoretical issues with respect to flood risk assessment and warning are discussed.

We have previously shown that autophagy might be involved in OTA-induced early renal cytotoxicity, but the mechanisms of action are unknown. Since OTA is known to induce mitochondrial damage and Nix is a selective autophagy receptor for mitochondrial clearance, the objective of this study was to investigate whether Nix mediates autophagic response to OTA-induced renal cytotoxicity. Our results showed that OTA induced autophagic and mitophagic activitits. Nix shRNA HEK 293 cells were more sensitive than scrambled shRNA cells to OTA-induced cell death, and differentially affect the mRNA expression of SDHA, AIFM1, and Bad and protein expression of AIF, VDAC, SDHA and LONP1 after OTA treatment. In particular, up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bad and AIF after OTA treatment was prominent only in Nix shRNA cells, which might explain the higher ratio of cell death. These results might indicate that Nix plays a critical role in the cellular protection against OTA toxicity through autophagy and mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acytotoxicity 3agene expression 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3anephrotoxicity 3aochratoxin A 3aprotein synthesis 3atoxicology 0aOchratoxin A 0aAutophagy 0aMitophagy 0aApoptosis 0aRenal cytotoxicity1 aZhang, Boyang1 aLiang, Rui1 aCheng, Wen-Hsing1 aXu, Wentao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2302-84901 aLuo, Yunbo,1 aZhao, Changhui1 aHuang, Kunlun0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 July, v. 69 p.202-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.04.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04414naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245015700198300001400355500002000369520233200389592002802721596006402749596007102813596005102884596005202935596010302987596002103090596007103111596011803182650002203300650002003322650002403342650002703366650002303393650002603416650001303442650001103455650001203466650001803478650002303496650001503519650002603534650002403560650001203584700002303596700002003619700002103639773013103660856007203791852000903863655001203872IND60681332720221122155110.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133272DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.35562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Robert F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0726-211010aAssessing macroinvertebrate community response to restoration of Big Spring Run: Expanded analysis of before‐after‐control‐impact sampling designs  ap. 79-90.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStream restoration projects utilize a variety of approaches to improve conditions for aquatic organisms or enhance ecosystem function. Alterations to abiotic conditions to enhance certain ecosystems services may not lead to concurrent changes in the benthic macroinvertebrate community indicative of improved stream health. Big Spring Run was the location of a novel restoration project to recreate an anabranching “wet meadow” habitat typical of precolonization conditions without the primary goal of restoring a macroinvertebrate community characteristic of single‐channel lotic systems. We examined the effect of the restoration on the macroinvertebrate community using a multivariate analysis of assemblage composition, a before‐after‐control‐impact (BACI) approach, and an assessment of potential aerial migrants. We also examined subsets of the data using a BACI approach that represented restricted sampling designs often employed in stream restoration projects. Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected in the Spring twice prior to restoration (2010 and 2011) and 3 years after restoration (2012–2014). Adult stream insects were collected in 2014. Analyses of benthic macroinvertebrates and adult insects using the full dataset suggested that restoration had no effect on the macroinvertebrate community due to poor in‐stream conditions likely from sediment deposition following restoration. Dispersal barriers are likely acting as a secondary constraint on recolonization. Analyses using subsets of the data demonstrated that reference site quality and sampling extent can alter conclusions from a BACI approach. We found that a holistic approach using multiple lines of evidence required a nuanced approach to interpreting the data but was also informative for assessing project success. Robust monitoring protocols are likely the best approach for producing convincing results through a single line of evidence. The additional BACI analyses performed for this study, however, allowed the modest sampling regime employed to generate a broad narrative demonstrating that the macroinvertebrate assemblage did not respond to this type of restoration. Thus, we believe the holistic approach we employed can strengthen assessments of stream restoration projects when resources for monitoring are limited.  aPublisher supplied data  aBiology Student Investigator GrantcMillersville University  aNeimeyer‐Hodgson Student Research GrantcMillersville University  aNoonan Endowment FundcMillersville University  aStudent Research GrantcMillersville University  aGEO‐1215896cNational Science Foundation, Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability  cLycoming College  a6032200011.00cPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection  aGrowing Greener Environmental Stewardship Grant No. MU070258cPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection 3abenthic organisms 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aecological restoration 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3aimagos 3ainsects 3alotic systems 3amacroinvertebrates 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3asediment deposition 3astreams1 aNeideigh, Emily C.1 aRittle, Alex M.1 aWallace, John R.0 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.79-90dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.35563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010800168300001600276500001900292520112600311592002801437650002001465650001101485650001501496650002801511650000901539650001501548650002201563653001301585653000701598653002301605653001701628653003201645700002101677773010101698856008601799852000901885655001201894IND60697132720221122224553.0200719e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069713272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2020.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, In Jung10aThermophilic l-fucose isomerase from Thermanaeromonas toyohensis for l-fucose synthesis from l-fuculose  ap. 131-137.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe beneficial biological properties of l-fucose have extended its commercial application potential in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries. Enzymatic production of l-fucose with l-fucose isomerase (l-FucI) is considered a selective, green, and efficient strategy. Efficient sugar production requires thermophilic enzymes with increased reaction rate, reduced risk of microbial contamination, and high sugar solubility. No study has evaluated the applicability of thermophilic l-FucI for l-fucose production. In this study, we explored the biochemical properties of a thermostable l-FucI from Thermanaeromonas toyohensis (TtFucI) using l-fuculose as a substrate. The recombinant TtFucI exhibited thermophilicity and optimum activity at 70 °C. The specific activity, Kₘ, and kcₐₜ toward l-fuculose were 199.8 U/mg, 33.4 mM, and 901.7 s⁻¹, respectively. Mn²⁺ ions increased the activity of the enzyme by ∼10 times and enhanced its thermal stability. Our study, on l-fucose synthesis by thermostable l-FucI, suggests the potential application of this enzyme for the industrial production of l-fucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3afucose 3aisomerases 3amicrobial contamination 3arisk 3asolubility 3athermal stability 0aL-Fucose 0al- 0al-fucose isomerase 0aThermophilic 0aThermanaeromonas toyohensis1 aKim, Kyoung Heon0 tProcess biochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 96 p.131-137dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007400168300002000242500001400262520087000276592002801146650002101174650001501195650001501210650002201225650001601247650002301263650001601286650001301302650001701315650001401332650001201346650002301358700002101381700002201402700002001424773012501444856007401569852000901643655001201652IND60717478120221118162211.0201111e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071747812DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra07745c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomis-Berenguer, Alicia10aStudy of enantioselective metolachlor adsorption by activated carbons  ap. 40321-40328.  aNAL-light  aFour activated carbons were employed to analyse the adsorption of different enantiomeric mixtures of the herbicide metolachlor in aqueous solution. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms were measured and fitted with different theoretical models to exhaustively analyse the adsorption mechanism. Different adsorption capacities were observed as a function of textural features of the adsorbents revealing an important effect of the presence of micro and mesoporous development on the adsorbent–adsorbate interactions. Additionally, enantioselective adsorption was detected for two of the activated carbons employed, rendering a greater adsorption of the S-metolachlor enantiomer compared to the racemic mixture. This fact was associated to the accessibility of certain conformers of the herbicide to the larger pores, facilitating the non-electrostatic adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3ametolachlor 3amixtures 3aporous media 3arendering 3atexture 3atheoretical models1 aLaidin, Isabelle1 aRenoncial, Sophie1 aCagnon, Benoît0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 10, no. 66 p.40321-40328dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra07745c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013300169300001600302500001900318520106700337592002801404650001201432650002601444650001501470650002501485650001701510650001401527650001001541650001801551650001501569650001601584650001801600650001101618650001301629650001501642650001901657650001301676650001301689650001801702653002001720653000901740653002301749653003101772700001901803700001901822700002101841700002001862700002201882700003201904700002601936773014001962856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60708442320221118074418.0200826e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844232DNAL7 a10.1080/10496475.2020.17487842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Milon10aPhytochemical profiling and evaluation of bioactivities of methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of Marsdenia tenacissima leaves  ap. 405-422.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe in vitro antioxidant properties, brine shrimp lethality bioassay, in vivo analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diarrheal potentiality of methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of leaf of Marsdenia tenacissima were examined.

In this study, the scaling properties of hourly and daily streamflow time series were measured. As an innovation, the effects of extreme values on the multifractal behavior of these series were evaluated. Interestingly, both hourly and daily discharge records led to nearly identical scaling trends and identical crossover times. Daily and hourly discharge time series appeared to be non‐stationary when the timescale ranged from 75 to 366 days. Otherwise, the signals may be considered stationary time series. In addition, the results indicated that the extreme values strongly contribute to the multifractality of the series. The width of singularity spectra decreased considerably when the extreme events were removed from both hourly and daily discharge records.  aPublisher supplied data 3ariver flow 3arivers 3astream flow 3atime series analysis1 aTorabi Haghighi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5157-01561 aHosseini Guyomi, Kianoosh1 aAmiri, Seyed Mehrab1 aKløve, B.q(Bjørn),0 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.171-182dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.35503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245015300152300002000305500001400325520114500339592002801484650001601512650002401528650001301552650001301565650001901578650001401597700001801611700001401629700001201643700001801655700001701673773012501690856007401815852000901889655001201898IND60717478220221118162226.0201111e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071747822DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra07751h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aEnhancing the mechanical and tribological properties of epoxy composites via incorporation of reactive bio-based epoxy functionalized graphene oxide  ap. 40148-40156.  aNAL-light  aThe high rigidity and brittleness of traditional thermosetting resin based on bisphenol epoxy limits its many potential technical applications. Here, a novel tertiary amine containing cardanol-based epoxy resin (NC-514-DEA) was synthesized by reaction of diethanolamine (DEA) with cardanol epoxy resin (NC-514). Moreover, NC-514-DEA modified graphene oxide (GOND) was prepared and used as a reactive nano-reinforcing filler for epoxy composites. The results show that, compared with neat epoxy resin, the fracture toughness of the epoxy composite with 0.5 wt% GOND is increased by nearly 10%, and the friction coefficient is reduced from 0.567 to 0.408, demonstrating the best performance among specimens. The improved mechanical and wear resistance properties of prepared composites were attribute to the synergistic effect of NC-514-DEA and GO, which inhibited the generation and propagation of cracks by enhancing the interfacial interaction and distributing stress. In addition, the synthetic process of GOND is green, simple and efficient, providing a novel way for designing epoxy composite materials with many potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3afriction 3agraphene oxide 3asynergism1 aLiu, Chengbao1 aCheng, Li1 aYu, Yue1 aZhao, Haichao1 aWang, Liping0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 10, no. 66 p.40148-40156dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra07751h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006100168300001600229520085600245592002801101650000801129650001801137650001401155650002201169650001201191650001401203650002101217650001101238650001901249650001401268650002201282650001301304650001301317650001401330650002001344650001201364653002101376653000901397653002201406653002001428653001401448653001701462653000901479653001801488700002101506700002801527773011601555856008301671852000901754655001201763IND60615705520221120032106.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061570552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tree.2018.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHays, Graeme C.12aA Paradigm Shift in the Trophic Importance of Jellyfish?  ap. 874-884.  aThe past 30 years have seen several paradigm shifts in our understanding of how ocean ecosystems function. Now recent technological advances add to an overwhelming body of evidence for another paradigm shift in terms of the role of gelatinous plankton (jellyfish) in marine food webs. Traditionally viewed as trophic dead ends, stable isotope analysis of predator tissues, animal-borne cameras, and DNA analysis of fecal and gut samples (metabarcoding) are all indicating that many taxa routinely consume jellyfish. Despite their low energy density, the contribution of jellyfish to the energy budgets of predators may be much greater than assumed because of rapid digestion, low capture costs, availability, and selective feeding on the more energy-rich components. Feeding on jellyfish may make marine predators susceptible to ingestion of plastics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aScyphozoa 3aaquatic food webs 3acameras 3adigestion 3adigestive system 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aingestion 3amarine ecosystems 3aplankton 3aplastics 3apredators 3astable isotopes 3atissues 0aappendicularians 0adiet 0afasting endurance 0aingestion rates 0ajelly web 0amicroplastic 0asalp 0asiphonophores1 aDoyle, Thomas K.1 aHoughton, Jonathan D.R.0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2018 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.874-884dElsevier LtdwJournal:1990x0169-53477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245006900177300001600246500001900262520052200281536013400803592002800937596002200965650001400987650002301001650002401024650002701048650002701075653002101102653001701123700002301140700003001163700003601193773014001229856008501369852000901454655001201463IND60708442420221118074402.0200826e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844242DNAL7 a10.1080/10496475.2020.17492072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamila, Pradeep Kumar10aEffect of Auxins on Rooting of Stem Cuttings in Hypericum gaitii  ap. 423-434.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn efficient vegetative propagation method was developed for Hypericum gaitii.

This paper presents an empirical modeling methodology to predict flood vulnerability and risk, considering factors of hazard distribution, property exposure, built environment, and socio‐demographic and economic characteristics of a community. Vulnerability is empirically modeled as the expected fraction of property loss that is uninsured within a community (i.e., census tract) given water depth. Risk is derived as the expected annual uninsured property loss and loss ratio. The proposed framework is applied to the state of North Carolina in the United States. For model calibration, modeled flood loss data from Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018 and insurance claims data from the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration's National Flood Insurance Program are used. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Flood Hazard Layer is adopted, along with empirical probability distribution of water depth given flood event, to characterize hazard distribution. Results demonstrate how the presented methodology can be used to predict annual loss in terms of currency and to highlight hotspots of flood vulnerability and risk. Future work is needed to reduce uncertainty associated with limited hazard information available to the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsurance 3aprobability distribution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3auncertainty 3aNorth Carolina1 aSebastian, Antonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4309-25610 tJournal of flood risk management.g2021 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.e12739-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.127393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245008500163520188400248592002802132650000802160650002202168650001402190650001302204650002202217650001702239653001802256653001802274653002002292653002402312653002202336700001502358700001502373700001302388700001302401700001302414700001602427773011302443856008602556852000902642655001202651IND60752553520221120024843.0211030e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, R.10aViable approaches to increase the throughput of ring spinning: A critical review  aSpinning is one of the major steps in textiles to convert staple fibers from either natural or synthetic sources into continuous and twisted yarns. Since its invention, ring spinning has become the most widely used spinning technology due to the high yarn quality and applicability. However, the productivity is limited by its twisting and winding mechanism. Viable approaches to substantially improve the throughput of ring spinning are crucial. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the state-of-the-art of disruptive technologies aiming at improving the throughput of ring spinning. Based on the governing equation of ring yarn productivity, two approaches of increasing spindle speed via reducing or eliminating ring-traveler friction and reducing yarn twist have been scrutinized. Increasing the spindle speed directly increases the centrifugal force and air drag of the yarn in the spinning balloon and exacerbates the traveler's wear. By reducing or eliminating the ring-traveler friction, it is possible to achieve a balance between improved productivity, similar energy consumption, and reasonable traveler wear. Since the yarn productivity is inversely proportional to the yarn twist, yarn productivity can be enhanced by reducing yarn twist with less energy consumption. However, with far less twist, the yarn strength is going to suffer. Therefore, both approaches improve ring yarn yield to some extent, and the level of improvement is subjected to the yarn count, fiber material, spinning conditions, etc. This review provides a clear view of the combination of both approaches to improve yarn productivity and energy efficiency. In the future, it is expected to see more studies of new alternatives which provide the ring spinning process with a cleaner and higher throughput compared to previous or current spinning technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy efficiency 3aequations 3afriction 3asystematic review 3ayarn quality 0aRing spinning 0aStaple fibers 0aYarn properties 0aSpinning technology 0aYarn productivity1 aLing, Y.L.1 aFisher, R.1 aChen, Y.1 aLi, M.J.1 aMu, W.L.1 aHuang, X.X.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 323 p.129116-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245018700167300001600354500001900370520103400389592002801423650001101451650001301462650001201475650001301487651001401500653001001514653001401524653001801538653002301556653000901579700001501588700002401603700001701627773012101644856008501765852000901850655001201859IND60708442620221118074422.0200826e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844262DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2020.17487682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNardi, Anne10aPublic attitudes toward urban foxes and coyotes: the roles of perceived risks and benefits, political ideology, ecological worldview, and attention to local news about urban wildlife  ap. 405-420.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper examines public attitudes toward urban red foxes and coyotes in Madison, Wisconsin (US), and the roles that perceived risks and benefits, attention to local news about urban wildlife, political ideology, and ecological worldview play in an individual’s attitude toward these species. Data were collected using an in-person survey at four public events around Madison from July to August 2017 (n = 163, response rate = 47%). Results showed that perceived benefits, perceived risks, and ecological worldview were significant predictors of attitudes toward both urban coyotes and foxes. Although political ideology and attention to local news about urban wildlife were not significant predictors of attitudes toward urban foxes or coyotes, these concepts interacted in predicting attitudes toward urban coyotes. This study demonstrated the importance for wildlife managers to consider attention to news about urban wildlife and political ideology, as well as developing separate communications for different species.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3apolitics 3asurveys 3awildlife 3aWisconsin 0aUrban 0ared foxes 0aurban coyotes 0arisk communication 0arisk1 aShaw, Bret1 aBrossard, Dominique1 aDrake, David0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2020 Sept. 02, v. 25, no. 5 p.405-420dRoutledgewJournal:J000000084x1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2020.17487683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245009500181300001600276500000900292520077400301592002801075650001501103650001401118650001701132650001901149650001801168650002001186650001501206651001301221700001801234773014801252856009601400852000901496655001201505IND60668496620221122093322.0191125e195903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066849662DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1959.03615995002300020020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartelli, L.

In addition such physical properties as bulk density and mechanical analysis were also determined for the principal soil horizons. Available soil moisture and field capacity was shown to vary by textural classes for each soil group studied. For example it was found that silt loam soils of the Gray-Brown Podzolic averaged more available moisture in the A horizon than the Brunizems and Planosols. It was found that the available soil mositure was highly correlated with the 1/3-atm. percentage but not correlated with the 15-atm. percentage. The available moisture was controlled principally by the silt fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aPlanosols 3abulk density 3afield capacity 3asilt fraction 3asilt loam soils 3asoil water 3aIllinois1 aPeters, D.

Colorants and other pigment-containing products are marketed as a means of relieving summer stress but research supporting such claims is limited and was the objective of this study. Pigment-containing products evaluated on bentgrass maintained under supraoptimal (>30°C) temperature stress included: TurfScreen (a combination of zinc oxide [ZnO], a green pigment, and titanium dioxide [TiO₂]) and PAR (a commercial copper-based pigment). Carbon dioxide exchange rate (µmol CO₂ cm–² s–¹) was reduced >100% following Turfscreen and PAR applications and evapotranspiration rate (µmol H₂O cm–² s–¹) was reduced ∼10% compared to nonstressed control plants. Fluorescence (Fᵥ/Fₘ) was reduced ∼16% following Turfscreen and PAR application. Products (including a commercial paint and an additional copper-based pigment, Foursome) were also applied to acrylic sheets to measure the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation. PAR and Foursome reduced the transmission of photosynthetically active radiation ∼20%, while TurfScreen and paint reduced it by 39 and 46%, respectively. Microscopy images revealed TurfScreen (higher viscosity) remained on the leaf surface, and covered stomata while PAR (lower viscosity) entered the leaf via stomata. Overall, products evaluated provided little consistent physiological benefit to creeping bentgrass in a heat-stressed environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aagronomy 3acarbon dioxide 3acopper 3aevapotranspiration 3afluorescence 3amicroscopy 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3aviscosity 3azinc oxide1 aGann, James R.1 aWells, Christina E.1 aBruce, Terri F.1 aGerard, Patrick D.0 tAgronomy journal.g2013 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1797-1802dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2013.02983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245003900169300001600208520089400224592002801118650001101146650001701157650000901174650001901183650001101202650001401213650001101227650001101238650001101249650001301260650001101273773012501284856007901409852000901488655001201497IND60300718120221120081009.0150703e20120720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071812DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12254612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurtgen, Matthew T.14aThe Marine Sulfur Cycle, Revisited  ap. 305-306.  aSulfur takes part in many biogeochemical reactions that affect the global carbon and oxygen cycles. On short time scales and in the absence of oxygen, many microbes use organic carbon to reduce sulfate to sulfide, which may then react with iron to form pyrite. On much longer time scales, the net addition of oxygen to the atmosphere through organic carbon burial promotes sulfide oxidation on land and increases the amount of sulfate carried by rivers to the oceans. Two reports in this issue, by Wortmann and Paytan (1) on page 334 and Halevy et al. (2) on page 331, show that on time scales of millions of years, changes in the formation and dissolution of evaporite minerals can strongly impact marine chemistry and the carbon cycle (see the figure). On longer time scales, the sulfur cycle played a much greater role in regulating atmospheric oxygen levels than previously recognized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3airon 3amicroorganisms 3aoceans 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apyrite 3arivers 3asulfates 3asulfur0 tScience.g2012 July 20, v. 337, no. 6092 p.305-306dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12254613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245005500161300001600216520113100232592002801363650002501391650001501416650001501431650001301446650002501459650001301484650001401497650001701511650001001528650002001538650002401558650001001582650002601592650001001618650000901628700002201637700001801659700002101677773009101698856007301789852000901862655001201871IND60340791020221123025934.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079102DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.133832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRůžička, Kamil10aXylem development – from the cradle to the grave  ap. 519-535.  a519 I. 519 II. 520 III. 520 IV. 527 V. 530 530 References 530 SUMMARY: The development and growth of plants, as well as their successful adaptation to a variety of environments, is highly dependent on the conduction of water, nutrients and other important molecules throughout the plant body. Xylem is a specialized vascular tissue that serves as a conduit of water and minerals and provides mechanical support for upright growth. Wood, also known as secondary xylem, constitutes the major part of mature woody stems and roots. In the past two decades, a number of key factors including hormones, signal transducers and (post)transcriptional regulators have been shown to control xylem formation. We outline the main mechanisms shown to be essential for xylem development in various plant species, with an emphasis on Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as several tree species where xylem has a long history of investigation. We also summarize the processes which have been shown to be instrumental during xylem maturation. This includes mechanisms of cell wall formation and cell death which collectively complete xylem cell fate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acell death 3acell walls 3ahormones 3amaterials life cycle 3aminerals 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asecondary xylem 3asignal transduction 3astems 3atranscription factors 3atrees 3awood1 aUrsache, Robertas1 aHejátko, Jan1 aHelariutta, Ykä0 tnew phytologist.g2015 Aug., v. 207, no. 3 p.519-535dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.133833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001500184245007700199300001800276506007600294520129900370592002801669506003701697650002701734650001301761650001601774650002101790650002101811650001701832650002001849650001601869650001101885650001601896650001201912650006101924650001901985650003902004650002102043650002302064650000902087650002402096650002302120650004002143650005202183700002602235700001802261700002702279700003002306700002302336700002702359700002702386773017302413856004602586852000902632655001202641IND4486970920221207144030.0120502e20120403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448697092DNAL7 a224211352pmid7 aPMC33256862pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11216271092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yang10aAntigen-specific memory in B-1a and its relationship to natural immunity  ap. 5388-5393.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the companion article by Yang and colleagues [Yang Y, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 109, 10.1073/pnas.1121631109], we have shown that priming with glycolipid (FtL) from Francisella tularensis live-vaccine strain (i) induces FtL-specific B-1a to produce robust primary responses (IgM >>IgG); (ii) establishes persistent long-term production of serum IgM and IgG anti-FtL at natural antibody levels; and (iii) elicits FtL-specific B-1a memory cells that arise in spleen but rapidly migrate to the peritoneal cavity, where they persist indefinitely but divide only rarely. Here, we show that FtL rechallenge alone induces these PerC B-1a memory cells to divide extensively and to express a unique activation signature. However, FtL rechallenge in the context of a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist-stimulated inflammatory response readily induces these memory cells to migrate to spleen and initiate production of dominant IgM anti-FtL secondary responses. Thus, studies here reveal unique mechanisms that govern B-1a memory development and expression, and introduce B-1a memory as an active participant in immune defenses. In addition, at a practical level, these studies suggest previously unexplored vaccination strategies for pathogen-associated antigens that target the B-1a repertoire.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3alymphocytes 3aspleen 3avaccination 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aFrancisella tularensisximmunology 2aImmunity, Innate 2aImmunologic Memory 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aGhosn, Eliver Eid Bou1 aCole, Leah E.1 aObukhanych, Tetyana V.1 aSadate-Ngatchou, Patricia1 aVogel, Stefanie N.1 aHerzenberg, Leonard A.1 aHerzenberg, Leonore A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Apr. 3, v. 109, no. 14 p.5388-5393dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1121627109  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245007700181300001400258520095000272592002801222650000801250650002701258650001201285650001101297650001801308650001401326650001501340700002001355700002501375773011001400856008501510852000901595655001201604IND60677503020221117032548.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067750302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2019.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasprzak, Wojciech Kajetan10aModeling ligand docking to RNA in the design of RNA-based nanostructures  ap. 16-25.  aRNA has grown in biological importance as the discovery of its many functional roles in the cellular machinery has revealed the potential for targeting it to disrupt cancer pathways. RNA structure underlies its functionality and suitability as a nanoparticle building material. Advances in modelling methods have been achieved by the recognition of common structural motifs in natural RNA molecules that can be employed in the prediction of new structures based on sequence information and in design of functional nanostructures. Ligand docking prediction programs and RNA dynamics adds an important and non-trivial aspect to the modeling and characterization of the RNA structures. This short review introduces the issues involved in RNA structure prediction and modeling, dynamics of RNA structures, the influence of ligands on the structure and the dynamics, and ways to incorporate this information in the design of RNA-based nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aconstruction materials 3aligands 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aprediction1 aAhmed, Nour Ali1 aShapiro, Bruce Allen0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2020 June, v. 63 p.16-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:11964x0958-16697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2019.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013500174300001600309520076000325592002801085650002001113650001801133650001301151650001501164653001901179653001301198653002301211653003301234653002301267653002001290700001901310700002401329773010801353856008401461852000901545655001201554IND60605443420221120121231.0180721e20150130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060544342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoráčková, Jitka10aList of malacologically treated Holocene sites with brief review of palaeomalacological research in the Czech and Slovak Republics  ap. 207-211.  aThe complete list of all Holocene mollusc succession sites sampled by standard techniques in the area of the Czech and Slovak Republics is presented, 30 years after the last one.

However, we do not know how spatial distribution of plant–soil feedback affects plant below‐ground interactions. We investigated the way in which spatial heterogeneity of soil biota affects competitive interactions in grassland plant species. We performed a pairwise competition experiment combined with heterogeneous distribution of soil biota using four grassland plant species and their soil biota. Patches were applied as quadrants of ‘own’ and ‘foreign’ soils from all plant species in all pairwise combinations. To evaluate interspecific root responses, species‐specific root biomass was quantified using real‐time PCR. All plant species suffered negative soil feedback, but strength was species‐specific, reflected by a decrease in root growth in own compared with foreign soil. Reduction in root growth in own patches by the superior plant competitor provided opportunities for inferior competitors to increase root biomass in these patches. These patterns did not cascade into above‐ground effects during our experiment. We show that root distributions can be determined by spatial heterogeneity of soil biota, affecting plant below‐ground competitive interactions. Thus, spatial heterogeneity of soil biota may contribute to plant species coexistence in species‐rich grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3agrasslands 3ainterspecific competition 3aplant competition 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroot growth1 aRavenek, Janneke M.1 aSmit‐Tiekstra, Annemiek E.1 aPaauw, Jan Willem1 aCaluwe, Hannie1 aPutten, Wim H.1 aKroon, Hans1 aMommer, Liesje0 tnew phytologist.g2015 Aug., v. 207, no. 3 p.830-840dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.133943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03891naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002200167245013400189300001600323520182100339592002802160650002502188650000902213650001402222650001402236650001902250650001402269650001802283650002902301650001002330650002102340650002002361650002202381650001402403650002602417650002002443650002302463650001502486650001102501650001302512650002202525650004002547650001602587650003802603650002502641650002502666650003002691650002702721650001802748650001102766650001202777650003802789650002102827650002902848650001202877651001802889700001702907700002202924773017902946856008303125852000903208655001203217IND50064372520221118142438.0190416e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006437252DNAL7 a235225782pmid7 a10.1016/j.jand.2013.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordin, Stacia M.10aPosition of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Nutrition Security in Developing Nations: Sustainable Food, Water, and Health  ap. 581-595.  aIt is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that all people should have consistent access to an appropriately nutritious diet of food and water, coupled with a sanitary environment, adequate health services, and care that ensure a healthy and active life for all household members. The Academy supports policies, systems, programs, and practices that work with developing nations to achieve nutrition security and self-sufficiency while being environmentally and economically sustainable. For nations to achieve nutrition security, all people must have access to a variety of nutritious foods and potable drinking water; knowledge, resources, and skills for healthy living; prevention, treatment, and care for diseases affecting nutrition status; and safety-net systems during crisis situations, such as natural disasters or deleterious social and political systems. More than 2 billion people are micronutrient deficient; 1.5 billion people are overweight or obese; 870 million people have inadequate food energy intake; and 783 million people lack potable drinking water. Adequate nutrient intake is a concern, independent of weight status. Although this article focuses on nutritional deficiencies in developing nations, global solutions for excesses and deficiencies need to be addressed. In an effort to achieve nutrition security, lifestyles, policies, and systems (eg, food, water, health, energy, education/knowledge, and economic) contributing to sustainable resource use, environmental management, health promotion, economic stability, and positive social environments are required. Food and nutrition practitioners can get involved in promoting and implementing effective and sustainable policies, systems, programs, and practices that support individual, community, and national efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3adiet 3adietetics 3adisasters 3adrinking water 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3aenvironmental management 3afoods 3ahealth promotion 3ahealth services 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3aoverweight 3apeople 3apolitics 2aAgingxphysiology 2aCommunicable Diseasesxepidemiology 2aComorbidity 2aDeficiency Diseasesxepidemiology 2aDeveloping Countries 2aDieteticsxstandards 2aDrinking Waterxstandards 2aFood Supplyxstandards 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aHygiene 2aNutrition Disordersxepidemiology 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPoverty 0aUnited States1 aBoyle, Marie1 aKemmer, Teresa M.0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2013 Apr., v. 113, no. 4 p.581-595dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2013.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012400170300001400294520191000308592002802218650002002246650002202266650001102288650002702299650001002326650002102336650001202357650002202369650001902391650001702410650001702427650002302444650002002467650001002487650001902497650002602516650002202542650001602564650001902580650002202599650001002621650000902631650001102640650002302651650001402674650001602688651001102704653001402715653002702729653002202756653002102778653002502799653002002824700002402844700001702868773010602885856008402991852000903075655001203084IND60605443520221120121334.0180721e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060544352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGałka, Mariusz10aLate Glacial and Early Holocene lake level fluctuations in NE Poland tracked by macro-fossil, pollen and diatom records  ap. 23-38.  aLate Glacial and Early Holocene vegetation history and lake level fluctuations in NE Poland were described based on high-resolution plant macrofossils analyses and records of pollen, diatoms, and radiocarbon dates. The development of Lake Kojle-Perty began in the Allerød (GI-1c). Cooling during the Younger Dryas (GS-1) led to the development of communities of heliophyte herbaceous plants. Palaeobotanical and lithostratigraphical records demonstrate that abrupt climate changes at approximately 11,600 and 9450 cal. BP resulted in distinct changes in the vegetation and water level of Lake Kojle-Perty. Climate warming in the Younger Dryas–Holocene transition (11,600 cal. BP) caused the development of the terrestrial vegetation dominated by cold deciduous forest (Betula), and appearance of thermophylious aquatic plants: Typha latifolia, Najas marina, and Ceratophyllum demersum. A gradual decrease in the lake level since 11,200 cal. BP is evident from the appearance of plants from shallow lake environments (Potamogeton natans and Hippuris vulgaris). The low water levels since 10,700 cal. BP resulting from increased temperature and evaporation caused the development of peat on limnic sediments. The dry and warm climatic phase with lowest lake level in the lakes of NE Poland were coeval with the expansion of temperate deciduous forests (Corylus and Ulmus) that commenced at approximately 10,500 cal. BP. A distinctive increase in lake levels at approximately 9450 cal. BP is suggested by the development of rush plants such as Cladium mariscus and aquatic plants such as Najas marina, Chara sp., and Nuphar lutea in the shallow parts of Lake Kojle-Perty. The increased lake levels correspond with the expansion of Alnus glutinosa in North-East (NE) Poland. Our reconstructions of the vegetation development and lake level changes align with results from other studies in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aBacillariophyceae 3aBetula 3aCeratophyllum demersum 3aChara 3aCladium mariscus 3aCorylus 3aHippuris vulgaris 3aHolocene epoch 3aNajas marina 3aNuphar lutea 3aPotamogeton natans 3aTypha latifolia 3aUlmus 3aaquatic plants 3acommunity development 3adeciduous forests 3aevaporation 3aglobal warming 3aherbaceous plants 3alakes 3apeat 3apollen 3aradiocarbon dating 3asediments 3atemperature 3aPoland 0aNE Poland 0aVegetation development 0aLake level change 0aPlant succession 0aMacrofossil analysis 0aPollen analysis1 aTobolski, Kazimierz1 aBubak, Iwona0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 388 p.23-38dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013900174300001600313520149700329592002801826650001201854650001601866650001601882650001601898650001001914650001101924650001301935650001201948650002001960650002101980650001802001650002602019650001502045650002402060650001602084650002202100650001602122650003202138653001102170653001302181653002002194653002302214653002202237700007002259700002402329700002302353700002302376700002202399700002002421700002102441700002202462773013802484856008502622961001302707852000902720655001202729IND60535152520221119141639.0190318e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarroll, Jeffery A.10aSexually dimorphic innate immunological responses of pre-pubertal Brahman cattle following an intravenous lipopolysaccharide challenge  ap. 108-115.  aThis study was designed to characterize potential sexually dimorphic immunological responses following a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in beef cattle. Six female (heifers) and five male (bulls) Brahman calves (average age=253±19.9 and 288±47.9 days; average body weight=194±11kg and 247±19kg for heifers and bulls, respectively) were challenged with LPS (0.25μg LPS/kg body weight). Following administration of LPS, all cattle displayed increased sickness behavior beginning at 0.5h, with heifers on average displaying less sickness behavior than bulls. A febrile response was observed in all animals following LPS administration, with a maximum response observed from 4 to 5.5h. The average rectal temperature response was greater in heifers than bulls. In all cattle there were elevated serum concentrations of cortisol from 0.5 to 8h, TNF-α from 1 to 2.5h, IL-6 from 2 to 8h, and IFN-γ from 2.5 to 7h after LPS challenge. Additionally, serum concentrations of TNF-α were greater in heifers than bulls from 1.5 to 2h after the LPS challenge. Concentrations of IFN-γ were also greater on average in bulls than heifers. Leukopenia occurred from 1 to 8h, with a decreased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio for the first 5h among all calves. These data demonstrate the existence of a sexually dimorphic acute-phase response in pre-pubertal Brahman calves. Specifically, heifers may have a more robust acute response to LPS challenge, even though bulls display more signs of sickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrahman 3abeef cattle 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abulls 3acalves 3acortisol 3aheifers 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-6 3aintravenous injection 3aleukopenia 3alipopolysaccharides 3aneutrophils 3asexual dimorphism 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aCattle 0aCortisol 0aInnate immunity 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aSexual dimorphism1 aBurdick Sanchez, Nicole C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0709-871X1 aHulbert, Lindsey E.1 aBallou, Michael A.1 aDailey, Jeffery W.1 aCaldwell, Lisa C.1 aVann, Rhonda C.1 aWelsh, Thomas H.1 aRandel, Ronald D.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 166, no. 3-4 p.108-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245016000152300001600312500001500328520137800343592002801721650002101749650001601770650001801786650001301804650001301817650001001830650001501840650001801855653001501873700002601888700002001914700003001934700001701964700001401981700001801995700001602013700001602029700002102045700001702066773009102083856007302174852000902247655001202256IND60340791220221123041345.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079122DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.133652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zhe10aIdentification of microRNAs and their mRNA targets during soybean nodule development: functional analysis of the role of miR393j‐3p in soybean nodulation  ap. 748-759.  a2019-12-05  aPlant microRNAs (miRNAs) play important regulatory roles in a number of developmental processes. The present work investigated the roles of miRNAs during nodule development in the crop legume soybean (Glycine max). Fifteen soybean small RNA libraries were sequenced from different stages of nodule development, including young nodules, mature nodules and senescent nodules. In order to identify the regulatory targets of the miRNAs, five parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE) libraries were also sequenced from the same stages of nodule development. Sequencing identified 284 miRNAs, including 178 novel soybean miRNAs. Analysis of miRNA abundance identified 139 miRNAs whose expression was significantly regulated during nodule development, including 12 miRNAs whose expression changed > 10‐fold. Analysis of the PARE libraries identified 533 miRNA targets, including three nodulation‐related genes and eight nodule‐specific genes. miR393j‐3p was selected for detailed analysis as its expression was significantly regulated during nodule formation, and it targeted a nodulin gene, Early Nodulin 93 (ENOD93). Strong, ectopic expression of miR393j‐3p, as well as RNAi silencing of ENOD93 expression, significantly reduced nodule formation. The data indicate that miR393j‐3p regulation of ENOD93 mRNA abundance is a key control point for soybean nodule formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aGlycine max 3amessenger RNA 3asoybeans 3amicroRNA 3agenes 3anodulation 3aRNA libraries 0asenescence1 aHossain, Md Shakhawat1 aArikit, Siwaret1 aValdés‐López, Oswaldo1 aZhai, Jixian1 aWang, Jun1 aLibault, Marc1 aJi, Tieming1 aQiu, Lijuan1 aMeyers, Blake C.1 aStacey, Gary0 tnew phytologist.g2015 Aug., v. 207, no. 3 p.748-759dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.133653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02557naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008900174300001400263520118700277592002801464650001801492650001101510650001601521650001701537650001001554650002501564650004301589650001901632650001101651650001701662650002301679653000901702653003901711653002101750653001101771653001101782700001701793700002001810700001701830700002101847773013701868856008502005852000902090655001202099IND60535152620221119141449.0190318e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHisazumi, Rinnosuke10aDetection and quantification of bovine signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles  ap. 86-90.  aA signal joint (sj) T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) is produced by T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements during αβ T-cell maturation in the thymus. sjTREC have been studied as a marker of thymic function in several spices. We designed specific primers for δrec-ψJα sj region to identify the location of the bovine sjTREC region and determined the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product. The obtained sequences were subjected to a BLAST search, which identified a matching region. This matching region contained TCR δ genes and was identified on bovine chromosome 10. We also confirmed the polymorphism of the sj region by sequencing of 10 PCR products, and observed irregular insertion of bases in the δrec-ψJα recombination signal sequence. We then developed a quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay for evaluation of sjTRECs level in order to evaluate bovine thymic function for application in the veterinary clinic. This QPCR assay specifically amplified the sj region of bovine sjTREC and could detected 101–107 copy numbers of sjTRECs. Using this assay we found that the number of sjTRECs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was less than 10% that of the thymus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3acattle 3achromosomes 3acircular DNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal peptide 3aspices 3athymus gland 3aveterinary clinics 0aCalf 0aPeripheral blood mononuclear cells 0aQuantitative PCR 0asjTREC 0aThymus1 aKayumi, Miya1 aKikukawa, Ryuji1 aNasu, Tetsuo1 aYasuda, Masahiro0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 167, no. 1-2 p.86-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245003200162300001600194520102100210592002801231650001401259650001601273650001401289650002001303700001701323773012501340856007901465852000901544655001201553IND60300718320221120080901.0150703e20120720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071832DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12252192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZutic, Igor,10aSpin Twists in a Transistor  ap. 307-308.  aTransistors are the centerpiece of conventional electronics, with two key features of switching and amplification. However, transistors relying on electron charge are oblivious to another property of electrons: their spin. In a simple picture, these spins are compass needles, aligned by a magnetic field. With different orientations, “up” and “down,” spin lends itself to encoding binary information as ones and zeroes, as explored in the field of spintronics (1 , 2). Whereas harnessing spin for robust information storage in computer hard drives and magnetic random access memories has been very successful, delivering a spin transistor has been challenging (1). On page 324 of this issue, Betthausen et al. (3) describe a newly discovered spin-transistor action. Considering that the pioneering work on another spin transistor (4) waited two decades for experimental realization (5), it is a remarkable feat that the work of Betthausen et al. presents the experiment and theory for their spin transistor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aelectronics 3aelectrons 3amagnetic fields1 aLee, Jeongsu0 tScience.g2012 July 20, v. 337, no. 6092 p.307-308dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12252193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245006100170300001500231520104600246592002801292650000801320650001301328650001301341650002101354650002301375650001401398653001601412653001301428653002001441653001801461653002701479653002101506653001501527700002101542700002301563773012001586856008001706852000901786655001201795IND60560857920221119170609.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056085792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b110012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarati Farimani, Amir10aDNA Origami–Graphene Hybrid Nanopore for DNA Detection  ap. 92-100.  aDNA origami nanostructures can be used to functionalize solid-state nanopores for single molecule studies. In this study, we characterized a nanopore in a DNA origami–graphene heterostructure for DNA detection. The DNA origami nanopore is functionalized with a specific nucleotide type at the edge of the pore. Using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we computed and analyzed the ionic conductivity of nanopores in heterostructures carpeted with one or two layers of DNA origami on graphene. We demonstrate that a nanopore in DNA origami–graphene gives rise to distinguishable dwell times for the four DNA base types, whereas for a nanopore in bare graphene, the dwell time is almost the same for all types of bases. The specific interactions (hydrogen bonds) between DNA origami and the translocating DNA strand yield different residence times and ionic currents. We also conclude that the speed of DNA translocation decreases due to the friction between the dangling bases at the pore mouth and the sequencing DNA strands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3afriction 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3ananopores 0aDNA origami 0agraphene 0ahybrid nanopore 0aDNA detection 0apore functionalization 0amultiplex signal 0adwell time1 aDibaeinia, Payam1 aAluru, Narayana R.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.92-100dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b110013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245008200213300001800295520111700313592002801430650002201458650001501480650002301495650003101518650001901549650002401568650001901592650001301611650001801624650002401642650001401666650001301680650001601693650001601709700005101725700002501776700005901801700001501860700005901875773012001934856008402054852000902138655001202147IND60679468220221120155410.0191228e20191213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067946822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b020082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnisur Rahman, Md.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7190-975110aFacial Amphiphilicity-Induced Self-Assembly (FAISA) of Amphiphilic Copolymers  ap. 9526-9535.  aAmphiphilic molecules, including macromolecules and small surfactants, inherently self-assemble into a wide variety of nanostructures in selective solvents. However, the sequential structure for synthetic polymers is largely restricted to block copolymers. In this work, we report facial amphiphilicity-induced self-assembly (FAISA) of gradient amphiphilic copolymers. This new approach is demonstrated using facial amphiphilic multicyclic compounds. The facial amphiphilicity of bile acids allows cationic copolymers to form aggregates with different morphologies in aqueous solution. By tuning the compositions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, these copolymers can self-assemble in water to produce spherical, vesicle, and rodlike nanostructures via supramolecular and electrostatic interactions. The hydrophobic interaction from multicyclic hydrocarbon moieties largely dictates the self-assembly process, which can be further modulated by integrating neutral hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) in copolymer compositions with additional stimuli such as temperature, charge density, and ionic screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abile acids 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3ananomaterials 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascreening 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atemperature1 aSha, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3338-12281 aJui, Moumita Sharmin1 aLamm, Meghan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3485-43221 aMa, Yufeng1 aTang, Chuanbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0242-82410 tMacromolecules.g2019 Dec. 13, v. 52, no. 24 p.9526-9535dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b020083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011000165300001600275520170700291592002801998650004802026650001502074650001602089650002702105650003802132650001002170650002102180650002102201650001402222650002202236650002102258650001402279650001002293653005202303653002002355653001002375653001302385653001102398700001702409700001602426700001702442700001402459700002202473773013802495856008502633852000902718655001202727IND60535152720221119141735.0190318e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBegg, D.J.10aSpecific faecal antibody responses in sheep infected with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  ap. 125-131.  aMany studies have examined the serum antibody response to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in cases of Johne's disease (JD), but there are no reports on the mucosal antibody response.

The sheep were divided into three groups: (i) “un-inoculated controls” (n=10), (ii) “clinical cases” (n=8) which were inoculated animals that developed clinical disease and had moderate to high levels of MAP shedding and (iii) “survivors” (n=11) which were inoculated animals from which MAP could not be cultured from tissues at the conclusion of the trial. Serum IgG responses gradually increased in all inoculated animals, peaking at 12–16 months PI. A significant increase in the levels of MAP-specific faecal IgG and IgA was measured in the survivors at 16 and 17 months PI, while levels in the un-inoculated controls and clinical cases remained at baseline levels. The detection of faecal Ig in the survivors coincided with the removal of sheep that developed clinical disease. The data suggest that some sheep produced MAP-specific IgG and IgA in the intestinal mucosa, which was released into their faeces. We hypothesise that the survivors produced faecal Ig as a direct response to ingestion of MAP associated with environmental contamination from clinical cases. Thus MAP specific mucosal antibodies may play a previously unreported role as part of a protective response triggered by environmental exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aingestion 3aintestinal mucosa 3aparatuberculosis 3apollution 3asheep 0aMycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis 0aJohne's disease 0aSheep 0aAntibody 0aFaeces1 ade Silva, K.1 aPlain, K.M.1 aPurdie, A.C.1 aDhand, N.1 aWhittington, R.J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 166, no. 3-4 p.125-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245007300188300001600261520110600277592002801383650002401411650002001435650001101455650001401466650001001480650001501490650002601505650001701531650001201548650003901560650001101599650006301610650002701673650004001700653002101740653001301761653002301774653001001797700002301807773017101830856008502001852000902086655001202095IND50060610620221119043745.0190312e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006061062DNAL7 a232914592pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Adnan R.10aHelminth therapies: Translating the unknown unknowns to known knowns  ap. 293-299.  aThe use of live helminth infections is currently in clinical trials as a novel approach for the treatment of a range of allergic and autoimmune diseases. This rapid progression from observational studies some 20years ago to helminth clinical trials can be attributed to huge advances in not just pre-clinical and clinical evidence, pertaining to the efficacy of these parasites in unrelated diseases, but also a greater understanding of the complex immunological mechanisms that underpin these effects. Helminths have exerted significant evolutionary selective pressures on the host immune genome or “immunome”. Studies on helminths were pivotal in a paradigm shift in immunology with recent discoveries of a number of novel immune cell populations. Critically, these new discoveries highlight the need to further understand the underlying mechanism behind the desirable therapeutic effects that helminths offer. With these unknown unknowns there is the distinct possibility that a true, fundamental modus operandi for helminth therapy will arrive long after it has been established in the clinic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoimmune diseases 3aclinical trials 3agenome 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3aimmunology 3aobservational studies 3atherapeutics 2aAnimals 2aHelminthsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aImmune System Diseasesximmunologyxparasitologyxtherapy. 2aTherapy with Helminths 2aTranslational Research, Biomedical. 0aHelminth therapy 0aImmunome 0aAutoimmune disease 0aAtopy1 aFallon, Padraic G.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2013 Mar., v. 43, no. 3-4 p.293-299dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for Parasitology Inc.wJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001600162245010200178300001600280500001900296500000900315520126500324592002801589650001301617650001301630650001101643650001601654650001501670650000901685650001501694650001401709650001401723650002101737650001101758650001601769650001801785700001801803773012201821856009701943852000902040655001202049IND60663683320221117223806.0191122e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066368332DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1989.00021962008100010019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaas, S.

This study was conducted to demonstrate the effects of pigments on light reflectance, transmittance and absorptance spectra of corn (Zea mays L.) leaves. Three treatments were used to produce corn seedlings with different pigmentations. Normal seedlings contained the natural complement of colored pigments (predominantly chlorophylls and carotenoids). Etiolated seedlings (grown in the dark) contained carotenoids but not chlorophylls. Albino seedlings, produced by treating seeds with fluridone (l-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-(trifluromethyl) phenyl]-4(1H)- pyridinone) contained no colored pigments. The morphology and histology of seedlings in the three treatments were basically similar, except that the leaves of the etiolated seedlings were characteristically elongated. Pigments did not affect leaf reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance spectra at infrared (< 2500 nm) wavelengths. Over most of the visible waveband, albino leaf reflectance was the same as the maximum observed at infrared wavelengths. The leaf absorptance spectrum of the etiolated seedlings at ultraviolet (> 350 nm) and visible wavelengths resembled the in vitro  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3aalbino 3acarotenoids 3acomplement 3acorn 3aetiolation 3afluridone 3ahistology 3aleaf reflectance 3aleaves 3areflectance 3atransmittance1 aDunlap, J.

This study was designed as a systematical review to explore the association of traffic noise with different indicators of obesity, thus providing updated quantitative estimates for the pooled effect estimates of the existing literature. We conducted an extensive search for epidemiological studies that investigated the association of traffic noise with obesity in three electronic databases till February 23, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the summary effect estimates for each 10-dB(A) increase in noise and compared the highest with the lowest category of noise in relation to seven obesity indicators. Meanwhile, we assessed the risk of bias and the overall quality of the evidence of each study as well as the level of evidence for each exposure–outcome pair. The initial search identified 30 studies, 13 of which were ultimately included. The meta-analysis for the highest versus the lowest category of noise exposure was generally associated with higher waist circumfluence (WC) ranging from 0.326 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.078, 0.574) to 0.705 cm (95% CI = 0.071, 1.340) and higher odds of central obesity ranging from 1.055 (95% CI = 1.000, 1.109) to 1.167 (95% CI = 1.037, 1.298). When the continuous exposure (each 10 dB(A) increase in noise) was introduced, similar results were found. This study indicated positive associations of traffic noise with WC and central obesity. However, in consideration of some limitations, there is an urgent need for future studies to increase the sample size, discriminate the etiological differences in different noise and obesity indicators, and thoroughly consider socioeconomic status.  aPublisher supplied data  aKJ2020A0163cKey Projects of Natural Science Research of Anhui Provincial Department of Education 3aadiposity 3aconfidence interval 3aetiology 3ameta-analysis 3anoise pollution 3aobesity 3apublic health 3aresearch 3asample size 3asocioeconomic status 3asystematic review 3atraffic 3awaist1 aWu, Ke-Jia1 aSun, Yue1 aChen, Yue-Nan1 aLiang, Huan-Ru1 aLiu, Wen1 aLu, Yao1 aHu, Cheng-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0052-90300 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.55707-55727dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19056-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01330naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245014400153300001800297520027700315592002800592650002300620650001500643650001700658650002100675650001200696700001500708700001800723700001200741700001400753700001600767773012700783856007300910852000900983655001200992IND60658204220221121224929.0190816e20080508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820422DNAL7 a10.1039/b718147g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zijun10aTwo-photon absorption enhancement induced by aggregation due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding in V-shaped 2-hydroxypyrimidine derivatives  ap. 2260-2262.  aThe aggregation of V-shaped hydroxypyrimidine derivatives is formed through an intermolecular hydrogen bond in chloroform that cannot form a hydrogen bond with the solute, giving rise to a large enhancement of the two-photon absorption and two-photon induced fluorescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achloroform 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3asolutes1 aShao, Bin,1 aHuang, Zhenli1 aLiu, Bo1 aChen, Tao1 aQin, Jingui0 tChemical communications.g2008 May 8, , no. 19 p.2260-2262dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b718147g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002800138245010100166300001800267520130600285592002801591650001101619650002301630650001201653650002001665650001501685650001601700650001901716650001501735650002301750650000901773650001401782651001901796700002501815700002001840773013101860856007201991852000902063655001202072IND60648085820221119162335.0190626e20140723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064808582DNAL7 a10.3390/f50717982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgunbadewa, Ebenezer Y.10aOptical Medium Spatial Resolution Satellite Constellation Data for Monitoring Woodland in the UK  ap. 1798-1814.  aThe aim of this study was to test the potential of a constellation of remote sensing satellites, the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC), for retrieving a temporal record of forest leaf area index (LAI) in the United Kingdom (U.K.). Ground-based LAI measurements were made over a 12-month period in broadleaf woodland at Risley Moss Nature Reserve, Lancashire, U.K. The ground-based LAI varied between zero in January to a maximum of 4.5 in July. Nine DMC images, combining data from UK-DMC and NigeriaSat-1, were acquired, and all images were cross-calibrated and atmospherically corrected. The spectral reflectance of the test site was extracted, and a range of vegetation indices were then computed and correlated with the ground measurements of LAI. The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) had the strongest correlation, and this was used to derive independent estimates of LAI using the “leave-one-out” method. The root mean square error of the LAI estimates was 0.47, which was close to that calculated for the ground-measured LAI. This study shows, for the first time, that data from a constellation of high temporal, medium spatial resolution optical satellite sensors may be used to map seasonal variation in woodland canopy leaf area index (LAI) in cloud-prone areas, like the U.K.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3aleaf area index 3amonitoring 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3awoodlands 3aUnited Kingdom1 aArmitage, Richard P.1 aDanson, F.

Groundwater vulnerability evaluation models play a prominent role in groundwater resource management, such as the DRASTIC model that has been used successfully in numerous areas. Several studies have focused on improving this model by changing the initial parameters or the rates and weights. The presented study investigated results produced by the DRASTIC model by simultaneously exerting both modifications. For this purpose, two land use-based DRASTIC-derived models, DRASTICA and susceptibility index (SI), were implemented in the Shiraz plain, Iran, a semi-arid region and the primary resource of groundwater currently struggling with groundwater pollution. To develop the novel proposed framework for the progressive improvement of the mentioned rating-based techniques, three main calculation steps for rates and weights are presented: (1) original rates and weights; (2) modified rates by Wilcoxon tests and original weights; and (3) adjusted rates and optimized weights using the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. To validate the results of this framework applied to the case study, the concentrations of three contamination pollutants, NO₃, SO₄, and toxic metals, were considered. The results indicated that the DRASTICA model yielded more accurate contamination concentrations for vulnerability evaluations than the SI model. Moreover, both models initially displayed well-matched results for the SO₄ concentrations, specifically 0.7 for DRASTICA and 0.58 for SI, respectively. Comparatively, the DRASTICA model showed a higher correlation with NO₃ concentrations (0.8) than the SI model (0.6) through improved steps. Furthermore, although both original models demonstrated less correlation with toxic metal concentrations (0.05) compared to SO₄ and NO₃ concentrations, the DRASTICA and SI models with modified rates and optimized weights exhibited enhanced correlation with toxic metals of about 0.7 and 0.2, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3amodels 3aresearch 3aresource management 3arisk assessment 3asemiarid zones 3atoxicity 3aurban population 3awater management 3aIran1 aNikoo, Mohammad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3740-43891 aNematollahi, Banafsheh1 aGandomi, Amir H.1 aAl-Wardy, Malik1 aAl-Rawas, Ghazi Ali0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.55845-55865dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19620-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245015700208300001600365520103900381592002801420650001201448650001901460650001201479650001101491650001001502650001101512650000901523650001901532650001601551650001401567650001201581650001001593650001501603651001901618653001901637653002001656653002001676653001301696653003101709700002101740700002001761700002101781773009501802856008601897852000901983655001201992IND60557068120221120034713.0190403e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055706812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuseini, Awal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7886-872914aThe perception and acceptability of pre-slaughter and post-slaughter stunning for Halal production: The views of UK Islamic scholars and Halal consumers  ap. 143-150.  aThe importance of religious slaughter from economic, emotive and ethical viewpoints is significant. There are apparent economic benefits associated with trading in meats slaughtered according to religious traditions. Some religious authorities insist on the slaughter of animals without stunning, but this, according to many researchers, compromises animal welfare. We conducted a survey of Islamic scholars and Halal consumers, 66 scholars from 55 organisations and 314 consumers from 54 UK cities/towns were surveyed. Forty-nine scholars were interviewed through pre-arranged meetings, 17 surveyed online whilst all 314 consumers were either surveyed online or through the remote completion of copies of the questionnaire. Most of the scholars (>95%) (CI 86.9 to 98.4%) agreed that if an animal is stunned and then slaughtered by a Muslim and the method of stunning does not result in death, cause physical injury or obstruct bleed-out, the meat would be Halal and 53% (CI 47 to 58%) consumers also thought such meat would be Halal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMuslims 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3acities 3adeath 3aethics 3ameat 3aquestionnaires 3aresearchers 3aslaughter 3asurveys 3atowns 3atraditions 3aUnited Kingdom 0aHalal consumer 0aHalal slaughter 0aIslamic scholar 0aStunning 0aAnimal welfare, Halal meat1 aWotton, Steve B.1 aHadley, Phil J.1 aKnowles, Toby G.0 tMeat science.g2017 Jan., v. 123 p.143-150dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01165naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245009600160300001800256520020900274592002800483650002100511650002300532650002300555650001300578650001600591700001600607700002900623773012900652856007300781852000900854655001200863IND60658204320221121224908.0190816e20080415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820432DNAL7 a10.1039/b718148e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNativ-Roth, Einat10aShear-induced ordering of micellar arrays in the presence of single-walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 2037-2039.  aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes were found to induce elongation and alignment of surfactant micelles in thin films under the action of shear, leading to the formation of ordered arrays over micron lengths.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3amicelles 3asurfactants1 aRegev, Oren1 aYerushalmi-Rozen, Rachel0 tChemical communications.g2008 Apr. 15, , no. 17 p.2037-2039dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b718148e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245011700181300001600298500001900314500000900333520049700342592002800839650002300867650001300890650001200903650002000915650002100935650000700956650001400963700002300977773012301000856009701123852000901220655001201229IND60663683620221117223825.0191122e196309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066368362DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1963.00021962005500050007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacLeod, L.

Dry-cured ham with adjusted aw (0.86–0.96) and fat content (10–50%) was inoculated with S. enterica and pressurised (347–852MPa, 5min/15°C), following a Central Composite Design. Polynomial regression indicated a significant impact of pressure and aw on S. enterica HP-lethality. By lowering aw a clear piezoprotection was observed. At low aw (0.88) the S. enterica reduction was little affected by increasing pressure (e.g. 2.3 to 3.2 Logs at 450 to 750MPa, respectively). At the highest aw the estimated inactivation ranged from 3.3 to 8.9 Logs at 450 to 750MPa, respectively. No significant piezoprotective effect on S. enterica was recorded by the fat content. The relevance of food characteristics on the HP-lethality of S. enterica indicate the need to validate the HP effectiveness on the specific product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella enterica 3acured meats 3ahigh pressure treatment 3alipid content 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3awater activity 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aFoodborne pathogen 0aMicrobial inactivation 0aFood safety 0aRTE meat products 0aPiezoresistance1 aBelletti, N.1 aAymerich, T.1 aGarriga, M.0 tMeat science.g2017 Jan., v. 123 p.120-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014700164300001600311520141400327592002801741650000801769650002101777650002401798650002101822650001801843650001801861650002001879650001601899650001601915650001501931653001201946653002501958653001901983653002502002653002102027653002702048700002502075700003302100700002302133700003202156700002802188773012102216856008002337852000902417655001202426IND60560858220221119170715.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056085822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b111092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDāsa, Sumitā,10aSelective Binding of Genomic Escherichia coli DNA with ZnO Leads to White Light Emission: A New Aspect of Nano–Bio Interaction and Interface  ap. 644-657.  aHere, we report for the first time, a novel and intriguing application of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the area of optics by demonstrating white light emission by tuning the emission of a nanomaterial, ZnO rods, exhibiting surface defects, in the presence of genomic Escherichia coli DNA with a comparatively high quantum efficiency. In order to understand the DNA specificity, we have also studied the interaction of ZnO with CT, and ML DNA, ss EC DNA, synthetic polynucleotides and different mononucleosides and bases. Further, in order to understand the effect of particle shape and defects present in ZnO, we have also extended our study with ZnO rods prepared at higher temperature exhibiting red emission and ZnO particles exhibiting yellow emission. Interestingly, none of the above studies resulted in white light emission from ZnO–DNA complex. Our studies unequivocally confirmed that the concentration and the nature of DNA and ZnO together plays a crucial role in obtaining CIE coordinates (0.33, 0.33) close to white light. The much enhanced melting temperature (Tₘ) of EC DNA and the energetics factors confirm enhanced hydrogen bonding of ZnO with EC DNA leading to a new emission band. Our experimental observations not only confirm the selective binding of ZnO to EC DNA but also open a new perspective for developing energy saving light emitting materials through nano-bio interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aenergy conservation 3ahydrogen bonding 3amelting point 3ananomaterials 3apolynucleotides 3atemperature 3awhite light 3azinc oxide 0aZnO rod 0aEscherichia coli DNA 0asurface defect 0awhite light emission 0ahydrogen bonding 0anano−bio interaction1 aPramanik, Srikrishna1 aChatterjee, S.c(Sabyasachi)1 aDas, Partha Pratim1 aDevi, Parukuttyamma Sujatha1 aSuresh Kumar, Gopinatha0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.644-657dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b111093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245008500179300001600264500000900280520159800289592002801887650002201915650002201937650000901959650001301968650001901981650001702000650001202017650001802029650002202047650001802069650001302087650001502100650001502115650001302130650001302143650001302156650002002169650001702189651001202206700001202218700001602230773014802246856009602394852000902490655001202499IND60668497420221120050453.0191125e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066849742DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1991.03615995005500010031x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhuman, B.

Long-range planning in the humid tropics requires monitoring of these effects for an extended period of time. The effects of two land-clearing methods and six land-use systems on soil physical properties of an Ultisol were studied for 4 yr in the humid coastal belt of Nigeria. The land-clearing methods were bulldozer clearing with a shear blade and manual clearing. The six land-use systems were comprised of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)-based cropping, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)-based cropping, alley cropping, plantain (Musa spp.), pasture, and improved forestry, all under no-tillage. Soil physical properties were measured 90 d after clearing prior to planting, and at 2 and 4 yr after cropping. The soil texture of the 0–10 cm layer was not affected by clearing methods. Soil compaction increased to 30 cm with shear blade and 20 cm with manual clearing. With respect to the forested control, shear blade and manual clearing increased the bulk density in the 0- to 10-cm layer by 22 and 14%, respectively. The bulk density in the surface layer after 2 yr of cropping was significantly more for the pasture than the other systems. Three months after clearing, the steady infiltration rates were 89, 20 and 32 cm h⁻¹ in the forested control, and shear-blade and manually cleared plots, respectively. Infiltration rate increased to 47 and 51 cm h⁻¹ in the shear-blade cleared and increased to 290 and then decreased to 156 cm h⁻¹ in the manually cleared plots after 2 and 4 yr of cropping, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aManihot esculenta 3aMusa 3aUltisols 3aalley cropping 3abulk density 3acassava 3ahumid tropics 3ainfiltration rate 3aland clearing 3aland use 3amonitoring 3ano-tillage 3apastures 3aplanning 3aplanting 3asoil compaction 3asoil texture 3aNigeria1 aLal, R.1 aShearer, W.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1991 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.178-183dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1991.03615995005500010031x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245009500160300001800255520234800273592002802621650002302649650001302672650001702685650001802702650001102720650001002731650001102741650002402752700002702776700002102803700002202824700001602846773013102862856007202993852000903065655001203074IND60648086020221119162142.0190626e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064808602DNAL7 a10.3390/f50715652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCifuentes, Renato10aCorrection of Erroneous LiDAR Measurements in Artificial Forest Canopy Experimental Setups  ap. 1565-1583.  aTerrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data makes possible to directly characterize the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of canopy foliage elements. The scanned edges of these elements may result in incorrectly point measurements (i.e., “ghost points”) impacting the quality of point cloud data. Therefore, estimation of the ghost points’ spatial visibilities, measurement of their characteristics and their removal are essential. In order to quantify the improvements on data quality, a method is developed in this study to efficiently correct for ghost points. Since the occurrence of ghost points is governed by a number of factors, (e.g., scanning resolution and distance, object properties, incident angle); the developed method is based on the analysis of the effects of these factors under controlled conditions where canopy-like objects (i.e., leaves, branches and layers of leaves) were scanned using a continuous-wave TLS system that employs phase-shift technology. Manual extraction of ghost points was done in order to calculate the relative amount of ghost points per scan, or ghost points ratio (gpr). The gpr values were computed in order to: (i) analyze their relationships with variables representing the above factors; and (ii) be used as a reference to evaluate the performance of filters used for extraction of ghost points. The ghost points’ occurrence was modeled by fitting regression models using different predictor variables that represent the variables under study. The obtained results indicated that reduced models with three predictors were suitable for gpr estimation in artificial leaves and in artificial branches, with a relative root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.7% and 3.7%, respectively; while the full model with four predictors was appropriate for artificial layers of leaves, with relative RMSE of 4.5%. According to the statistical analysis, scanning distance was identified as the most important variable for modeling ghost points occurrence. Results indicated that optimized distance-based filters relative to the scanning distance have improved the outcomes in ghost points detection, in comparison to standard filtering criteria. These results suggest that more accurate characterization of forest canopy 3D structures can be achieved by removing ghost points using the new developed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangle of incidence 3abranches 3adata quality 3aforest canopy 3aleaves 3alidar 3amodels 3aregression analysis1 aVan der Zande, Dimitry1 aSalas, Christian1 aFarifteh, Jamshid1 aCoppin, Pol0 tForests.g2014 July 03, v. 5, no. 7 p.1565-1583dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f50715653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245016100183300001600344520107200360592002801432650003901460650001901499650001101518650002901529650001301558650003701571650001101608650001301619650001401632653002401646653001301670653002101683700003201704700003201736700003401768700003501802700002401837700003001861700003601891773013801927856008502065852000902150655001202159IND60535153020221119141822.0190318e20151015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Larissa Sarmento10aTranscription of non-classic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I in the bovine placenta throughout gestation and after Brucella abortus infection  ap. 166-170.  aTranscription of non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) was assessed in the bovine placenta throughout gestation. Additionally, the effect of Brucella abortus infection on expression of non-classical MHC-I was also evaluated using a chorioallantoic membrane explant model of infection. The non-classical MHC-I genes MICB and NC3 had higher levels of transcription in the intercotyledonary region when compared to the placentome, which had higher levels of transcription at the second trimester of gestation. NC1 and classical MHC-I had very low levels of transcription throughout gestation. Trophoblastic cells of B. abortus-infected chorioallantoic membrane explants had an increase in transcription of non-classical MHC-I at 4h post infection. Therefore, this study provides an analysis of non-classical MHC-I transcription at different stages of gestation and different placental tissues, and during B. abortus infection. These findings provide additional knowledge on immune regulation in placental tissues, a known immune-privileged site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aanimal tissues 3acattle 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aexplants 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amodels 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 0aNon-classical MHC-I 0aPlacenta 0aBrucella abortus1 ada Silva Mol, Juliana Pinto1 ade Macedo, Auricélio Alves1 aSilva, Ana Patrícia Carvalho1 ados Santos Ribeiro, Diego Luiz1 aSantos, Renato Lima1 ada Paixão, Tatiane Alves1 ade Carvalho Neta, Alcina Vieira0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 167, no. 3-4 p.166-170dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01562naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001500161245009700176300001400273500000900287520057100296592002800867650001300895650001700908650003300925650001800958650001500976650001800991773014601009856009601155852000901251655001201260IND60668497520221120050647.0191125e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066849752DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1981.03615995004500010006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadler, A.10aField Application of the Four-Electrode Technique for Determining Soil Solution Conductivity  ap. 30-34.  aepub  aIn situ electrical conductivity of a soil solution (ECw) was calculated using the four-electrode technique and a newly suggested calibration procedure.

Aboveground and belowground factors play important roles, and determining their relative contribution to tree success will greatly assist in refining predictive models and forestry strategies in a changing climate. In a common glasshouse, seedlings of interior Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) from multiple populations were grown in multiple forest soils. Fungicide was applied to half of the seedlings to separate soil fungal and nonfungal impacts on seedling performance. Soils of varying geographic and climatic distance from seed origin were compared, using a transfer function approach. Seedling height and biomass were optimized following seed transfer into drier soils, whereas survival was optimized when elevation transfer was minimised. Fungicide application reduced ectomycorrhizal root colonization by c. 50%, with treated seedlings exhibiting greater survival but reduced biomass. Local adaptation of Douglas‐fir populations to soils was mediated by soil fungi to some extent in 56% of soil origin by response variable combinations. Mediation by edaphic factors in general occurred in 81% of combinations. Soil biota, hitherto unaccounted for in climate models, interacts with biogeography to influence plant ranges in a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aectomycorrhizae 3aedaphic factors 3aforest soils 3aforestry 3afungicides 3agreenhouses 3apesticide application 3apopulation 3aseedlings 3asoil fungi 3atrees1 aTwieg, Brendan D.1 aO'Neill, Gregory A.1 aMohn, William W.1 aSimard, Suzanne W.0 tnew phytologist.g2015 Aug., v. 207, no. 3 p.858-871dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.133603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017600175300001600351520124100367592002801608650000801636650001801644650002001662650001301682650003701695773007801732856008401810852000901894655001201903IND60087188520151109000000.0141102e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008718852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2010.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassover, William H.10aNew and unconventional approaches for advancing resolution in biological transmission electron microscopy by improving macromolecular specimen preparation and preservation  ap. 141-151.  aResolution in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) now is limited by the properties of specimens, rather than by those of instrumentation. The long-standing difficulties in obtaining truly high-resolution structure from biological macromolecules with TEM demand the development, testing, and application of new ideas and unconventional approaches. This review concisely describes some new concepts and innovative methodologies for TEM that deal with unsolved problems in the preparation and preservation of macromolecular specimens. The selected topics include use of better support films, a more protective multi-component matrix surrounding specimens for cryo-TEM and negative staining, and, several quite different changes in microscopy and micrography that should decrease the effects of electron radiation damage; all these practical approaches are non-traditional, but have promise to advance resolution for specimens of biological macromolecules beyond its present level of 3–10Å (0.3–1.0nm). The result of achieving truly high resolution will be a fulfillment of the still unrealized potential of transmission electron microscopy for directly revealing the structure of biological macromolecules down to the atomic level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adata analysis 3ainstrumentation 3aproteins 3atransmission electron microscopy0 tMicron.g2011 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.141-151dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2010.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003900148245008800187300002000275520141100295592002801706650001501734650001501749650001401764650001301778650002901791650001901820650001401839650000901853650001401862650001301876650001101889650002101900650001701921650001701938650001601955650001301971650001301984700005501997700001702052773015502069856008302224852000902307655001202316IND60788430420221118162420.0220813e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078843042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19749-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMamaghani, Fatemeh Amir Aslanzadeh10aManagement of solid waste after used motor oil recovery via production of zeolite A  ap. 55877-55889.  aThe attempt of the current study is to find an eco-friendly method for managing the solid waste deposited in the landfill of used motor oil recovery factories through the fabrication of zeolite-based compounds. This toxic waste is originated from the application of natural bentonite, traditionally used as an effective adsorbent in the recovery process. The black waste was converted to zeolite structures through the fusion technique. Firstly, the collected powder was mixed with sodium hydroxide, and boehmite followed by the thermal treatment at different temperatures, 600–800 °C. Then, the obtained precursors were hydrothermally converted to zeolite A or hydroxysodalite. The effects of processing factors like alkalinity, boehmite, and sodium aluminate ratios (respect to solid waste mass), fusion temperature, and aging time on the structural characteristics, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were studied in detail. In order to achieve a cation exchange capacity of about 190 mg g⁻¹, the alkali and boehmite ratios should be adjusted at 2.00 and 0.53, respectively. Based on the morphological observations, the fusion at 800 °C caused the formation of cubic particles with sharp edges. Besides, the hydrosodalite powder with the extended surface area, 77 m² g⁻¹, could be produced by fixing the boehmite, and sodium aluminate ratios at the levels of 0.13 and 0.40, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aalkalinity 3abentonite 3aboehmite 3acation exchange capacity 3aheat treatment 3alandfills 3aoils 3apollution 3aresearch 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3asolid wastes 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3azeolites1 aSalem, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3014-88611 aSalem, Shiva0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.55877-55889dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19749-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008500166520142800251592002801679650001801707650001501725650001701740650002201757650001101779650002601790650001501816650001201831650001601843653002701859653002801886653002701914653002701941700001501968773011301983856008602096852000902182655001202191IND60677504220221117032851.0200210e20200310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067750422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1193972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao10aEnvironmentally friendly traffic control strategy - A case study in Xi’an city  aGiven the increasing painful repercussions of air pollution caused by massive vehicular emissions and the unsustainable development of transport sectors, the integration of traffic models with emission estimation models has been investigated in depth to evaluate the performance of the pre-determined environment-friendly transportation policies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of the optimization approach to design the traffic control strategy combining the coupled models. Therefore, an optimization framework is developed to optimize the traffic control strategies to mitigate the vehicular emissions in the considered network. The proposed framework integrates a macroscopic analytical traffic model with a macroscopic emissions estimation model to account for the vehicle emissions, and then genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to minimize vehicle emissions. A congested urban area in Xi’an city that consists of two signalized intersections is selected for a case study. The performance of the signal plans derived by the proposed framework is compared with the currently in use signal plans via the microscopic simulator AIMSUN. It indicates that the proposed traffic control scheme reduces expected vehicle trip travel time and vehicle emissions of four sorts of pollutants for the considered area.

However, the utilization of fascinating characters of Mel NP such as innate MR contrast effects, high affinity to metal ions, strong light absorption requires special design with strategic synthetic method for its own purpose. Here, we have introduced paramagnetic Gd³⁺ metal ions and silica nanocoating on Mel NP for the dual-modal MRI/fluorescent contrast-enhanced imaging and therapeutics. The Gd³⁺ chelating kinetics of Mel NP by quinone and hydroquinone residues were optimized in various conditions of Gd³⁺ amounts and pH in solution for improving MRI contrast enhancing properties of the Mel NP. Then, bioinert silica was coated on the surfaces of Gd-chelated Mel NP (Gd-Mel@SiO₂ NP) with a modified sol–gel process. The silica nanocoating allowed increased outer sphere water diffusion time, resulting a significantly brighter MR T₁ contrast effect of Gd-Mel@SiO₂ NP, comparing with a bare Gd-Mel NP or clinical grade T₁ contrast agent. Further, when the Gd-Mel@SiO₂ NP was labeled with fluorescent molecules, a significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity was achieved by the silica nanocoating that preventing the innate fluorescent deactivation property of melanin. Finally, in vitro/in vivo dual-modal contrast enhanced MRI/fluorescent imaging and feasibility of image-guided cancer therapeutic applications using Gd-Mel@SiO₂ NPs were successfully evaluated in a clinically relevant human prostate cancer xenograft mouse model.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aanimal models 3adopamine 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3ahydroquinone 3aimage analysis 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amelanin 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3atherapeutics 0amelanin 0asilica coating 0ametal-chelation 0amultimodal image-guidance 0aMRI 0afluorescence imaging1 aPak, U-ram,1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.101-111dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b113043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013800169300001600307520089200323592002801215650001501243650002301258650001001281650000901291650001401300650001301314650002601327650002601353650000701379650001501386650002701401653001601428653000801444653002801452653001701480653001901497700001801516700005501534773009501589856008601684852000901770655001201779IND60557068520221120034819.0190403e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055706852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jun-Hu10aHyperspectral imaging with multivariate analysis for technological parameters prediction and classification of muscle foods: A review  ap. 182-191.  aMuscle foods are very important for a well-balanced daily diet. Due to their perishability and vulnerability, there is a need for quality and safety evaluation of such foods. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) coupled with multivariate analysis is becoming increasingly popular for the non-destructive, non-invasive, and rapid determination of important quality attributes and the classification of muscle foods. This paper reviews recent advances of application of HSI for predicting some significant muscle foods parameters, including color, tenderness, firmness, springiness, water-holding capacity, drip loss and pH. In addition, algorithms for the rapid classification of muscle foods are also reported and discussed. It will be shown that this technology has great potential to replace traditional analytical methods for predicting various quality parameters and classifying muscle foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanimal-based foods 3acolor 3adiet 3adrip loss 3afirmness 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amultivariate analysis 3apH 3aprediction 3awater holding capacity 0aMuscle food 0aHSI 0aTechnological parameter 0aChemometrics 0aClassification1 aNicolai, Bart1 aSun, Da-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3634-99630 tMeat science.g2017 Jan., v. 123 p.182-191dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169520204600291592002802337650002102365650002202386650002502408650001102433650001702444650001902461650001102480650002102491650002902512650001402541650002102555650001702576650002002593650001602613650001902629653002502648653003702673653002802710653001202738700001402750700001702764773012702781856008602908852000902994655001203003IND60677504420221117032249.0200210e20200310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067750442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1194052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgbonnaya, C.10aNovel thermodynamic efficiency indices for choosing an optimal location for large-scale photovoltaic power generation  aSustainable energy is a current key priority across the globe. Hence, renewable energy sources have been widely accepted as potential substitutes for fossil fuels in the existing energy infrastructures. A recent report showed that photovoltaic power generation constituted around 100 GW out of 2378 GW of the global renewable power capacity installed in 2018. Consequently, various researchers are investigating how the increasing utilisation of photovoltaics can be handled in order to reduce future environmental impacts; whilst leveraging their operational zero-emission. From a circular economic paradigm, recycling, reuse and reduction strategies are often adopted to improve the sustainability of systems. This study proposes novel thermodynamic efficiency indices as a resources reduction strategy. By selecting an optimal location for large-scale photovoltaic power generation (LSPPG), the same amount of resources (such as land space, materials, energy) will achieve higher utilisation efficiency. In this study, actual two-year solar radiation and temperature data were sourced from Nigerian Meteorological Agency, Abuja. A probability distribution modeling was used to generate statistical mean values for solar radiation and temperature based on the classical almost sure central limit theory. Then, Photovoltaic modeling and simulation code was used to simulate the power generation characteristics of the LSPPG. Comparative analyses of the results for a 5 MW (MW) LSPPG showed that statistical mean value of power generation, energy efficiency index and exergy efficiency index range from 0.76 to 0.99 MW, 1.315 to1.254 and 1.298 to1.237, respectively, across the locations studied. Overall, the thermodynamic efficiency indices can complement the current laboratory-based rating of the photovoltaic modules in order to establish the environmental, economic and policy rationales for sitting a LSPPG. This would ultimately improve the cradle-to-cradle management of LSPPG installations based on resources reduction strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acradle-to-cradle 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3afossil fuels 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3apower generation 3aprobability distribution 3arecycling 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3azero emissions 0aPhotovoltaic modules 0aThermodynamic efficiency indices 0aModeling and simulation 0aNigeria1 aTuran, A.1 aAbeykoon, C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Mar. 10, v. 249 p.119405-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1194053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012000163300001500283520127400298592002801572650002201600650002101622650002201643650002001665650001601685650002001701650001501721651001001736653001501746653001801761653001501779653003601794653002901830700001801859700001901877700001701896700001601913773011201929856008402041852000902125655001202134IND60605444520221120172022.0180721e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060544452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Buda10aProjected precipitation and streamflow under SRES and RCP emission scenarios in the Songhuajiang River basin, China  ap. 95-105.  aProjections of future water resources in large river basins are of the utmost importance. However, it is difficult to predict hydrological processes by applying physically based hydrological models. To solve this problem, artificial neural networks were used to project streamflow in the Songhuajiang River basin, which is one of the more important agricultural areas in China. Multi-layer Perceptron Networks were applied to construct relationships between climate factors and hydrological variables in this study. Possible changes of precipitation and streamflow in 2011–2050 in the Songhuajiang River basin were obtained by considering the climate conditions of the ECHAM5/MPI-OM under three SRES scenarios and the ensemble mean of the CMIP5 models under three RCP scenarios. The results indicate that inter-annual and inter-decadal changes of precipitation and streamflow (at the Jiamusi hydrological station) did not show obvious trends in 2011–2050. However, seasonal precipitation and streamflow showed various tendencies under different emission scenarios, and their inner annual distribution patterns tended to change as well. Furthermore, precipitation and streamflow had more obvious increasing tendencies under the RCP scenarios than the SRES scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aclimatic factors 3ahydrologic models 3aneural networks 3astream flow 3awater resources 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aProjection 0aPrecipitation 0aStreamflow 0aMulti-layer Perceptron Networks 0aSonghuajiang River basin1 aZeng, Xiaofan1 aZhai, Jianqing1 aWang, Yanjun1 aLi, Xiucang0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 380-381 p.95-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04494naa a2201093 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014300157300001600300520137600316592002801692650001001720650003301730650001201763650002201775650001401797650002301811650001901834650001901853650001201872650001601884650001701900650001401917650002601931650001101957650002001968650002101988650001902009650001102028650001202039650002202051650002602073650001902099650002202118650002502140700002102165700002102186700002202207700002602229700002202255700001802277700002202295700003702317700002602354700002102380700002302401700002102424700002002445700001902465700001402484700002002498700001802518700002102536700001802557700002002575700001602595700001802611700002402629700001902653700001902672700002002691700001902711700002502730700001602755700002302771700002002794700002202814700002202836700001602858700003002874700002502904700002102929700002202950700002102972700002302993700001703016700001703033700002203050700001603072700001803088700001903106700002603125700002003151700001903171700002503190773009103215856007303306852000903379655001203388IND60340792220221123035055.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079222DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.133932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaohan12aA roadmap for research on crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) to enhance sustainable food and bioenergy production in a hotter, drier world  ap. 491-504.  aCrassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a specialized mode of photosynthesis that features nocturnal CO₂ uptake, facilitates increased water‐use efficiency (WUE), and enables CAM plants to inhabit water‐limited environments such as semi‐arid deserts or seasonally dry forests. Human population growth and global climate change now present challenges for agricultural production systems to increase food, feed, forage, fiber, and fuel production. One approach to meet these challenges is to increase reliance on CAM crops, such as Agave and Opuntia, for biomass production on semi‐arid, abandoned, marginal, or degraded agricultural lands. Major research efforts are now underway to assess the productivity of CAM crop species and to harness the WUE of CAM by engineering this pathway into existing food, feed, and bioenergy crops. An improved understanding of CAM has potential for high returns on research investment. To exploit the potential of CAM crops and CAM bioengineering, it will be necessary to elucidate the evolution, genomic features, and regulatory mechanisms of CAM. Field trials and predictive models will be required to assess the productivity of CAM crops, while new synthetic biology approaches need to be developed for CAM engineering. Infrastructure will be needed for CAM model systems, field trials, mutant collections, and data management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aOpuntia 3aagricultural land 3abioenergy 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adeserts 3adry forests 3aenergy crops 3aevolution 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3afuel production 3ahuman population 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3amutants 3apopulation growth 3aproduction technology 3asemiarid zones 3asynthetic biology 3awater use efficiency1 aCushman, John C.1 aBorland, Anne M.1 aEdwards, Erika J.1 aWullschleger, Stan D.1 aTuskan, Gerald A.1 aOwen, Nick A.1 aGriffiths, Howard1 aSmith, J.

Striploins were collected from USDA Standard steer carcasses, longitudinally cut into halves (lateral or medial) and assigned randomly to pork fat injection (PFI) or non-injected control (CON). Loin halves assigned to PFI were enhanced with pork fat using a multi-needle injector. Steaks were analyzed via Warner-Bratzler shear force, trained and consumer sensory panels, and proximate analysis (cooked and uncooked). Shear force values for PFI steaks were lower (P<0.01) than CON steaks (24.5 vs. 43.5N, respectively). Trained panelists detected (P=0.02) an off-flavor for PFI steaks but were unable to discern other attribute differences. Consumer panelists denoted (P=0.05) improved juiciness and overall preference (P=0.02) for the PFI treatment. Cooked PFI steaks had less (P<0.01; −1.0%) moisture and more (P<0.01; +1.3%) fat than CON steaks; protein did not differ (P=0.14). This processing method deserves further investigation for new product development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3abackfat 3abeef 3abeef quality 3ajuiciness 3aloins 3aoff flavors 3apalatability 3apork 3aproduct development 3aproximate composition 3asensory evaluation 3ashear stress 3asteaks 3asteers 0aBeef 0aConsumer 0aFat 0aPork 0aSensory 0aWBSF1 aWalter, Lee-Anne J.1 aSchmitz, Angela N.1 aGuadián-García, Daniel E.1 aLawrence, Ty E.0 tMeat science.g2017 Jan., v. 123 p.205-210dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01084naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003200138245007000170300001800240520021100258592002800469650002300497650002300520650001700543650001800560700001700578773012900595856007300724852000900797655001200806IND60658204920221121233430.0190816e20080229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820492DNAL7 a10.1039/b718232e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnthony, Savarimuthu Philip10aTwo-dimensional arrays of luminescent metal-selenide nanoparticle  ap. 1193-1195.  aThe direct synthesis of CdSe nanoparticles inside the core of PS-P4VP micellar structures has been utilized for the easy fabrication of 2-D CdSe nanoparticle arrays with variable sizes on a solid substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles1 aKim, Jin Kon0 tChemical communications.g2008 Feb. 29, , no. 10 p.1193-1195dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b718232e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024001200169040001800181100001600199245012000215300001600335506017300351520127200524592002801796650002101824650004101845650001301886650002701899650001601926650001801942650001201960650001201972650001201984650001801996650001502014650001402029650002702043650001702070650001102087650001402098650001402112650001302126650002602139650002002165650002802185650001102213653001902224653002202243653003002265653001202295700002002307700001802327700001502345700001402360700001702374773012902391856008202520856011402602956010302716961001302819852000902832655001202841IND60647216520221214231446.0190712e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064721652DNAL7 a3349112aris7 a10113/64721652hdl7 a10.1017/S14792621170000532doi8 ans12146  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, M.

The USDA-ARS NPGS (National Plant Germplasm System) collections hold 93 bamboo species in 20 genera. Total leaf protein, amino acid composition and elemental content for these important genetic resources had never been quantified. Lack of nutrition information hinders germplasm utilization. The above-mentioned nutritional traits were evaluated from these 93 species in this study. Leaf protein content among bamboo species ranged from 8.12 to 16.33% with an average of 12.84%. This average was higher than 9.0% observed for switchgrass leaves, but considerably lower than 32.48% in cassava leaves. For 18 quantified amino acids, there was more than a twofold variation among the samples evaluated. For 12 quantified mineral elements, there was significant variability from the low end (4.2-fold, 2.27–9.52 mg/g calcium; 4.4-fold, 56.17–246.43 µg/g sodium) to the high end (61.5-fold, 17.67–1087.0 µg/g manganese; 40.8-fold, 42.0–1713.5 µg/g aluminium). Due to their variability in leaf nutritive value, bamboo species should be carefully chosen when they are used as a feedstock. The results from this study will be useful for the bamboo industry, producers and consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aUSDA National Plant Germplasm System 3aaluminum 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3abamboo shoots 3abamboos 3acalcium 3acassava 3acrude protein 3afeedstocks 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aleaf protein 3aleaves 3alivestock 3amanganese 3aminerals 3anutrition information 3anutritive value 3aplant genetic resources 3asodium 0aanimal feeding 0agenetic resources 0aleaf nutrition evaluation 0aPoaceae1 aHarrison, M.

In these cases, characterization of immune effector mechanisms and identification of protective epitopes/immunogens has been informative for the development of successful vaccine programs. Diseases in which the immune system does not rapidly clear the acute infection and/or convalescent immunity does not provide highly effective protection against secondary challenge pose a major hurdle for clinicians and scientists. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) falls primarily into this category, though not entirely. PRRSV causes a prolonged infection, though the host eventually clears the virus. Neutralizing antibodies can provide passive protection when present prior to challenge, though infection can be controlled in the absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies. In addition, primed pigs (through natural exposure or vaccination with a modified-live vaccine) show some protection against secondary challenge. While peripheral PRRSV-specific T cell responses have been examined, their direct contribution to antibody-mediated immunity and viral clearance have not been fully elucidated. The innate immune response following PRRSV infection, particularly the antiviral type I interferon response, is meager, but when provided exogenously, IFN-α enhances PRRSV immunity and viral control. Overall, the quality of immunity induced by natural PRRSV infection is not ideal for informing vaccine development programs.The epitopes necessary for protection may be identified through natural exposure or modified-live vaccines and subsequently applied to vaccine delivery platforms to accelerate induction of protective immunity following vaccination. Collectively, further work to identify protective B and T cell epitopes and mechanisms by which PRRSV eludes innate immunity will enhance our ability to develop more effective methods to control and eliminate PRRS disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aacute course 3aadaptive immunity 3acontrol methods 3aepitopes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterferon-alpha 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3ascientists 3aswine 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aPRRSV 0aImmunology 0aAntibody 0aCell-mediated immunity 0aInnate immunity1 aOsorio, Fernando A.1 aMurtaugh, Michael P.1 aZuckermann, Federico A.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 167, no. 1-2 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245020000161300001600361520149000377592002801867650001801895650002401913650002001937650001701957650001801974650001401992650001502006650001402021650001102035650001902046650002702065650001502092650001802107650001102125650001702136650002602153650001402179650002002193700002802213700002502241700002002266700001902286773009102305856007302396852000902469655001202478IND60340792320221123030023.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034079232DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.134042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Martin,10aCytokinin concentrations and CHASE‐DOMAIN CONTAINING HIS KINASE 2 (NaCHK2)‐ and NaCHK3‐mediated perception modulate herbivory‐induced defense signaling and defenses in Nicotiana attenuata  ap. 645-658.  aHerbivore attack elicits changes in cytokinins (CKs), but how these changes influence defense signaling remains poorly described. We investigated the influence of the CK pathway on the well‐described inducible defense pathways of Nicotiana attenuata in response to wounding with and without elicitors from the specialist herbivore Manduca sexta. CK pathway manipulation often suffers from substantial side effects on plant growth and development. We therefore used multiple manipulation tools including spray application of CKs, chemically‐inducible expression of the CK biosynthesis enzyme isopentenyltransferase, and transient and constitutive RNAi‐mediated gene silencing of CK receptors to resolve the function of CKs in plant defense. The results demonstrated that CK concentrations in leaves and perception through CHASE‐DOMAIN CONTAINING HIS KINASE 2 (NaCHK2) and NaCHK3 were important for the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and phenolamides and proteinase inhibitor activity. By contrast, the CK pathway did not promote the accumulation of the active JA‐isoleucine conjugate and negatively regulated the release of specific green leaf volatile esters. Interestingly, CK signaling also promotes the systemic phenolamide accumulation. We conclude that the CK pathway is an important regulator of herbivory‐inducible defense signaling and chemistry, which expands its reported participation in adjusting a plant's physiology to abiotic and biotic stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManduca sexta 3aNicotiana attenuata 3aadverse effects 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic stress 3achemistry 3acytokinins 3aelicitors 3aesters 3agene silencing 3agrowth and development 3aherbivores 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areceptors 3astress response1 aMeza‐Canales, Ivan D.1 aBrütting, Christoph1 aBaldwin, Ian T.1 aMeldau, Stefan0 tnew phytologist.g2015 Aug., v. 207, no. 3 p.645-658dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.134043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245007000161300001800231520122900249592002801478650002001506650002901526650002201555650002101577650002201598650001201620650001101632650001201643650001101655650001501666650001001681650001901691650001701710650001001727650000901737651001201746700002201758700001801780773013101798856007201929852000902001655001202010IND60648086620221119162244.0190626e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064808662DNAL7 a10.3390/f50716822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolopainen, Markus10aOutlook for the Next Generation’s Precision Forestry in Finland  ap. 1682-1694.  aDuring the past decade in forest mapping and monitoring applications, the ability to acquire spatially accurate, 3D remote-sensing information by means of laser scanning, digital stereo imagery and radar imagery has been a major turning point. These 3D data sets that use single- or multi-temporal point clouds enable a wide range of applications when combined with other geoinformation and logging machine-measured data. New technologies enable precision forestry, which can be defined as a method to accurately determine characteristics of forests and treatments at stand, sub-stand or individual tree level. In precision forestry, even individual tree-level assessments can be used for simulation and optimization models of the forest management decision support system. At the moment, the forest industry in Finland is looking forward to next generation’s forest inventory techniques to improve the current wood procurement practices. Our vision is that in the future, the data solution for detailed forest management and wood procurement will be to use multi-source and -sensor information. In this communication, we review our recent findings and describe our future vision in precision forestry research in Finland.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aforest industries 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforests 3alasers 3alogging 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3atrees 3awood 3aFinland1 aVastaranta, Mikko1 aHyyppä, Juha0 tForests.g2014 July 15, v. 5, no. 7 p.1682-1694dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f50716823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002700161245008800188300001600276500000900292520065600301592002800957650001900985650002001004650002301024650001401047650001801061650000901079700001701088700001901105700002001124773014801144856009601292852000901388655001201397IND60668498020221120050514.0191125e197903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066849802DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300020037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBickelhaupt, Donald H.10aSeasonal Weather Regimes Influence Interpretation of Pinus resinosa Foliar Analysis  ap. 417-420.  aepub  aA technique is described for quantifying the influence of seasonal precipitation and atmospheric temperature patterns (using degree-day summations) on annual foliar analysis data.

However, results of experimental and observational studies often conflict, leading to vigorous debate about the mechanistic importance of diversity in determining invasion success in the field, as well as other ecosystem properties, such as productivity and stability. In this study, we employed both field experiments and observational approaches to assess the effects of diversity on the invasion of a subtidal marine invertebrate community by three species of nonindigenous ascidians (sea squirts). In experimentally assembled communities, decreasing native diversity increased the survival and final percent cover of invaders, whereas the abundance of individual species had no effect on these measures of invasion success. Increasing native diversity also decreased the availability of open space, the limiting resource in this system, by buffering against fluctuations in the cover of individual species. This occurred because temporal patterns of abundance differed among species, so space was most consistently and completely occupied when more species were present. When we held diversity constant, but manipulated resource availability, we found that the settlement and recruitment of new invaders dramatically increased with increasing availability of open space. This suggests that the effect of diversity on invasion success is largely due to its effects on resource (space) availability. Apart from invasion resistance, the increased temporal stability found in more diverse communities may itself be considered an enhancement of ecosystem function. In field surveys, we found a strong negative correlation between native‐species richness and the number and frequency of nonnative invaders at the scale of both a single quadrat (25 × 25 cm), and an entire site (50 × 50 m). Such a pattern suggests that the means by which diversity affects invasion resistance in our experiments is important in determining the distribution of invasive species in the field. Further synthesis of mechanistic and observational approaches should be encouraged, as this will increase our understanding of the conditions under which diversity does (and does not) play an important role in determining the distribution of invaders in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscidiacea 3abiodiversity 3acolonizing ability 3aecological function 3afield experimentation 3ainvasive species 3amarine ecosystems 3aobservational studies 3aopen space 3asurveys1 aFried, Heather1 aOsman, Richard W.1 aWhitlatch, Robert B.0 tEcology.g2002 Sept., v. 83, no. 9 p.2575-2590dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083%5B2575:BIRAME%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002400184245009500208300001800303506007600321520114800397592002801545506003701573650002701610650001301637650001601650650002001666650000901686650001501695650000901710650002201719650001601741650001101757650003601768650003901804650001501843650003401858650005001892650004701942650003101989650001402020650003602034650005802070650001702128650001302145650002202158650001102180650005202191650002702243650006602270650003102336650001602367650002302383650003602406700002502442700002202467773017202489856004602661852000902707655001202716IND4486971320221207141119.0120510e20120508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448697132DNAL7 a225177442pmid7 aPMC33589012pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11195051092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Stephanie C.10aNonthermal ATP-dependent fluctuations contribute to the in vivo motion of chromosomal loci  ap. 7338-7343.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChromosomal loci jiggle in place between segregation events in prokaryotic cells and during interphase in eukaryotic nuclei. This motion seems random and is often attributed to Brownian motion. However, we show here that locus dynamics in live bacteria and yeast are sensitive to metabolic activity. When ATP synthesis is inhibited, the apparent diffusion coefficient decreases, whereas the subdiffusive scaling exponent remains constant. Furthermore, the magnitude of locus motion increases more steeply with temperature in untreated cells than in ATP-depleted cells. This "superthermal" response suggests that untreated cells have an additional source of molecular agitation, beyond thermal motion, that increases sharply with temperature. Such ATP-dependent fluctuations are likely mechanical, because the heat dissipated from metabolic processes is insufficient to account for the difference in locus motion between untreated and ATP-depleted cells. Our data indicate that ATP-dependent enzymatic activity, in addition to thermal fluctuations, contributes to the molecular agitation driving random (sub)diffusive motion in the living cell.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3adiffusivity 3aenzyme activity 3aheat 3ainterphase 3aloci 3aprokaryotic cells 3atemperature 3ayeasts 2a2,4-Dinitrophenolxpharmacology 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAlgorithms 2aAntimetabolitesxpharmacology 2aChromosomes, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromosomes, Fungalxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDeoxyglucosexpharmacology 2aDiffusion 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Loci 2aKinetics 2aMicroscopy, Video 2aMotion 2aNucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRifampinxpharmacology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSodium Azidexpharmacology 2aTemperature 2aTime-Lapse Imaging 2aUncoupling Agentsxpharmacology1 aSpakowitz, Andrew J.1 aTheriot, Julie A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 May 8, v. 109, no. 19 p.7338-7343dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1119505109  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012300160300002000283500001900303520123700322592002801559650001301587650000801600650001301608650001801621650001901639650001601658650001601674700002401690700001801714700001701732700002401749773012501773856007401898852000901972655001201981IND60717474720221123033014.0201111e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071747472DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06115h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Rose, Angela10aMicrostructure and long-term stability of solder joints on nickel-plated aluminium formed during short soldering times  ap. 40215-40224.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWithin this work, we demonstrate that an easy soldering process in combination with wet chemical coating is suitable to realize a strong and reliable solder interconnection of Al substrates, even at short soldering times <5 s in ambient air. The microstructure of solder joints on wet chemically treated aluminum foils is investigated. A single and double zincate pre-treatment are compared to activate the Al surface, followed by electroless Ni plating. The quality of the solderable Ni surface is characterized by contact angle measurements, yielding good wettability (<60°), which is also achieved after isothermally heating (250 °C) the Ni-coated Al foils for 100 min. The microstructure of the Sn62Pb36Ag2 solder joints is investigated by SEM and EDX of cross sections, directly after soldering as well as after isothermal aging at 85 °C. Under the used soldering conditions, with a soldering temperature at about 280 °C, diffusion zones <500 nm were identified. Nonetheless, high peel forces after soldering >5 N mm⁻¹ show stable values under aging conditions of 85 °C for 1000 hours. This could be correlated to a mixed fracture pattern, promoting the high adhesion due to the absence of a dominant failure mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3aaluminum 3acontact angle 3amicrostructure 3atemperature 3awettability1 aMikolasch, Gabriele1 aKamp, Mathias1 aKraft, Achim1 aNowottnick, Mathias0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 10, no. 66 p.40215-40224dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06115h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008500162300001600247520213400263592002802397650001302425650001502438650001902453650002602472650001902498650001202517650001302529650001302542650001702555700002102572700003002593700003002623773013802653856007402791852000902865655001202874IND60641877120221117083700.0190506e20170103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064187712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta07145g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandi, Shyamapada10aStrategically designed azolyl-carboxylate MOFs for potential humid CO₂ capture  ap. 535-543.  aDevelopment of solid sorbents with optimal CO₂ capture characteristics is key to improving the efficiency of PSA based CO₂ separation. Of the several potential sorbents, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) hold a key niche. This is owing to their modular tunable structures and manipulatable adsorption sites. Yet, developing a MOF that meets the multiple demands of a gas-separation sorbent remains a challenge. Particularly, tuning them to adsorb CO₂ over the more polar water is quite difficult. The presence of highly polarizing metal centers and oxygen-rich sites in MOFs makes it difficult to retain their CO₂ adsorption capacities under humid gas streams. However, tailoring the organic framework to incorporate humid CO₂ capture properties should be feasible. Along these lines, here we have developed a family of iso-structural MOFs built from bi-functional ligands that carry basic azolyl and chelating carboxylate groups together. Importantly, the framework is built by employing acetate moieties as ‘modulators’; they provide a hydrophobic lining to the pore-walls. This not only enables selective adsorption of CO₂, but also helps retain about 80% of the capture capacity even upon exposure to 75% RH. Along with its other advantageous features: high CO₂ uptake and selectivity (3 mmol g⁻¹ and s(CO₂–N₂) = ∼500 for 85N₂ : 15CO₂@303 K); surface area: ∼700 m² g⁻¹, working capacity: 2.6 mmol g⁻¹; optimal HOA (22–30 kJ mol⁻¹) and CO₂ kinetics (Dc = 1.02 × 10⁻⁸ m² s⁻¹), these MOFs can qualify as efficient candidates for humid CO₂ capture. Furthermore, we identify the most-favorable CO₂ adsorption sites via simulated annealing methods, from which the presence of polarized CO₂ molecules located adjacent to the π-electron rich pore walls can be seen. Importantly, these polarized molecules form T-shaped configurations among themselves via C(δ+ve)⋯O(δ−ve) interactions resembling those found in solid CO₂, a cooperative feature that is not observed in the other CO₂ molecules in the structure, which are not proximal to the polarizing walls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3amoieties 3asorbents 3asurface area1 aHaldar, Sattwick1 aCakrabartī, Debāñjana,1 aVaidhyanathan, Ramanathan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2017 Jan. 3, v. 5, no. 2 p.535-543dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07145g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015500171300001400326520152300340592002801863650002001891650002201911650002201933650001401955650001101969650002101980650004902001650001402050650001102064650004102075650001602116650000902132650001302141650001402154650000702168650001902175650001602194650002702210650001302237650001602250653002602266653000802292653001802300653001802318700001802336700001602354700001802370700001802388700005702406773008902463856008902552852000902641655001202650IND60606375720221119030004.0180725e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060637572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Wenxiu10aEfficient transformation of DDT by peroxymonosulfate activated with cobalt in aqueous systems: Kinetics, products, and reactive species identification  ap. 68-76.  aRecently, sulfate radical (SO4·−) based-advanced oxidation technologies (AOTs) have been attracted great attention in the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. In the present study, Co²⁺ ions activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system was used to degrade 1, 1, 1-trichloro-2, 2′bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) in aqueous solutions. It was found that DDT was efficiently degraded in the PMS/Co(II) solutions within several hours, and the degradation efficiency of DDT was dependent on the concentrations of PMS and Co(II), and the optimum molar ratio of PMS and Co(II) was 50:1. The degradation kinetics of DDT were well described with pseudo-first-order equations over a range of temperature (10–40 °C), and the activation energy that was calculated with Arrhenius equation was 72.3 ± 2.6 kJ/mol. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and GC–MS techniques were applied to identify the intermediates and reactive species for DDT degradation. The results indicated that SO4·− and OH were the main reactive species accounting for DDT degradation. Dichlorobenzophenone, 4-chlorobenzoic acid and benzylalcohol were the dominant intermediates for DDT degradation, and the likely degradation pathway of DDT was proposed on the basis of these identified products. Increasing pH inhibited the formation of SO4·− and OH, and thus decreased the catalytic degradation of DDT. Cl⁻ ion was found to significantly inhibit, while NO3− and dissolved oxygen had limited effects on DDT degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aactivation energy 3aaqueous solutions 3achlorides 3acobalt 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aequations 3aethane 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agroundwater 3aions 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolluted soils 3aremediation 3aspecies identification 3asulfates 3atemperature 0aCatalytic degradation 0aDDT 0aFree radicals 0aIntermediates1 aFang, Guodong1 aWang, Yujun1 aWu, Tongliang1 aZhu, Changyin1 aZhou, Dongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0363-99450 tChemosphere.g2016 Apr., v. 148 p.68-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245013200173300001600305520124700321592002801568650001201596650002301608650003001631650001801661650002201679650001401701650001101715650001901726653003501745653004501780653001601825653002501841700001401866773009101880856009001971852000902061655001202070IND60615972920221119132724.0201202e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061597292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xiaolan10aComputational investigation of the atmospheric oxidation reactions of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins initiated by OH radicals  ap. 548-553.  aDensity functional theory (DFT) method was used to study OH-initiated atmospheric oxidative reactions of some polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs). B3LYP functional and 6–311++G (2df,p) basis set were applied to optimize molecular structures of all stationary points involved in the investigated reactions. The rate constants for key elementary reactions were estimated by means of transition state theory. The computational results demonstrate that all addition reactions of PBDDs with OH radicals can occur spontaneously at standard conditions, however, the OH addition reactions are very slow due to low atmospheric concentration of OH radicals. Addition reactions occurring at γ-C position dominate in OH addition of all PBDDs. With the number of bromine atoms substituting at α-sites increases, the overall rate coefficients of OH addition decrease. The succeeding addition reactions of PBDD-OH adducts with O₂ take place hardly both thermodynamically and kinetically. Abstraction reaction of H atoms by O₂ is a governing route for PBDD-α(β)-adducts without bromine atoms at the same site, while the fused-ring CO bond fission is a main reaction channel for PBDD-γ-adducts, which will produce substituted phenoxy radicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3achemical structure 3adensity functional theory 3afree radicals 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3athermodynamics 0aAtmospheric oxidation reaction 0aPolybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) 0aOH radicals 0aDegradation products1 aWang, Yan0 tChemosphere.g2018 Dec., v. 212 p.548-553dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010800162300002000270520179500290592002802085650001602113650002302129650002102152650001902173650002102192650001502213650002202228650001402250650001902264650001302283650001102296650002202307650004002329650001802369650001702387700001802404700001802422700001702440700001802457700001802475700002302493700001802516700001802534700002402552700001802576700001802594773014402612856007402756852000902830655001202839IND60641877220221117084019.0190506e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064187722DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta07148a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaboe, Patrick O.10aBiomimetic wiring and stabilization of photosynthetic membrane proteins with block copolymer interfaces  ap. 15457-15463.  aIntegrating photosynthetic membrane proteins with non-biological materials such as polymers and electrodes is attractive, as it could allow new ways of harvesting solar energy for direct electrical power, sensing, or chemical production. However, such integration is challenging, as these proteins have to be “wired” to electrodes and oriented to maximize light capture and electron transfer all while maintaining long-term activity. In this work we present a durable and unique solution to the challenges of stabilization and wiring of photosynthetic membrane proteins on electrodes. A block copolymer, poly(butadiene)₁₂-poly(ethylene oxide)₈ (PB₁₂-PEO₈), that mimics the bilayer assembly of lipids was used to stabilize photosystem I (PSI) in a near-native hydrophobic environment. At high protein concentrations, large, highly packed planar membranes (∼4 nm thick) were formed, which allowed high surface loading of protein at the electrode interface. To “wire” these membranes with metal electrodes, a conductive block copolymer bilayer based on the same PB₁₂-PEO₈ but with intercalated conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) was used. This photo-active conductive layer was used to conduct electrons while maintaining a stabilizing cell membrane-like hydrated environment at the protein–metal interface. Photocurrents approaching 35.0 ± 3.5 μA cm⁻² were generated upon illumination of these assembled devices with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), among the highest reported so far for such systems on a per protein basis. This is the first application of membrane proteins completely stabilized in and on a block copolymer support for an energy-relevant electrochemical device and may represent the highest photocurrent generation per protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3acomposite polymers 3aelectric current 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3ahydrophobicity 3alighting 3alipids 3amembrane proteins 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aphotosystem I 3asolar energy1 aConte, Emelia1 aChan, Stanley1 aFeroz, Hasin1 aFerlez, Bryan1 aFarell, Megan1 aPoyton, Matthew F.1 aSines, Ian T.1 aYan, Hengjing1 aBazan, Guillermo C.1 aGolbeck, John1 aManish Kumar,0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 4, no. 40 p.15457-15463dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07148a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005900137245016800196300001600364500002000380520167900400592002802079596009302107650002602200650000802226650002802234650001802262650000902280650001602289650001802305650001102323650001002334650001902344650002402363650001602387650001802403650001002421650001702431700005802448700002102506700003002527700006102557700001702618700004402635773012302679856007102802852000902873655001202882IND60681330320221118062859.0200115e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133032DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.55662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpadaro, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5207-934510aAspergillus fumigatus population dynamics and sensitivity to demethylation inhibitor fungicides in whole‐crop corn, high moisture corn and wet grain corn silages  ap. 685-694.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Aspergillus fumigatus, the causal agent of aspergillosis in humans, is commonly present as a saprophyte in various organic substrates, such as spoiled silages. Aspergillosis is generally combated with demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides, but the recent appearance of resistant medical and environmental strains made current treatment strategies less reliable. The goal of this study was to determine the evolution of A. fumigatus populations during the ensiling process of whole‐crop corn, high moisture corn and wet grain corn, and to monitor the sensitivity of isolates from treated and untreated fields to one medical and one agricultural DMI fungicide. RESULTS: A. fumigatus was isolated from fresh forage at harvest at rather low concentrations (10² cfu g⁻¹). The low frequency lingered during the silage process (at 60 and 160 days), whereas it significantly increased during air exposure (at 7 and 14 days of air exposure). Field treatment of corn with a mixture of prothioconazole and tebuconazole did not affect the sensitivity of A. fumigatus isolates. One of 29 isolates from the untreated plot was resistant to voriconazole. A unique amino acid substitution (E427K) was detected in the cyp51A gene of 10 of 12 sequenced isolates, but was not associated with DMI resistance. CONCLUSION: A. fumigatus significantly increased during aerobic deterioration of ensilaged corn after silo opening, compared with the low presence in fresh corn and during ensiling. Field treatment of corn with DMI fungicides did not affect the sensitivity of A. fumigatus isolates collected from fresh and ensiled corn. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  aSOST‐MILK ‐ Plant health emergencies of corncFondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aair 3aamino acid substitution 3aaspergillosis 3acorn 3acorn silage 3ademethylation 3aforage 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3apopulation dynamics 3asaprophytes 3asilage making 3asilos 3atebuconazole1 aMatic, Slavica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0885-87441 aPrencipe, Simona1 aFerrero, F.q(Francesco),1 aBorreani, Giorgio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7726-41731 aGisi, Ulrich1 aGullino, M.

Current approaches for modelling live fuel moisture content typically focus on the use of drought indices. However, these have mixed success partly because of species-specific differences in drought responses. Here we seek to understand the physiological mechanisms driving changes in live fuel moisture content, and to investigate the potential for incorporating plant physiological traits into live fuel moisture models. We measured the dynamics of leaf moisture content, access to water resources (through stable isotope analyses) and physiological traits (including leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, and cellular osmotic and elastic adjustments) across a fire season in a Mediterranean mixed forest in Catalonia, NE Spain. We found that differences in both seasonal variation and minimum values of live fuel moisture content were a function of access to water resources and plant physiological traits. Specifically, those species with the lowest minimum moisture content and largest seasonal variation in moisture (Cistus albidus: 49–137% and Rosmarinus officinalis: 47–144%) were most reliant on shallow soil water and had the lowest values of predawn leaf water potential. Species with the smallest variation in live fuel moisture content (Pinus nigra: 96–116% and Quercus ilex: 56–91%) exhibited isohydric behaviour (little variation in midday leaf water potential, and relatively tight regulation of stomata in response to soil drying). Of the traits measured, predawn leaf water potential provided the strongest predictor of live fuel moisture content (R2 = 0.63, AIC = 249), outperforming two commonly used drought indices (both with R2 = 0.49, AIC = 258). This is the first study to explicitly link fuel moisture with plant physiology and our findings demonstrate the potential and importance of incorporating ecophysiological plant traits to investigating seasonal changes in fuel moisture and, more broadly, forest flammability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra 3adrought 3afuel moisture index 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3astomatal conductance 3aCistus albidus 3aQuercus ilex 3amodels 3afire season 3aleaf water potential 3asoil water 3awater content 3awater resources 3aprediction 3amixed forests 3aecophysiology 3aflammability 3afuels 3astomata 3adrying 3aSpain 0aWildfire 0aleaves 0aDrought code 0aFire ecophysiology 0aKBDI 0aResprouting 0aTurgor loss point1 aHedo, Javier1 aArteaga, Carles1 aSugai, Tetsuto1 aResco de Dios, Víctor0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 263 p.417-427dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245008200169300001600251500000900267520179300276592002802069650001502097650001302112650001802125650001502143650001902158650001502177650001202192650001302204650002502217650001402242650001902256650001502275650002302290650000902313700002802322700002602350773019102376856007702567852000902644655001202653IND60666430920221121043013.0191028e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643092DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.09202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Cruz, M.

The aim was to gain insight into soil characteristics in surfactant-enhanced desorption of herbicides from soils. Adsorption and desorption isotherms in water, in all Triton X-100 solutions for atrazine, and in solutions of 0.75 times the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and 1.50cmc for linuron fit the Freundlich equation. All desorption isotherms showed hysteresis. Hysteresis coefficients decreased for linuron and increased or decreased for atrazine in Triton X-100 solutions. These variations were dependent on surfactant concentration and soil OM and clay contents. In the soil–water–surfactant system desorption of linuron from all soils was always greater than in the soil–water system but for atrazine this only occurred at concentrations higher than 50cmc. For the highest Triton X-100 concentration (100cmc), the desorption of the most hydrophobic herbicide (linuron) was increased more than 18-fold with respect to water in soil with an OM content of 10.3% while the atrazine desorption was increased 3-fold. The effect of Triton X-100 on the desorption of both herbicides was very low in soil with a high clay content. The results indicate the potential use of Triton X-100 to facilitate the desorption of these herbicides from soil to the water–surfactant system. They also contribute to better understanding of the interactions of different molecules and surfaces in the complex soil–herbicide–water surfactant system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatrazine 3aclay fraction 3adesorption 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3alinuron 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3aorganic matter 3asoil water 3asorption isotherms 3aurea1 aSánchez-Martín, M.

Sampling sites were allocated within the littoral and deeper waters of one embayment, the main-stream, and at turbines. Annual carbon emissions were estimated at 2.3 × 10⁵ ± 7.45 × 10⁴ t C year⁻¹, or in CO₂-equivalents (CO₂-eq) at 1.33 × 10⁶ ± 4.5 × 10⁵ t CO₂-eq year⁻¹. Diffusion across the water surface was the main pathway accounting for 96% of total carbon emissions. Ebullition was limited to littoral areas. A slight accumulation of CO₂, but not of CH₄, in bottom waters close to the turbines inlet led to degassing emissions about 8 × 10³ t C year⁻¹. Emissions in littoral areas were higher than in main-stream and contribute to 40% of the total carbon. Carbon (C) emissions per electricity generated, at 60% of installed capacity, is 0.05 t C-CO₂-eq MWh⁻¹. The ratio increases to 0.09 t C-CO₂ MWh⁻¹, equating 80% of the emissions from natural gas and 40% of diesel or coal power plants. Retention time and benthic metabolism were identified as main drivers for carbon emissions in littoral areas, while water column mixing and rapid water flow are important factors preventing CH₄ accumulation and loss by degassing. Our results indicate that Itaparica Reservoir, located in the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, acts as a source of GHGs. Management measurements are needed to prevent emissions to raise in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  aFKz 01LL0904CcGerman Federal Ministry of Education and Research 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3adeaeration 3aelectricity generation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alittoral zone 3ametabolism 3amethane 3amixing 3anatural gas 3apower plants 3asemiarid zones 3aturbines 3awater flow 3awater power 3aBrazil1 aCasper, Peter0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 Oct., v. 18, no. 7 p.1901-1912dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1289-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014000159300002000299520112600319592002801445650001901473650001401492650002301506650002101529650001401550650001801564650001401582650001101596650001401607650001901621650001801640650001501658650001701673650002301690650001301713650002501726700002001751700001601771700001901787700001901806773014401825856007401969852000902043655001202052IND60641877320221117084032.0190506e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064187732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta07149j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrà, Albert10aHighly efficient electrochemical and chemical hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol using recyclable narrow mesoporous magnetic CoPt nanowires  ap. 15676-15687.  aToxic nitro-compounds, such as 4-nitrophenol, are one of the most common wastewater industrial pollutants. Thus, efficient ways to neutralize them are actively pursued. Here novel procedures to degrade these types of compounds based on the use of mesoporous magnetic nanowires are demonstrated. Fully-mesoporous magnetic narrow (25 nm) CoPt nanowires with an extraordinary effective area are grown using ionic liquid-in-water microemulsions in alumina templates. These mesoporous nanowires are shown to be efficient catalysts for the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol by electrocatalysis. Additionally, these nanowires also present exceptional conventional catalytic activity when used in conjunction with NaBH₄, particularly when magnetic stirring is utilized. In fact, magnetically actuated mesoporous CoPt nanowires drastically outperform all state-of-the-art 4-nitrophenol catalysts. Additionally, given their magnetic character, these nanowires can be easily recycled and reused. Thus, the outstanding catalytic performance of mesoporous CoPt nanowires makes them excellent candidates for wastewater treatment agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aemulsions 3ahydrogenation 3amagnetism 3amixing 3ananowires 3aneutralization 3ap-nitrophenol 3apollutants 3aporous media 3asodium borohydride 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment1 aAlcobé, Xavier1 aSort, Jordi1 aNogués, Josep1 aVallés, Elisa0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 4, no. 40 p.15676-15687dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07149j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245008400179500001900263520196300282592002802245650000802273650001602281650001302297650001202310650001702322650001302339650001202352650001002364650001902374650002502393650001602418651001002434653003002444653001902474653002102493653003102514700002402545700002602569700001902595700002202614700002302636700002102659700002102680700002402701773010702725856008702832852000902919655001202928IND60697130120221119041123.0200628e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069713012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1176182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrados-Roman, Cristina10aAtmospheric formaldehyde at El Teide and Pic du Midi remote high-altitude sites  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFormaldehyde (CH₂O) is a tracer of the photochemical activity of the atmosphere. Linked to air quality, CH₂O is an ozone (O₃) precursor and serves as a proxy for natural and anthropogenic reactive organic emissions. As a product of the photooxidation of methane (CH₄) and other hydrocarbons (e.g., isoprene), CH₂O represents an important source of radicals in the remote free troposphere. This work aims at improving the characterization of this part of the troposphere where data are scarce. In particular, this study assesses the presence of CH₂O at two high-altitude remote sites: El Teide (TEI, 3570 m a.s.l., Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain) and Pic du Midi (PDM, 2877 m a.s.l., French Pyrenees). Through ground-based remote sensing measurements performed during two field campaigns in July (TEI) and September (PDM) 2013, this study presents the vertical distribution of CH₂O at both locations. Results at PDM show that CH₂O mixing ratios follow a decreasing vertical profile with a mean maximum of 0.5 ± 0.2 nmol mol⁻¹ (i.e., ppbv) at the instruments' altitude. At TEI, observations indicate an uplifted layer of CH₂O with a mean maximum of 1.3 ± 0.3 nmol mol⁻¹ at 3.8 km a.s.l. (i.e., 300 m above the instrument's altitude). At both remote sites, the observed CH₂O levels are higher than expected for background methane oxidation (a threefold increase in the case of TEI). Air mass back trajectory analysis links CH₂O observations with abundant natural (e.g. forests) and/or anthropogenic isoprene emissions from the region nearby PDM, while the high CH₂O levels detected at TEI indicate in-plume formation of CH₂O resulting from its precursors emitted from west-African and Canadian fires. Finally, as a key trace gas for O₃ and HOₓ chemistries, we estimate the upper limit of bromine monoxide (BrO) in the free troposphere at TEI and PDM to be 0.8 and 1.5 pmol mol⁻¹ (i.e., pptv) respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aaltitude 3abromine 3aformaldehyde 3aisoprene 3amethane 3aozone 3aphotooxidation 3aspatial distribution 3atroposphere 3aSpain 0aGround-based observations 0aRemote sensing 0aFree troposphere 0aVolatile organic compounds1 aFernández, Miguel,1 aGómez-Martín, Laura1 aCuevas, Emilio1 aGil-Ojeda, Manuel1 aMarusczak, Nicolas1 aPuentedura, Olga1 aSonke, Jeroen E.1 aSaiz-Lopez, Alfonso0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 234 p.117618-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1176183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245011000201520147000311592002801781650002101809650001501830650002001845650002101865650002501886650002301911650001501934650001501949650001401964650001301978653002701991653002602018653001702044653000902061653002402070700001202094700005202106700005002158700001702208700005202225700001402277773011202291856008302403852000902486655001202495IND60752550720221120024801.0211213e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1136712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6306-598210aIn situ peptide self-assembly on ionic nanochannel for dynamic monitoring of MMPs in extracellular matrix  aThe extracellular matrix (ECM) of tumor mediates malignant transformation and distant metastasis with extracellular proteinases, especially the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). However, there is no assay method to trace the dynamic content of MMPs in ECM. In this work, we have proposed a strategy by assembling peptide scaffold on ionic nanochannels to monitor the target proteinases. The short peptide unit is designed to induce self-assembly with good stability, biocompatibility and programmability, while ion nanochannels can provide electrochemical response upon the MMP activities. Taking MMP-2 as an example, the peptide unit includes two regions, one for self-assembly and one for bio-recognition, so the assembly region (KLVFF) can self-assemble to nanofiber networks. In the meantime, since the reactive region (PLGVR) has MMP-2 recognition site, the peptide assembly on nanochannel can thus be used for the detection of active MMP-2 in tumor microenvironment, with a wide linear detection range (10 fg/mL-10 ng/mL) and 6.6 fg/mL limit of detection. Moreover, the availability of the established ECM mimic is able to distinguish active MMP-2 from latent proMMP-2 in tumor samples. By designing different peptide units for self-assembly on the ionic nanochannel, the assay platform can be promisingly used for other proteinases in ECM, so this work may provide a useful approach to trace the dynamic content of the MMPs in tumor microenvironment (TEM).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aextracellular matrix 3ametalloproteinases 3ametastasis 3ananofibers 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 0aTumor microenvironment 0aPeptide self-assembly 0aNanochannels 0aMMPs 0aBioelectrochemistry1 aLi, Hao1 aShi, Liu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4916-93121 aLi, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4834-84471 aJia, Fengjie1 aGao, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3687-89451 aLi, Genxi0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 195 p.113671-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1136713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245008200177300001400259520118000273592002801453650001701481650002501498650002101523650002101544650001801565650001001583650001501593650001601608650001201624650001901636650001301655650001301668653000901681653002601690653001201716653001401728653002101742700002201763700002401785773011201809856008601921852000902007655001202016IND60615703120221120181906.0181029e20181110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061570312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChereddy, Kiran Kumar10aPLGA: From a classic drug carrier to a novel therapeutic activity contributor  ap. 10-13.  aPoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is well known for its biocompatibility and minimal toxicity. It is one of the most promising biodegradable polymeric drug delivery systems able to get endorsement from regulatory bodies to enter market. For many decades, PLGA has been functioning as an excipient, which by definition is pharmaceutically inert at a given dose of formulation. Lactate (one of the hydrolysis products of PLGA) has a key role in biochemical pathways and could improve physiological activities in certain illnesses by exerting therapeutic effects such as angiogenesis and promotion of healing. These activities, however, depend on the released amounts and metabolic clearance of lactate and route of formulation delivery. In the current commentary, along with several key notes on the lactate interactions, we would like to inform the PLGA research community that lactate (resulting from local delivery of physiologically significant amount of PLGA) may positively or negatively affect therapeutic efficacy of certain drugs. Hence, the excipient role of PLGA may be investigated for its potential pharmacological contributions in some biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiochemical pathways 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3amarkets 3ananotechnology 3apolymers 3atoxicity 0aPLGA 0aDrug delivery systems 0aLactate 0aExcipient 0aClinical studies1 aPayen, Valéry L.1 aPréat, Véronique,0 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 Nov. 10, v. 289 p.10-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008400171500001900255520122900274592002801503650001501531650001801546650001801564650003901582650002001621650001201641650001901653650001401672653001601686653002101702653003401723653001801757700002401775700002301799700002601822773010201848856008601950852000902036655001202045IND60716113320221122035652.0210124e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071611332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1064552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi, Farzad10aEffect of sucrose on phase and flow behavior of protein-polysaccharide mixtures  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of different sucrose levels on phase and flow behavior of two model polysaccharide-protein aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), Persian gum (PG)-sodium caseinate (NaCas) and sodium alginate (NaAlg)-NaCas, was studied. Phase diagrams were determined and changes in their shape and the actual position of phase boundary features were investigated in the presence of different sucrose concentrations. It was found that the thermodynamic compatibility of mixtures was enhanced by raising the level of sucrose leading to the concentration of protein-rich equilibrium phase and the dilution of polysaccharide-rich equilibrium phase. This was shown to clearly correspond to a decrease in the slope of the tie lines. SDS-PAGE pattern indicated that sucrose had no effect on selective fractionation of NaCas subunits between the equilibrium phases upon de-mixing. The flow behavior of these ATPS was found to depend on the volume ratio and composition of the equilibrium phases. At constant phase volume ratio, increasing sucrose concentration changed the viscosity in accordance with the nature of the continuous phase, whilst at constant composition, rising sucrose level promoted the viscosity and shear thinning behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaseinates 3afractionation 3ahydrocolloids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium alginate 3asucrose 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity 0aPersian gum 0aSodium caseinate 0aThermodynamic incompatibility 0aFlow behavior1 aKadkhodaee, Rassoul1 aEmadzadeh, Bahareh1 aNishinari, Katsuyoshi0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Apr., v. 113 p.106455-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1064553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245016900169300002000338500001900358520104200377592002801419650001401447650002101461650002101482650002101503650001801524650001301542650001701555650001301572650000801585650001601593700002801609700003101637700002801668773012501696856007401821852000901895655001201904IND60717475520221123045358.0201111e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071747552DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra06871c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrujillo, Sergio Alfonso10aTin(ii) chloride dihydrate/choline chloride deep eutectic solvent: redox properties in the fast synthesis of N-arylacetamides and indolo(pyrrolo)[1,2-a]quinoxalines  ap. 40552-40561.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this contribution a physicochemical, IR and Raman characterization for the tin(ii) chloride dihydrate/choline chloride eutectic mixture is reported. The redox properties of this solvent were also studied by cyclic voltammetry finding that it can be successfully used as an electrochemical solvent for electrosynthesis and electroanalytical processes and does not require negative potentials as verified by the reduction of nitrobenzene. The potential use of this eutectic mixture as a redox solvent was further explored in obtaining aromatic amines and N-arylacetamides starting from a wide variety of nitroaromatic compounds. In addition, a fast synthetic strategy for the construction of a series of indolo(pyrrolo)[1,2-a]quinoxalines was developed by reacting 1-(2-nitrophenyl)-1H-indole(pyrrole) with aldehydes. This simple protocol offers a straightforward method for the construction of the target quinoxalines in short reaction times and high yields where the key step involves a tandem one-pot reductive cyclization-oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3acholine chloride 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrosynthesis 3anitrobenzenes 3apyrroles 3aquinoxalines 3asolvents 3atin 3avoltammetry1 aPeña-Solórzano, Diana1 aBejarano, Oscar Rodríguez1 aOchoa-Puentes, Cristian0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 10, no. 66 p.40552-40561dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra06871c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245017400201520149600375592002801871650001501899650002101914650001301935650002001948650001901968650001701987650002002004650001702024650001302041650001502054650001902069653001502088653002902103653003902132653003402171653003702205700001602242700001702258700001502275700001802290700001802308700001702326773011202343856008302455852000902538655001202547IND60752550920221120024822.0211213e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1136732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6087-897210aHigh-performance olfactory receptor-derived peptide sensor for trimethylamine detection based on Steglich esterification reaction and native chemical ligation connection  aTrimethylamine (TMA) commonly exists in daily life and is harmful to human health, therefore the convenient and sensitive monitoring of TMA is highly desired. In this study, we developed a method to fabricate a high-performance TMA sensor by chemically conjugating olfactory receptor-derived peptides (ORPs) to single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) on interdigital electrodes. First, the SWCNTs were modified with thioester by Steglich esterification reaction. Next, the ORPs with a cysteine residue at the N-terminus were connected to the thioester by native chemical ligation and modified to the surface of the SWCNTs. The chemical connection method enabled more effective loading of ORPs to the SWCNTs compared to the previously reported physical connection method. Using this approach, the ORPs-SWCNTs sensor for gaseous TMA was fabricated and enabled detection of TMA with a concentration as low as 0.01 parts per trillion, which was three orders of magnitude lower than the reported lowest detection limit up to date. Furthermore, we tested the performance of the ORP-sensor with vaporized TMA and TMA generated from various spoiled food, and the sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and stability for TMA detection. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed chemical connection method for the fabrication of ORP-sensor and the great potential of using these sensors for applications in environmental safety, food quality evaluation, and healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3aesterification 3afood quality 3ahealth services 3ahuman health 3apeptides 3athioesters 3atrimethylamine 0aGas sensor 0aNative chemical ligation 0aOlfactory receptor-derived peptide 0aSingle-walled carbon nanotube 0aSteglich esterification reaction1 aMa, Weichao1 aWei, Junqing1 aLan, Kuibo1 aYan, Shanchun1 aChen, Ruibing1 aQin, Guoxuan0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 195 p.113673-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1136733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012600171300001600297520100100313592002801314650003701342650001301379650001401392650001301406650002101419650001201440650001901452650001901471650001901490650001301509653002901522653003001551653001901581653002101600653001901621700001601640700001501656700001701671700001701688700001801705700001801723700001601741700005601757700002101813700001801834773009101852856009001943852000902033655001202042IND60615973220221119132409.0201202e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061597322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Wenyi10aMechanochemical treatment of Cr(VI) contaminated soil using a sodium sulfide coupled solidification/stabilization process  ap. 540-547.  aIn this research, mechanochemical reduction was carried out to remediate Cr(VI) contaminated soil, and the reduction effectiveness was evaluated by analyzing the corresponding leachable fraction obtained through the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) proposed by the EPA. The results indicated that mechanochemical reduction can efficiently reduce the Cr(VI) concentration in the leachate. Under a milling time of 2 h, milling speed of 500 rpm, ball-to-powder weight ratio of 14 and Na₂S dosage of 5%, the Cr(VI) leaching concentration significantly decreased from 663.98 mg L⁻¹ to 0.84 mg L⁻¹, much lower than the regulatory limit of 5 mg L⁻¹. In addition, the significant decrease in Cr(VI) was mainly due to the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), as supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The mechanochemical reduction with mechanism proposed in this experiment may involve two major processes: solidification and reduction (stabilization).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achromium 3aleachates 3aleaching 3amechanochemistry 3amilling 3apolluted soils 3asodium sulfide 3asolidification 3atoxicity 0aCr(VI) contaminated soil 0aMechanochemical treatment 0aRedox reaction 0aSoil remediation 0aSodium sulfide1 aXu, Weitong1 aWu, Zebing1 aZhang, Ziwei1 aWang, Lincai1 aBai, Jianfeng1 aWang, Xiaoyan1 aZhang, Qiwu1 aZhu, Xuefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1910-629X1 aZhang, Chenglong1 aWang, Jingwei0 tChemosphere.g2018 Dec., v. 212 p.540-547dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.08.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013000170300001400300520104800314592002801362653001401390653001501404653001801419653001201437653001401449653001401463653001501477653001001492653001201502653001501514700001901529700001901548700002201567700001801589700002101607773011601628856008601744852000901830655001201839IND60602561120221118225303.0180711e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060256112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSözen, Adnan10aImproving the thermal performance of diffusion absorption refrigeration system with alumina nanofluids: An experimental study  ap. 73-80.  aIn this study, the effect of the passive heat transfer improvement method of ammonia/water couple with alumina (Al2O3) particles in nano-size were examined in diffusion absorption coolers regarding to the heat performance of the system. Adding nanoparticles into fluid leads to significant improvement in heat transfer since the surface area and heat capacity of the fluid increase due to nanoparticles. Therefore, in this study cooling/absorption fluid mixtures with Al2O3 nanoparticles and their impact on system performance were assessed. The results of experiments indicated that the system with nanoparticles provided better absorption of heat from the generator and faster evaporation of the cooler from the cooling/absorption fluid. The connection units of the heat transfer in the system were investigated considering the effect of fluids containing nanoparticles. It was observed that the operation time of the system was reduced due to shorter heat transfer periods. Consequently, it resulted in obtaining desired temperature faster.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDiffusion 0aAbsorption 0aRefrigeration 0aAlumina 0aNanofluid 0aDiffusion 0aAbsorption 0aFroid 0aAlumine 0aNanofluide1 aÖzbaş, Engin1 aMenlik, Tayfun1 aÇakır, M.Tarık1 aGürü, Metin1 aBoran, Kurtuluş0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Aug., v. 44 p.73-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012300167300001600290520041900306592002800725650001300753650001000766650001000776650001600786650001200802651001000814653001400824653001400838653002000852653001700872653001400889653001400903653001600917653001300933700002500946773008200971856008101053852000901134655001201143IND60628764320221119072136.0190130s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062876432DNAL7 a10.1163/15685403-000038682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Peter K.

In 2009, the invasive yellow crazy ant Anoplolepis gracilipes was recorded for the first time within the palm forest, raising concern about its potential impacts on the endemic fauna. This research aimed to: (1) assess the current distribution and spread of A. gracilipes within the palm forest; (2) identify environmental variables that are linked to A. gracilipes distribution; and (3) compare endemic species richness and abundance in A. gracilipes invaded and uninvaded areas. Anoplolepis gracilipes was confined to the north-east of the site and remained almost stationary between April 2010 and December 2012, with isolated outbreaks into the forest. Infested areas had significantly higher temperature and humidity and lower canopy cover. Abundance and species richness of the endemic arboreal fauna were lower in the A. gracilipes invaded area. Molluscs were absent from the invaded area. The current restricted distribution of A. gracilipes in this ecosystem, combined with lower abundance of endemic fauna in the invaded area, highlight the need for further research to assess control measures and the possible role of biotic resistance to the invasion of the palm forest by A. gracilipes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoplolepis gracilipes 3aLodoicea maldivica 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3acanopy 3acontrol methods 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3aforests 3ahumidity 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amolluscs 3aspecies richness 3atemperature 3aSeychelles 0aEndemic arboreal species 0acoco de mer palm 0ageckos 0ainvasive alien species 0aislands 0aWorld Heritage Site 0aWestern Indian Ocean1 aCuthbert, Harriet1 aFox, Rebeckah1 aBirch, Darryl1 aBunbury, Nancy0 tNeoBiota.g2014 June 26, v. 22 p.43-57dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.22.66343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007700169500001900246520149300265592002801758650001301786650002001799650001101819650001601830650001801846650001201864650001301876650001301889650001101902650001301913650001101926651001501937651001101952653000801963653002401971653002301995653002102018653000702039653002302046700002402069700002602093773010702119856008702226852000902313655001202322IND60697130520221119042735.0200621e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069713052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1176232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorejwo, Ewa10aFractionation of mercury in aerosols of the southern Baltic coastal zone  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe form in which Hg occurs in the atmosphere is important to understand the toxicity and bioavailability of this metal. So far, research on mercury speciation in the atmosphere has mostly focused on its three forms: elemental gaseous mercury (GEM/Hg⁰), reactive gaseous mercury (GOM/Hg²⁺) and mercury bound in aerosols (TPM). However, these studies do not provide complete information on mercury compounds in aerosols. Only a few publications on mercury fractionation in TPM have been published, but these have focused mainly on describing the method and have provided only a limited number of environmental results. Therefore, the research aimed to identify forms of mercury occurring in aerosols in the coastal zone of the southern Baltic Sea, as well as to determine factors affecting the temporal changes in the share of individual Hg fractions. Aerosol samples were collected in Gdynia (Poland) from May 2016 to January 2017. A thermo-desorption technique was used for the determination of total mercury and Hg fractions. Mercury in aerosols was present mainly in labile factions related to mercury halides, mercury nitrate and organic mercury as well as gaseous mercury. The stable Hg fraction, mainly bound to Hg sulphide, constituted only 7% of total particulate mercury. The conducted research also allowed to determine the origin of mercury sources in aerosols. In the winter it was burning of fossil fuels, and in the summer biological activity and emission from the sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abioavailability 3acoasts 3aenvironment 3afractionation 3amercury 3anitrates 3asulfides 3asummer 3atoxicity 3awinter 3aBaltic Sea 3aPoland 0aTPM 0aParticulate mercury 0aParticulate matter 0aReactive mercury 0aRM 0aThermal desorption1 aSaniewska, Dominika1 aBełdowska, Magdalena0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 235 p.117623-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1176233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
