Along the Brazilian coast, three species of the genus Nausithoe Kölliker, 1853 have been recorded: Nausithoe atlantica Broch, 1914, Nausithoe punctata Kölliker, 1853, and Nausithoe aurea Silveira & Morandini, 1997. Living polyps (n = 9) of an unidentified nausithoid were collected in September 2002 off Arraial do Cabo (Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil) at a depth of 227 m, and have been kept in culture since then. We compared these specimens with three species cultured in our laboratory: Nausithoe aurea (from Ilhabela, São Paulo, Brazil), Nausithoe maculata Jarms, 1990 (from Cuba and Puerto Rico), and Nausithoe werneri Jarms, 1990 (from the Atlantic Ocean off Morocco and from the Mediterranean Sea). The criteria used for comparison were: main aspects of the morphology, life cycle, and DNA sequences (18S, 28S, and COI). The results indicate that the unidentified polyps belong to N. werneri. Furthermore, N. aurea is considered a junior synonym of N. maculata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronatae 3acoasts 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil 3aCuba 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMorocco 3aPuerto Rico 0aCoronamedusae 0ajellyfish 0alife cycle 0aperiderm 0apolyp 0ascyphomedusae 0asystematics1 aMaronna, Maximiliano Manuel1 aMorandini, André Carrara0 tZooKeys.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 984 p.1-21dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.984.563803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018800169300001600357520174400373592002802117650002902145650001102174650001802185650001102203650002202214650001402236650001502250650002002265650001102285650001802296650002402314650002202338650001302360650001302373650001602386650001402402653001302416653001402429653002102443653001702464700001402481700001502495700001402510700005202524700001202576700001702588700005402605773013102659856008502790852000902875655001202884IND60606402920221120130153.0180725e20180105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060640292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b006212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArarso, Zewdu10aProteome Comparisons between Hemolymph of Two Honeybee Strains (Apis mellifera ligustica) Reveal Divergent Molecular Basis in Driving Hemolymph Function and High Royal Jelly Secretion  ap. 402-419.  aHemolymph is vital for the immunity of honeybees and offers a way to investigate their physiological status. To gain novel insight into the functionality and molecular details of the hemolymph in driving increased Royal Jelly (RJ) production, we characterized and compared hemolymph proteomes across the larval and adult ages of Italian bees (ITbs) and Royal Jelly bees (RJbs), a stock selected from ITbs for increasing RJ output. Unprecedented in-depth proteome was attained with the identification of 3394 hemolymph proteins in both bee lines. The changes in proteome support the general function of hemolymph to drive development and immunity across different ages. However, age-specific proteome settings have adapted to prime the distinct physiology for larvae and adult bees. In larvae, the proteome is thought to drive temporal immunity, rapid organogenesis, and reorganization of larval structures. In adults, the proteome plays key roles in prompting tissue development and immune defense in newly emerged bees, in gland maturity in nurse bees, and in carbohydrate energy production in forager bees. Between larval and adult samples of the same age, RJbs and ITbs have tailored distinct hemolymph proteome programs to drive their physiology. In particular, in day 4 larvae and nurse bees, a large number of highly abundant proteins are enriched in protein synthesis and energy metabolism in RJbs. This implies that they have adapted their proteome to initiate different developmental trajectories and high RJ secretion in response to selection for enhanced RJ production. Our hitherto unexplored in-depth proteome coverage provides novel insight into molecular details that drive hemolymph function and high RJ production by RJbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera ligustica 3aadults 3acarbohydrates 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3ahemolymph 3ahoney bees 3aimmune response 3alarvae 3aorganogenesis 3aphysiological state 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aroyal jelly 3asecretion 0aproteome 0ahemolymph 0aRoyal Jelly bees 0aItalian bees1 aMa, Juan,1 aQi, Yuping1 aFeng, Mao1 aHan, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6974-86991 aHu, Han1 aMeng, Lifeng1 aLi, Jianke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4183-73360 tJournal of proteome research.g2018 Jan. 05, v. 17, no. 1 p.402-419dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b006213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170520120200275592002801477650002001505650002301525650001501548650001601563650001701579650001701596650002101613651001201634653001201646653001101658653002201669653002301691653001601714700001701730700001801747700002301765700002001788700002001808700003201828773009901860856008501959852000902044655001202053IND60752585320221120175006.0220124e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075258532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.1013632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeurer, Melanie10aRegional scale mapping of ecosystem services supply, demand, flow and mismatches in Southern Myanmar  aMapping ecosystem service (ES) supply, demand, and flow – and identifying supply/demand mismatches – has become a focus of ES research and has benefitted from recent advances in modelling techniques and their combination with Geographic Information Systems. But few studies have been done in data-scarce tropical forest frontiers and these were limited in terms of area, land uses, and number and types of ES. Aiming to evolve contemporary approaches, we used Bayesian networks to model and map nine ES across Myanmar’s Tanintharyi Region for local stakeholders. Results show that while there is a high supply of multiple ES at regional level, demand for ES in urban and rapidly developing agricultural areas is not fully covered. Further, we identified a clear connection between land tenure and ES outcomes for rural communities. Agricultural concessions and protected areas with restricted access for the local population were related to lower ES flows and more supply/demand mismatches than community forests or untenured land. For future research on local ES outcomes in tropical forest frontiers, we recommend combined mismatch and flow analyses under consideration of tenurial rights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aland tenure 3aspatial data 3astakeholders 3atropical forests 3aMyanmar 0aBalance 0aAccess 0aBayesian networks 0aFrontier landscape 0aTanintharyi1 aRueff, Henri1 aCelio, Enrico1 aHeinimann, Andreas1 aBlaser, Juergen1 aHtun, Aung Myin1 aZaehringer, Julie Gwendolin0 tEcosystem services.g2021 Dec., v. 52 p.101363-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.1013633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245011100189300001600300520182100316592002802137650003202165650002102197650001202218650001102230650001802241650001002259650001002269650001102279650002202290650002302312650001402335650001402349650001402363650000902377650003002386650001002416650001102426650001002437650001302447650001202460650006902472650004402541650003302585650002402618650002702642651001102669651002602680653003202706653001202738653001102750653002202761653001702783653001102800700002202811700002302833700002002856700001802876773012002894856008503014852000903099655001203108IND50068890020221118002802.0190401e20131018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006889002DNAL7 a237258222pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmhang, Gérald10aNutrias and muskrats as bioindicators for the presence of Echinococcus multilocularis in new endemic areas  ap. 283-287.  aNutrias (Myocastor coypus) and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are large invasive semi-aquatic or aquatic rodents, naturalized throughout Europe. They are regarded as pests, and can be infected with several pathogens and parasites transmissible to wildlife, livestock, pets and humans. As a rule, in Europe the life cycle of the cestode Echinococcus multilocularis involves red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) as main definitive hosts and common voles as intermediate hosts. The suitability of nutrias and muskrats as intermediate hosts has already been described. Here, we investigate the occurrence of E. multilocularis in the context of a wide-scale health study on nutrias and muskrats in 12 “départements” in the western part of France. During the sampling period, a total of 817 aquatic rodents were trapped in five rivers or ponds in each “départements”. During post-mortem examinations, lesions were observed on the livers of 21 nutrias and 104 muskrats, and analyzed by PCR and sequencing of the mitochondrial cox1 gene for specific identification. Several non-zoonotic parasites were identified: Taenia taeniaformis, Taenia mustelae, Taenia polyacantha and Taenia martis. Four livers from 2 nutrias and 2 muskrats exhibited E. multilocularis infection. One of the muskrats was infected with fertile E. multilocularis lesions. The 4 animals came from 3 French “départements” where foxes have recently been found to be infected by E. multilocularis. These results lead us to consider nutrias and muskrats as relevant bioindicators for the presence of E. multilocularis in this environment. Our results also suggest that, when listed as pests and targeted by large trapping campaigns, nutrias and muskrats could be used to detect the presence of E. multilocularis in areas considered free of this parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aMyocastor coypus 3aOndatra 3aTaenia 3aVulpes vulpes 3afoxes 3agenes 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3aintermediate hosts 3alivestock 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aponds 3arivers 3avoles 3awildlife 2aAnimals 2aEchinococcosis, Hepaticxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aEchinococcus multilocularisxphysiology 2aEndemic Diseasesxveterinary 2aFoxesxparasitology 2aRodentiaxparasitology 3aFrance 0aFrancexepidemiology. 0aEchinococcus multilocularis 0aMuskrat 0aNutria 0aIntermediate host 0aBioindicator 0aFrance1 aRichomme, Céline1 aBoucher, Jean-Marc1 aGuedon, Gérald1 aBoué, Franck0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Oct. 18, v. 197, no. 1-2 p.283-287dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012000177300001600297520123100313592002801544653001201572653002301584653002601607653001801633653003001651653001701681653001501698653002801713653002901741653002201770653003301792653002001825700001901845700002601864700002101890773011801911856008602029852000902115655001202124IND60602593220221119232503.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060259322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2015.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdous, Mohammad Ali10aInvestigation of entropy generation in a helically coiled tube in flow boiling condition under a constant heat flux  ap. 217-233.  aThere are many methods to augment the heat transfer rate in flow boiling in industrial applications. The helically coiled tubes are one of the best geometries to enhance the heat transfer rate. The entropy generation analysis is an appropriate tool to evaluate the contribution of heat transfer and pressure drop mechanisms. In the present paper, the entropy generation in the helically coiled tube under flow boiling is studied. The optimum tube and coil diameters under specified conditions are found. The effect of different flow conditions such as mass velocity, inlet vapor quality, saturation temperature, and heat flux on contributions of pressure drop and heat transfer in entropy generation is discussed. The Bejan number (Be) and irreversibility distribution ratio (IDR) at different saturation temperatures versus mass velocity are plotted. The comparison between entropy generation and contributions of pressure drop and heat transfer for the helically coiled tube and the straight one is presented. The entropy generation number (Ns) for different flow conditions is plotted. The entropy generation analysis shows that there is a favorable region to use the helically coiled tube with respect to the straight one.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBoiling 0aEntropy generation 0aHelically coiled tube 0aPressure drop 0aHeat transfer coefficient 0aBejan number 0aEbullition 0aProduction d’entropie 0aTube enroulé en hélice 0aChute de pression 0aTaux de transfert de chaleur 0aNombre de Bejan1 aSaffari, Hamid1 aAvval, Hasan Barzegar1 aKhoshzat, Mohsen0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Dec., v. 60 p.217-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2015.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010800154300002000262520141400282592002801696650001301724650001801737650001201755650002501767700001501792700002001807700001601827700002001843700001801863700001701881700001401898700003101912773012501943856007502068852000902143655001202152IND60789352020221119125440.0220820e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078935202DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01869a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yang10aStretched three-dimensional white graphene with a tremendous lattice thermal conductivity increase rate  ap. 22581-22589.  aDespite the increasing interest in the physical properties of the newly synthesized three-dimensional (3D) nano-architectured graphene, there are still few studies on the thermal transport properties of this family of materials. In the present work, heat transport of 3D h-BN and its mechanical response are systematically explored through first principles calculations. It is fascinating to find that the thermal conductivity of the 3D h-BN honeycomb structure could be significantly modulated by mechanical tension. Its lattice thermal conductivity perpendicular to the hole axis increases by 7.2 times at 6% critical strain, compared to only 0.67 times for that of the strained 3D graphene counterpart. The structure's thermal conductivity versus mechanical tension differs quantitatively and qualitatively from the monotonic downward trend of traditional bulk diamond or silicon under tension. This deviation from the classic behavior could be attributed to the modification of the phonon lifetimes, together with the competition between group velocities of low- and high-lying phonons under strain. Finally, the phonon vibrational modes contribution analysis indicates that the BN ribbon atoms contribute mainly at a lower frequency range. Our results provide important insights into potential employment of nano-architectured 3D white graphene for thermal management in relevant industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3aheat transfer 3asilicon 3athermal conductivity1 aLiang, Yue1 aLiu, Xiaochuang1 aJia, Shijie1 aZhao, Chaoxiang1 aYang, Longbin1 aDing, Jiabao1 aHong, Guo1 aTermentzidis, Konstantinos0 tRSC advances.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 12, no. 35 p.22581-22589dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra01869a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245011300165300001800278500000900296520159600305592002801901650002501929650001101954650001401965650000901979650002901988650002302017651001202040651001202052700002602064700002502090700002402115773019402139856007702333852000902410655001202419IND60666463820221121014601.0191028e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066646382DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.04422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHrachowitz, Markus10aSoil Redistribution Model for Undisturbed and Cultivated Sites Based on Chernobyl-Derived Cesium-137 Fallout  ap. 1302-1310.  aepub  aMeasurements of ¹³⁷Cs fallout have been used in combination with a range of conversion models for the investigation of soil relocation mechanisms and sediment budgets in many countries for more than 20 yr.

The main idea of the new model is the combination of a modified exponential model describing uncultivated soil with a Chapman distribution based model describing cultivated soil. The compound model subsequently allows a dynamic description of the Chernobyl derived ¹³⁷Cs situation in the soil and its change, specifically migration and soil transport processes over the course of time. Using the suggested model at the sampling site in Pettenbach, in the Austrian province of Oberösterreich ¹³⁷Cs depth distributions were simulated with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 compared with the measured ¹³⁷Cs depth profile. The simulated rates of soil distribution at different positions at the sampling site were found to be between 27 and 60 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ It was shown that the model can be used to describe the temporal changes of ¹³⁷Cs depth distributions in cultivated as well as uncultivated soils. Additionally, the model allows to quantify soil redistribution in good correspondence with already existing models.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium radioisotopes 3amodels 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil transport processes 3atemporal variation 3aAustria 3aUkraine1 aMaringer, Franz-Josef1 aSteineder, Christian1 aGerzabek, Martin H.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.1302-1310dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.04423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245018500157300001600342500001400358520130600372592002801678650001201706650001001718650000901728650001801737650002001755650001601775650002301791650001001814650001101824650001001835650001701845653001301862653002601875653002401901653004801925700001601973773010901989856007302098852000902171655001202180IND60726864820221118043940.0210209e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072686482DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew2902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustafa, A.F.10aEvaluation of dried vegetables residues for poultry: II. Effects of feeding cabbage leaf residues on broiler performance, ileal digestibility and total tract nutrient digestibility  ap. 681-686.  aNAL-light  aA study was conducted to investigate the effects of partial replacing corn and soybean meal with dried cabbage leaf residues (DCR) on broiler growth performance, apparent ileal nutrient digestibility, and apparent total tract nutrient utilization. Dietary treatments include 4 levels of DCR (0, 3, 6, and 9%). Two hundred and twenty-four day-old male broilers were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (8 cage replicates; 7 birds/cage) and grown over a 35-d experimental period. Results showed that feeding DCR had no effects on daily body weigh gain (average 53.4 g/d), daily feed intake (average 94.9 g/d), and feed conversion ratio (average 1.78 g of feed/g of gain). Inclusion of DCR reduced apparent ileal DM (quadratic effect, P < 0.001), OM (linear effect, P = 0.012), and CP (quadratic effect, P = 0.001) digestibility of younger birds (d 21) while incremental levels of DCR had no effect on apparent ileal nutrient digestibilities of older birds (d 35). Apparent total tract digestibility of DM, OM, and CP increased (linear effect, P < 0.001) as the level of DCR increased. It was concluded that the inclusion of DCR in broiler diets up to 9% had no negative impact on bird performance and apparent ileal digestibility of older birds and improved apparent total tract nutrient digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3acabbage 3acages 3acorn 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3aleaves 3amales 3asoybean meal 0abroilers 0acabbage leaf residues 0aileal digestibility 0aapparent total tract nutrient digestibility1 aBaurhoo, B.0 tPoultry science.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 96, no. 3 p.681-686dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew2903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010100167300001400268520124500282592002801527650001501555650001601570650001101586650001801597650001001615650001401625650001601639650001301655650001201668650001501680650001201695650001201707650001301719650001401732650003001746650001501776650002001791650001401811653001701825653002801842653001401870653000901884653001101893653001401904700001901918700006201937700002501999700001702024700002102041700002002062773012202082856008302204852000902287655001202296IND60543180820221119052038.0190410e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054318082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSajwan, Suresh10aTargeted mutagenesis and functional analysis of adipokinetic hormone-encoding gene in Drosophila  ap. 79-86.  aAdipokinetic hormones (Akhs) are small peptides (8–10 amino acid [aa] residues long) found in insects that regulate metabolic responses to stress by stimulating catabolic reactions and mobilizing energy stores. We employed Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) mutagenesis and isolated an Akh1 mutant carrying a small deletion in the gene that resulted in a truncated peptide; the second aa (Leu) was missing from the functional octapeptide. This null Dmel/Akh mutant is suitable to study Akh function without any effect on the C-terminal associated peptide encoded by the same gene. The mutant flies were fully viable and compared to the control flies, had significantly low levels of hemolymph saccharides including trehalose and were resistant to starvation. These characteristics are similar to those obtained from the flies carrying targeted ablation of Akh-expressing neurons (reported earlier). We also found that the Akh1 mutants are slightly heavy and had a slow metabolic rate. Furthermore, we showed that the ectopic expression of Dmel∖Akh reverses the Akh1 phenotype and restores the wild-type characteristics. Our results confirmed that Akh is an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aamino acids 3aenergy 3agene deletion 3agenes 3ahemolymph 3ahomeostasis 3ahormones 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3amutants 3aneurons 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3astarvation 3astress response 3atrehalose 0aNeuropeptide 0aCarbohydrate metabolism 0aDrome-Akh 0aNHEJ 0aStress 0aTrehalose1 aSidorov, Roman1 aStašková, Tereza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2798-61671 aŽaloudíková, Anna1 aTakasu, Yoko1 aKodrík, Dalibor1 aZurovec, Michal0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 June, v. 61 p.79-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01771naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006900150245012800219300001600347520067600363592002801039650001501067650001601082650001301098650001101111650004401122700002001166700001901186773017101205856008401376852000901460655001201469IND60604309520180911000000.0180716e20180126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060430952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b009262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro-Vázquez, Armando1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4364-516X10aComputer-Assisted 3D Structure Elucidation (CASE-3D) of Natural Products Combining Isotropic and Anisotropic NMR Parameters  ap. 203-210.  aA computer-assisted structural elucidation (CASE-3D) strategy based on the use of isotropic and/or anisotropic NMR data is proposed to elucidate relative configuration and preferred conformation in complex natural products.

This detached ripening of climacteric fruit is a unique feature that is widely exploited by the postharvest industry. Non-climacteric strawberry on the other hand, ripens without the autocatalytic ethylene response. Surprisingly, we found that strawberry was capable of ripening after detachment at the green stage. This apparent ripening process was studied by comparing ethylene production and multiple fruit quality traits between strawberries that ripened on the vine versus detached. Our findings show that ethylene production is hardly influenced by the dissimilar ripening conditions, yet fruit quality is heavily affected. Importantly, detached strawberries did not reach the same fruit mass, lowering the market value of the detached ripened fruit. Furthermore, sugar and acid analysis showed that detached strawberries have a low malic acid, glucose, fructose and sucrose content compared to fruit ripened on the vine, indicating that a continuous supply of photosynthesis assimilates, water and nutrients by the plant is essential for normal fruit ripening. The unique aroma of strawberries was also heavily altered in detached ripened fruit. Detached strawberries had a lower abundance of most volatile compounds, except for alcohols, resulting in less intense aroma and unwanted off-flavors. It can be concluded that detached ripened strawberries are of inferior quality compared to normal vine-ripened strawberries and are unsuitable for marketing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afood industry 3afructose 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aglucose 3amalic acid 3amarket value 3amarketing 3anutrients 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3aphotosynthesis 3aripening 3astrawberries 3asucrose 3avines 3avolatile compounds 0aStrawberry 0aDetached ripening 0aEthylene 0aAroma 0aFruit quality1 aVandendriessche, Thomas1 aHertog, Maarten L.A.T.M.1 aNicolai, Bart M.1 aGeeraerd, Annemie0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2014 Sept., v. 95 p.70-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010000157300001600257500001400273520200200287592002802289650002502317650001902342650002002361650002602381650002302407650001302430650001802443650002202461650001102483650003102494650001902525650002502544650001702569651001102586653001202597653000902609653002902618700001402647700001702661700001302678773010902691856007302800852000902873655001202882IND60726865020221118043901.0210209e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072686502DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew3432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWieczorek, K.10aDistribution of Campylobacter jejuni multilocus sequence types isolated from chickens in Poland  ap. 703-709.  aNAL-light  aPoultry is recognized as the most important source of food-related transmission of Campylobacter jejuni to humans and campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported zoonotic bacterial disease in the European Union. It has been documented that C. jejuni is genetically diverse and analyses of bacterial isolates usually show a large strain variety. Therefore, molecular typing of strains represents an important tool to study the genetic diversity of isolates and to trace individual strains that cause human infections. The aim of the study was characterization of genetic population structure and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of C. jejuni isolated from Polish chickens. C. jejuni from chicken ceca and the corresponding carcasses (72 and 61 strains, respectively), originating from 128 flocks in Poland during February 2011 and May 2013, were used in the study. The isolates were tested for their population structure and genetic diversity using a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme with connection to their antimicrobial resistance. The molecular analysis of 133 C. jejuni generated 39 different sequence types (ST); 3 of them were defined for the first time. Additionally, 16 STs were represented by single isolates. The most common STs observed were 6411 (16.5% isolates) and 257 (15.0% strains). The first mentioned ST was resistant to 3 different classes of antibiotics, i.e., quinolones, tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides. Overall, 125 (94.4%) of C. jejuni isolates demonstrated antimicrobial resistance and the most frequent AMR profile observed was ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline (47.4% strains). Likewise, the clonal complexes CC 257 and CC 353 were defined as the predominant molecular groups covering altogether 37 C. jejuni strains. No associations between CCs and the origin of the samples as well as the place of isolation were found. This study highlights that the C. jejuni population from chickens in Poland was diverse and showed a weak clonal structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aEuropean Union 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3acampylobacteriosis 3achickens 3aciprofloxacin 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amultilocus sequence typing 3analidixic acid 3apopulation structure 3atetracycline 3aPoland 0apoultry 0aMLST 0aantimicrobial resistance1 aDenis, E.1 aLachtara, B.1 aOsek, J.0 tPoultry science.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 96, no. 3 p.703-709dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew3433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010100156300002000257520166500277592002801942650002101970650001901991650001302010650002802023650002202051650002102073650002202094650001302116650002102129650002102150650002502171650001702196650001202213700001102225700001402236700001502250773012502265856007502390852000902465655001202474IND60789352420221119123628.0220820e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078935242DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02038f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, L. F.12aA short review of graphene in the microbial electrosynthesis of biochemicals from carbon dioxide  ap. 22770-22782.  aMicrobial electrosynthesis (MES) is a potential energy transformation technology for the reduction of the greenhouse gas carbon oxide (CO₂) into commercial chemicals. The major bottlenecks in the development of highly productive MES systems are the low bacterial loading, low electron transfer rate and low production of relevant chemicals, which limit the future potential for scaling up this process. Graphene has excellent electrical conductivity, remarkably high carrier mobility, special intrinsic mechanical strength, chemical stability, outstanding specific surface area, and biocompatibility. Therefore, in this regard, graphene can overcome these challenges and provide new opportunities. Graphene is suited for use as a cathode for increasing the bacterial loading and boosting the performance of MES. Over the last decade, graphene has been extensively developed and explored in MES. Graphene incorporation in cathodes can augment the surface area, reduce the resistance, and increase the electron transfer rate; thus, high current density, high coulombic efficiency, and high chemical production can be achieved. To better understand and further explore the modification of graphene-based materials as cathodes in MES systems, it is quite necessary to review and summarize recent developments in this field. Therefore, in this report, we briefly survey and discuss the up-to-date research activities regarding graphene in cathode modification and fabrication, with particular emphasis on their fabrication strategies and characterization, highlighting their key roles in MES systems, as well as presenting the challenges and the future prospects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acarbon dioxide 3acathodes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrosynthesis 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3agreenhouse gases 3apotential energy 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface area 3asurveys1 aYu, H.1 aZhang, J.1 aQin, H.

Herein, a detailed morphological redescription of Garra makiensis from the Awash River drainage is presented, together with additional data on the type specimens of G. makiensis and G. rothschildi. Mitochondrial CO1 sequence data are also provided, including the historic paralectotype of G. makiensis, with a comparison to Garra species from Africa and the Middle East. Based on these sequences, G. makiensis clusters outside the group of African congeners and is a sister lineage to species from the south-east of the Arabian Peninsula. Although morphologically variable, G. makiensis is characterised by having a single unbranched pectoral-fin ray, a short distance between vent and anal-fin origin (7.3–19.7 % of pelvic – anal distance), chest and belly covered with scales, and a prominent axillary scale at base of pelvic fin (18.8–35.5 % of pelvic-fin length).  aLARIMA – Sustainable High LAnd Rivers MAnagement in Ethiopia – project (Project Number 106) funded by the Austrian Partnership Programme in Higher Education and Research for Development (APPEAR) of the Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC) and the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD).

Aqueous and nonaqueous extraction schemes were studied. The trichloroacetic acid/KOH two-step extraction and the 0.5 M NaOH extraction were effective in recovering P from sludges. It was found that the P distribution pattern is sludges was affected by the sludge digestion processes. Almost all of the P in anaerobically digested sludges was inorganic. In the waste-activated sludge and aerobically digested sludges, more than 50% of the total P was present as P-monoesters and P-diesters. Several experiments were conducted to confirm P-diester peak assignment. Incubation of the sludge with ribonuclease caused a decrease of the peak in the P-diester region, indicating that at least a part of the P-diesters is in the form of RNA. Results of a dialysis experiment appeared to indicate that P-diesters were broken down from the molecular weight >1000 material to their lower molecular weight components during sludge digestion. The peaks appearing in the ³¹P NMR spectra of sludge-borne phospholipids were tentatively assigned to phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol or diphosphatidylglycerol.

A novel optimization model is developed based on the available work loss minimization for the recuperative heat exchanger. The experiments are conducted based on four factors: L, Dt, S, Ds, one level: Nd, and the results are analyzed according to the principle of Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The final predicted optimum combination of geometrical parameters for the heat exchanger is: L = 430.5 mm, Dt = 0.45 mm, S = 5.41, Ds = 4.3 mm. The optimization results are in good agreement with our model, and the deviations of predicted values are less than 1.32%. The model and results presented here for the optimization of the heat exchanger can provide helpful guidance and a new way for the optimization of J–T cryocooler.  aPublisher supplied data 0aJoule–Thomson cryocooler 0aHeat exchanger 0aAvailable work loss 0aRSM 0aThermodynamic optimization 0aCryo refroidisseur de Joule-Thomson 0aEchangeur de chaleur1 aLiu, Liu1 aLiang, Lili1 aLiu, Xin1 aLi, Jiapeng0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Dec., v. 60 p.155-165dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2015.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010000169300001400269520153100283592002801814650001301842650001501855650002301870650001401893650002001907650001001927650001101937650001101948650001501959650001401974650001501988650002102003650003102024650002002055650000902075650002002084650001302104650001502117653001402132653001302146653001102159653001502170653001302185653001902198700002202217700002202239700002302261700002002284773010902304856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60541963220221117160448.0190401e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054196322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2015.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroekaert, Nathan10aModified Fusarium mycotoxins unmasked: From occurrence in cereals to animal and human excretion  ap. 17-31.  aModified mycotoxins formed by plants, fungi and during some food processing steps may remain undetected by analytical methods, potentially causing underestimation of mycotoxin exposure and risk. Furthermore, due to altered physico-chemical characteristics of modified mycotoxins, these compounds might have different gastro-intestinal absorption compared to the unmodified forms, leading to altered modified mycotoxin plasma concentrations. Additionally, modified mycotoxins can be converted back into their corresponding unmodified forms by in vivo hydrolysis upon oral ingestion. This review aims to describe the current knowledge on the production, occurrence, toxicity and toxicokinetic properties of the modified Fusarium mycotoxins. The need for more occurrence data to correctly assess the risks associated with these modified mycotoxins is clearly indicated, including differences between commodities as well as geographical and climatological influences. Research on toxicity of these modified forms demonstrates the possibility of significant decreases as well as increases in the toxic effects of these compounds compared with those of the unmodified forms. Their toxicokinetics demonstrates that a decreased (increased) polarity of modified mycotoxins might cause enhanced (decreased) oral absorption. The possibility of in vivo hydrolysis, altered toxicity and their wide-spread occurrence makes modified mycotoxins a complex threat for which a risk assessment will require prospective multi-disciplinary efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aabsorption 3aanalytical methods 3aexcretion 3afood processing 3afungi 3agrains 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aingestion 3amycotoxins 3apharmacokinetics 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplants (botany) 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aMycotoxin 0aModified 0aMasked 0aOccurrence 0aToxicity 0aToxicokinetics1 aDevreese, Mathias1 aDe Baere, Siegrid1 aDe Backer, Patrick1 aCroubels, Siska0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2015 June, v. 80 p.17-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2015.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245023200177300001600409520182200425592002802247650002002275650002802295650002402323650002902347650001302376650001202389650002802401650001902429650002002448650001302468650001402481650001902495650002302514650001502537650001802552650001202570650001602582650001902598650001502617653003102632653003102663653001802694700002102712700003402733700002202767700002102789700002002810700001902830773010902849856008702958852000903045655001203054IND60615732520221120032058.0210118e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Qadiri, Hamzah M.10aBactericidal activity of neutral electrolyzed water against Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens in cell suspensions and artificially inoculated onto the surface of selected fresh produce and polypropylene cutting boards  ap. 212-218.  aBactericidal activity of neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) was investigated against endospore forming Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens in cell suspensions and artificially inoculated onto the surface of selected fresh produce items (cherry tomato, miniature cucumber, carrot and parsley) and polypropylene cutting boards at ambient temperature (22 °C). Viable counts of survivors were determined within 0 (untreated control), 1, 3 and 5 min of treatment at ambient temperature using NEW solutions of 60 and 120 mg/L free available chlorine FAC. All treatments showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in bacterial reductions with regard to contact time and concentration used and which maximized after 5 min of treatment at 120 mg/L FAC. For cell suspensions, the extent of reduction (log₁₀ CFU/mL) after 5 min of treatment ranged from 2.11 to 3.03 for B. cereus and 2.46–3.62 for C. perfringens at 60 and 120 mg/L FAC, respectively. However, when the bacteria inoculated onto the produce items and cutting boards showed greater resistance to NEW treatments compared to cell suspensions. Sterile deionized water did not contribute any significant reduction (P > 0.05) after 5 min of treatment, whereas bacterial viability of the inoculated produce was reduced by 2.11–2.30 and 2.41–3.16 log₁₀ CFU/g when NEW used at 120 mg/L FAC for B. cereus and C. perfringens, respectively. When inoculated cutting boards were sprayed with NEW at 120 mg/L FAC and after 5 min of treatment, cell viability was reduced by 2.33 and 3.06 log₁₀ per 100 cm² for B. cereus and C. perfringens, respectively. This study showed that NEW could be used as an effective bactericidal treatment alternative to commonly used chemical sanitizers against endospore forming bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aClostridium perfringens 3aambient temperature 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acarrots 3acell suspension culture 3acell viability 3acherry tomatoes 3achlorine 3acucumbers 3acutting boards 3aelectrolyzed water 3aendospores 3afresh produce 3aparsley 3aplate count 3apolypropylenes 3asanitizers 0aNeutral electrolyzed water 0aEndospore forming bacteria 0aFresh produce1 aSmith, Stephanie1 aSielaff, Aleksandra Checinska1 aGovindan, Byju N.1 aZiyaina, Mohamed1 aAl-Alami, Nivin1 aRasco, Barbara0 tFood control.g2019 Feb., v. 96 p.212-218dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009300174300001600267500001500283520054600298592002800844650001900872650001200891650002200903650001700925650001700942650001900959650002300978650002401001650001801025650001201043650001001055651001101065651002001076651002801096651001101124653001401135653001001149700002501159700002201184700002401206700002601230773013701256856008901393852000901482655001201491IND60562731720221119040343.0170208e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056273172DNAL7 a10.3161/00016454AO2016.51.2.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Pedro10aGenetic Diversity of the Azores Blackbirds Turdus merula Reveals Multiple Founder Events  ap. 221-234.  a2019-12-06  aWe assessed the genetic diversity and phylogeography of the Azores Blackbird Turdus merula, based on sequences of two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome b and NADH Dehydrogenase subunit 2) and one nuclear gene (Aconitase 1 — intron 9) from 45 individuals and an outgroup of 15 birds from Madeira, continental west Europe and north Africa.

Samar Bahisht Chaunsa). Fruit were treated with various PUT concentrations (0.0, 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0mM) and were allowed to ripen at 32±2°C for 7 days, or stored at 11±1°C for up to 28 days. Respiration rate and ethylene production were measured daily during ripening and cold storage. Cell wall degrading enzymes such as exo-polygalacturonase (exo-PG), endo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG), pectin esterase (PE), endo-1,4-β-d-glucanase (EGase), antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), and catalase (CAT), fruit firmness as well as biochemical fruit quality characteristics were estimated during ripening and cold storage at 2 and 7 day intervals, respectively. PUT treatments reduced respiration rate, ethylene production and maintained higher fruit firmness during ripening as well as cold storage. PUT-treated fruit exhibited significantly suppressed activities of cell wall enzymes (exo-, endo-PG and EGase), but retained higher PE activity during ripening and cold storage. Total phenolic and antioxidant contents were significantly higher in PUT-treated fruit during ripening as well in the cold storage period than in the controls. Activities of antioxidative enzymes (CAT, POX and SOD) were also significantly higher in PUT-treated fruit during ripening as well as cold storage. SSC and SSC:TA were lower in PUT-treated fruit, while TA and ascorbic acid content showed the reverse trend. In conclusion, pre-storage 2.0mM PUT treatment inhibited ethylene production and suppressed the activities of cell wall enzymes, while resulting in higher activities of antioxidative enzymes and maintaining better fruit quality during ripening and cold storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acell walls 3acold storage 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene production 3afruit quality 3amangoes 3apectinesterase 3aperoxidase 3apolygalacturonase 3aputrescine 3arespiratory rate 3aripening 3astorage time 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aExo-polygalacturonase 0aEndo-polygalacturonase 0aMango 0aPeroxidase 0aPutrescine 0aRipening 0aSuperoxide dismutase1 aKhan, Ahmad Sattar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6230-99921 aMalik, Aman Ullah1 aShāhid, Muḥammad,1 aUllah, Sami0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2014 Oct., v. 96 p.23-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014100168300001400309520188700323592002802210650002502238650003702263650002802300650000902328650002002337650003102357650001002388650001502398650002002413650001402433650001702447650001102464650002302475650002602498650001102524650001902535650004302554650005202597650002302649650001302672650002902685650001902714653002502733653002002758653002302778653001502801653000702816653000602823653000702829653000802836653000802844653001002852653001302862700002102875700005602896700002102952773012202973856008303095852000903178655001203187IND60543181320221119052115.0190410e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054318132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuwar, Suyog S.10aAdaptive regulation of digestive serine proteases in the larval midgut of Helicoverpa armigera in response to a plant protease inhibitor  ap. 18-29.  aProtease inhibitors (PIs) are direct defenses induced by plants in response to herbivory. PIs reduce herbivore digestive efficiency by inhibiting insects' digestive proteases; in turn insects can adapt to PIs by generally increasing protease levels and/or by inducing the expression of PI-insensitive proteases. Helicoverpa armigera, a highly polyphagous lepidopteran insect pest, is known for its ability to adapt to PIs. To advance our molecular and functional understanding of the regulation of digestive proteases, we performed a comprehensive gene expression experiment of H. armigera exposed to soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (SKTI) using a custom-designed microarray. We observed poor larval growth on the SKTI diet until 24 h, however after 48 h larvae attained comparable weight to that of control diet. Although initially the expression of several trypsins and chymotrypsins increased, eventually the expression of some trypsins decreased, while the number of chymotrypsins and their expression increased in response to SKTI. Some of the diverged serine proteases were also differentially expressed. The expression of serine proteases observed using microarrays were further validated by qRT-PCR at different time points (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h) after the start of SKTI ingestion. There were also large changes in transcriptional patterns over time in the control diet. Carbohydrate metabolism and immune defense genes were affected in response to SKTI ingestion. Enzyme assays revealed reduced trypsin-specific activity and increased chymotrypsin-specific activity in response to SKTI. The differential regulation of trypsins and chymotrypsins at the transcript and protein levels accompanying a rebound in growth rate indicates that induction of SKTI-insensitive proteases is an effective strategy of H. armigera in coping with this protease inhibitor in its diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aKunitz-type proteinase inhibitor 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3adiet 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aherbivores 3aimmune response 3aingestion 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amicroarray technology 3amidgut 3aplant response 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserine proteinases 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics) 3aweight control 0aHelicoverpa armigera 0aSerine protease 0aProtease inhibitor 0aMicroarray 0aPI 0aT 0aCT 0aDSP 0aAZU 0aBApNA 0aSAAPFpNA1 aPauchet, Yannick1 aVogel, Heiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9821-77311 aHeckel, David G.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Apr., v. 59 p.18-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2015.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245015500180300001200335500001400347520153700361592002801898650001901926650001301945650001001958650002501968650000901993650000902002650001802011650001202029650001102041650001602052650001002068650002402078650001502102650001402117651001702131651001102148651001402159651001302173653001102186653001702197653002102214700003702235700002602272700003102298700002602329700002702355773009302382856008302475852000902558655001202567IND60717510820221118191818.0210125e20201103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071751082DNAL7 a10.3897/zoologia.37.e530922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Chaves, Héctor E.14aThe chiggerflea Hectopsylla pulex (Siphonaptera: Tungidae): infestation on Molossus molossus (Chiroptera: Molossidae) in the Central Andes of Colombia  ap. 1-5.  aNAL-light  aSome species of mastiff bats, Molossus Geoffroy, 1805, inhabit human shelters such as houses and barns. Among them, the Pallas’s mastiff bat, Molossus molossus Pallas, 1766, is the most common species in South America. There are a few studies on this bat in Colombia, mostly on colony size, diet, ectoparasite records, and activity patterns in the Andean and Caribbean regions. Here, we provide information on the prevalence of chiggerfleas, Hectopsylla pulex (Haller, 1880), on M. molossus, along with molecular data on the flea, and its distribution in Colombia. In addition, we describe the size and sex ratio of the infested bat colony, located in the central Andes of Colombia. The bat colony was represented by ca. 45 individuals, of which 33 were captured. The colony had more females (25 individuals) than males (8 individuals). A total of four Pallas’s mastiff bats had chiggerfleas, H. pulex, most of which were attached to the bat’s faces and ears. The composition of the colony (sex ratio) and the observed activity times match those reported for other colonies of the species in Colombia. The cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, and the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene obtained from H. pulex represent the second and first available sequences for the species, respectively. The level of infestation of individuals in the colony was low, similar to that observed in other South American countries, such as Brazil. Finally, the new locality is the seventh confirmed and the highest elevational record of H. pulex in Colombia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHectopsyllidae 3aMolossus 3abarns 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adiet 3aears 3aectoparasites 3afemales 3ahumans 3ainformation 3amales 3amitochondrial genes 3aprevalence 3asex ratio 3aAndes region 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 3aColombia 0aColony 0adistribution 0aurban ecosystems1 aTamayo-Zuluaga, Andrés Fernando1 aHenao-Osorio, Jose J.1 aCardona-Giraldo, Alexandra1 aOssa-López, Paula A.1 aRivera-Páez, Fredy A.0 tZoologia.g2020 Nov. 03, v. 37 p.1-5dPensoft PublisherswJournal:27352x1984-46897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zoologia.37.e530923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014000157300002000297520130900317592002801626650002301654650001601677650002001693650001701713650001701730650001701747650003901764650002101803650001801824650002501842700001801867700002301885700002001908773012501928856007502053852000902128655001202137IND60789352720221119123302.0220820e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078935272DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02239g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDagher, Diaa10aUtility of a novel turn-off fluorescence probe for the determination of tranilast, an adjunctive drug for patients with severe COVID-19  ap. 22044-22053.  aTranilast (TR) could be investigated as a suitable anti-inflammatory and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor medication for the treatment of COVID-19 acute patients. Owing to its importance, our study was constructed for the determination of TR using a new, fast, sensitive, and reliable green spectrofluorimetric method. TR was quantified in this study by forming a complex with the acriflavine (AC) reagent. The reaction between TR and AC quenched the fluorescence of AC through the formation of an ion-association complex and the response was measured at 493 nm after excitation at 263 nm. It was observed that the quenching of the fluorescence of AC was linear (r = 0.9998) with the concentration of TR in the range of 1.0–15.0 μg mL⁻¹. The limit of detection was 0.224 μg mL⁻¹, and the limit of quantification was 0.679 μg mL⁻¹. The fluorescence quenching mechanism was carefully studied and was confirmed to be able to analyze TR in its pure form and its prepared pharmaceutical dosage form. To validate the method, the international conference of harmonization (ICH) Q₂R₁ guidelines were followed. The statistical assessment of the proposed and comparison methods revealed no significant differences between them. Moreover, the green criteria of the method were evaluated and confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aacriflavine 3adetection limit 3adosage forms 3adrug therapy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3ainflammasomes 3astatistical analysis1 aElmansi, Heba1 aNasr, Jenny Jeehan1 aEl-Enany, Nahed0 tRSC advances.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 12, no. 34 p.22044-22053dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02239g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245020800210520151500418592002801933650002201961650002101983650001702004650001802021650001002039650001902049650001402068650002302082650001302105650002002118650001902138650001302157650002102170650002202191653001602213653001802229653002402247653002602271700005602297700005502353700002402408700002602432700001802458773009502476856008302571852000902654655001202663IND60752586220221123014021.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075258622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonsiriwit, Athip1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0825-435010aHydroxypropyl methylcellulose/microcrystalline cellulose biocomposite film incorporated with butterfly pea anthocyanin as a sustainable pH-responsive indicator for intelligent food-packaging applications  aIn this study, an environment-friendly pH-responsive indicator was prepared from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/microcrystalline cellulose biocomposites (HMB) and butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) anthocyanin (BA).

Therefore, 15 mg was selected as the optimum concentration of BA for indicator fabrication. The 1.5BA-HMB indicator was used to monitor the freshness of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) by attaching it to inside of the package exposed to the headspace. The 1.5BA-HMB indicator clearly changed color with respect to variation in the quality of S. scombrus during storage at 4 °C. Based on the changes in the color of 1.5BA-HMB, the quality of S. scombrus was interpreted as follows: deep purple and light purple colors indicated that S. scombrus was fresh, violet color indicated that S. scombrus was suitable for eating, and blue, green ocean, and colonial blue colors indicated spoilage of S. scombrus. Thus, the 1.5BA-HMB indicator can be used as a sustainable pH-responsive indicator for intelligent food packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClitoria ternatea 3aScomber scombrus 3aanthocyanins 3abiocomposites 3acolor 3afood packaging 3afreshness 3aheadspace analysis 3amackerel 3amethylcellulose 3amicrostructure 3aspoilage 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aAnthocyanin 0aButterfly pea 0aFreshness indicator 0aIntelligent packaging1 aLee, Myungho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8842-43391 aKim, Minhwi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1448-41601 aInthamat, Patthrare1 aUbonrat Siripatrawan,1 aLee, Youn Suk0 tFood bioscience.g2021 Dec., v. 44 p.101392-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245010000162300001600262520071700278592002800995650001201023650001201035650002001047650001901067650001401086650001601100650001901116650001001135651001001145653001401155653001101169653001601180653002301196700001801219773016501237856008401402852000901486655001201495IND60679164820221119003052.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067916482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2019.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ning10aTwo new species of Panorpa (Mecoptera, Panorpidae) from the Hengduan Mountains in Yunnan, China  ap. 138-145.  aTwo new species of the genus Panorpa Linnaeus, 1758 are described from the Hengduan Mountains in Yunnan, China.

The changes of specific fatty acids in lipid profiles and its association with anti-obesity are not entirely clear. The purpose of this study was to determine the fatty acid metabolism of a novel structured lipid prepared from soybean oil and coconut oil in C57BL/6J mice. The lipid digestion rate of SLs was higher than physical blend (SOCO) and soybean oil on in vitro digestion model. The conversion of essential FAs (18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3), oxidation of saturated FAs in the liver, and the digestion and absorption of saturated FAs in the intestine increased with increasing SLs content. In addition, the mRNA expression of hepatic β-oxidation genes (PPARα and ACO), was higher in the SLs diet groups than in the HFD group, whereas the mRNA expression of lipogenesis genes (SREBP-1c, ACC-1, SCD-1 and FAS) showed the opposite trend. It is concluded that prepared structured lipids can use as one kind of functional oils to resist obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acoconut oil 3adiet 3adigestion 3aessential fatty acids 3afatty acid metabolism 3agene expression 3aintestines 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amodels 3amortality 3aobesity 3aoxidation 3asoybean oil 0aStructured lipids 0aEssential FAs 0aSaturated FAs 0aGenes 0aSLs 0aSO 0aCO 0aSOCO 0aTAG 0aMCTs 0aMUFA 0aUFAs 0aMCFAs 0aFFA1 aXu, Feiran1 aZhang, Na1 aWu, Ying1 aJu, Xingrong1 aWang, Lifeng0 tFood bioscience.g2021 Dec., v. 44 p.101396-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245015100174300001600325520180400341592002802145650002202173650001102195650002502206650001302231650002102244650002002265650001402285650001502299650001202314650001902326650001202345650001202357650001102369650002502380650001102405650001402416650001102430650001102441650002502452650004102477650001202518650000902530650002502539650002302564650001602587650002902603650001102632650002202643650002902665650002802694650001202722650002402734650001002758651001102768700001902779700001402798700001702812700001902829700002302848700002902871700002102900773013102921856004003052852000903092655001203101IND50071151020221118154055.0131205e20140130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007115102DNAL7 a237611322pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.62632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReilly, Kim10aPotential of cultivar and crop management to affect phytochemical content in winter‐grown sprouting broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica)  ap. 322-330.  aBACKGROUND: Variety and crop management strategies affect the content of bioactive compounds (phenolics, flavonoids and glucosinolates) in green broccoli (calabrese) types, which are cultivated during summer and autumn in temperate European climates. Sprouting broccoli types are morphologically distinct and are grown over the winter season and harvested until early spring. Thus they show considerable potential for development as an import substitution crop for growers and consumers during the ‘hungry gap’ of early spring. The present study investigated the effect of variety and management practices on phytochemical content in a range of sprouting broccoli varieties. RESULTS: Yields were significantly higher in white sprouting broccoli varieties. Levels of phenolics and flavonoids were in the range 81.64–297.65 and 16.95–104.80 mg 100 g⁻¹ fresh weight, respectively, depending on year and cultivar, and were highest in variety ‘TZ 5052’ in both years. In‐row spacing did not affect flavonoid content. Phenolic and flavonoid content generally increased with increasing floret maturity and levels were high in edible portions of the crop. Crop wastes (leaf and flower) contained 145.9–239.3 and 21.5–116.6 mg 100 g⁻¹ fresh weight total phenolics and flavonoids, respectively, depending on cultivar, tissue and year. Climatic factors had a significant effect on phenolic and flavonoid content. Levels of total and some individual glucosinolates were higher in sprouting broccoli than in the green broccoli variety ‘Ironman’. CONCLUSION: Levels of total phenolics, flavonoids and glucosinolates are higher in sprouting than green broccoli types. Sprouting broccoli represents an excellent source of dietary bioactive compounds. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aautumn 3abioactive properties 3abroccoli 3aclimatic factors 3acrop management 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3aflorets 3aglucosinolates 3agrowers 3aimports 3aleaves 3aspatial distribution 3aspring 3asprouting 3asummer 3awastes 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aBrassicaxchemistryxclassification. 2aClimate 2aDiet 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aGermination 2aGlucosinolatesxanalysis 2aHumans 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPhytochemicalsxanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aSeasons 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWater 0aEurope1 aValverde, Juan1 aFinn, Leo1 aRai, Dilip K1 aBrunton, Nigel1 aSorensen, Jens C.,1 aSørensen, H.q(Hilmer),1 aGaffney, Michael0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2014 Jan. 30, v. 94, no. 2 p.322-330dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.6263  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006000169300001600229520093800245592002801183653002801211653001501239653001201254653001301266653001401279653002101293653003501314653002501349653001301374653001501387653001401402653002401416700001701440700005601457700002601513773011801539856008601657852000901743655001201752IND60602594320221119232608.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060259432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2015.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Chasik10aRecent advances in vapor compression cycle technologies  ap. 118-134.  aThis paper comprehensively reviews the recent studies on advanced vapor compression cycle technologies.

Field experiments conducted in 1999 and 2000 at two locations in eastern Nebraska quantify the effects of N and increasing duration of weed interference on corn growth and development. A naturally occurring population of weeds was allowed to compete with the corn crop for increasing lengths of time and at three rates of N application (0, 60, and 120 kg N ha⁻⁻¹). Weed interference and withholding applied N increased the time to 50%% silking by an average of 3.9 and 2.9 d, respectively. Regardless of treatments, relative growth rates of corn leaf area and biomass were maximized between the V1 and V2 growth stages of corn and increased linearly with N rate but were affected to a lesser extent by weed presence. The improvement in early season corn growth with addition of N resulted in greater leaf area, biomass, and height, which improved the competitive ability of corn against weeds. Reductions in maximum corn leaf area and height due to weed interference usually began earlier and were more extensive at reduced rates of N. Partitioning of biomass to reproductive structures increased with N during reproductive stages, likely contributing to greater harvest indices at the end of the season. Results from this study indicate that the effects of N fertilization on early-season crop growth provided a competitive advantage for corn relative to weeds, thereby increasing the length of time that weeds could compete with a crop before removal was required, but further research is needed to identify mechanisms regarding improved crop tolerance to weeds.Nomenclature: Corn, Zea mays L. ‘‘DK589RR’’.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3adry matter partitioning 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3aharvest index 3aintegrated weed management 3aleaf area 3amanagement systems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aweeds 3aNebraska 0aCritical time of weed removal 0aduration of weed interference 0agrowth analysis 0agrowth curves 0alight competition 0aN competition 0aresource acquisition1 aKnezevic, Stevan Z.1 aLindquist, John L.1 aShapiro, Charles A.0 tWeed science.g2003 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.546-556dWeed Science Society of America]x0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2F0043-1745%282003%29051%5B0546%3AIONADO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015900169300001600328520116900344592002801513650003001541650001701571650001301588650002301601650004101624650001501665650002601680650001601706650001701722650004401739650001701783650001401800650002501814653002301839653005001862653001801912653001401930653001701944653001701961653000901978700002101987700002002008700002202028700006402050773009602114856008402210852000902294655001202303IND60563662620221119030621.0170713e20160108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056366262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcunha, Tanize10aAnionic metabolite profiling by capillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry using a noncovalent polymeric coating.

In this work, we present a strategy for anionic metabolite profiling by CE–MS using a cationic capillary coating. The polymer, abbreviated as PTH, is composed of a poly-(N,N,N’,N’-tetraethyldiethylenetriamine, N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide, TEDETAMA-co-HPMA (50:50) copolymer. A CE–MS method based on PTH-coating was optimized for the analysis of a group of 16 standard anionic metabolites. Separation was achieved within 12min, with high separation efficiency (up to 92,000 theoretical plates per meter), and good repeatability, namely, relative standard deviation values for migration times and peak areas were below 0.2 and 2.1%, respectively. The optimized method allowed the detection of 87 metabolites in orange juice and 142 metabolites in red wine, demonstrating the good possibilities of this strategy for metabolomic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acase studies 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorange juice 3ared wines 3astatistical analysis 0aAnionic metabolite 0aCapillary electrophoresis–mass spectrometry 0aFood analysis 0aFoodomics 0aMetabolomics 0aOrange juice 0aWine1 aSimó, Carolina,1 aIbáñez, Clara1 aGallardo, Alberto1 aCifuentes, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7464-02170 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Jan. 08, v. 1428 p.326-335dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007700171300001600248500001100264520139400275592002801669650002201697650002301719650001301742650002301755650001801778650001201796650001501808650001701823650001001840650001801850650001501868650001901883700001701902700002201919700001601941700002201957700002001979773011201999856008202111852000902193655001202202IND60648113620221118065341.0190626e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064811362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-019-00185-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Vikas Kumar10aCRISPR–Cas9 System for Genome Engineering of Photosynthetic Microalgae  ap. 541-561.  aReview  aTargeted genome editing using RNA-guided endonucleases is an emerging tool in algal biotechnology. Recently, CRISPR–Cas systems have been widely used to manipulate the genome of some freshwater and marine microalgae. Among two different classes, and six distinct types of CRISPR systems, Cas9-driven type II system has been widely used in most of the studies for targeted knock-in, knock-out and knock-down of desired genes in algae. CRISPR technology has been demonstrated in microalgae including diatoms to manifest the function of the particular gene (s) and developing industrial traits, such as improving lipid content and biomass productivity. Instead of these, there are a lot of gears to be defined about improving efficiency and specificity of targeted genome engineering of microalgae using CRISPR–Cas system. Optimization of tools and methods of CRISPR technology can undoubtedly transform the research toward the industrial-scale production of commodity chemicals, food and biofuels using photosynthetic cell factories. This review has been focused on the efforts made so far to targeted genome engineering of microalgae, identified scopes about the hurdles related to construction and delivery of CRISPR–Cas components, algae transformation toolbox, and outlined the future prospect toward developing the CRISPR platform for high-throughput genome-editing of microalgae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3aenzymes 3afreshwater 3agene editing 3agenes 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis1 aSoni, Niraja1 aPrasad, Venkatesh1 aSapre, Ajit1 aDasgupta, Santanu1 aBhadra, Bhaskar0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2019 Aug., v. 61, no. 8 p.541-561dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-019-00185-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012700166520209100293592002802384653001802412653000802430653000802438653001702446653002402463653002302487700001802510700002002528700005902548773010902607856008602716852000902802655001202811IND60677529620221119125607.0191227e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067752962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1090662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoor, Anam10aSynthetic auxins concentration and application time modulates seed yield and quality of carrot by altering the umbel order  aQuality seed is an essential prerequisite to achieve good yield of a crop. Carrot (Daucus carota) seed quality is affected due to uneven maturation of seeds produced in different umbel orders. Seed quality can be improved by altering the umbel order. Auxins play role in apical dominance and thus can be tested to suppress tertiary umbels in carrot seed crop. A study was conducted to explore the potential of synthetic auxins on alteration of umbel order in carrot seed crop. Significant differences were recorded among different concentrations (0, 100, 200 or 300 mg L−1) of plant growth regulators for growth, yield and seed quality. All growth related traits were improved when Indole acetic acid (IAA) was applied three times at 300 mg L−1. Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at 200 mg L−1 or IAA at 100 mg L−1 applied at three times, viz. planting of stecklings (PoS) + 15 days after PoS + 30 days after PoS significantly enhanced number of secondary umbels by suppressing the tertiary umbels. Seed yield and 1000-seed weight of primary, secondary and tertiary umbels was maximum for NAA or IAA at 100 mg L-1 applied three times. Seed quality attributes, viz., final germination, vigour index, enzymatic activity i.e. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase (POD), Catalase (CAT), total antioxidants and total phenolic contents from seeds of primary, secondary and tertiary umbels were increased when three applications of IAA or NAA were done at 200 mg L−1. Moreover, three times application of IAA or NAA at 200 mg L−1 not only minimized the conductivity of seed leachates and malondialdehyde contents from seeds of primary and secondary umbels but also in tertiary umbels seeds. It was concluded that three times foliar application of IAA or NAA at 100 or 200 mg L−1, till 30 days after planting of stecklings, can be effectively used to modify umbel order and hence to increase yield and seed quality. Therefore, seed companies and growers may apply IAA or NAA at 200 mg L−1 for obtaining higher yield of good quality carrot seed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDaucus carota 0aIAA 0aNAA 0aVigour index 0aElectrolyte leakage 0aEnzymatic activity1 aZiaf, Khurram1 aAmjad, Muhammad1 aAhmad, Iftikhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6427-21230 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 262 p.109066-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1090663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009500156300001800251500002000269520167000289592002801959650001001987650000901997650001202006650001802018650001002036650001102046650002102057650001402078650001502092650001402107650001802121650001702139650001402156650001702170650002902187651001902216700001902235773009802254856007102352852000902423655001202432IND60569978120221120025827.0170626e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056997812DNAL7 a10.1890/02-04222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, J. Iwan10aDoes the fish–invertebrate–periphyton cascade precipitate plant loss in shallow lakes?  ap. 2155-2167.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlternative equilibria dominated by either submerged plants or phytoplankton have been described for communities in shallow lakes. A nutrient‐mediated increase in periphyton (algae attached to plant surfaces) is often described as being responsible for the loss of plants from shallow lakes, yet this violates the stochastic assumptions of alternative equilibria. To determine if periphyton is capable of forcing a switch between these communities, the factors governing the success of aquatic plants were surveyed in 17 plant‐dominated shallow lakes in Norfolk (United Kingdom) that varied in nutrient concentration and fish biomass. In these lakes, plant biomass was negatively related to the density of periphyton. However, the density of periphyton on the plants was correlated with the density of grazing invertebrates, not nutrient concentration. In turn, the biomass of fish determined the density of invertebrates. This cascade from fish to periphyton via invertebrates appeared to be evident even though plant‐dominated lakes are heterogeneous and complex. Under conditions of plant dominance, periphyton appeared to have a stronger influence on plant growth than phytoplankton. Our data support a model where, within the range of nutrients where alternative equilibria are possible, fish are the prime determinants of community structure in shallow lakes, through a cascading effect of predation on grazing invertebrates influencing the biomass of periphyton and hence, plants. We suggest that the stochasticity required for alternative equilibria in shallow lake communities is often derived from the vagaries of fish colonization and reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3afish 3agrazing 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aperiphyton 3aphytomass 3aphytoplankton 3aplant growth 3apredation 3areproduction 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aUnited Kingdom1 aSayer, Carl D.0 tEcology.g2003 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.2155-2167dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-04223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245014100202520226300343592002802606650001202634650001902646650001002665650000902675650002802684650002402712650001702736650001002753650001102763650002002774650001002794650002502804650002002829650001002849650002402859651001302883700006202896700005802958773010303016856007703119852000903196655001203205IND60761846520221119121449.0220103e20211224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076184652DNAL7 a10.1155/2021/84396982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekuria, Solomon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6207-143510aCommunity Perception on Trypanosomosis, Parasitological, and Entomological Studies in Two Selected Districts of South Omo Zone, Ethiopia  aParticipatory investigation and trypanosomosis prevalence studied during April 2019 and March 2020 in two selected districts of South Omo, Ethiopia. The study site is located in the gridline of 04.90 to 5.60ᵒN and 35.80 to 36.90⁰ E. Twelve community groups are employed. A cross-sectional study design and 288 animals bled and examined a wet film prepared from the buffy coat. Sixty NGU traps baited with acetone and cow urine were deployed for 48 hrs to estimate the apparent density. Data generated from focus group discussion and trypanosomosis prevalence analyzed using an appropriate statistical package. Proportional piling showed that cattle, goats, and sheep were proportionally dominant with a high median score of 32(14–40), 26(12–33), and 21(5–23), respectively; trypanosomosis ranked first with a proportional median score of 24(13–26) followed by contagious bovine/caprine pleuropneumonia with a proportional median score of 23(19–26) among others. Community unanimously agreed that (W = 0.9) trypanosomosis affects their socioeconomic status and was able to describe clinical signs with significant (p < 0.05) agreement. Tsetse fly (Echut and Kusubo) is the main vector with the agreement of W = 0.9(p < 0.05). Perception on human trypanosomosis varies between Benna Tsemay and Gnagatom districts. Therefore, further study supported by laboratory like molecular test is very important to conclude the presence of human trypanosomosis in the suggested area. The overall prevalence of cattle trypanosomosis was 10.1%. The prevalence of trypanosomosis was significantly higher in poor body condition (OR = 2.1, P < 0.05) and in black coat color (OR = 13.5, P < 0.05) animals. T. congolense and T. vivax were circulating in the area. A total of 455 Glossina (385 G. pallidipes, 17 G. tachinoides, and 53 G. fuscipes) were trapped. The overall apparent density of Glossina was 3.79 Flies/Trap/Day. Three species of Glossina, namely G. pallidipes, G. tachinoides, and G. fuscipes, were distributed in the study areas. Therefore, the finding suggests that the problem is significant and the human trypanosomosis is doubtful.

To establish if these contrasting growth habits changed controls to WUEe, we tracked volumetric soil moisture (θ25cm), ET and transpiration (T), NEE and its constituent ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) fluxes, and community water use efficiency (WUEc = GEP : T) in annual-dominated and bunchgrass dominated plots in a southern Arizona, United States, savanna. Annual and bunchgrass plots had similar θ25cm, ET, and T, suggesting the similarity in ET was due to higher soil evaporation in annual plots. Seasonal NEE was delayed and lower in annual plots compared with that in bunchgrass plots, owing to higher Reco in annual plots. Transpiration, GEP, and Reco in both vegetation types increased following late-season rain, indicating similar late-season phenological constraint. WUEe was lower in annual plots, but with similar WUEc between plot types. These results suggest that differences in annual plant biomass allocation and plot-level leaf area distribution increased proportional soil evaporation and aboveground Reco contributions, reducing plot level WUEe, not lowering plant WUE typical of arid-land annuals. Lower plot-level WUEe suggests that any increase in annual plant dominance would increase interannual variation of productivity in savanna intercanopy spaces, which could enhance the negative effects of predicted higher temperatures, greater aridity, and larger and more widely spaced storms on arid-land watershed processes. 3aannuals 3aarid lands 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3adry environmental conditions 3adry matter partitioning 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3aleaf area 3aperennial grasses 3aphenology 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3arain 3asavannas 3asoil water 3astorms 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3awatersheds 3aArizona1 aScott, Russell L.1 aCavanaugh, Michelle L.1 aBarron-Gafford, Greg0 tEcohydrology.g2014 Aug., v. 7, no. 4 p.1208-1215wJournal:J000000066x1936-05847nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64724143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.14523Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2097.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011300165520159500278592002801873653001601901653002401917653001101941653002101952653001801973700001601991700001302007700001802020700001702038773010902055856008602164852000902250655001202259IND60677529920221119125602.0191227e20200227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067752992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1090692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Shida14aThe effect of Trichoderma biofertilizer on the quality of flowering Chinese cabbage and the soil environment  aIn the present study, four Trichoderma species were isolated and made into a biofertilizer. Following treatment with the biofertilizer for 30 days, the germination rate (↑22.5%), height (↑24.4%), fresh weight (↑41.7%), and yield (↑37.4%) of flowering Chinese cabbage increased markedly compared with those of the control. In addition, the contents of soluble sugar (2.044%), soluble protein (5.938 %), and chlorophyll (2.803 mg/g) were higher in flowering Chinese cabbage treated with the biofertilizer for 30 days, compared to the control (1.7.4%, 5.611% and 2.639 mg/g respectively); however, the content of nitric nitrogen, with toxicological consequences for human health, was lower (↓23.6%), indicating that Trichoderma could also improve the quality of flowering Chinese cabbage. After Evans blue and Nitro blue tetrazolium staining, the leaves of flowering Chinese cabbage treated with the biofertilizer showed a smaller blue area than in the control, suggesting that the biofertilizer enhanced the tolerance of flowering Chinese cabbage to environment stresses. Furthermore, the biofertilizer contributed to the increasing of soil enzyme activity at 30th days, including urease (↑25.1%), phosphatase (↑13.1%), and catalase (↑14.0%), providing more inorganic N and P to the soil and reducing the harm done to flowering Chinese cabbage by reactive oxygen species. Taken together, the results showed the Trichoderma biofertilizer enhanced the nutrient uptake and tolerance environment stresses, further improving the quality and production of flowering Chinese cabbage.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTrichoderma 0aBrassica campestris 0aGrowth 0aSoil improvement 0aBiofertilizer1 aLiu, Zhihua1 aLiu, Bin1 aWang, Yucheng1 aWang, Jinjie0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Feb. 27, v. 262 p.109069-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1090693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245006000178300001600238506002800254520181900282592002802101506003702129650001402166650001002180650001402190650001202204650001702216650001702233650001302250651000902263653001502272653001102287653001102298653001002309773015002319856008502469852000902554655001202563IND60774475720221207090434.0200512e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077447572DNAL7 a10.22077/jhpr.2020.2972.11122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzimi, Mohammad Hossein10aAssessment and ranking of new gladiolus hybrids in Iran  ap. 235-244.  aResource is Open Access  a<strong>Purpose</strong>: The aims of this research were to collect reliable information about economic traits, introducing superior genotypes for production, exportation and breeding programs in new hybrids of gladiolus.<strong> Research Method</strong>: 48 promising genotypes with 4 parents of gladiolus evaluated on the basis of a randomized complete block design in three replications. The Research was conducted in Ornamental Plants Research Center in Mahallat from 2017-2018. <strong>Main findings</strong>: The results showed that the highest number of florets was observed in OPRC16 (19.0 florets) and the lowest in OPRC412, OPRC413, and OPRC99 (8.00 florets). The highest floret width of 12.00 cm was related to OPRC16 and the lowest of 7.00 cm to OPRC712. The longest spike was 71.00 cm observed in OPRC16 and the shortest was 33.00 cm observed in OPRC411. OPRC311 and OPRC61 exhibited the highest and lowest plant height of 210 and 132 cm, respectively.<strong> </strong> It was found that the flowers of the new hybrids were almost whitish in color. It was also indicated that the diversity in the traits was mostly related to the genetic factors and the environment was less influential on them. According to the North American Gladiolus Council, the length of the cut branch (spike and branch length) of all hybrids (48 hybrids) and the parents P1, P2, and P3 were categorized in the fantasy group. The hybrids that were placed in the fantasy group in terms of the spike length were more marketable. <strong>Research limitations</strong>: No limitations were founded.<strong> Originality/Value</strong>: The results revealed high diversity among the hybrids and parents in traits. Therefore, hybrids that are superior (fantasy group) in these commercial traits can be introduced as new cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGladiolus 3acolor 3acultivars 3aflorets 3ahorticulture 3aplant height 3aresearch 3aIran 0acut branch 0afloret 0ahybrid 0aspike0 tJournal of horticulture and postharvest research.g2020 Sept., v. 3, no.

Plant resistance traits, like concentrations of secondary compounds, can also be negatively associated with tolerance. Few studies have measured both “tolerance” and “resistance” traits in the same study to determine which are the best predictors of a plant's ability to tolerate insect damage. Here, we measured simultaneously a large suite of traits on damaged and undamaged siblings in 10 families of greenhouse‐grown Raphanus raphanistrum plants. Traits measured were: leaf area, root biomass, shoot biomass, photosynthetic rate, trichome density, total glucosinolate concentration, flowering rate, petal size, total number of flowers, and total number of seeds. Pieris rapae larvae were used to damage plants to 50% leaf area removal. Using multiple regression, we examined which traits were the best predictors of tolerance. We considered both male tolerance (relative number of flowers produced by damaged and undamaged sibs) and female tolerance (relative number of seeds produced). We found that, generally, resistance traits were better predictors of both male and female tolerance than tolerance traits. Interestingly, we found that male and female tolerance were not correlated, and that male tolerance was significantly less variable than female tolerance. We also found that measurements of traits postdamage (induced state) were more informative than measurements on undamaged plants (constitutive state). Our results support the idea of a resistance/tolerance trade‐off. In addition, our study suggests that there are conflicts in investment in male vs. female fitness after damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPieris rapae 3aRaphanus raphanistrum 3abiomass 3afemales 3aflowering 3aglucosinolates 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3alarvae 3aleaf area 3amales 3aphotosynthesis 3aregression analysis 3aseeds 3asiblings 3atrichomes1 aWatson, Wendy1 aAllen, Mitchell T.0 tEcology.g2003 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.2074-2082dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-02673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010400157300001800261520148300279592002801762650002101790650002301811650001801834650002001852650001101872650001201883650001401895650001701909650002501926650001901951650002101970650001301991650001602004650001102020700001702031700001802048700001802066700001502084700001802099773012202117856007302239852000902312655001202321IND60340819320221117185552.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034081932DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.125252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jinhua,10aDetoxification function of the Arabidopsis sulphotransferase AtSOT12 by sulphonation of xenobiotics  ap. 1673-1682.  aCytosolic sulphotransferases have been implicated in inactivation of endogenous steroid hormones and detoxification of xenobiotics in human and animals. Yet, the function of plant sulphotransferases in xenobiotic sulphonation and detoxification has not been reported. In this study, we show that the Arabidopsis sulphotransferase AtSOT12 could sulphonate the bacterial‐produced toxin cycloheximide. Loss‐of‐function mutant sot12 exhibited hypersensitive phenotype to cycloheximide, and expression of AtSOT12 protein in yeast cells conferred resistance to this toxic compound. AtSOT12 exhibited broad specificity and could sulphonate a variety of xenobiotics including phenolic and polycyclic compounds. Enzyme kinetics analysis indicated that AtSOT12 has different selectivity for simple phenolics with different side chains, and the position of the side chain in the simple phenolic compounds affects substrate binding affinity and catalytic efficiency. We proposed that the broad specificity and induced production of AtSOT12 may have rendered this enzyme to not only modify endogenous molecules such as salicylic acid as we previously reported, but also sulphonate pathogen‐produced toxic small molecules to protect them from infection. Sulphonation of small molecules in plants may constitute a rapid way to inactivate or change the physiochemical properties of biologically active molecules that could have profound effects on plant growth, development and defence.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3acatalytic activity 3acycloheximide 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahumans 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3apolycyclic compounds 3asalicylic acid 3asteroid hormones 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics 3ayeasts1 aGAO, LIQIONG1 aBAEK, DONGWON1 aLiu, Chunlin,1 aRUAN, YING1 aSHI, HUAZHONG0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2015 Aug., v. 38, no. 8 p.1673-1682dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.125253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009200130300001600222506002800238520177900266592002802045506003702073650002302110650001502133650001602148650001102164650001602175650001402191650001402205650001302219651001402232653002302246653001102269653001402280653001502294773010102309852000902410655001202419IND60774475920221207090426.0120125e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077447592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTIRTA, I GEDE14aThe effect of potassium and mycorrhiza on growth of vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Andrew)  ap. 171-174.  aResource is Open Access  aThe few and shallow roots caused slow growth of vanilla seedling. Mycorrhiza may increased the absorption of water and nutrients, while potassium may increased the rate of growth and strength of seedlings. This study was conducted at Sambangan Village, Buleleng, Bali in 2003 (April-Agustus 2003). The experiment was done in polybag and was arranged in Randomized Block Design with three replications. The treatments were consisted of two factors. The first factor was the rates of KCl fertilizer (0, 100 and 200 kg ha-1 or 0, 0,10 and 0,20 9 plant-1) and the second factor was the rates of mycorrhiza (0, 20 and 30 g plant-1). The aim of the research to study interactions between potassium and mycorrhiza and The optimum dosage the mycorrhiza on growth of vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Andrew). The resultes showed that there were interactions between potassium and mycorrhiza on fresh weight of the new shoot, root length and fresh root weight. The optimum dosage of the mycorrhiza was 20 g plant-1 with new shoot fresh weight was 25.63 g plant-1. The longest root (24.67 cm plant-1) was observed at the treatment without potasium with 20 g plant-1 mycorrhiza and this was 23% longer than control (19.93 cm plant-1). The highest fresh root weight (2.48 g plant-1) was observed at the dosage of 200 kg KCl ha-1 and 20 g mycorrhiza plant-1 and that was 55% heavier than control (1.60 g plant-1). The leaf number of the plant with 20 g plant-1 mycorrhiza was 6.22 and that was 18% more than control with leaf number 5.25. The total fresh weight of the seedling with 20 g plant-1 mycorrhiza was 86.74 g plant-1or 15% higher compared with control (75.18 g plant-1). The dosage of 100 kg KCl ha-1 increased the K content of the plant (2.45%K) or 35% higher than control (1.81%K).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVanilla planifolia 3aabsorption 3afertilizers 3aleaves 3amycorrhizae 3apotassium 3aseedlings 3avillages 3aIndonesia 0aVanilla planifolia 0agrowth 0apotassium 0amycorrhiza0 tBiodiversitas.g2006 Apr., v. 7, no. 2 p.171-174dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007000169300001700239520083000256592002801086650000801114650001701122650001701139650002001156650001901176650001501195650001201210650001401222650002501236650002601261700001801287700001901305700001801324700001801342700002001360773008001380856008401460852000901544655001201553IND60087215920221117231307.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008721592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2012.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOng, Hwee Jing10aAnalysis of p53 binding to DNA by fluorescence imaging microscopy  ap. 996-1000.  aTranscription factors play a central role in cell biology through binding to target DNA elements and regulating gene expression. In this study, we used the p53 tumour suppressor as a model transcription factor to develop an imaging based assay to measure DNA binding. The assay utilizes fluorescence imaging microscopy to detect labelled p53 bound to DNA coated on microbeads. We demonstrate the ability to multiplex the assay by interrogating simultaneous binding to variant DNA sequences present on tractable beads. Additionally, the assay measures activation of p53 for increased DNA binding by a known peptide in addition to reactivation of mutant p53 by a small molecule. It may therefore be adaptable to a high-content imaging screen for compounds capable of restoring the function of mutant p53 associated with cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell biology 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3aimage analysis 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription factors1 aSiau, Jia Wei1 aZhang, Jing Bo1 aHong, Minghui1 aFlotow, Horst1 aGhadessy, Farid0 tMicron.g2012 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.996-1000dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2012.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245014000167300001600307506002800323520175300351592002802104506003702132650002202169650001602191650002102207650002402228650002402252650001602276650001102292650001702303650001302320650001702333650001702350651001202367653001102379653002202390653001702412653001002429700002002439700002102459773010302480856007902583852000902662655001202671IND60761847020221207113802.0220104e20211229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076184702DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2021-00572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshi, Kyenpiya E.10aGrowth and yield of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) as affected by storage conditions and storage duration in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria  ap. 779-797.  aResource is Open Access  aThis study was carried out in two seasons (2010–2011 and 2012–2013) in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria to investigate the growth and yield of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) seed tubers as affected by storage conditions and storage duration. Five potato varieties (“Nicola,” “Bertita,” “Diamant,” “BR63-18,” and “Roslin-Ruaka”) were stored for three durations (12, 24, and 32 weeks) in three kinds of stores (room temperature store [RTS], diffused light store [DLS], and air-conditioned store [ACS]). The experimental design was a split–split plot in a randomized complete block design with the potato varieties, storage conditions, and storage durations as the main, sub, and sub–sub plots, respectively. All the parameters assessed varied with variety except the plant height. Germination and establishment were significantly higher in ACS than in RTS and DLS. RTS and DLS resulted in more aboveground stems than ACS. Storage in ACS resulted in a significantly higher plant height, leaf number, total number and yield of tubers, and yield of saleable tubers in both seasons. Seed tubers stored for 24 weeks resulted in the highest establishment count and the mean number of aboveground stems in both seasons. Aboveground stems increased from 12 to 24 weeks of storage and declined at 32 weeks. Seed storage for 12 weeks resulted in the highest total number of tubers, whereas 32 weeks had the lowest number of tubers in both seasons. Seed storage for 12 and 32 weeks resulted in the highest yield of tubers in seasons 1 and 2, respectively. In conclusion, potato varieties varied greatly in the rate of physiological aging; hence, every variety required specific storage conditions and duration for optimal growth and yield.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aagriculture 3aair conditioning 3aambient temperature 3aexperimental design 3agermination 3aleaves 3aplant height 3apotatoes 3aseed storage 3astorage time 3aNigeria 0apotato 0aphysiological age 0afield growth 0ayield1 aObasi, Moses O.1 aOdiaka, Ngozi I.0 tOpen Agriculture.g2021 Dec. 29, v. 6, no. 1 p.779-797dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2021-00573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04177naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002600134040001800160100001700178245014800195300001600343500001400359506017300373520195000546650001302496650000902509650001602518650001102534650001902545650001302564650001102577650001602588650001102604650001102615650002102626650002202647650001002669650000902679650001002688650001702698650001502715650001302730650001102743650001102754650000902765650001302774650002002787650002002807650001802827650001202845650002202857650002402879650001502903651001202918700002202930700001702952700002202969700001802991700001603009700001903025700002303044773008903067856011403156856007203270956008303342961000903425852000903434655001203443IND60647241820221214231439.0180730e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064724182DNAL7 a10113/64724182hdl7 a3045702aris7 a10.1002/eco.13622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Guo-Yue13aAn integrated modelling framework of catchment-scale ecohydrological processes: 1.

This first of a two-part paper documents a fully integrated catchment-scale ecohydrological model consisting of a three-dimensional physically based hydrological model and a land surface model. This first part also presents a first application to test the model over an energy-limited catchment (8.4km2) of the Sleepers River watershed in Vermont. The physically based hydrological model (CATchment HYdrology, CATHY) describes three-dimensional subsurface flow in variably saturated porous media and surface routing on hillslopes and in stream channels, whereas the land surface model (LSM), an augmented version of Noah LSM with multiple parameterization schemes (NoahMP), accounts for energy, water, and carbon flux exchanges between various land surface elements and the atmosphere. CATHY and NoahMP are coupled through exchanges of water fluxes and states. In the energy-limited catchment of the Sleepers River watershed, where snowmelt runoff generation is the dominant hydrologic flux, the coupled CATHY/NoahMP model at both 90 and 30-msurface grid resolutions, with minimal calibration, performs well in simulating the observed snow accumulation, and melt and subsequent snowmelt discharge. The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency of daily discharge is above 0.82 for both resolutions. The simulation at 90-mresolution shows a marginal improvement over that at 30-m resolution because of more elaborate calibration of model parameters. The coupled CATHY/NoahMP also shows a capability of simulating surface-inundated area and distributed surface water height, although the accuracy of these simulations needs further evaluation. The CATHY/NoahMP model is thus also a potentially useful research tool for predicting flash flood and lake dynamics under climatic change. 3aaccuracy 3aarea 3acalibration 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adynamics 3aenergy 3aexhibitions 3afloods 3aheight 3ahydrologic cycle 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3aland 3apaper 3aporous media 3aprediction 3aresearch 3arivers 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3astream channels 3asubsurface flow 3asurface water 3atesting 3atopographic slope 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3aVermont1 aPaniconi, Claudio1 aTroch, Peter1 aScott, Russell L.1 aDurcik, Matej1 aZeng, Xubin1 aHuxman, Travis1 aGoodrich, David C.0 tEcohydrology.g2014 Apr., v. 7, no. 2 p.427-439wJournal:J000000066x1936-05847nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64724183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.13623Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2102.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012400163506011700287506007600404520150700480592002801987506003702015650002602052650002002078650001402098650002402112650001102136650001302147650002102160650001502181651001002196653003202206653003002238653000802268653004502276653002402321700002102345700002302366700001302389773010102402856008302503852000902586655001202595IND60777523020221207131413.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077752302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yin10aApplication and assessment of a downscaled GPM dataset in the simulation of snowmelt runoff in alpine mountainous areas  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  athe Jingou River basin (located in central Xinjiang, China). Estimating snowmelt runoff in alpine areas lacking monitoring stations is essential for water resource management. The newly released global precipitation measurement (GPM) data provide a high-precision precipitation input data source for snowmelt runoff simulations in such areas. However, the resolution (10 km × 10 km) is still insufficient for small and medium watersheds, which reduces the application efficiency of the GPM dataset in runoff simulations. Therefore, the geographic weighted regression model (GWR) is used to downscale the GPM dataset and drive the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) in this study. The results show that the average R² values of daily runoff simulated by observed precipitation data and the downscaled GPM dataset (1 km × 1 km) are 0.869 and 0.847, respectively, and the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values are 0.795 and 0.715, respectively. The accuracy of the runoff data simulated by the downscaled GPM dataset is 2.5% lower than that simulated based on the observed data, and good results are obtained. This study shows that the downscaled GPM dataset can be regarded as an effective alternative product in areas lacking observed data. The GPM dataset has good application prospects as substitute data in mountainous areas, and the GPM dataset resolves the precipitation data scarcity in high-elevation mountainous areas without stations and provides a rare data source for modeling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSnowmelt Runoff Model 3adata collection 3amountains 3aregression analysis 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aSnowmelt runoff model (SRM) 0aSnow cover fraction (SCF) 0aGPM 0aGeographically weighted regression (GWR) 0aSpatial downscaling1 aHanati, Gulimire1 aDanierhan, Sulitan1 aHu, Keke0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 June, v. 41 p.101107-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245008200181300001800263500000900281520167400290592002801964650001301992650002302005650002302028650001202051650002802063650001402091650000902105650001402114650002302128650003502151650001202186650001502198650001302213651001302226700002002239773015002259856009602409852000902505655001202514IND60668523020221122043015.0191125e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066852302DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800060010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanchar, R.

Phosphate sorption studies were done by shaking KH₂PO₄ solutions with soil for 16 d and measuring pH, Eh, electrical conductivity, Ca, Mn, Al, Fe, and P contents of the solution. These data were used to compute ion products and to estimate the activities of solid-phase phosphate minerals. It was shown that solubility relationships for the reaction of H₂PO₄ with Al(OH)₃ could be interfaced with estimates of solid-phase activities and used to predict phosphate in solution as a function of a soil constant (C), soil pH, and the amount of phosphate added. Activities for the equilibrium equation, p(H₂PO₄) = 10.50 − pH − p[Al(OH)₃] + p(AlPO₄), were estimated. The value of p[Al(OH)₃] was determined from the data to be a linear function of pH, 2.41 − 0.42 pH, for soils used in this study. The value of p(AlPO₄) was determined by statistically fitting observed p(AlPO₄) and Pₐddₑd to a polynomial equation similar in form to the one for a regular solid solution: p(AlPO₄) = C − 9.4 × 10⁻³ (Pₐddₑd) + 6.9 × 10⁻⁶ (Pₐddₑd)², with r² = 0.96. Values of p(H₂PO₄) were calculated from pH and Pₐddₑd by these combined equations, and compared with measured p(H₂PO₄) with an r² of 0.96. The system was shown to have solubility features similar to those described for a regular solid solution. Combining solution equilibria and regular solid-solution concepts was useful in providing a chemical basis for interpreting phosphate sorption by soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aaluminum phosphate 3acalcium 3aelectrical conductivity 3aequations 3airon 3amanganese 3aphosphate minerals 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3asoil pH 3asolubility 3asorption 3aMissouri1 aStearman, G.

However, with regard to renovating and retrofitting existing buildings, life cycle assessment (LCA)-based studies mostly focus on the improvement of a building’s energy performance rather than on the structural aspects of the retrofit itself. The present study assesses the life cycle environmental impacts of different replacement options for a typical old flat roof belonging to a masonry building. Three different structural options are considered: reinforced concrete joists and hollow clay blocks, steel joists and concrete slab, and reinforced concrete joists and polystyrene panels. METHODS: The environmental analysis is based on a new approach wherein the structural and functional properties of a new flat roof are set as fixed requirements for the design of the different replacement options. A cradle-to-grave LCA-based study is then conducted for the environmental assessment of the entire retrofit process, including different waste scenarios. SimaPro software and IMPACT2002+ methodology are used for the LCA analysis, enabling quantification of the environmental impacts of the three flat roofing options by means of 4 endpoint and 15 midpoint indicators. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The environmental contribution of each life cycle phase related to the replacement of the old flat roof is assessed. The results demonstrate that within the life cycle of each option, the use phase and the construction phase have the highest environmental impact, ranging from 60 to 70 % and 50 to 80 % of the total burden in the Climate Change/Resources and Human Health/Ecosystem Quality damage categories, respectively. Having initially set structural and functional constraints for the analysis, the results show that any of the different options exhibits an overall lowest environmental performance. Consequently, specific environmental burdens/categories can be identified to optimize the sustainable retrofit design. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The work demonstrates that a comprehensive LCA-based approach can be used to effectively drive the design of structural and functional retrofit operations on existing buildings. This study also shows how a rigorous environmental analysis, conducted by implementing the proposed approach, can influence decision-making for the most sustainable design alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aclay 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3adesign for environment 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afunctional properties 3ahuman health 3ahuman resources 3amaterials life cycle 3amidpoint indicator 3apolystyrenes 3asteel 3asustainable development1 aMenna, Costantino1 aAsprone, Domenico1 aProta, Andrea1 aManfredi, Gaetano0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2015 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.694-708dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0852-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245015900179300001600338520068500354592002801039650001301067650002201080650001401102650001001116650001201126650000901138650001401147650002301161650003301184700002301217700002301240700002601263773007901289856008401368852000901452655001201461IND60087216020221117231235.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008721602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2012.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeonardi, María Soledad10aScanning electron microscopy of Antarctophthirus microchir (Phthiraptera: Anoplura: Echinophthiriidae): Studying morphological adaptations to aquatic life  ap. 929-936.  aThe members of the Family Echinophthiriidae (Phthiraptera: Anoplura) are unique among insects because they infest hosts with an amphibious lifestyle.

Based on this, the study explores the quantitative changes in groundwater levels towards the end of this century according to most relevant climate scenarios regarding the evolution of air temperature and precipitation amount. The results of the ANNs model show that air temperature together with precipitation amount explain between 50% and 70% of the groundwater levels variability for 1983–2017 interval. For local conditions instead, analysed at the level of main regional weather stations, the explained variability by the climate conditions decreases between 40% and 60%. This overall good statistical performance enables us to assimilate into the model the climate scenarios data for the region. The groundwater projections indicate that the decline in groundwater levels is expected to be general in both climate scenarios analysed. Thus, the impact of climate change on groundwater supply is expected to be very high over the study region, adding to the onset effect of diminishing water quality, raising a great risk on water availability for natural and socio-economic environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3awater quality 3aweather 3aRomania 0aGroundwater levels 0aClimate scenarios 0aNARX 0aNortheastern Romania1 aMinea, Ionuţ1 aHriţac, Robert1 aAmihăesei, Vlad-Alexandru1 aBoicu, Daniel0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 June, v. 41 p.101108-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1011083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012000157300001800277520141800295592002801713650002501741650001601766650001701782650001701799650000901816650001601825650001901841650001401860650001301874650002001887650003101907650001001938650001101948650001601959650002001975650001601995700002002011700001902031700002502050700002102075773012202096856007302218852000902291655001202300IND60340819520221117185631.0150808e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034081952DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHULZ, ELISA10aNatural variation in flavonol and anthocyanin metabolism during cold acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions  ap. 1658-1672.  aIn plants from temperate climates such as Arabidopsis thaliana, low, non‐freezing temperatures lead to increased freezing tolerance in a process termed cold acclimation. During cold acclimation, massive changes in gene expression and in the content of primary metabolites and lipids have been observed. Here, we have analysed the influence of cold acclimation on flavonol and anthocyanin content and on the expression of genes related to flavonoid metabolism in 54 Arabidopsis accessions covering a wide range of freezing tolerance. Most flavonols and anthocyanins accumulated upon cold exposure, but the extent of accumulation varied strongly among the accessions. This was also true for most of the investigated transcripts. Correlation analyses revealed a high degree of coordination among metabolites and among transcripts, but only little correlation between metabolites and transcripts, indicating an important role of post‐transcriptional regulation in flavonoid metabolism. Similarly, levels of many flavonoid biosynthesis genes were correlated with freezing tolerance after cold acclimation, but only the pool sizes of a few flavonols and anthocyanins. Collectively, our data provide evidence for an important role of flavonoid metabolism in Arabidopsis freezing tolerance and point to the importance of post‐transcriptional mechanisms in the regulation of flavonoid metabolism in response to cold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aacclimation 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3aflavonols 3afreezing 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alipids 3ametabolites 3atemperate zones 3atemperature1 aTOHGE, TAKAYUKI1 aZuther, Ellen,1 aFernie, Alisdair R.,1 aHincha, Dirk K.,0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2015 Aug., v. 38, no. 8 p.1658-1672dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010100156300001800257500002000275520113000295592002801425650001001453650001201463650002301475650001001498650000901508700001501517700001601532773009801548856007101646852000901717655001201726IND60569978820221120025801.0170626e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056997882DNAL7 a10.1890/01-06162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, S.

For example, plant seeds that appear to be adapted for wind dispersal may occasionally be dispersed long distances by birds, or vice versa. In this paper, we explore whether existing data on dispersal distances, colonization rates, and migration rates support the idea that dispersal processes suggested by the morphology of the dispersal unit are responsible for long distance dispersal. We conclude that the relationship between morphologically defined dispersal syndrome and long‐distance dispersal is poor. This relationship is poor because the relationship between the morphology of dispersal units and the multiple processes that move seeds are often complex. We argue that understanding gleaned from the often anecdotal literature on nonstandard and standard means of long distance dispersal is the foundation for both statistical and mechanistic models of long‐distance dispersal. Such models hold exciting promise for the development of a quantitative ecology of long‐distance dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aecology 3amechanistic models 3aseeds 3awind1 aNathan, R.1 aCain, M.

This activity is planned to last 2 years and covers human health, ecosystem quality, and a stress-based indicator. This latter encompasses potential deprivation of both ecosystem and human, hence aiming to represent potential impacts more comprehensively than any other available LCA-oriented method assessing the “water scarcity footprint” (ISO 2014). METHODS: A series of three expert workshops, including non-LCA experts from hydrology, eco-hydrology, and water supply science, was organized specifically on the topic of this generic midpoint indicator. They were held in Zurich on 10th September, in San Francisco on 5th October and in Tsukuba on 27th October 2014. In total 49 experts attended. The specific objectives of the workshops were twofold. First, it was to present the identified options of the stress-based indicator narrowed down by the active members of WULCA during the first 8 months of the project and to receive comments on the relevance, usefulness, acceptability, and focus of the selected indicator. Second, the workshop covered different challenges in the modeling of the indicator and presented the experts with background information and specific questions. This paper summarizes the discussions and outcome of these workshops. Where no agreement was reached, the working group of active members is considering all inputs received and continues the work. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The discussion covered first the question to be answered by such indicator, resulting on an agreement on the evaluation of the potential to deprive other users of water, independently of who the user is (i.e., human or ecosystems). Special attention was given to the special case of arid areas as well as the definition of environmental water requirements. Specific modeling challenges were then addressed: definition and quantification of human and ecosystem water demand, consideration of green water and terrestrial ecosystems, sources of data, distinction of groundwater and surface water, and temporal and geographical resolution. CONCLUSIONS: The input, decisions, and points of discussion were compiled and brought back within the group of active members. The group is using the recommendations and works further on the harmonization of the points of disagreement. It is expected that a selection of indicators representing different ways to address the most important issues will be produced and tested in spring 2015. The analysis of the result should lead to a provisional recommendation by summer 2015.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperts 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amidpoint indicator 3amodels 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awater supply1 aBare, Jane1 aDe Camillis, C.,1 aDöll, Petra1 aGassert, Francis1 aGerten, Dieter1 aHumbert, Sébastien,1 aInaba, Atsushi1 aItsubo, Norihiro1 aLemoine, Yann1 aMargni, Manuele1 aMotoshita, Masaharu1 aNúñez, Montse1 aPastor, Amandine V.1 aRidoutt, B.

Of a multifactorial nature, it may be related to diseases in the functioning of the organs, physical inactivity and poor diet. The possibility of a correlation between dietary patterns and sarcopenia has been studied, indicating a good relationship between a healthy habitual diet in the protection against the development of this syndrome. Objective: To analyze the association between the eating patterns of the elderly and the emergence of sarcopenia. Materials and Methods: This is a systematic review, which was elaborated following the items of preferred reports for systematic analyzes and meta-analyses (PRISMA), carried out through the electronic databases: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science that, after an evaluation careful analysis of the articles, counted as a final sample of 05 studies. Results: Through the analysis of studies that ranged from 2008 to 2020, most of which were published in 2020, it was possible to verify different types of dietary patterns and how they influence the prevention, delay of sarcopenia or risk of developing it, suggesting a positive association between healthier eating patterns in the treatment of age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. Conclusion: The role of good nutrition in human aging is evidenced, both in the prevention and control of sarcopenia, however, it was clear that there is no specific dietary pattern, but different healthy eating patterns that show promising results in terms of development of sarcopenia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet 3aelderly 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3amuscle tissues 3apublic health 3arisk 3asarcopenia 3asystematic review 0aalimentação 0aidosos 0adieta1 aSantos, Joene Vitória Rocha1 aCarvalho, Francisca Patrícia Barreto de0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2022 Mar., v. 15, no. 93 p.325-335dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do Exercíciox1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166520076300273592002801036650001301064650001301077650001401090650001801104650002301122650004401145650002601189650002201215653001801237653002501255653001401280653002201294700001901316700001401335700001501349700001901364773011801383856008201501852000901583655001201592IND60677530520221119131504.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067753052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2019.1039792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiao-Hong10aPolyacelylenic alcohols and alkaloid derivatives from a calcareous marine sponge, Leucetta chagosensis  aA chemical investigation of the CH2Cl2 extract of the marine sponge Leucetta chagosensis afforded 8 secondary metabolites, namely, pellynol A (1), pellynol B (2), pellynol I (3), pellynol D (4), plakohypaphorine B (5), plakohypaphorine E (6), 4-bromo-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide (7), and 2-phenylacetamide (8).

In the structural and ultrastructural analysis, it was used impregnation by silver ions, immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy using antibodies against fibrillarin. Regarding the results, the fibrillarin nucleolar protein marked the nucleus and some cytoplasmic spots of germ cells during spermatogenesis in triatomines. These data suggest that fibrillarin could be a constituent of the CB that was most likely derived from nucleolar fragmentation. This is the first time that fibrillarin protein expression has been shown in the CB during spermatogenesis progression in triatomines. The knowledge regarding CB constituents may help to expand the understanding of the physiological role of this structure and the role that it plays in the reproductive biology of triatomines, which are vectors of Chagas Disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTriatoma infestans 3aTriatoma sordida 3aantibodies 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agerm cells 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aions 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asilver 3aspermatogenesis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPeruquetti, Rita Luiza1 aTaboga, Sebastião Roberto1 aVilela de Azeredo-Oliveira, Maria Tercília0 tMicron.g2012 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.954-960dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2012.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165300001600263520184000279592002802119650002402147650002202171650001402193650001402207650002002221650001602241650001402257650002502271650001302296650001702309650001302326650001902339650002602358650002302384650001502407650001402422650002602436650001802462650001902480650001602499700001502515700001802530773012002548856008102668852000902749655001202758IND60129905920221123043716.0150503e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012990592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-015-0854-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Jingmin10aEnvironmental and economic impact of furfuralcohol production using corncob as a raw material  ap. 623-631.  aPURPOSE: Corncob as agricultural waste has dramatically increased in recent years. Some corncobs are recycled and reused as bioproducts, whereas a large amount remains unused and burned in the fields. Currently, furfural production technology is one of the most commonly used technologies for corncob valorization because furfural is one of the most promising chemicals for sustainable chemical production. However, very few studies have analyzed the impact of furfural and furfuralcohol production on the environment and economy via life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). This study aims to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of furfural and furfuralcohol production, identify the main pollution processes and substances, improve potentials, and build a database on the furfural industry. METHODS: Life cycle assessment and life cycle costing were carried out to estimate the environmental and economic impact of corncob-based furfural and furfuralcohol production. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The corncob production, transport, and electricity consumption stages had the greatest impact on the environment because of direct heavy metal, phosphate, and phosphorus emissions. The overall economic impact was mainly attributed to tax, corncob, transport, electricity, and infrastructure investment. Optimizing corncob transport, raw materials and consumption efficiency, and waste disposal is highly important in reducing both environmental and economic burden. CONCLUSIONS: The key factors that contribute to reducing the overall environmental and economic impacts are increasing electricity consumption efficiency and furfural product yield, decreasing transport distance from corncob buyers to suppliers, choosing the appropriate corncob compression technology, and optimizing the wastewater reuse system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abiobased products 3acorn cobs 3adatabases 3aeconomic impact 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3afurfural 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3alife cycle assessment 3alife cycle costing 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3aproduction technology 3araw materials 3awaste disposal 3awater reuse1 aZhou, Jing1 aHong, Jinglan0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2015 May, v. 20, no. 5 p.623-631dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0854-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245012200178300001600300520168800316592002802004650002402032650001702056650001502073650001202088650001802100650001402118650002202132650001502154650001402169650001902183650002302202650002302225650001302248650001602261650002002277650001402297650001602311650001402327650001502341650001002356653002602366653002102392653003602413653002502449653001802474653001402492700002202506700002402528700002302552700002002575700002202595773012402617856008902741852000902830655001202839IND60112052720221120093126.0190410e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011205272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2012.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaral, Dany S.S.L.10aNon-crop vegetation associated with chili pepper agroecosystems promote the abundance and survival of aphid predators  ap. 338-346.  aHabitat manipulation has long been used as strategy to enhance beneficial insects in agroecosystems. Non-crop weed strips have the potential of supplying food resources to natural enemies, even when pest densities are low. However, in tropical agroecosystems there is a paucity of information pertaining to the resources provided by non-crop weeds and their interactions with natural enemies. In this study we evaluated (a) whether weeds within chili pepper fields affect the diversity and abundance of aphidophagous species; (b) whether there are direct interactions between weeds and aphidophagous arthropods; and (c) the importance of weed floral resources for survival of a native and exotic coccinellid in chili pepper agroecosystems. In the field, aphidophagous arthropods were dominated by Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Anthocoridae, Neuroptera and Araneae, and these natural enemies were readily observed preying on aphids, feeding on flowers or extrafloral nectaries, and using plant structures for oviposition and/or protection. Survival of native Cycloneda sanguinea (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) differed between plant species, with significantly greater survival on Ageratum conyzoides and Bidens pilosa. However, no evidence was gathered to suggest that weed floral resources provided any nutritional benefit to the exotic Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). This research has provided evidence that naturally growing weeds in chili pepper agroecosystems can affect aphid natural enemy abundance and survival, highlighting the need for further research to fully characterize the structure and function of plant resources in these and other tropical agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratum conyzoides 3aAnthocoridae 3aAphidoidea 3aAraneae 3aBidens pilosa 3aCycloneda 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aNeuroptera 3aSyrphidae 3aagroecosystems 3abeneficial insects 3abiological control 3ahabitats 3ahot peppers 3anatural enemies 3anectaries 3aoviposition 3apredators 3avegetation 3aweeds 0aAphidophagous species 0aAlternative food 0aConservation biological control 0aGeneralist predators 0aCoccinellidae 0aSyrphidae1 aVenzon, Madelaine1 aDuarte, Marcus V.A.1 aSousa, Fernanda F.1 aPallini, Angelo1 aHarwood, James D.0 tBiological control.g2013 Mar., v. 64, no. 3 p.338-346dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2012.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03752naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245012800213300001100341506007600352520157900428592002802007596007402035506003702109650002302146650002002169650001502189650002302204650001202227650001902239650002802258650002002286650002002306650001402326650001802340650001902358650002202377650001802399650002502417650001802442650000902460650001102469650001302480650001302493650001302506700002802519700004002547700002902587700002802616700003802644700002902682700002502711700003602736700002202772700003102794700003002825700002802855773010402883856008202987852000903069655001203078IND60648114720221207140234.0200821e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064811472DNAL7 a312389392pmid7 aPMC65935742pmcid7 a10.1186/s12896-019-0518-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiabai, Maria José10aMucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNF scFv expression vector ameliorates experimental colitis in mice  ap. 38.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha therapy has become clinically important for treating inflammatory bowel disease. However, the use of conventional immunotherapy requires a systemic exposure of patients and collateral side effects. Lactic acid bacteria have been shown to be effective as mucosal delivering system for cytokine and single domain antibodies, and it is amenable to clinical purposes. Therefore, lactic acid bacteria may function as vehicles for delivery of therapeutic antibodies molecules to the gastrointestinal tract restricting the pharmacological effect towards the gut. Here, we use the mucosal delivery of Lactococcus lactis carrying an anti-TNFα scFv expression plasmid on a DSS-induced colitis model in mice. RESULTS: Experimental colitis was induced with DSS administered in drinking water. L. lactis carrying the scFv expression vector was introduced by gavage. After four days of treatment, animals showed a significant improvement in histological score and disease activity index compared to those of untreated animals. Moreover, treated mice display IL-6, IL17A, IL1β, IL10 and FOXP3 mRNA levels similar to health control mice. Therefore, morphological and molecular markers suggest amelioration of the experimentally induced colitis. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence for the use of this alternative system for delivering therapeutic biopharmaceuticals in loco for treating inflammatory bowel disease, paving the way for a novel low-cost and site-specific biotechnological route for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  a193.000.834/2015cFundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Distrito Federal0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactococcus lactis 3aadverse effects 3aantibodies 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acolitis 3adrinking water 3agastrointestinal system 3agenetic markers 3agenetic vectors 3ahistology 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alactic acid bacteria 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3anecrosis 3apatients 3aplasmids1 aAlmeida, Juliana Franco1 ade Azevedo, Mariana Gabriela Dantas1 aFernandes, Suelen Soares1 aPereira, Vanessa Bastos1 ade Castro, Raffael Júnio Araújo1 aJerônimo, Márcio Sousa1 aSousa, Isabel Garcia1 ade Souza Vianna, Leonora Maciel1 aMiyoshi, Anderson1 aBocca, Anamelia Lorenzetti1 aMaranhão, Andrea Queiroz1 aBrigido, Marcelo Macedo0 tBMC biotechnology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.38-38dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-019-0518-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03727naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011400170300001800284520177600302592002802078650002402106650001602130650001102146650001502157650001702172650002002189650001102209650000902220650001202229650002202241650001902263650001302282650002202295650001502317650002102332650001402353650002002367650001502387650002102402650001002423650000902433651001702442653002502459653001102484653001602495653001602511653002102527653000802548653001002556653000802566653000902574653000902583653000902592653000902601653001002610653000902620653000702629653001102636700003402647700003002681700001802711700002302729700002302752773012502775856008402900852000902984655001202993IND60541418120221119134527.0190318e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054141812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVardien, Waafeka10aNodules from Fynbos legume Virgilia divaricata have high functional plasticity under variable P supply levels  ap. 1732-1739.  aLegumes have the unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) via symbiotic bacteria in their nodules but depend heavily on phosphorus (P), which affects nodulation, and the carbon costs and energy costs of N2 fixation. Consequently, legumes growing in nutrient-poor ecosystems (e.g., sandstone-derived soils) have to enhance P recycling and/or acquisition in order to maintain N2 fixation. In this study, we investigated the flexibility of P recycling and distribution within the nodules and their effect on N nutrition in Virgilia divaricata Adamson, Fabaceae, an indigenous legume in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Specifically, we assessed tissue elemental localization using micro-particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), measured N fixation using nutrient concentrations derived from inductively coupled mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS), calculated nutrient costs, and determined P recycling from enzyme activity assays. Morphological and physiological features characteristic of adaptation to P deprivation were observed for V. divaricata. Decreased plant growth and nodule production with parallel increased root:shoot ratios are some of the plastic features exhibited in response to P deficiency. Plants resupplied with P resembled those supplied with optimal P levels in terms of growth and nutrient acquisition. Under low P conditions, plants maintained an increase in N2-fixing efficiency despite lower levels of orthophosphate (Pi) in the nodules. This can be attributed to two factors: (i) an increase in Fe concentration under low P, and (ii) greater APase activity in both the roots and nodules under low P. These findings suggest that V. divaricata is well adapted to acquire N under P deficiency, owing to the plasticity of its nodule physiology  aPublisher supplied data 3aVirgilia divaricata 3aX-radiation 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3aenergy costs 3aenzyme activity 3afynbos 3airon 3alegumes 3amass spectrometry 3amicrosymbionts 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3aroot shoot ratio 3aroots 3asoil 3aSouth Africa 0aPhosphorus-deficient 0aLegume 0aRoot-nodule 0aN2-fixation 0aAcid-phosphatase 0aBNF 0a%NDFA 0aRGR 0aSNAR 0aSNUR 0aSPAR 0aSPUR 0aAPase 0aPIXE 0aBS 0aICP-MS1 aMesjasz-Przybylowicz, Jolanta1 aPrzybylowicz, Wojciech J.1 aWang, Yaodong1 aSteenkamp, Emma T.1 aValentine, Alex J.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 171, no. 18 p.1732-1739dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245009300177300001600270500000900286520145300295592002801748650001601776650001301792650001201805650002001817650001101837650000901848650001101857650001401868650000901882650001901891650001501910650001401925650000901939650000901948650001901957650001801976650001601994650001502010700001902025773014802044856009602192852000902288655001202297IND60668523720221120033235.0191125e196907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066852372DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1969.03615995003300040015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, D.

After the soil cubes were saturated with Cs, they were dried and impregnated with a polyester resin. X-ray images and Cs activity measurements, determined on thin sections with the electron microprobe, demonstrated that Cs sorbed by microstructures enriched with clay was nearly twice that of silty matrices. These observations illustrate that the loci of cation exchange are heterogeneously distributed within the undisturbed soil horizon and are influenced by micromorphological features produced by geologic and pedogenic processes. Cesium sorbed by weathered biotite sand grains was eight times greater than by clay bodies. The greater exchange capacity of the weathered biotite was attributed to the loss of interlayer potassium and conversion to a vermiculite-like mineral. The smaller exchange capacity of the clay was attributed to the presence of illite, chlorite, and kaolinite, of low exchange capacity, to pedogenic weathering and aluminum interlayer formation in vermiculite and to the presence of 40 to 50% pore space. Although weathered biotite sand grains constituted only 1.6% of the whole soil, they contributed about 15% to the total exchange capacity of Charlton soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaluminum 3abiotite 3acation exchange 3acesium 3aclay 3aillite 3akaolinite 3aloci 3amicrostructure 3apolyesters 3apotassium 3asand 3asilt 3asoil formation 3asoil horizons 3avermiculite 3aweathering1 aSawhney, B.

New assessment approaches are needed to quantify how conservation agriculture might contribute to soil health improvement and soil organic C (SOC) sequestration. In the southeastern United States, conservation management has been repeatedly shown to stratify SOC concentration with depth. Starting immediately below a zone of tillage influence (i.e., 30‐cm depth), SOC concentration is rarely affected by management due to low C inputs and high decomposition potential, whereas concentration increases toward the surface in a nonlinear manner, presumably with greater inputs of residue and root inputs and changing temperature and moisture conditions. Using these observations as an ecological foundation, SOC sequestration was calculated as the summation of SOC stock greater than the baseline condition at 30‐cm depth. Data from literature sources were mathematically fitted with this new approach as a validation. Two on‐farm surveys with different agricultural management practices (5–40 yr) in the southeastern United States yielded preliminary estimates of SOC sequestration. The interquartile range of calculated SOC sequestration was 4.2–9.4 Mg C ha–¹ for conventional‐tillage cropland (n = 45 fields), 13.6–29.7 Mg C ha–¹ for no‐tillage cropland (n = 97 fields), and 15.9–26.1 Mg C ha–¹ for perennial pasture (n = 29 fields). This new approach will be valuable to estimate SOC sequestration from a greater diversity of conservation agricultural systems practiced on farms within a region and independent of soil type.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Agricultural Research Service 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural management 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aconventional tillage 3acropland 3ano-tillage 3apastures 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3atemperature 3awater quality0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2021 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.158-171dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.201763Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245024700182300001600429520130800445592002801753650003501781650001601816650001301832650001401845650002301859650002001882650002001902650002101922650001201943650001401955650001201969650000901981650002101990650001202011650000902023650000902032653003102041653001502072653003102087653002402118653004802142700003502190700003102225700003502256700002902291700002502320700002802345700002902373700002402402773009602426856008402522852000902606655001202615IND60563663720221119030730.0170713e20160108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056366372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Menéndez, Sonia10aTotal zinc quantification by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and its speciation by size exclusion chromatography–inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in human milk and commercial formulas: Importance in infant nutrition  ap. 246-254.  aThis paper summarises results of zinc content and its speciation in human milk from mothers of preterm and full-term infants at different stages of lactation and from synthetic formula milks. Human milk samples (colostrum, 7th, 14th, and 28th day after delivery) from Spanish and Brazilian mothers of preterm and full-term infants (and also formula milks) were collected. After adequate treatment of the sample, total Zn was determined, while speciation analysis of the Zn was accomplished by size exclusion chromatography coupled online with the ICP-MS.It is observed that total zinc content in human milk decreases continuously during the first month of lactation, both for preterm and full term gestations. All infant formulas analysed for total Zn were within the currently legislated levels. For Zn speciation analysis, there were no differences between preterm and full term human milk samples. Moreover Zn species elute mainly associated with immunoglobulins and citrate in human milk whey. Interestingly the speciation in formula milk whey turned out to be completely different as the observed Zn2+ was bound almost exclusively to low molecular weight ligands (citrate) and only comparatively very low amounts of the metal appeared to be associated with higher mass biomolecules (e.g. proteins).  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abreast milk 3acitrates 3acolostrum 3agel chromatography 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainfant formulas 3ainfant nutrition 3ainfants 3alactation 3aligands 3amilk 3amolecular weight 3amothers 3awhey 3azinc 0aZinc levels and deficiency 0aSpeciation 0aPreterm and full term milk 0aDietary supplements 0aChromatography coupled to mass spectrometry1 aFernández-Sánchez, María L.1 aFernández-Colomer, Belén1 ade la Flor St. Remy, Rafael R.1 aCotallo, Gil Daniel Coto1 aFreire, Aline Soares1 aBraz, Bernardo Ferreira1 aSantelli, Ricardo Erthal1 aSanz-Medel, Alfredo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Jan. 08, v. 1428 p.246-254dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014500163300001600308520065000324592002800974650002501002650001501027650003801042650001001080650001601090653003001106653001301136653003701149653001001186700001501196700002001211700001501231700001501246700001701261773011001278856008301388852000901471655001201480IND60535179220221120164630.0190411e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053517922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPileri, E.10aComparison of the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay and three commercial ELISAs for detection of antibodies against porcine circovirus type 2  ap. 429-432.  aThe aim of this study was to compare and correlate antibody titres against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in porcine sera (n = 1270) obtained by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) with the results of three commercial ELISAs (designated E1, E2 and E3).

The ability of populations to cope with thermal stress may be influenced by conditions experienced by parents, by both genetic changes and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity through epigenetics or maternal provisioning. In organisms with complex life cycles, larval stages are particularly vulnerable to stress. Positive parental carry‐over effects occur if more stressful parental environments yield more tolerant offspring while the opposite pattern leads to negative carry‐over effects. This study evaluated the role of parental effects in determining larval thermal tolerances for the intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus. We tested whether thermal environments across a natural gradient (shoreline elevation) impacted mussel temperature tolerances. Lethal thermal limits were compared for field‐collected adults and their larvae. We observed parental effects across one generation, in which adult mussels exposed to warmer habitats yielded less tolerant offspring. Interestingly, although parental environments influenced offspring tolerances, we found no clear effects of habitat conditions on adult phenotypes (tolerances). We found indicators of trade‐offs in energy investment, with higher reproductive condition and larger egg diameters in low stress environments. These results suggest that parental effects are negative, leading to possible adverse effects of thermal stress on the next generation.  aPublisher supplied data  cInternational Women’s Association Research Scholarship  cEEB Distinguished Scholars Fellowship  cConchologists of America 3aMytilus californianus 3aadults 3aclimate change 3aeggs 3aenergy 3aepigenetics 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3alittoral zone 3amussels 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprogeny 3ashorelines 3atemperature 3athermal stress1 aSorte, Cascade J.

Its usage is mainly due to the phycocolloids content, such as alginates, carrageenans, agar, etc. One of the polysaccharides present in this biomass, and still little explored is cellulose, an important resource with several technological applications, for example: production of nanocellulose, ultralightweight structures, drug delivery, tissue engineering, wound dressings, among others. Thus, we used the Antarctic algae Cystosphaera jacquinottii as raw material for the production of a cellulosic material combining alkaline treatment, bleaching, and freeze-drying. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results revealed that the methodology employed was effective to obtain cellulose. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the material obtained had crystallinity above 70%. Scanning electron microscopy analyses showed a highly porous morphology, consisting of cellulose nanofibers with a diameter about 32 nm.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a99999.002378/2015-09cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul 3aCystosphaera 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aagar 3aalgae 3aalginates 3aalkali treatment 3abiomass 3ableaching 3acarrageenan 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3afreeze drying 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue engineering 3aAntarctic region1 aPereira, Claudio M.

These alterations are often most apparent at species range edges, where changes to conditions previously limiting the species distribution can result in range shifts. In this paper, we review the rapid recent increase in our understanding of the factors limiting the distribution of a species to explore how the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors is likely to significantly alter its range edge behaviour beyond our current predictive capacity. We focus on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), one of the most abundant tree species on the globe. Glacial refugia and colonisation routes after last glacial maximum have strongly influenced the genetic diversity and local adaptation of this species. Over recent decades, increased reproduction and growth has been detected at the northern limit of P. sylvestris as a response to increased temperature, whereas at its southern limit, increased drought stress has resulted in decreased growth, low recruitment, and in some cases a massive mortality of this species. In addition, direct climatic effects on the species are acting together with indirect effects due to altered biotic interactions including outbreaks of insects, pathogens, and parasites, and increased herbivory linked to declining ecosystem productivity. However, whilst predictive studies forecast a gradual decline of the species at the southern range limit and expansion at higher latitudes, models do not commonly include biotic factors, which can significantly modify the response of the species to climatic changes. We conclude by discussing the early detection of imperilled areas and how their natural resistance and resilience to ongoing climatic changes might be increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3arefuge habitats 3aparasites 3areproduction 3agenetic variation 3amodels 3aphenology 3aherbivores 3apathogens 3aclimate change 3atrees 3awater stress 3alatitude 3aPinus sylvestris 3ademography 3aecosystems 3atemperature 3ainsects 3amortality 3abiogeography 0arecruitment 0aadaptation1 aJump, Alistair S.0 tForest ecology and management.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 282 p.10-22dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002100159245007100180300001600251500000900267520128000276592002801556650001401584650001101598650001101609650002201620650002401642650001401666650001101680650001201691650001101703650002101714650000901735650001801744650001501762650000901777650001801786650001301804700001601817700001701833773020701850856009402057852000902151655001202160IND60666461820221122234726.0191028e198710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066646182DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1987.00472425001600040004x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchalscha, E.

Grass samples collected from the same locations were analyzed for total Mo and Pb and three samples were analyzed for total Cu. The objectives were to assess the potential toxicity of Mo and Pb to horses (Equus caballus) and cattle (Bos taurus) and to verify earlier research done in the same general area. Total and extractable Mo and Pb in soils and total Mo and Pb in grasses decreased with increase in distance downwind from the industrial site. The car battery plant ceased operation soon after the 1982 sampling and the extractable Pb in 1983 was much lower than in 1982, indicating a rapid reaction of Pb with soils. The total and extractable Mo in soils were about the same in 1983 as in 1982 even though the Mo industry installed electrostatic precipitators in late 1982 with a claimed 90% reduction of Mo emissions. The Pb, Mo, and Cu contents of grass samples indicated no potential problems of Pb toxicity to livestock, but the Mo concentrations and Cu/Mo ratios showed that cattle in the area would suffer from Mo-induced Cu deficiency (hypocuprosis).  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acattle 3acopper 3acopper deficiency 3adeficiency diseases 3aemissions 3aforage 3agrasses 3ahorses 3aindustrial sites 3alead 3amanufacturing 3amolybdenum 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atoxicity1 aMorales, M.1 aPratt, P.

(Fagaceae) in southern Italy based on the fractal dimension  ap. 79-95.  aThe fractal dimension (FD) is calculated for seven species of the genus Quercus L. in Calabria region (southern Italy), five of which have a marcescent-deciduous and two a sclerophyllous character. The fractal analysis applied to the leaves reveals different FD values for the two groups. The difference between the means and medians is very small in the case of the marcescent-deciduous group and very large when these differences are established between both groups: all this highlights the distance between the two groups in terms of similarity. Specifically, Q. crenata, which is hybridogenic in origin and whose parental species are Q. cerris and Q. suber, is more closely related to Q. cerris than to Q. suber, as also expressed in the molecular analysis. We consider that, in combination with other morphological, physiological and genetic parameters, the fractal dimension is a useful tool for studying similarities amongst species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus 3afractal dimensions 3aleaves 3aplant taxonomy 3aItaly 0adeciduous 0adimension 0afractal analysis 0aphenotype 0asclerophyllous 0aspecies 0aCalabria1 aAna, Cano-Ortiz1 arlos, Piñar Fuentes José C1 auan, Navas-Ureña1 aJosé, Pinto Gomes Carlos1 aRicardo, Quinto-Canas1 aCano Eusebio, 1 aGiovanni, Spampinato0 tPhytoKeys.g2018 Dec. 11, v. 113 p.79-95dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2142x1314-20037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.113.303303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245006900209300001800278520104100296592002801337650000801365650002101373650001801394650001701412650001401429650002401443650001601467650001101483650001201494700002601506700002601532700006001558700001701618773013601635856008001771852000901851655001201860IND60605582120180917000000.0180721e20180429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060558212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b030332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKočišek, Jaroslav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6071-214410aElectron Attachment to Microhydrated Deoxycytidine Monophosphate  ap. 5212-5217.  aDNA constituents are effectively decomposed via dissociative electron attachment (DEA). However, the DEA contribution to radiation damage in living tissues is a subject of ongoing discussion. We address an essential question, how aqueous environment influences the DEA to DNA. In particular, we report experimental fragmentation patterns for DEA to microhydrated 2-deoxycytidine 5-monophosphate (dCMP). Isolated dCMP was previously set as a model to describe mechanisms of DNA-strand breaks induced by secondary electrons and decomposes primarily by dissociation of the C–O phosphoester bond. We show that hydrated molecules decompose via dissociation of the C–N glycosidic bond followed by dissociation of the P–O bond. This significant change of the proposed mechanism can be interpreted by a reactive role of water in the postattachment dynamics. Comparison of the fragmentation with previous macroscopic irradiation studies suggests that the actual contribution of DEA to DNA radiation damage in living tissue is rather small.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemical bonding 3adeoxycytidine 3adissociation 3aelectrons 3aglycosidic linkages 3airradiation 3amodels 3atissues1 aSedmidubská, Barbora1 aIndrajith, Suvasthika1 aFárník, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7106-07191 aFedor, Juraj0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 29, v. 122, no. 20 p.5212-5217dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b030333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245014000210300001400350506007600364520105600440592002801496506003701524650001801561650001301579650002201592650001101614650001301625650001901638650001201657650001201669650002201681650002401703650001701727650001701744653001701761653001301778653002101791653003101812700003201843700002501875773012201900856008302022852000902105655001202114IND60543179020221207045522.0190410e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054317902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2014.12.0032doi7 aPMC42932122pmcid7 a255004282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNouzova, Marcela10aAllatostatin-C reversibly blocks the transport of citrate out of the mitochondria and inhibits juvenile hormone synthesis in mosquitoes  ap. 20-26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAedes aegypti allatostatin-C (AeaAST-C or PISCF-AST) is a strong and fast reversible inhibitor of juvenile hormone III (JH III) synthesis by the corpora allata (CA) of mosquitoes; however, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. AeaAST-C showed no inhibitory activity in the presence of any of the intermediate precursors of JH III indicating that the AeaAST-C target is located before the entry of acetyl-CoA in the pathway. Stimulation experiments using different sources of carbon (glucose, pyruvate, acetate and citrate) suggest that AST-C acts after pyruvate is transformed to citrate in the mitochondria. In vitro inhibition of the citrate mitochondrial carrier (CIC) mimicked the effect of AeaAST-C, and was overridden by addition of citrate or acetate. Our results provide compelling evidence that AeaAST-C inhibits JH III synthesis by blocking the CIC carrier that transports citrate from the mitochondria to the cytosol, obstructing the production of cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA that sustains JH III synthesis in the CA of mosquitoes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aacetates 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3acarbon 3acitrates 3acorpora allata 3acytosol 3aglucose 3ajuvenile hormones 3amechanism of action 3amitochondria 3apyruvic acid 0aAllatostatin 0aMosquito 0aJuvenile hormone 0aMembrane citrate transport1 aRivera-Perez, Crisalejandra1 aNoriega, Fernando G.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Feb., v. 57 p.20-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2014.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014300158500001400301520117600315592002801491650002101519650000901540650001201549650001601561650001501577650001101592650001001603650001901613651001001632700001701642700001401659700001801673700001601691700002101707700001501728700001701743773012901760856007401889852000901963655001201972IND60717508320221121065736.0201112e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071750832DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122135632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shufan 10aInvestigation of Precursors in VLF Subionospheric Signals Related to Strong Earthquakes (M > 7) in Western China and Possible Explanations  aNAL-light  aEarthquakes may disturb the lower ionosphere through various coupling mechanisms during their seismogenic and coseismic periods. The VLF signal radiated from ground-based transmitters is affected when it passes near the disturbed region above the seismogenic area, and this anomaly can be recorded by ground-based VLF receivers. In this paper, the seismic anomalies before two strong earthquakes (M > 7) that occurred in western China were detected using the ground-based observation of VLF signal; the possible reasons for the anomalies were discussed using full wave simulation. The amplitude of the VLF signals observed by the link between NOV, KHA transmitter, and VLF receivers at Ya’an and Tonghai show obvious anomaly by nighttime fluctuation analysis. The simulated results demonstrate that the anomalies could have been induced by ascending/descending of the bottom height of the ionosphere, caused by depletion/increase in D region electron density. The simulated result also illustrates that terminator time shift could have been induced by descending of the bottom boundary of the ionosphere, which is due to modal interference between different wave modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth ionosphere 3aarea 3adensity 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aheight 3apaper 3aremote sensing 3aChina1 aShen, Simon,1 aLiao, Li 1 aZhima, Zeren 1 aZhou, Chen 1 aWang, Zhuangkai 1 aCui, Jing 1 aLu, Hengxin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 12, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122135633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245005500166300001800221520093800239592002801177650001801205650001701223650001101240650001301251650001401264650002001278653002201298653002501320653001801345653001401363653001301377653001301390700002001403700002001423700001801443700002501461700002001486773012801506856008301634852000901717655001201726IND60752583420221120174910.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075258342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Roman10aMOSGA 2: Comparative genomics and validation tools  ap. 5504-5509.  aDue to the highly growing number of available genomic information, the need for accessible and easy-to-use analysis tools is increasing.

The residence time of groundwater in a fluviokarst basin, Bonne Femme Creek drainage basin, was determined from the coefficient of variation of the hardness of the water. The residence time of groundwater that was from the conduit-flow source was 3–4 days. This was an insufficient period for thermal or chemical equilibrium to be achieved, as indicated by oberved seasonal cycles in the temperature (13 ± 2°C) and the coefficient of variation of the hardness (typically 18 percent) of the water. The residence time of groundwater that was derived from internally drained sources was nearly 8 days. The internally drained water, having a longer period of contact with surrounding bedrock, more closely approached thermal and chemical equilibrium. A dampened seasonal cycle in the temperature (13 ± 0.6°C) and a lower coefficient of variation of the hardness (typically 12 percent) of the water were observed for the internally drained water. The findings of this study support the conceptual model of groundwater baseflow through a fluviokarst basin that is governed by a mixture of conduit-flow and diffuse-flow end members.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3achemical equilibrium 3agroundwater 3ahardness 3ahydrologic models 3asprings (water) 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater hardness 3awatersheds 3aMissouri0 tHydrogeology journal.g1997 Mar., v. 5, no. 3 p.89-96dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s1004000501243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245019400171300001600365520112600381592002801507653002701535653002201562653002001584653002601604653002701630653003101657653003501688653002301723653003701746653002601783700002001809700001501829700001601844700001601860700001301876700001501889773011801904856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60602591520221119232122.0180711e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060259152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2015.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSonnenrein, G.10aCopolymer-bound phase change materials for household refrigerating appliances: experimental investigation of power consumption, temperature distribution and demand side management potential  ap. 166-173.  aThis study presents the results of an experimental investigation of the influence of latent thermal heat storage elements on the power consumption as well as the temperature distribution of commercial household refrigerators. Two evaporator types and a standard wire-and-tube condenser are equipped with copolymer-bound phase change materials (PCM) and the performance is determined under standard conditions. The results show that refrigerating appliances equipped with PCM can be optimized through modifications of the control strategy to achieve different targets: (a) Power consumption can be significantly reduced by increasing the evaporator and decreasing the condenser temperature. (b) Temperature fluctuations in the refrigerator's fresh-food compartment during the cooling cycle can be reduced from 4 °C to 0.5 °C. (c) The cooling cycle duration can be tripled without compromising the fresh-food compartment conditions. The latter may help to meet the growing demand for balancing power consumption to stabilize the power grid, e.g. if the share of highly fluctuating, sustainable energy supply is large.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHousehold refrigerator 0aPower consumption 0aThermal storage 0aPhase change material 0aDemand side management 0aRéfrigérateur domestique 0aConsommation d’électricité 0aStockage thermique 0aMatériau à changement de phase 0aGestion de la demande1 aBaumhögger, E.1 aElsner, A.1 aFieback, K.1 aMorbach, A.1 aPaul, A.1 aVrabec, J.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Dec., v. 60 p.166-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2015.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001400281520144200295592002801737650003401765650002301799650002001822650001401842650002301856650001901879650002101898650001001919650002101929650001101950650001501961650005001976650001402026650001502040653003302055653000902088653003702097653001902134700005802153700002002211700001702231773010902248856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60541961320221123000717.0190401e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054196132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shan-Han10aDeveloping a QSAR model for hepatotoxicity screening of the active compounds in traditional Chinese medicines  ap. 71-77.  aThe perception that natural substances are deemed safe has made traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) popular in the treatment and prevention of disease globally. However, such an assumption is often misleading owing to a lack of scientific validation. To assess the safety of TCM, in silico screening provides major advantages over the classical laboratory approaches in terms of resource- and time-saving and full reproducibility. To screen the hepatotoxicity of the active compounds of TCMs, a quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model was firstly established by utilizing drugs from the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base. These drugs were annotated with drug-induced liver injury information obtained from clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. The performance of the model after nested 10-fold cross-validation was 79.1%, 91.2%, 53.8% for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. The external validation of 91 well-known ingredients of common herbal medicines yielded a high accuracy (87%). After screening the TCM Database@Taiwan, the world's largest TCM database, a total of 6853 (74.8%) ingredients were predicted to have hepatotoxic potential. The one-hundred chemical ingredients predicted to have the highest hepatotoxic potential by our model were further verified by published literatures. Our study indicated that this model can serve as a complementary tool to evaluate the safety of TCM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aactive ingredients 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3adisease prevention 3ahepatotoxicity 3aherbal medicines 3aliver 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3ascreening 3atoxicology 0aTraditional Chinese medicine 0aQSAR 0aDrug-induced liver injury (DILI) 0aHepatotoxicity1 aTung, Chun-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3011-84401 aFülöp, Ferenc1 aLi, Jih-Heng0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2015 Apr., v. 78 p.71-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245016700164300001800331520201800349592002802367650001102395650001102406650001002417650001902427650001702446650001102463650002302474650002202497650001702519650002702536700005602563773013502619856008002754852000902834655001202843IND60605582420221120215131.0180721e20180531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060558242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b031192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zijiang10aSingle-Molecule Spectroscopy Study of Crowding-Induced Protein Spontaneous Denature and Crowding-Perturbed Unfolding–Folding Conformational Fluctuation Dynamics  ap. 6724-6732.  aThe effects of molecular crowding on protein folding–unfolding processes are of importance for understanding protein function and structure dynamics in living cells. The enhancement of protein stability as a result of reduced entropic effect in the presence of molecular crowding is well understood both experimentally and theoretically. However, because of the complexity and interplay between various interactions existing in an equally favored environment of protein folding and unfolding conformational dynamics, such a simple reduced entropic enhancement model does not suffice to describe protein folding conformational dynamics under a protein crowding condition. In this paper, we report our observation on that single protein molecules spontaneously denature into unfolded proteins and folding–unfolding fluctuations in solution of crowding reagent Ficoll 70. We have identified that such protein dynamics involves a combined mechanism of polymer–polymer interaction, entropic effects, and protein solvation dynamics. We characterize the protein folding–unfolding dynamics by using single-molecule spectroscopy to obtain detailed molecular dynamic scale information on the protein folding–unfolding conformational fluctuation dynamics. Our findings suggest that the complex unfolding dynamic processes are spontaneous denature of single protein molecules induced by molecular crowding effect which has been elusive for analysis in ensemble-averaged measurements. Furthermore, the energy needed for the spontaneous unfolding is at the biological accessible force fluctuation level, which suggests a strong implication of significant human health relevance and importance. The new knowledge of the inhomogeneous protein unfolding processes can serve as a step forward to a mechanistic understanding of human diseases associated with molecular crowding, protein aggregates, fibril formation, as well as gene translational regulation processes typically under a molecular crowded local environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aficoll 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman health 3amodels 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein unfolding 3aspectroscopy 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLu, H.

Vertebrates like birds typically experience urban alterations to diet, habitat availability, and levels of predation or competition, but may also be exposed to greater or more pathogenic communities of microbes. Birds have been popular subjects of urban ecological research but, to our knowledge, no study has assessed how urban conditions influence the microbial communities on bird plumage. Birds carry a large variety of microorganisms on their plumage and some of them have the capacity to degrade feather keratin and alter plumage integrity. To limit the negative effects of these feather-degrading bacteria, birds coat their feathers with preen gland secretions containing antibacterial substances. Here we examined urban-rural variation in feather microbial abundance and preen gland size in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus). We found that, although urban and rural finches carry similar total-cultivable microbial loads on their plumage, the abundance of feather-degrading bacteria was on average three times higher on the plumage of urban birds. We also found an increase in preen gland size along the gradient of urbanization, suggesting that urban birds may coat their feathers with more preen oil to limit the growth or activity of feather-degrading microbes. Given that greater investment in preening is traded-off against other immunological defenses and that feather-degrading bacteria can alter key processes like thermoregulation, aerodynamics, and coloration, our findings highlight the importance of plumage microbes and microbial defenses on the ecology of urban birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpodacus mexicanus 3aadverse effects 3aaerodynamics 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acolor 3afeathers 3ahabitats 3akeratin 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial load 3aoils 3apredation 3apreening 3athermoregulation 3aurbanization 3auropygial gland 0aFeather microbes 0aHaemorhous mexicanus 0aUropygial gland 0aUrbanization1 aStikeleather, Ryan1 aMcKenna, Jennifer1 aHutton, Pierce1 aMcGraw, Kevin J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Feb. 15, v. 580 p.425-429dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.2243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013500156300001600291500001400307520182300321592002802144650001102172650001402183650001102197650001602208650001802224650001502242650001002257650001202267650001602279650001302295650001302308653001102321653001702332653002502349653002102374700001302395700001502408700001902423700001802442773010902460856007302569852000902642655001202651IND60726863320221118043810.0210209e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072686332DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew3702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokale, A.O.10aEffects of coccidiosis vaccination administered by in ovo injection on the hatchability and hatching chick quality of broilers , ,  ap. 541-547.  aNAL-light  aEffects of the in ovo injection of a commercial coccidiosis vaccine on the hatchability and hatching chick quality variables of Ross × Ross 708 broilers were examined. Four treatment (TRT) groups were represented on each of 7 replicate tray levels of a single-stage incubator (28 TRT-replicate groups). Each TRT-replicate contained 63 eggs (1,764 total eggs). On d 18.5 of incubation, eggs were subjected to one of 4 TRT using a commercial multi-egg injector. Three control groups (non-injected, dry-punch, and diluent-injected) and one TRT group (injected with diluent containing Inovocox EM1 vaccine) were used. On d 18.5 of incubation, the site of injection and stage of embryo development were determined. On d 21.5 of incubation (d zero post hatch), hatchability of injected eggs (HI), chick BW, and yolk sac, intestine, and liver weights were determined. On d zero post hatch, 20 chicks from each of the 28 TRT-replicate groups (560 total birds) were placed in corresponding isolated wire-floored battery cages. On a daily basis, from d zero to 14 post hatch, pooled fecal samples from each individual replicate cage were collected for oocyst output determination. There was no significant difference among TRT for HI or chick BW on d 21.5 of incubation. In the non-injected control and vaccine-treated groups, mean HI was 93.1 and 89.4%, respectively, and chick BW were 43.4 and 43.8 g, respectively. The mean embryonic stage score was 2.09, and 84.8 and 15.3% of in ovo injections were in the amnion and embryo, respectively. Oocyst shedding began 4 d post hatch (d 6 post injection), and reached a peak at d 7 post hatch (d 10 post injection). It was concluded that the in ovo injection of Inovocox EM1 vaccine did not have a significant detrimental effect on broiler embryogenesis or hatching chick quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamnion 3abatteries 3achicks 3acoccidiosis 3aembryogenesis 3aintestines 3aliver 3aoocysts 3avaccination 3avaccines 3ayolk sac 0aembryo 0ahatchability 0aInovocox EM1 vaccine 0ain ovo injection1 aZhai, W.1 aPote, L.M.1 aWilliams, C.J.1 aPeebles, E.D.0 tPoultry science.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 96, no. 3 p.541-547dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew3703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013200163300001400295520119400309592002801503650001901531650001801550650000901568650002301577650001601600650001301616650001601629650001001645650002001655650001001675650000901685650001701694650001501711650002401726653001401750653000801764653002201772653002401794653001001818653000901828700002301837700002001860700001801880700001601898700001801914700001701932700001701949700002001966773010901986856008202095852000902177655001202186IND60541961420221123000611.0190401e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054196142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamura, Kei10aInvolvement of constitutive androstane receptor in liver hypertrophy and liver tumor development induced by triazole fungicides  ap. 86-95.  aWe clarified the involvement of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in triazole-induced liver hypertrophy and tumorigenesis using CAR-knockout (CARKO) mice. Seven-week-old male CARKO and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with 200 ppm cyproconazole (Cypro), 1500 ppm tebuconazole (Teb), or 200 ppm fluconazole (Flu) in the diet for 27 weeks after initiation by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). At weeks 4 (without DEN) and 13 (with DEN), WT mice in all treatment groups and CARKO mice in Teb group revealed liver hypertrophy with mainly Cyp2b10 and following Cyp3a11 inductions in the liver. Teb also induced Cyp4a10 in both genotypes. Cypro induced slight and duration-dependent liver hypertrophy in CARKO mice. At week 27, Cypro and Teb significantly increased eosinophilic altered foci and/or adenomas in WT mice. These proliferating lesions were clearly reduced in CARKO mice administered both compounds. The eosinophilic adenomas caused by Flu decreased in CARKO mice. The present study indicates that CAR is the main mediator of liver hypertrophy induced by Cypro and Flu, but not Teb. In contrast, CAR played a crucial role in liver tumor development induced by all three triazoles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3acyproconazole 3adiet 3adiethylnitrosamine 3afluconazole 3agenotype 3ahypertrophy 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3amales 3amice 3atebuconazole 3atoxicology 3atriazole fungicides 0aTriazoles 0aCAR 0aLiver hypertrophy 0aLiver tumorigenesis 0aCyp2b 0aMice1 aChari Chari Chari,1 aTakahashi, Miwa1 aMatsuo, Saori1 aIrie, Kaoru1 aKodama, Yukio1 aGamo, Toshie1 aOzawa, Shogo1 aYoshida, Midori0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2015 Apr., v. 78 p.86-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009800161500001400259520166300273592002801936650001301964650001301977650001101990650002002001650001902021650001602040650001502056650001102071650001902082650001502101650001902116650001302135650001202148651001002160700002002170700002302190700002002213700002202233773012902255856007402384852000902458655001202467IND60717508620221121065518.0201112e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071750862DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122135662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevoto, Stefano 10aAdvantages of Using UAV Digital Photogrammetry in the Study of Slow-Moving Coastal Landslides  aNAL-light  aThe aim of this study is to demonstrate the advantages of using micro drones in the study of large slow-moving landslides, which are widespread along the northwestern coast of Malta. In particular, attention was given to the inventory and analysis of gravity-induced joints and megaclast deposits at four study sites selected due to the presence of remarkable examples of lateral spreads evolving into block slides. The research was carried out by means of Google Earth (GE) image analysis and uncrewed aerial vehicle digital photogrammetry (UAV-DP). UAV-DP outputs enabled the identification and characterization of tens of persistent joints (locally exceeding 150 m) and permitted the size categorization of thousands of blocks. With reference to gravity-induced joints, a favorable agreement was found between existing datasets (mainly based on the integration of GE analysis and field survey) and UAV-DP outputs in terms of the identification of joints and their persistence. Conversely, the use of the UAV-DP technique showed significant advantages in terms of joint aperture determination (even exceeding 1 m) and distribution setting. Regarding the extensive megaclast deposits, UAV-DP enabled the identification of 8943 individuals which, compared with the 5059 individuals identified by GE analysis, showed an increase in the total population of 76%. This is related to the high accuracy of DP-derived orthomosaics and 3D models, which are particularly useful for identifying detached blocks. The inexpensive technique used in this research highlights its potential for being extended to other rocky coastal areas affected by slow-moving landslides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aaccuracy 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3ainventories 3alandslides 3amodels 3aphotogrammetry 3apopulation 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asurveys 3aMalta1 aMacovaz, Vanja 1 aMantovani, Matteo 1 aSoldati, Mauro 1 aFurlani, Stefano 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 12, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122135663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245018200163300001600345520135500361592002801716650000801744650001501752650001901767650001301786650002101799650002801820650001901848650001301867650001901880650001201899650001101911650001901922650001401941650003101955650002101986650001302007650001702020650003402037653004502071653003102116653004602147653002002193653003002213700001702243700001802260700001502278700001102293700001602304700001202320700001702332773011202349856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60615730820221117184826.0210114e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.09.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yue10aAptamer-DNA concatamer-quantum dots based electrochemical biosensing strategy for green and ultrasensitive detection of tumor cells via mercury-free anodic stripping voltammetry  ap. 261-268.  aA electrochemical biosensing strategy was developed for green and ultrasensitive detection of tumor cells by combining aptamer-DNA concatamer-CdTe quantum dots (QDs) signal amplification probe with mercury-free anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). First, aptamer-DNA concatamer- CdTe QDs probes were designed by DNA hybridization and covalent assembling, which contained specific recognition of aptamer and signal amplification incorporating the DNA concatamer with QDs. Meanwhile, the capture electrode, glassy carbon electrode (GCE)/Graphene oxide (GO)/Polyaniline (PANI) / Glutaraldehyde (GA) / concanavalin A (Con A) was fabricated by a layer-by-layer assembling technique. K562 cells, as model cancer cells were detected to demonstrate the feasibility of this sensing strategy. Then, novel composite, graphene (GR)- Poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA)/L-Cysteine (L- Cys), was explored in ASV which replaced mercury electrodes using for determination of tumor cells. The proposed electrochemical biosensor showed high sensitivity with the detection limit of 60 cells mL⁻¹. More importantly, this novel design of signal amplification probes and the exploration of new composites in mercury-free ASV analysis would provide a promising method for ultrasensitive biosensor preparation and green electrochemical detection of tumor cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3aconcanavalin A 3acysteine 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3aglutaraldehyde 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3amercury 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 0aAptamer-DNA concatemer-CdTe Quantum dots 0aGR- PDDA/L- Cys composites 0aMercury-free anodic stripping voltammetry 0aTumor detection 0aElectrochemical biosensor1 aWang, Xiaoyu1 aHe, Shengquan1 aGao, Zehua1 aDi, Ya1 aLu, Kunling1 aLi, Kun1 aWang, Jidong0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.261-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.09.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014400166300001400310500001900324520152900343592002801872650001501900650002001915650001701935650002501952650003301977650001102010650001402021651001002035653001402045653003202059653002402091700001802115700001902133700001702152773009602169856008402265852000902349655001202358IND60698739520221118053507.0210531e20181220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069873952DNAL7 a10.3897/phytokeys.114.299142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeng, La-Mei10aRadiation of members of the Soroseris hookeriana complex (Asteraceae) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and their proposed taxonomic treatment  ap. 11-25.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe existence of intermediate types is a major obstacle that can hinder the circumscription of species. Elucidating the mechanism responsible for intermediate types is essential for achieving a reasonable taxonomical treatment. In this study, we explored the evolutionary history and taxonomic treatment of the Soroseris hookeriana (C.B.Clarke) Stebbins complex, which comprises six named taxa that may be taxonomically distinct and are all native to the Qingha-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We made an investigation across the distribution range of Soroseris Stebbins and sampled 27 populations, mostly from the complex. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and two chloroplast loci were sequenced and analysed using the neighbour-joining and Bayesian inference methods. The resulting phylogenies show no well supported inconsistence in topologies, in line with the lack of incongruence detected by the length difference test. However, all the trees were largely unresolved within S. hookeriana complex, irrespective of the optimality criterion employed. We interpret these results as an experience of radiation, which is a common process for native genera on the QTP. Thus, we suggest that all of the morphotypes might be different forms, generated by incipient speciation due to recent explosive differentiation, possibly triggered by the drastic environmental changes of the QTP. Given their evolutionary history, we propose a pragmatic method for treating all of these species as subspecies with a total of four new combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aBayesian theory 3achloroplasts 3aincipient speciation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amorphs 3aphylogeny 3aChina 0aRadiation 0aSoroserishookeriana complex 0ataxonomic treatment1 aZheng, Yu-Lin1 aZhao, Yong-Bao1 aWang, Yu-Jin0 tPhytoKeys.g2018 Dec. 20, v. 114 p.11-25dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2142x1314-20037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.114.299143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012500160520105300285592002801338650001901366650002301385650002201408650001401430650001901444650002301463650001701486650001301503650002201516650001901538650001401557650001101571653002701582653002701609653001801636653002201654653001601676653000801692653001301700653001101713653001101724700001801735700001801753700002801771773011201799856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60679162420221119003411.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067916242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2019.1033202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fei10aLmCBP1, a secreted chitin-binding protein, is required for the pathogenicity of Leptosphaeria maculans on Brassica napus  aLeptosphaeria maculans is the causal agent of blackleg disease on Brassica napus. Determining the underlying functions of genes required for pathogenesis is essential for understanding the infection process. A chitin-binding protein (LmCBP1) was discovered as a pathogenicity factor for the infection of B. napus by L. maculans through gene knockout using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Chitin-binding activity was demonstrated through a chitin-protein binding assay. A secreted signal peptide was detected using a yeast secreted-signal peptide trap assay. An increased expression level during the infection stage was also observed, suggesting that LmCBP1 is a secreted protein. The knockout mutants showed decreased infection on B. napus, with reduced pathogenicity on ten cultivars with/without diverse R genes. The mutants were more sensitive to H₂O₂ compared to wild type L. maculans isolate JN3. This study provides evidence of the virulence of a novel chitin-binding protein LmCBP1 on B. napus through mutants created via the CRISPR-Cas9 system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aPlenodomus lingam 3acultivars 3agene targeting 3amicrobial genetics 3apathogenesis 3apeptides 3aprotein secretion 3asignal peptide 3avirulence 3ayeasts 0aChitin binding protein 0aLeptosphaeria maculans 0aPathogenicity 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aROS 0aBlackleg 0aCanola 0aLmCBP11 aSelin, Carrie1 aZou, Zhongwei1 aDilantha Fernando, W.G.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2020 Mar., v. 136 p.103320-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2019.1033203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03916naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245020700170300001600377520222300393592002802616650001602644650001002660650002402670650002502694650001502719650002602734650001902760650001702779650001002796650003502806650001402841650001602855650001502871650000902886650002602895650002202921650001602943650001502959650001902974650001502993650002003008650001503028650001803043650001403061650002703075650001603102650002003118700002003138773011403158856008103272852000903353655001203362IND60548102220221120092906.0160903e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054810222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-003-2412-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZwiener, Christian10aLC-MS analysis in the aquatic environment and in water treatment technology – a critical review : Part II: Applications for emerging contaminants and related pollutants, microorganisms and humic acids  ap. 862-874.  aEnvironmental contaminants of recent concern are pharmaceuticals, estrogens and other endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) such as degradation products of surfactants, algal and cyanobacterial toxins, disinfection by-products (DBPs) and metalloids. In addition, pesticides (especially their transformation products), microorganisms, and humic substances (HS), in their function as vehicles for contaminants and as precursors for by-products in water treatment, traditionally play an important role. The present status of the application of LC-MS techniques for these water constituents are discussed and examples of application are given. Solid-phase extraction with various non-selective materials in combination with liquid chromatography (LC) on reversed-phase columns have been the most widely used methods for sample preconcentration and separation for different compound classes like pesticides, pharmaceuticals or estrogens. Electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure ionization (APCI) are the most frequently used ionization techniques for polar and ionic compounds, as well as for less polar non-ionic ones. The facilities of LC-MS have been successfully demonstrated for different compound classes. Polar compounds from pharmaceuticals used as betablockers, iodinated X-ray contrast media, or estrogens have been determined without derivatization down to ultratrace concentrations. LC-MS can be viewed as a prerequisite for the determination of algal and cyanobacterial toxins and the homologues and oligomers of alkylphenol ethoxylates and their metabolites. Tandem mass spectrometric techniques and the use of diagnostic ions reveal their usefulness for compound-class specific screening and unknown identification, and are also valid for the analysis of pesticides and especially for their transformation products. Structural information has been gained by the application of LC-MS methods to organometallic species. New insights into the structural variety of humic substances have been made possible by FT-ICR-MS due to its ultrahigh mass resolution. Finally, exciting possibilities for rapid detection and identification of microorganisms have been made possible by MALDI and LC-MS methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalgae 3aaquatic environment 3aatmospheric pressure 3abyproducts 3acyanobacterial toxins 3aderivatization 3adisinfection 3adrugs 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestrogens 3ahumic acids 3aionization 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametalloids 3amicroorganisms 3apesticides 3apolar compounds 3apollutants 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3asolid phase extraction 3asurfactants 3awater treatment1 aFrimmel, F.

Crosslinking was achieved by UV irradiation (15min) with 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as photoinitiator (0.6 wt%). The optimum PIM composition contained PVDF-HFP and PEG-DMA in a mass ratio of 5:5 and 40wt% Aliquat 336. Thiocyanate extraction and transport studies using this PIM demonstrated its potential for the clean-up of this anion from process and tailings waters in the gold mining industry which is of significant technological and environmental importance. The newly developed PIM exhibited excellent stability in five consecutive thiocyanate transport experiments with very little change in its permeability. In addition, this PIM produced an initial flux value of 2.18×10⁻⁵molm⁻² s⁻¹ which is more than an order of magnitude higher than those of the best performing PIMs using traditional base polymers such as poly(vinyl chloride) and cellulose triacetate and close to an order of magnitude higher than a recently developed PVDF-HFP based PIM. The results obtained in this study indicate that incorporating a semi-interpenetrating crosslinked polymer network of PEG-DMA into a PVDF-HFP-based PIM leads to a significant increase in both membrane stability and permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3agold 3amine tailings 3amining 3apermeability 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aultraviolet radiation 0aPolymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) 0aCrosslinking, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) 0aPoly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate 0aAliquat 3361 aTruong, Yen B.1 aCattrall, Robert W.1 aKyratzis, Ilias L.1 aKolev, Spas D.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 May 01, v. 529 p.55-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300001800243520097400261592002801235650001501263650001401278650001701292700001501309700001301324700001601337700001901353773012901372856007501501852000901576655001201585IND60789350620221119125143.0220820e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078935062DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ay00625a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaowen10aAdvances in precise single-cell capture for analysis and biological applications  ap. 3047-3063.  aCells are the basic structural and functional units of living organisms. However, conventional cell analysis only averages millions of cell populations, and some important information is lost. It is essential to quantitatively characterize the physiology and pathology of single-cell activities. Precise single-cell capture is an extremely challenging task during cell sample preparation. In this review, we summarize the category of technologies to capture single cells precisely with a focus on the latest development in the last five years. Each technology has its own set of benefits and specific challenges, which provide opportunities for researchers in different fields. Accordingly, we introduce the applications of captured single cells in cancer diagnosis, analysis of metabolism and secretion, and disease treatment. Finally, some perspectives are provided on the current development trends, future research directions, and challenges of single-cell capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolism 3asecretion 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Zhen1 aYuzhang,1 aGe, Zhixing1 aYang, Wenguang0 tAnalytical methods.g2022 Aug. 18, v. 14, no. 32 p.3047-3063dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ay00625a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245007300160300001800233520174500251592002801996650001902024650001902043650001202062650002802074650001102102650002302113650001802136650001302154650001902167700002102186700001802207700006002225700001502285700006202300700005902362700002002421700005702441773013502498856008002633852000902713655001202722IND60605582820221120224702.0180721e20180514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060558282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b031652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTa, An T.10aSolvation Dynamics of HEHEHP Ligand at the Liquid–Liquid Interface  ap. 5999-6006.  aActinide–lanthanide separation (ALSEP) has been a topic of interest in recent years as it has been shown to selectively extract problematic metals from spent nuclear fuel. However, the process suffers from slow kinetics, prohibiting it from being applied to nuclear facilities. In an effort to improve the process, many fundamental studies have been performed, but the majority have only focused on the thermodynamics of separation. Therefore, to understand the mechanism behind the ALSEP process, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were utilized to obtain the dynamics and solvation characteristics for an organic extractant, 2-ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (HEHEHP). Simulations were conducted with both pure and biphasic solvent systems to evaluate the complex solvent interactions within the ALSEP extraction method. The MD simulations revealed solvation and dynamical behaviors that are consistent with the experimentally observed chemical properties of HEHEHP for the pure solvent systems (e.g., hydrophobic/hydrophilic behaviors of the polar head group and alkyl chains and dimer formation between the ligands within an organic solvent). When present in a biphasic solvent system, interfacial behaviors of the ligand revealed that, at low concentrations, the alkyl side chains of HEHEHP were parallel to the interfacial plane. Upon increasing the concentration to 0.75 M, tendency for the parallel orientation decreased and a more perpendicular-like orientation was observed. Analysis of ligand solvation energies in different solvents through the thermodynamic integration method demonstrated favorability toward n-dodecane and biphasic solvents, which is in agreement with the previous experimental findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aligands 3aliquid-liquid interface 3ametals 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear fuels 3asolvents 3athermodynamics1 aHegde, Govind A.1 aEtz, Brian D.1 aBaldwin, Anna G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5114-48701 aYang, Yuan1 aShafer, Jenifer C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9702-15341 aJensen, Mark P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4494-66931 aMaupin, C.

These enzymes are largely responsible for the digestion of proteins. Three primary processes regulate the activity of these peptidases: secretion, precursor (zymogen) activation and substrate-binding site recognition. Here, we present a detailed phylogenetic analysis of trypsins and chymotrypsins in three orders of holometabolous insects and reveal divergent characteristics of Lepidoptera enzymes in comparison with those of Coleoptera and Diptera. In particular, trypsin subsite S1 was more hydrophilic in Lepidoptera than in Coleoptera and Diptera, whereas subsites S2–S4 were more hydrophobic, suggesting different substrate preferences. Furthermore, Lepidoptera displayed a lineage-specific trypsin group belonging only to the Noctuidae family. Evidence for facilitated trypsin auto-activation events were also observed in all the insect orders studied, with the characteristic zymogen activation motif complementary to the trypsin active site. In contrast, insect chymotrypsins did not seem to have a peculiar evolutionary history with respect to their mammal counterparts. Overall, our findings suggest that the need for fast digestion allowed holometabolous insects to evolve divergent groups of peptidases with high auto-activation rates, and highlight that the evolution of trypsins led to a most diverse group of enzymes in Lepidoptera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aNoctuidae 3aactive sites 3adigestion 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ainsects 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3asecretion 3atrypsin 0aTrypsin 0aChymotrypsin 0aDiptera 0aColeoptera 0aLepidoptera 0aSerine peptidase1 aVia, Allegra1 aBrandão, Marcelo M.1 aTramontano, Anna1 aSilva-Filho, Marcio C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2129-03880 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2015 Mar., v. 58 p.1-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2014.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245014700169300001800316520130400334592002801638650001301666650001301679650001301692650001301705650001501718650001801733650004401751650001001795650001101805650001201816653002501828653001301853653003001866653002201896653001501918700002201933700006201955773013902017856007802156852000902234655001202243IND60628798620190612000000.0190131e20190108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062879862DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b179072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, Jennifer L.10aAdaptive Shape Ripening and Interparticle Bridging of l-Arginine-Stabilized Silica Nanoparticles during Evaporative Colloidal Crystal Assembly  ap. 4568-4577.  aDuring evaporative self-assembly of colloidal crystal films, spherical l-arginine-stabilized silica colloids adapt to different close-packed geometries by faceting and forming bridge connections with their nearest neighbors. We systematically studied the morphological changes of 37 and 138 nm diameter colloids during evaporative assembly and compared them to 65 nm Stöber silica colloids prepared without l-arginine. Colloidal crystal films were grown from particles that had been dialyzed against water or l-arginine, and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and/or l-arginine were added to solutions during colloidal film growth. Solid-state ²⁹Si NMR spectra showed the presence of l-arginine and incompletely condensed silica in colloids grown from silica seeds in l-arginine solutions. These colloids were especially susceptible to chemical ripening during the colloidal assembly process, adopting faceted shapes that reflected the packing symmetry of the colloidal crystal films. The addition of l-arginine and TEOS accelerated these shape changes by catalyzing the hydrolysis and olation of silica and by adding a source of silica to the solution, respectively. This chemistry provides a route to single-component and binary colloidal crystals composed of nonspherical silica building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3acolloids 3acrystals 3ageometry 3ahydrolysis 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aseeds 3asilica 3asilicon 0asilica nanoparticles 0acolloids 0aevaporative self-assembly 0acolloidal crystal 0al-arginine1 aTran, Ngoc-Lan L.1 aMallouk, Thomas E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4599-42080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 11, no. 4 p.4568-4577dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b179073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009800167300001600265520149300281592002801774596007001802596008401872596008401956596006902040650002102109650001202130650002402142650001402166650001102180650002302191650002002214650001702234650001902251650001602270650001602286700002302302700001702325700001702342700001402359700001402373700001702387700001802404773010902422856008202531852000902613655001202622IND60681363320221118193539.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068136332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02807-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yushuang10aSynthesizing green carbon dots with exceptionally high yield from biomass hydrothermal carbon  ap. 415-428.  aCarbon dots (CDs), with high photostability, tunable excitation and emission wavelength, excellent biocompatibility, and environmental friendliness, attract great interest because of their promising applications in various fields. The synthesis of CDs from renewable biomass is especially attractive due to its sustainable and cost-efficient feature. However, one of the major problems for this route is the low yield of CDs. To overcome this issue, we propose a facile, universal, and highly effective synthesis method to prepare fluorescent CDs from various biomass hydrothermal carbons (HTCs). As compared with the current methods for synthesizing biomass derived CDs, our approach offers ultrahigh yield (42.5% based on the weight of biomass and 99.0% based on the weight of HTC) that is much higher than those obtained from other methods. The physiochemical properties of the as-prepared CDs can be tuned by reaction temperature. Furthermore, the PL quantum yield is high up to 16.6%, and is correlated with the surface chemical groups and conjugated π-domains of the carbon core in CDs. The fluorescence of CDs is effectively and selectively quenched by Cu²⁺, which enables CDs applying as fluorescent Cu²⁺ nanoprobe with a linear range of 0–30 μmol L⁻¹ and a detection limit of 85 nmol L⁻¹. Due to simple operation, mild condition, and low cost of the process, this method have a great potential in the large-scale synthesis and application of CDs from biomass.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019PY13cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2017A030306029cGuangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar  a2016A030306027cGuangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar  a2016A030313487cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 3abiocompatibility 3abiomass 3acarbon quantum dots 3acellulose 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aphotostability 3atemperature 3awavelengths1 aJing, Shuangshuang1 aPeng, Xinwen1 aChen, Zehong1 aHu, Yijie1 aZhuo, Hao1 aSun, Runcang1 aZhong, Linxin0 tCellulose.g2020 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.415-428dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02807-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04063naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013300157300001600290500001500306520217300321592002802494650002102522650001802543650002502561650001602586650001202602650001302614650002102627650002002648650001002668650001802678650001202696650002302708650002902731650001302760650001802773650002002791650001202811650002002823650001602843650002102859650002302880650001002903650003002913650001202943650002002955650001002975650001302985650001102998650001203009650001003021650001403031650001003045650001403055653001303069653001303082653001603095653002203111653002503133700001603158773010903174856007303283852000903356655001203365IND60726863720221118043832.0210209e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072686372DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pew2582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wen-Chao10aEffects of dietary xylanase supplementation on performance and functional digestive parameters in broilers fed wheat-based diets  ap. 566-573.  agolden set  aThis experiment was conducted to evaluate dietary xylanase supplementation in broilers wheat-based diets on performance and functional digestive parameters including ileal digesta viscosity, apparent ileal digestibility, intestinal morphology and microflora, digestive enzyme activities, and excreta odor content. A total of 600 1-day-old Ross 308 male broilers with an initial average BW of 45 ± 0.6 g were randomly allotted into 4 treatments with 10 replicate pens per treatment and 15 broilers in each pen for 35 d. The 4 dietary treatments were wheat-based diets and supplemented with 0, 1,875, 3,750, and 5,625 XU/kg xylanase. Xylanase supplementation improved (linear, P < 0.05) the body weight gain and decreased (linear, P < 0.05) the feed conversion ratio during d 1 to 18 and for the duration of the experiment. Dietary supplementation of xylanase led to a decrease (linear, P < 0.01) in ileal digesta viscosity. The apparent ileal digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), gross energy, and most amino acids (with the exception of Ile, Phe, Asp, Glu, and Pro) were increased (linear, P < 0.05) by xylanase supplementation. Increasing the dietary xylanase levels improved (linear, P < 0.05) the villus height and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. In addition, inclusion of xylanase increased (linear, P < 0.05) the Lactobacillus numbers in the ileum and cecum, while decreased the ileal E. coli counts (linear, P < 0.01) and cecal E. coli populations (linear, P < 0.01; quadratic, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in trypsin, amylase, and protease activities of small intestine among dietary treatments. Furthermore, xylanase supplementation reduced excreta NH₃ (linear, P < 0.05; quadratic, P < 0.05) and total mercaptan (R.SH) (linear, P < 0.01) concentration. Taken together, dietary xylanase supplementation in broilers wheat-based diets had beneficial effects on growth performance, apparent ileal digestibility of nutrients, intestinal morphology, and microflora balance. Furthermore, the xylanase could reduce the ileal digesta viscosity and excreta odor contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aRoss (chicken breed) 3aamino acids 3aammonia 3aamylases 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3acecum 3acrude protein 3adigesta 3adigestible protein 3adry matter digestibility 3aduodenum 3aenergy intake 3aenzyme activity 3aexcreta 3afeed conversion 3afeed grains 3afeed supplements 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ajejunum 3aliveweight gain 3aodors 3aroosters 3athiols 3atrypsin 3avilli 3aviscosity 3awheat 3axylanases 0aBroilers 0axylanase 0aperformance 0aintestinal health 0aexcreta odor content1 aKim, In-ho,0 tPoultry science.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 96, no. 3 p.566-573dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pew2583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010800168300001600276520091900292592002801211650002501239650001201264650001201276650001401288650001201302650001301314653003601327653001901363653001401382653001201396653002401408700002001432700002001452773011101472856008501583852000901668655001201677IND60562729920221119032153.0181015e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056272992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Moon Joo10aDefect-dependent stability of highly propylene-selective zeolitic-imidazolate framework ZIF-8 membranes  ap. 105-113.  aMembranes of ZIF-8, a prototypical zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF) with a sodalite topology, have shown excellent propylene/propane separation performances based on molecular sieving mechanism. Although the long-term stability of ZIF-8 membranes is of critical importance for their practical applications, there are only a few studies reported on the subject. Here, we report the long-term binary propylene/propane performances of ZIF-8 membranes prepared by two distinctive synthesis methods. A series of characterizations was employed to explain how different synthetic protocols led to the formation of ZIF-8 membranes with different bulk defect densities and surface defects, thereby affecting the long-term membrane stability. Finally, a post-synthetic ligand treatment is proposed as an effective means to mitigate the defects of ZIF-8 membranes, resulting in improved long-term separation performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3aligands 3apropane 3apropylene 3asieving 3atopology 0aZeolitic-imidazolate frameworks 0aGas separation 0aMembranes 0aDefects 0aLong-term stability1 aKwon, Hyuk Taek1 aJeong, Hae-Kwon0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 May 01, v. 529 p.105-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245015600161300001400317520130400331592002801635650001501663650001601678650001301694650002301707650001801730650002801748650002001776650001701796650003901813650002401852650002101876650002401897650001601921650001001937650002201947650001401969650001901983650001502002653003902017653001502056653001502071653002402086653003002110700001402140700001802154700001302172700001702185700001202202700002002214700002002234700001402254700001402268773010902282856008202391852000902473655001202482IND60541961920221123000806.0190401e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054196192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aSpectroscopic investigation on the food components–drug interaction: The influence of flavonoids on the affinity of nifedipine to human serum albumin  ap. 42-51.  aNifedipine (NDP) is used extensively for the clinical treatment of a number of cardiovascular diseases. Herein, the interaction between human serum albumin (HSA) and NDP and the influence of flavonoids, rutin and baicalin, on their binding properties were investigated in vitro by means of fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. The fluorescence of HSA was quenched remarkably by NDP and the quenching mechanism was considered as static quenching by forming a complex. The results of thermodynamic parameters indicate that both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions play the main role in the binding process and the binding process was spontaneous. The binding distance between the amino acid residue of HSA and NDP is 2.608 nm, which indicates that the energy transfer from HSA to NDP can occur with high probability. The decreased association constants and the increased binding distance of NDP binding to HSA in the presence of flavonoids were both due to their competitive binding to the site I of HSA. The results obtained from synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra showed that the interaction between HSA and NDP caused the conformational changes of HSA and the synergism effects of NDP and flavonoids induced the further conformational changes of HSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aamino acids 3abaicalin 3abinding properties 3abinding sites 3acardiovascular diseases 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aprobability 3arutin 3aspectral analysis 3asynergism 3athermodynamics 3atoxicology 0aFood components–drug interaction 0aNifedipine 0aFlavonoids 0aHuman serum albumin 0aFluorescence spectroscopy1 aLiu, Yang1 aHe, Ling-Ling1 aLiu, Bin1 aZhang, Si-Yi1 aYe, Xiu1 aJing, Jiao-Jiao1 aZhang, Jinfeng,1 aGao, Ming1 aWang, Xin0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2015 Apr., v. 78 p.42-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2015.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024004100132040001800173100002000191245009800211300001800309520132000327592002801647596007001675596009401745650002101839650003301860650003101893650002901924650002601953650003701979650002002016650001102036650001902047650001402066650001002080650002602090650002202116650001702138650001602155650004802171650001302219650000902232700001802241700002302259700002202282700005302304700002002357700002002377700002002397700001902417700001902436700001802455700005802473773017302531856008502704852000902789655001202798IND60604308520221120183206.0180716e20180613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060430852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b009032doi7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b009032chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasrin, Shamima10aChloramphenicol Derivatives with Antibacterial Activity Identified by Functional Metagenomics  ap. 1321-1332.  aA functional metagenomic approach identified novel and diverse soil-derived DNAs encoding inhibitors to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A metagenomic DNA soil library containing 19 200 recombinant Escherichia coli BAC clones with 100 Kb average insert size was screened for antibiotic activity. Twenty-seven clones inhibited MRSA, seven of which were found by LC-MS to possess modified chloramphenicol (Cm) derivatives, including three new compounds whose structures were established as 1-acetyl-3-propanoylchloramphenicol, 1-acetyl-3-butanoylchloramphenicol, and 3-butanoyl-1-propanoylchloramphenicol. Cm was used as the selectable antibiotic for cloning, suggesting that heterologously expressed enzymes resulted in derivatization of Cm into new chemical entities with biological activity. An esterase was found to be responsible for the enzymatic regeneration of Cm, and the gene trfA responsible for plasmid copy induction was found to be responsible for inducing antibacterial activity in some clones. Six additional acylchloramphenicols were synthesized for structure and antibacterial activity relationship studies, with 1-p-nitrobenzoylchloramphenicol the most active against Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with MICs of 12.5 and 50.0 μg/mL, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseasesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000060 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycobacterium intracellulare 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3achloramphenicol 3aclones 3aderivatization 3aesterases 3agenes 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametagenomics 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aplasmids 3asoil1 aGanji, Suresh1 aKakirde, Kavita S.1 aJacob, Melissa R.1 aWang, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3686-42921 aRavu, Ranga Rao1 aCobine, Paul A.1 aKhan, Ikhlas A.1 aWu, Cheng-Cang1 aMead, David A.1 aLi, Xing-Cong1 aLiles, Mark R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9313-81500 tJournal of natural products.g2018 June 13, v. 81, no. 6 p.1321-1332dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b009033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245014100162300001400303520170300317592002802020650001602048650001602064650002102080650002302101650002602124650002802150650002102178650001102199650001202210650001502222650001402237650002102251650001302272650000902285650001402294653004502308653003102353653004302384653002302427700001702450700001802467700001602485700001702501700001802518700001802536700001902554700001302573773011002586856008302696852000902779655001202788IND60615731220221117184856.0200210e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061573122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.09.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Nan10aTwo-dimensional oriented growth of Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF architecture: A highly sensitive and selective platform for detecting cancer markers  ap. 51-58.  aFabricating novel bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) architectures and exploiting them as aptasensor scaffolds for detecting diverse analytes, especially cancer markers, have aroused widespread research attention. Herein, we report a novel strategy for obtaining ZnZr bimetallic MOFs via the MOF-on-MOF method and exploit them as an aptasensor platform for detecting the cancer marker protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7). Basic characterizations reveal that the chemical structure, crystalline properties, and surface functionality of bimetallic ZnZr-MOFs can be modulated by changing the order of addition of metal precursors and organic ligands. The Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF hybrid exhibits a hierarchically decussated foliace, whereas Zr-MOF-on-Zn-MOF demonstrates a multilayered nanosheet structure. The electrochemical results reveal that Zr-MOF facilitates aptamer strand immobilization, whereas the Zn-MOF stabilizes the G-quadruplex formed by aptamer strands and PTK7. The Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF-based aptasensor outperforms the Zr-MOF-on-Zn-MOF-based one, providing ultralow detection limits of 0.84 and 0.66 pg mL⁻¹, as obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, respectively, within the PTK7 concentration range of 1.0 pg mL⁻¹ to 1.0 ng mL⁻¹. The proposed Zn-MOF-on-Zr-MOF-based aptasensor exhibits high selectivity in the presence of various interferences, good stability, reproducibility, and acceptability in human serum. The proposed strategy provides a new approach for fabricating ultrasensitive and selective bimetallic MOFs-based aptasensors and contributes to efforts to broaden their applications in early cancer diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3ablood serum 3achemical species 3achemical structure 3acoordination polymers 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3ahumans 3aligands 3ananosheets 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3atyrosine 3azinc 3azirconium 0aBimetallic ZnZr-metal organic frameworks 0aElectrochemical aptasensor 0aDetection of protein tyrosine kinase-7 0aMOF-on-MOF hybrids1 aSu, Fangfang1 aGuo, Chuanpan1 aHe, Linghao1 aJia, Zhankui1 aWang, Minghua1 aJia, Qiaojuan1 aZhang, Zhihong1 aLu, Siyu0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 123 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.09.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010900145300001200254500001500266520100800281650001401289650001601303650002601319650002101345650002001366650002101386650002301407650002201430650001301452650002801465650001701493650001801510650001601528650001601544650000901560650001501569650002301584650002901607650001201636650003701648650006301685650002301748650002201771650004501793650002901838650001101867650003401878650002701912650003201939650002301971650001901994650006302013650002602076653001302102653002002115653002202135700001802157700001902175700001702194700001902211773009902230852000902329930003302338945001302371946001102384655001202395IND2331149920221120201007.0030304e20020225ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233114992DNAL7 a118836702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLay, J.C.10aInhibition of bacterial foodborne pathogens by the lactoperoxidase system in combination with monolaurin  ap. 1-9.  a2019-12-05  aThe lactoperoxidase system (LPS) and monolaurin (ML) are potential natural antimicrobial agents for use in foods. The LPS is considered to have greatest activity against Gram-negative bacteria while ML is usually considered to have greatest activity against Gram-positive bacteria. An LPS-ML combination system (utilizing lactoperoxidase (LPX) in the range 5-200 mg kg-1 and ML in the range 50-1000 ppm) inhibited growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus. Growth of S. aureus was inhibited more strongly in broth than in milk, in milk than in ground beef. A similar pattern was observed for E. coli O157:H7, though enhanced inhibition by LPS-ML systems over that obtained in comparable LPS only systems was not observed in ground beef. The inhibitory action of the LPS in combination with other lipids was also examined, with progressively weaker inhibition observed in combinations including palmitoleic acid, monopalmitolein, lauric acid, caprylic acid, and sodium lauryl sulphate. 3aviability 3afatty acids 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aEscherichia coli 3adecontamination 3abiopreservatives 3afood contamination 3amonoacylglycerols 3aglycerol 3amicrobial contamination 3ainactivation 3aculture media 3aground beef 3aplate count 3amilk 3aperoxidase 3afood preservatives 3aantibacterial properties 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEscherichia coli O157xdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aFood Contamination 2aFood Microbiology 2aFoodborne Diseasesxprevention & control 2aGlyceridesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLactoperoxidasexpharmacology 2aLauratesxpharmacology 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aMonoglycerides 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSurface-Active Agents 0aefficacy 0alactoperoxidase 0afatty acid esters1 aKennedy, M.J.1 aO'Rourke, A.L.1 aElliot, R.M.1 aSimmonds, R.S.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2002 Feb. 25, v. 73, no. 1 p.1-9x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03657naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245007100151300001400222520156800236650001601804650000901820650001701829650001601846650001501862650002801877650002001905650001801925650002301943650002801966650001401994650001602008650001602024650001802040650001002058650002402068650002502092650001202117650006602129650002702195650002802222650005602250650002202306650002202328650002302350650007702373650007902450650001702529650003002546650002602576650001602602650001702618650002302635653002102658653001902679653001602698653002202714700001302736700001402749700001702763773010102780852000902881930003302890945001302923946001102936655001202947IND2331154020221120200935.0030304e20020225ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233115402DNAL7 a118855732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasmussen, S.K.J.12aA process risk model for the shelf life of Atlantic salmon fillets  ap. 47-60.  aThe shelf life of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) portions produced for retail distribution is examined and the dominant aerobic spoilage organism is identified. Characterization of the harvesting and processing operations allow the development of a stochastic mathematical model, a process risk model (PRM), which predicts the range of the possible shelf life for the portions under normal retail and distribution. The considered risk is the failure to achieve the nominal 'use by' date. Bacterial counts from surface swabs, water, ice, and fish samples, collected over a period of 9 months, are fitted to distribution functions for use within the model. Comparisons are made between the distributions fitted to the observed bacterial levels and the predicted levels for the slurry water, initial surface contamination on the fish, and for the predicted and observed shelf life. Storage temperature of the packaged salmon portions has the greatest influence on shelf life, with contamination from contact surfaces and other sources being the next most important. The range of bacterial counts on the portions was between -0.6 and 5 log10 cfu/cm2. The model predicts bacterial counts in the slurry water to have an average value of 3.36 log10 cfu/ml, whereas the observed slurry water bacterial counts were 3.35 log10 cfu/ml. The predicted average initial bacterial contamination is 3.31 log10 cfu/cm2 on the fish surface and 3.23 log10 cfu/cm2 on the observed. The average predicted shelf life is 6.5 days, compared to an observed value of 6.2 days at 4 degrees C. 3aSalmo salar 3afish 3afood storage 3atemperature 3ashelf life 3afood processing quality 3arisk assessment 3afood spoilage 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aviability 3aplate count 3aPseudomonas 3agrowth models 3awater 3asodium hypochlorite 3astochastic processes 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aChlorinexpharmacology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservation 2aModels, Biological 2aMoraxellaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aPseudomonasxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aRisk Factors 2aSalmo salarxmicrobiology 2aSeafoodxmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWater Microbiology 0aquality controls 0aidentification 0agrowth rate 0afish slurry water1 aRoss, T.1 aOlley, J.1 aMcMeekin, T.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2002 Feb. 25, v. 73, no. 1 p.47-60x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02858naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245008700144300001400231520140400245650001601649650001801665650001001683650002301693650002801716650001801744650002201762650001601784650001901800650000701819650001101826650001801837650002201855650002201877650002501899650004501924650002401969650003101993650001302024650001602037650001002053653002002063653001602083700001802099700001502117700001702132773010102149852000902250930003302259945001302292946001102305655001202316IND2331160920221120171827.0030304e20030225ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233116092DNAL7 a124239142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGock, M.A.10aInfluence of temperature, water activity and pH on growth of some xerophilic fungi  ap. 11-19.  aThe combined effects of water activity (aw), pH and temperature on the germination and growth of seven xerophilic fungi important in the spoilage of baked goods and confectionery were examined. Eurotium rubrum, E. repens, Wallemia sebi, Aspergillus penicillioides, Penicillium roqueforti, Chrysosporium xerophilum and Xeromyces bisporus were grown at 25, 30 and 37 degrees C on media with pH values of 4.5, 5.5, 6.5 and 7.5 and a range of water activities (aw) from 0.92 to 0.70. The aw of the media was controlled with a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. Temperature affected the minimum aw for germination for most species. For example, P. roqueforti germinated at 0.82 aw at 25 degrees C, 0.86 aw at 30 degrees C and was unable to germinate at 37 degrees C. E. repens germinated at 0.70 aw at 30 degrees C, but at 25 and 37 degrees C, its minimum aw for germination was 0.74. C. xerophilum and X. bisporus germinated at 0.70 aw at all three temperatures. The optimum growth occurred at 25 degrees C for P. roqueforti and W. sebi, at 30 degrees C for Eurotium species, A. penicillioides and X. bisporus and at 37 degrees C for C. xerophilum. These fungi all grew faster under acidic than neutral pH conditions. The data presented here provide a matrix that will be used in the development of a mathematical model for the prediction of the shelf life of baked goods and confectionery. 3abaked goods 3afood spoilage 3afungi 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afungal spores 3aspore germination 3atemperature 3awater activity 3apH 3asweets 2aCulture Media 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservation 2aFructosexmetabolism 2aFungixgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aTemperature 2aWater 0awater relations 0agrowth rate1 aHocking, A.D.1 aPitt, J.I.1 aPoulos, P.G.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 Feb. 25, v. 81, no. 1 p.11-19x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02693naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007200143300001400215500001500229520098800244650002101232650001701253650001501270650002201285650001101307650002301318650003001341650002901371650001801400650001001418650002501428650001501453650001201468650002601480650003301506650001701539650002201556650001201578650003901590650004601629650009401675650002301769653001901792653002801811653002501839700002801864700001501892700001401907700001501921773010101936852000902037930003302046945001302079946001102092655001202103IND2331167620221120171824.0030304e20030225ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233116762DNAL7 a124239192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, V.12aA new PCR-based method for monitoring inoculated wine fermentations  ap. 63-71.  a2019-12-05  aA new PCR-based method has been developed to monitor inoculated wine fermentations. The method is based on the variation in the number and position of introns in the mitochondrial gene COX1. Oligonucleotide primers homologous to the regions flanking the Saccharomyces cerevisiae COX1 introns have been designed and tested for S. cerevisiae wine yeast strain differentiation. Four primers were selected for their subsequent use in a multiplex PCR reaction and have proved to be very effective in uncovering polymorphism in natural and commercial yeast strains. An important point is that the speed and simplicity of the technique, which does not require the isolation of DNA, allows early detection of the starter yeast strain throughout the fermentation process. The main advantage for the wineries is that the must sample can be used directly for the PCR reaction obtaining very fast results (in approximately 8 h). This allows the wine industries to intervene quickly if necessary. 3astarter cultures 3afermentation 3amonitoring 3amitochondrial DNA 3ayeasts 3astrain differences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3arapid methods 3awines 3aamino acid sequences 3awinemaking 3aintrons 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aIntrons 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aWinexmicrobiology 0aidentification 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aFernandez-Espinar, M.T.1 aBarrio, E.1 aRamon, D.1 aQuerol, A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 Feb. 25, v. 81, no. 1 p.63-71x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03213naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245014600134300001600280520188600296650001302182650002102195650003002216650002002246650002002266650002802286650002702314650002302341650002802364650001402392650001302406650001602419653001202435653002102447653002202468653002402490700001702514700002202531700001502553700001902568773010202587852000902689930003302698945001302731946001102744655001202755IND2332628020141222000000.0030519e20030515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233262802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuinebretiere, M.H.10aContamination flows of Bacillus cereus and spore-forming aerobic bacteria in a cooked, pasteurized and chilled zucchini puree processing line  ap. 223-232.  aA food processing plant producing pasteurized purées and its zucchini purée processing line were examined for contamination with aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial spores during a day's operation. Multiplication of spores was also monitored in the product stored under different conditions. High concentrations of Bacillus cereus spores were found in the soil in which the zucchinis were grown (4.6 +/- 0.3 log CFU/g), with a background spore population of 6.1 +/- 0.2 log CFU/g. In the processing plant, no B. cereus or psychrotrophic bacterial spores were detected on equipment. B. cereus and psychrotrophic bacterial spores were detected after enrichment in all samples of raw zucchinis, washed zucchinis, of two ingredients (starch and milk proteins) and in processed purée at each processing step. Steam cooking of raw zucchinis and pasteurization of purée in the final package significantly reduced spore numbers to 0.5 +/- 0.3 log CFU/g in the processed food. During storage, numbers of spore-forming bacteria increased up to 7.8 +/- 0.1 log CFU/g in purée after 5 days at 20-25 degrees C, 7.5 +/- 0.3 log CFU/g after 21 days at 10 degrees C and 3.8 +/- 1.1 log CFU/g after 21 days at 4 degrees C. B. cereus counts reached 6.4 +/- 0.5 log CFU/g at 20-25 degrees C, 4.6 +/- 1.9 log CFU/g at 10 degrees C, and remained below the detection threshold (1.7 log CFU/g) at 4 degrees C. Our findings indicate that raw vegetables and texturing agents such as milk proteins and starch, in spite of their low levels of contamination with bacterial spores and the heat treatments they undergo, may significantly contribute to the final contamination of cooked chilled foods. This contamination resulted in growth of B. cereus and psychrotrophic bacterial spores during storage of vegetable purée. Ways to eliminate such contamination in the processing line are discussed. 3azucchini 3avegetable juices 3afood processing equipment 3arisk assessment 3aBacillus cereus 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3aspore-forming bacteria 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3adetection 3asampling 3aplate count 0asources 0aquality controls 0acook-chill system 0aaerobic plate count1 aGirardin, H.1 aDargaignaratz, C.1 aCarlin, F.1 aNguyen-the, C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 May 15, v. 82, no. 3 p.223-232x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle03262naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012300179300001800302500002400320520163800344650002001982650001202002650001802014650003102032650001002063650001802073650002402091650001602115650002002131650002402151650001402175650002202189650002402211650001202235650001802247650002302265650003802288650003102326650006902357650001102426650002802437650001402465700001702479700002002496700001502516773010702531852000902638856008502647655001202732IND4457561920221120151854.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756192DNAL7 a201310112pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-9972-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ning10aMolecular characterization and expression analysis of a heat shock protein 90 gene from disk abalone (Haliotis discus)  ap. 3055-3060.  aIncludes references  aHeat shock protein 90s (hsp90s) are chaperones that contribute to the proper folding of cellular proteins and help animals cope with the cellular protein damages in stress conditions. In this study, an hsp90 gene was isolated from disc abalone (Haliotis discus). The complete nucleotide sequence of the hsp90 gene contains an open reading frame of 2,184 base pairs, encoding an 84 kDa protein. Disk abalone hsp90 shares high sequence similarity with other hsp90 family proteins. Although the phylogenetic analysis did not classify it into the hsp90α group, the inductivity of this gene was confirmed by heat shock and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge test. Disk abalone hsp90 gene displayed a rapid and reversible induction response to both an exposure of typical heat shock and the LPS challenge. Once given the sublethal heat shock treatment, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly up-regulated. With a recovery of 12 h, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene gradually attenuated to the control level. These observations reflected the feedback regulation of abalone heat shock responses faithfully. In response to LPS challenge, the transcription of disk abalone hsp90 gene was significantly increased within 2 h and it approached maximum induction at 4 h later and recovered finally the reference level in 24 h. Take all together, the cloning and expression analysis of disk abalone hsp90 gene provided useful molecular information of abalone responses in stress conditions and potential ways to monitor the chronic stressors in abalone culture environments and diagnose the animal health status. 3aHaliotis discus 3aabalone 3aanimal health 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahealth status 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3amollusc culture 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGastropodaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHSP90 Heat-Shock Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny1 aWhang, Ilson1 aLee, Jae-seong.1 aLee, Jehee0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.3055-3060dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-9972-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03135naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245008900147300001600236500011700252500001500369520146300384650001801847650001701865650002001882650002301902650001701925650001001942650002501952650002001977650002201997650002002019650002202039650002402061650002002085650002802105650002502133650001702158650004502175650003302220650003102253650001102284650001202295650002002307653002102327653001702348653002002365653001602385773010202401852000902503930003302512945001302545946001102558655001202569IND2332653820221120104834.0030520e20020525ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233265382DNAL7 a120361442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotarjemi, Y.10aImpact of small scale fermentation technology on food safety in developing countries  ap. 213-229.  aIn the special issue: Small-scale fermentations in developing countries/edited by R.S. Rolle and W.H. Holzapfel.  a2019-12-05  aFermentation is one of the oldest technologies used for food preservation. Over the centuries, it has evolved and been refined and diversified. Today, a variety of food products is derived from this technology in households, small-scale food industries as well as in large enterprises. Furthermore, fermentation is an affordable food preservation technology and of economic importance to developing countries. In the report of an FAO/WHO Workshop (FAO/WHO, 1996), fermentation was reviewed and the nutritional and safety aspects of fermentation technologies and their products were assessed. Fermentation enhances the nutritional quality of foods and contributes to food safety particularly under conditions where refrigeration or other foods processing facilities are not available. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) studies of some fermented products have demonstrated that depending on the process and the hygienic conditions observed during preparation, some fermented foods, e.g. togwa prepared in Tanzania, may pose a safety risk. Fermented foods must therefore be studied following HACCP principles and small-scale food industries and households must be advised on the critical control points of fermentation processes and the control measures to be applied at these points. This paper reviews the risks and benefits of fermentation and demonstrates the application of the HACCP system to some fermented foods in developing countries. 3amodernization 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3afood contamination 3ainfant foods 3aHACCP 3adeveloping countries 3anutritive value 3afood preservation 3arisk assessment 3afoodborne illness 3atechnology transfer 3afood sanitation 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aDeveloping Countries 2aFermentation 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Microbiologyxstandards 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aHumans 2aHygiene 2aNutritive Value 0aquality controls 0afood quality 0afood technology 0afood safety0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2002 May 25, v. 75, no. 3 p.213-229x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02591naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100001400157245010200171300002000273520125600293650002201549650001501571650001601586650002401602650001901626650001601645650003401661650001601695650002601711650002801737650002001765650001901785650003901804653001201843700001401855700001401869700001501883773007801898852000901976856007901985939003302064946001302097990002302110655001202133IND9304379220221120085119.0930726e19921222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930437922DNAL7 a14724992pmid7 a10.1021/bi00165a0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBains, G.10aMicrocalorimetric study of wheat germ agglutinin binding to N-acetylglucosamine and its oligomers  ap. 12624-12628.  aThe energetics of association of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and its beta(1,4) oligomers have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry. Association constants of 0.4, 5.3, 11.1, 12.3, and 19.1 mM-1 and enthalpies of binding of -6.1, -15.6, -19.4, -19.3, and -18.2 kcal mol-1 were obtained at 26 degrees C for the titration of WGA with GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, (GlcNAc)4, and (GlcNAc)5, respectively. The term T delta S was always of negative value, indicating that the binding process is enthalpically driven. Titrations of WGA performed at pH 4.5 did not differ significantly from those performed at pH 7.0, suggesting that no groups with a pK(a) in this range are directly involved in the binding event. Also, performing the titration in a buffer system with a higher enthalpy of protonation did not change the enthalpy of binding confirming that there is no net protonation or deprotonation when WGA binds GlcNAc residues at pH 7. A model of four independent binding sites was found to adequately describe the binding curves, except in the case of (GlcNAc)4 which exhibited positive cooperativity. The energetic values are discussed within the context of the structure of the WGA-(GlcNAc)2 complex. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat germ 3aagglutinins 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3athermodynamics 3acalorimetry 2aAcetylglucosaminexmetabolism 2aCalorimetry 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 2aThermodynamics 2aWheat Germ Agglutininsxmetabolism 0abinding1 aLee, R.T.1 aLee, Y.C.1 aFreire, E.0 tBiochemistry.g1992 Dec. 22, v. 31, no. 50 p.12624-12628x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00165a0123Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03303naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100001600157245009600173300002000269520187800289650002202167650001502189650001402204650001302218650002002231650001202251650002002263650002402283650001902307650002402326650003002350650002102380650002702401650002702428650003402455650001302489653001402502700002002516700002302536700001502559773007802574852000902652856007902661939003302740946001302773990002302786655001202809IND9304379920221120074858.0930726e19921110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930437992DNAL7 a14201972pmid7 a10.1021/bi00159a0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoehs, C.P.10aEnhanced stability of histone octamers from plant nucleosomes: role of H2A and H2B histones  ap. 10844-10851.  aGel filtration and sedimentation studies have previously established that the vertebrate animal core histone octamer is in equilibrium with an (H3-H4)2 tetramer and an H2A-H2B dimer [Eickbush, T. H., & Moudrianakis, E. N. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 4955-4964; Godfrey, J. E., Eickbush, T. H., & Moudrianakis, E.N. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 1339-1346]. We have investigated the core histone octamer of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and have found it to be much more stable than its vertebrate animal counterpart. When vertebrate animal histone octamers are subjected to gel filtration in 2 M NaCl, a trailing peak of H2A-H2B dimer can be clearly resolved from the main octamer peak. When the plant octamer is subjected to the identical procedure, there is no trailing peak of H2A-H2B dimer, but rather a single peak containing the octamer. A sampling across the octamer peak from leading to trailing edge shows no change in the ratio of H2A-H2B to (H3-H4)2. Surprisingly, the plant octamer shows the same stability at 0.6 M NaCl, a salt concentration in which the vertebrate animal octamer dissociates into dimers and tetramers. Equilibrium sedimentation data indicate that the assembly potential of the wheat histones in 2 M NaCl is very high at all protein concentrations above 0.1 mg mL-1. In order to disrupt the forces stabilizing the plant histone octamer at high histone concentrations, the concentration of NaCl must be lowered to approximately 0.3 M. Because histones H3 and H4 are essentially identical proteins in plants and animals, it is logical to assume that the H2 histones (H2A and H2B) are responsible for the enhanced stability of plant histone octamers.

(1990) Biochemistry 29, 2551-2256]. These results from our laboratory have been reexamined using an extension of the same procedure. Sealed right-side-out vesicles were modified with pyridoxal phosphate and sodium [3H]borohydride in the presence and absence of saponin or cholate. The modified alpha polypeptide was isolated and digested with the proteinase from Staphylococcus aureus strain V8 or trypsin to produce one or the other of these two peptides. These digests were passed over immunoadsorbents, identical to those used by Bayer, directed against pyroglutamylRXIVE or -ETYY. Unlike in the earlier studies, however, in the present studies the modified, radioactive peptides bound and eluted from the immunoadsorbents were submitted to HPLC, and their respective mobilities were compared to those of the synthetic peptides that had also been modified with pyridoxal phosphate. In this manner, the correct, modified peptide could be positively identified, and its specific radioactivity could be estimated. When cholate was added to sealed vesicles, prior to modification, there was at least a 3-fold increase in the incorporation of radioactivity into lysine 1012, consistent with a cytoplasmic location for this residue. It was not possible to determine the position of lysine 905 owing to the difficulty in modifying this residue with pyridoxal phosphate, but it could be shown that the conclusions of Bayer (1990) concerning this peptide were compromised by the presence of a contaminating, modified peptide, RYAK(3Hpyr)IVE. 3asheep 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3aion transport 3aactive transport 3asodium 3apotassium 3aspatial distribution 3amolecular conformation 3alysine 3aplasma membrane 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCell Membranexenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aEndopeptidases 2aKidneyxenzymology 2aMicrosomesxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligopeptidesxchemical synthesis 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPyridoxal Phosphate 2aSheep 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPasexchemistry0 tBiochemistry.g1993 Mar. 23, v. 32, no. 11 p.2813-2821x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00062a0123Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03247naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010700174300001600281500002400297500001500321520176300336650001702099650001002116650001902126650002602145650001002171650002302181650002902204650002602233650001502259650002102274650001302295650002502308650001202333651001502345653001502360700002402375700003102399700002902430700001802459700003102477700002402508700002702532773009302559852000902652856009202661655001202753IND4457408020221120064232.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445740802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00705.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Steig E.10aGray-headed Lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps) Abundance and Forest Structure Dynamics at Manombo, Madagascar  ap. 371-379.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMadagascar's ecosystems are subject to high levels of anthropogenic disturbance and stochastic events, including cyclones. We investigated the abundance of gray-headed lemurs (Eulemur cinereiceps) and vegetation structure in the fragmented forest of Manombo from 1995 to 2007, including 10 yr following Cyclone Gretelle in January 1997. We predicted that the density of this arboreal, frugivorous lemur would be similar in the pre- and post-cyclone intervals only if tree measures demonstrate trends toward recovery in the post-cyclone period. Initial impacts included severe damage to over 60 percent of trees. After 10 yr, all vegetation metrics except for stem density remained low relative to the pre-cyclone period, including dbh, height, and basal area. To investigate vegetation changes separately from cyclone effects, we compared forest structure in the pre-cyclone period alone. Basal area declined but dbh and stem density did not vary between 1995 and 1997; thus, anthropogenic activities or other factors did not consistently alter forest structure in this 2-yr period. Subsequent changes may be linked to cyclone response, presumably in synergy with human disturbance. Contrary to predictions, recent gray-headed lemur population densities were nearly identical to those recorded in 1995 (13.5 ± 3.2 vs. 13.6 ± 6.4 individuals/km², respectively). Lemur populations may have remained stable or declined initially and then recovered in the last 10 yr. Life history and ecological adaptations may explain their resistance or resilience when faced with habitat change. Recent models suggest that lemurs have evolved in response to unpredictable environmental conditions. Such environmental variability may increase with projected climate change. 3alife history 3aLemur 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3atrees 3apopulation density 3aanthropogenic activities 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aecosystems 3astand basal area 3ahabitats 3avegetation structure 3aforests 3aMadagascar 0abasal area1 aIngraldi, Christina1 aRalainasolo, Fidimalala B.1 aAndriamaharoa, Hubert E.1 aLudovic, Reza1 aBirkinshaw, Christopher R.1 aWright, Patricia C.1 aRatsimbazafy, Jonah H.0 tBiotropica.g2011 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.371-379dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00705.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02770naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008400176300001600260500002400276500001500300520150100315650003501816650001701851650002001868650002601888650003201914650002601946650002201972650002501994650002102019650002502040651001702065653001502082700001902097700002202116700002202138773009902160852000902259856009202268655001202360IND4457448220221120042514.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445744822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02160.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHWARZKOPF, TERESA10aAre cloud forest tree structure and environment related in the Venezuelan Andes  ap. 280-289.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCloud forest vegetation structure and composition were studied in the Venezuelan Andes at three sites in Mérida State. Although the sites are within 10 to 30 km of each other, climatic, geologic and topographic differences are remarkable. The main purpose of the study was to determine the relationship of specific environmental variables to forest vegetation characteristics, including basal area, tree height, density and diversity, and leaf area index (LAI). At 51 plots, all trees' diameter at breast height >10 cm were recorded and identified. Although the environment at the three sites is distinctive, the tree species composition of the most abundant species was very similar. None of the measured environment variables were significantly correlated with the measured vegetation structure variables, except LAI, which was correlated with slope orientation; LAI showed higher values at south-facing plots. Tree height was relatively uniform, while basal area was highly variable and reached very high values. Stem densities were in the range reported elsewhere in cloud forests. Multivariate analysis using structure or composition data shows segregation of the plots by site. Principal component analyses by site indicate a minor impact of environmental factors on forest variables. At each site, a particular group of species are correlated with the ordination axes. We conclude that species pools and forest dynamics add to the complexity of the structure of the studied cloud forests. 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aforest trees 3aleaf area index 3amultivariate analysis 3atree and stand measurements 3aenvironmental factors 3aspecies diversity 3aenvironmental impact 3astand basal area 3avegetation structure 3aAndes region 0abasal area1 aRIHA, SUSAN J.1 aFAHEY, TIMOTHY J.1 aDEGLORIA, STEPHEN0 tAustral ecology.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.280-289dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02160.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02148naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008000173300001600253500002400269520101000293650002001303650002401323650001001347650002001357650001601377650001201393650001801405650001501423700002001438700001701458700002301475700002101498700001901519700002401538773009901562852000901661856009201670655001201762IND4457448420221120042433.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445744842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02150.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKEARNEY, MICHAEL12aA cost-effective method of assessing thermal habitat quality for endotherms  ap. 297-302.  aIncludes references  aThe conservation of many endothermic species depends critically on the availability of suitable retreat sites, yet we know little about the variation in thermal quality of such microhabitats. Studies of thermal habitat suitability for birds and mammals must account for the effect of endothermic heat production on their microclimates. For example, endotherms may significantly raise the air temperature in their retreat sites and this effect must be considered when assessing retreat site quality. We devised an inexpensive means by which to construct pseudo-endothermic ‘environmental temperature' models with the use of disposable heat pads. We applied this technique to investigate thermal aspects of nest box design, illustrating the potential positive and negative effects of nest box insulation depending on the environmental context. We suggest that, from a thermal perspective, the avoidance of heat stress is an important and underappreciated issue in the retreat site selection of endotherms. 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3abirds 3aheat production 3aheat stress 3amammals 3amicrohabitats 3anest boxes1 aFerguson, Emma.1 aFUMEI, SARAH1 aGALLACHER, ANTHONY1 aMitchell, Peter.1 aWOODFORD, ROMY1 aHANDASYDE, KATHRINE0 tAustral ecology.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.297-302dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02150.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02723naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010000174300001600274500002400290520182500314650001702139650001302156650002302169650001402192650001302206651001402219773009902233852000902332856009202341655001202433IND4457447820221120033713.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445744782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02143.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOSKIN, CONRAD J.14aThe invasion and potential impact of the Asian House Gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) in Australia  ap. 240-251.  aIncludes references  aHemidactylus frenatus is an Asian gecko that has spread pantropically to become one the world's most widespread reptiles. It has been established in Australia for approximately 50 years, but the last two decades have seen massive range expansion across settled areas of northern and eastern Australia; and this spread continues at pace. Disturbingly, H. frenatus is increasingly being detected in natural habitats in Australia, in some cases at high densities. Despite rampant spread, there has been little concern regarding the potential impact of this species on native geckos or natural systems more broadly. This is surprising given that Australia is a centre of gecko origin and diversity, and that H. frenatus has had well documented detrimental impacts on geckos in other parts of its introduced range. Here I review the biology and global distribution of H. frenatus, plot its spread in Australia over the five decades since establishment, and review the research on invasive populations of this species overseas and in Australia to assess potential impacts. I argue that Australia should be more concerned about H. Frenatus because: (i) it is spreading rapidly across northern, eastern and central Australia; (ii) it can invade natural habitats; (iii) it is a very strong competitor and may out-compete Australian geckos in some situations; and (iv) it carries novel parasites that may impact native reptile species. Hemidactylus frenatus is here to stay and represents a potential threat to Australia's diversity and ecology. A key question is the degree to which it will invade natural habitats and what its impacts will be in these. Research is required to assess the current and potential impacts of H. frenatus in Australia so as to determine how these can be managed and the level of investment warranted. 3aHemidactylus 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aparasites 3areptiles 3aAustralia0 tAustral ecology.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.240-251dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02143.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02805naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100001500157245009100172300001800263520103800281650001901319650001301338650002501351650003701376650002301413650002101436650002101457650000901478650001301487650001801500650001801518650002401536650001201560650002301572650003101595650002301626650001301649650003601662650001101698650001401709650002401723650003701747650000901784650002401793650002801817650003601845650003001881653001201911700001701923700001901940773007501959852000902034856007902043939003302122946001302155990002302168655001202191IND9304385420221120023310.0930727e19930406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930438542DNAL7 a76816912pmid7 a10.1021/bi00064a0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, T.P.10aStructure-immunogenicity relationship of melittin and its N-terminal truncated analogs  ap. 3506-3510.  aMelittin is an amphipathic 26-residue peptide from bee venom. We showed previously that, in the murine system, melittin has one major B-cell epitope in the hydrophilic region of residues 21-26 and one T-cell epitope in the hydrophobic midregion of 11-19. In this paper we compared the immunogenicity and the biophysical properties of a series of melittin analogs which differ by stepwise two-residue truncation in the N-terminus of residues 2-10. All analogs retain the B- and T-cell epitopes of melittin. However, the analogs which have more than two residues deleted at the N-terminus are nonimmunogenic for antibody responses although they are immunogenic for T-cell responses. The analogs were found to differ in their hemolytic activity, helical content, and oligomer formation in different solvents. These results support the hypothesis that the immunogenicity of melittin for antibody response is associated with its binding to cell membranes followed with oligomer formation but its immunogenicity for T-cell response is not. 3aApis mellifera 3amelittin 3aamino acid sequences 3astructure-activity relationships 3aantibody formation 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3aepitopes 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aAntigen-Antibody Reactions 2aCircular Dichroism 2aEpitopes 2aErythrocyte Membranexchemistry 2aFemale 2aHemolysis 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMelittenxchemistryximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 0aanalogs1 aCoscia, M.R.1 aKochoumian, L.0 tBiochemistry.g1993 Apr. 6, v. 32, no. 13 p.3506-3510x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00064a0393Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03446naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245010100151300001600252520183900268650001002107650001502117650002002132650001902152650002602171650003402197650002402231650001902255650002602274650001302300650002002313650000902333650002502342650003002367650001202397650006902409650003702478650001802515650002202533650002502555650003102580650003202611653002102643700001202664700001602676700001502692700001602707773010302723852000902826930003302835945001302868946001102881655001202892IND2333217120221117182150.0030625e20030615ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233321712DNAL7 a127060372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeuschner, R.G.K.12aA collaborative study of a method for the enumeration of probiotic bifidobacteria in animal feed  ap. 161-170.  aAn enumeration method to be used as an official control method in the framework of Council Directive 70/524/EEC for probiotic bifidobacteria used as feed additives was validated. Seventeen laboratories in 11 European Countries carried out a collaborative study. A spread plate method following BS ISO 15214:1998 using four different agars, Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS), acidified MRS, MRS with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and a selective bifidobacteria medium, was validated. Precision data in terms of repeatability (r) and reproducibility (R) of the method for each medium using different feeding stuffs with a high and a low inoculation level were determined. Bifidobacteria were present in the samples as a single component or in mixtures with other probiotics. The enumeration of bifidobacteria on all agars showed a relative standard deviation of repeatability (RSD(r)) between 1.2% and 6.3% and a relative standard deviation of reproducibility (RSD(R)) between 2.6% and 8.7%. MRS agar was preferred, followed by acidified MRS and MRS+TTC agar. The selective bifidobacteria medium gave similar counts as the MRS media. For routine analysis, the use of MRS agar with supplementation of cysteine hydrochloride (the selective bifidobacteria medium without antibiotics) is recommended. Depending on the presence and concentration of other probiotics such as enterococci, lactobacilli and pediococci, acidified MRS or MRS+TTC agar is recommended. The selective bifidobacteria medium was selective for bifidobacteria. An official control method for enumeration of probiotic bifidobacteria as a single component and in mixtures with other probiotic microorganisms in feeding stuffs was validated. The methodology is not applicable to mineral feed. The results are intended for consideration for adaptation as CEN and ISO standards. 3afeeds 3aprobiotics 3aBifidobacterium 3afeed additives 3alaboratory techniques 3astandard operating procedures 3areference standards 3aEuropean Union 3acollaborative testing 3avalidity 3aselective media 3aagar 3astatistical analysis 2aAnimal Feedxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aBifidobacteriumxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aCulture Media 2aFood Microbiology 2aProbioticsxanalysis 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aofficial control1 aBew, J.1 aSimpson, P.1 aRoss, P.R.1 aStanton, C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 June 15, v. 83, no. 2 p.161-170x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle03001naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245005300143300001600196500001500212520100200227650001201229650002201241650002301263650002701286650002601313650003301339650001001372650001301382650002901395650001801424650001401442650001801456650002401474650001601498650000901514650002501523650001501548650000701563650002301570650002801593650003001621650000901651650002201660650002201682650002501704650002301729650005501752650002801807650002401835650001101859650001701870650001101887650003101898650003601929650000901965653001101974653001301985653001901998653002002017700001702037700001402054700001902068773010202087852000902189930003302198945001302231946001102244655001202255IND2332878220221117164100.0030603e20030525ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233287822DNAL7 a126725962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaine, R.10aPerformance of bifidobacteria in oat-based media  ap. 105-109.  a2019-12-05  aThirteen Bifidobacterium strains were isolated form the faeces of healthy elderly subjects. The ability of the isolated strains to acidify and survive in an oat-based medium was assessed and compared to a commercial starter Bifidobacterium strain. Since adhesion to the intestinal mucosa is one of the main selection criteria for potential probiotics, the influence of the oat medium on the ex vivo adhesion of the isolates to both human colonic tissue and to mucus from elderly subjects was assessed. Seven of the fourteen strains survived the 24-h fermentation, six of these acidified the medium to below pH 5. Supplementation of the medium with soy protein had a negative effect on survival and the acidification. The strains isolated from the elderly subjects were found to adhere in high levels to immobilised intestinal mucus from elderly. However, their adhesion to colonic tissue was significantly lower. Prior exposure to the oat-based medium increased the adhesion of two of the strains. 3aelderly 3aintestinal mucosa 3anutrition research 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aBifidobacterium breve 3aBifidobacterium adolescentis 3acolon 3aadhesion 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3aculture media 3aviability 3aacidification 3aprotein supplements 3asoy protein 3aoats 3alactic acid bacteria 3aprobiotics 3apH 3acolonizing ability 3acell suspension culture 3acultured product starters 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAvenaxmicrobiology. 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBifidobacteriumxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmicrobiology 2aMale 0agrowth 0acultures 0aimmobilization 0aBifidobacterium1 aSalminen, S.1 aBenno, Y.1 aOuwehand, A.C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 May 25, v. 83, no. 1 p.105-109x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02675naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245007900145300001400224520117700238650003001415650001601445650002201461650002301483650002801506650001401534650001801548650001901566650001801585650003901603650002901642650002201671650002301693650005101716650002401767650003101791650003201822653002301854653003501877700001801912700001701930700001301947700001501960700001601975773010001991852000902091930003302100945001302133946001102146655001202157IND2332877320221117164105.0030603e20030525ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233287732DNAL7 a126725912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalorny, B.10aStandardization of diagnostic PCR for the detection of foodborne pathogens  ap. 39-48.  aIn vitro amplification of nucleic acids using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become, since its discovery in the 1980s, a powerful diagnostic tool for the analysis of microbial infections as well as for the analysis of microorganisms in food samples. However, despite its potential, PCR has neither gained wide acceptance in routine diagnostics nor been widely incorporated in standardized methods. Lack of validation and standard protocols, as well as variable quality of reagents and equipment, influence the efficient dissemination of PCR methodology from expert research laboratories to end-user laboratories. Moreover, the food industry understandably requires and expects officially approved standards. Recognizing this, in 1999, the European Commission approved the research project, FOOD-PCR (http://www.PCR.dk), which aims to validate and standardize the use of diagnostic PCR for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in foods. The present review focuses on the harmonization procedure and standardization criteria for detection of foodborne pathogens by PCR. The progress of standardization so far and future perspectives of diagnostic PCR are discussed. 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acalibration 3afoodborne illness 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3adetection 3arapid methods 3aEuropean Union 3afood research 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aFood Microbiology 2aGene Amplification 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxstandards. 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aliterature reviews 0afood-polymerase chain reaction1 aTassios, P.T.1 aRadstrom, P.1 aCook, N.1 aWagner, M.1 aHoorfar, J.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 May 25, v. 83, no. 1 p.39-48x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02513naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100002100157245006800178300002000246520119600266650002301462650001601485650001001501650001101511650002901522650002201551650002501573650005401598650002201652650002401674650002101698650002201719650002001741650002201761653000901783700001601792773007701808852000901885856007901894930003301973945001302006946001302019990002302032655001202055IND2035834820221122220234.0931117e19921201dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203583482DNAL7 a14459042pmid7 a10.1021/bi00162a0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneegurt, M.A.10aOrigin of the chlorophyll b formyl oxygen in Chlorella vulgaris  ap. 11677-11683.  aChlorophyll (Chl) b is an accessory light-harvesting pigment of plants and chlorophyte algae. Chl b differs from Chl a in that the 3-methyl group on ring B of Chl a is replaced by a 3-formyl group on Chl b. The present study determined the biosynthetic origin of the Chl b formyl oxygen in in vivo labeling experiments. A mutant strain of the unicellular chlorophyte Chlorella vulgaris, which can not synthesize Chls when cultured in the dark but rapidly greens when transferred to the light, was grown in the dark for several generations to deplete Chls, and then the cells were transferred to the light and allowed to form Chls in a controlled atmosphere containing (18)O2. Chl a and Chl b were purified from the cells and analyzed by high-resolution mass spectroscopy. Analysis of the mass spectra indicated that over 76% of the Chl a molecules had incorporated an atom of (18)O. For Chl b, 58% of the molecules had incorporated an atom of (18)O at one position and 34% of the molecules had incorporated an atom of (18)O at a second position. These results demonstrate that the isocyclic ring keto oxygen of both Chl a and Chl b, as well as the formyl oxygen of Chl b, is derived from O2. 3aChlorella vulgaris 3achlorophyll 3alight 3aoxygen 3alight harvesting complex 3aspectral analysis 2aChlorellaxchemistry 2aChlorophyllxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Structure 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxygenxchemistry 2aOxygen Isotopes 2aSpectrophotometry 0adark1 aBeale, S.I.0 tBiochemistry.g1992 Dec. 1, v. 31, no. 47 p.11677-11683x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00162a0023Available from publisher's Web site  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03933naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010600182300001800288500002400306520188900330650002502219650001802244650001902262650001202281650001702293650001302310650001902323650001802342650001102360650001802371650001602389650005202405650004802457650001202505650003102517650005502548650003702603650002002640650002502660650001102685650002202696650003902718650002902757650002502786650001002811650005002821650003202871700002002903700002002923700002002943700001702963700002002980700001603000700001703016700001903033700001803052773010703070852000903177856008503186655001203271IND4457559720221122220228.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445755972DNAL7 a201079092pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-9950-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Young-Mo10aOsteogenic differentiation of human periosteal-derived cells in a three-dimensional collagen scaffold  ap. 2887-2894.  aIncludes references  aThis study examined the osteogenic differentiation of cultured human periosteal-derived cells grown in a three dimensional collagen-based scaffold. Periosteal explants with the appropriate dimensions were harvested from the mandible during surgical extraction of lower impacted third molar. Periosteal-derived cells were introduced into cell culture. After passage 3, the cells were divided into two groups and cultured for 28 days. In one group, the cells were cultured in two-dimensional culture dishes with osteogenic inductive medium containing dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and β-glycerophosphate. In the other group, the cells were seeded onto a three-dimensional collagen scaffold and cultured under the same conditions. We examined the bioactivity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the RT-PCR analysis for ALP and osteocalcin, and measurements of the calcium content in the periosteal-derived cells of two groups. Periosteal-derived cells were successfully differentiated into osteoblasts in the collagen-based scaffold. The ALP activity in the periosteal-derived cells was appreciably higher in the three-dimensional collagen scaffolds than in the two-dimensional culture dishes. The levels of ALP and osteocalcin mRNA in the periosteal-derived cells was also higher in the three-dimensional collagen scaffolds than in the two-dimensional culture dishes. The calcium level in the periosteal-derived cells seeded onto three-dimensional collagen scaffolds showed a 5.92-fold increase on day 7, 3.28-fold increase on day 14, 4.15-fold increase on day 21, and 2.91-fold increase on day 28, respectively, compared with that observed in two-dimensional culture dishes. These results suggest that periosteal-derived cells have good osteogenic capacity in a three-dimensional collagen scaffold, which provides a suitable environment for the osteoblastic differentiation of these cells. 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aascorbic acid 3abone formation 3acalcium 3acell culture 3acollagen 3acultured cells 3adexamethasone 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aosteocalcin 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCalcification, Physiologic 2aCell Culture Techniquesxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aCell Differentiationxphysiology 2aCells, Cultured 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMaterials Testing 2aOsteocalcinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOsteogenesisxphysiology 2aPeriosteumxcytology 2aSwine 2aTissue Engineeringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry1 aHah, Young-Sool1 aPark, Bong-Wook1 aKim, Deok Ryong1 aRoh, Gu Seob1 aKim, Jong-Ryoul1 aKim, Uk-Kyu1 aRho, Gyu-Jin1 aMaeng, Geun-Ho1 aByun, June-Ho0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.2887-2894dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-9950-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03863naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100001700157245009900174300001800273500001500291520192200306650002602228650001202254650001802266650001902284650001202303650001002315650001902325650001402344650000902358650002102367650001002388650002402398650001202422650002702434650001402461650004702475650003102522650001102553650001202564650004402576650003102620650001302651650001402664650001602678650002502694650002702719650002602746650004002772650002502812650001002837650001702847650003202864653001502896700001602911700001702927773007602944852000903020856007903029939003303108946001303141990002303154655001203177IND9304504220221122220323.0930730e19930316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930450422DNAL7 a83835202pmid7 a10.1021/bi00061a0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriver, N.A.10aApical membrane of the gastric parietal cell: water, proton, and nonelectrolyte permeabilities  ap. 2459-2468.  a2019-12-04  aGastric parietal cell apical membranes must protect the cell from the extremely low pH and wide variations in osmolality of the gastric juice. To characterize the permeability properties of gastric apical membranes, we have measured passive permeabilities to water, protons, NH3, and small nonelectrolytes of membrane vesicles derived from parietal cells of fasted animals and fed animals. Both preparations are known to be highly enriched in H+/K+-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for acidifying the gastric contents. The preparations behaved as single populations, and their permeability properties were similar in all respects, permitting pooling of the results. This similarity suggests that insertion of tubulovesicles into the apical membrane does not change the behavior of the lipid bilayer. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) averaged (mean +/- SD) (2.8 +/- 0.3) X 10(-4) cm/s, a value 10-fold lower than that obtained in lecithin large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and similar to that obtained in other water-tight epithelia. Similarly, ammonia permeability (P(NH3)) was low [(4.4 +/- 2.3) X 10(-3) cm/s] and 10 times below that of lecithin LUV. By contrast, proton permeability (P(H+)) was surprisingly high (0.030 +/- 0.011 cm/s) and similar to that of lecithin LUV. These results suggest that the pathway for proton permeation differs from that of water and NH3. Nonelectrolyte permeabilities were strikingly similar to those obtained in another water-tight epithelium, the toad urinary bladder. Moreover, these permeabilities followed Overton's rule in that permeability varied in accordance with the oil-water partition coefficient. We conclude that the gastric apical membrane, like that of several renal epithelia, is relatively water-tight and exhibits low permeabilities to small nonelectrolytes. These properties are likely to be essential to the ability of this membrane to perform its barrier function. 3amembrane permeability 3aammonia 3ahydrogen ions 3agastric mucosa 3afasting 3awater 3acell membranes 3adiffusion 3aurea 3aactive transport 3aswine 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Waterxmetabolism 2aBufonidae 2aCell Membranexmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCell Membrane Permeability 2aEating 2aFasting 2aH(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLiposomes 2aMathematics 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMicrosomesxmetabolism 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aParietal Cells, Gastricxmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylcholines 2aSwine 2aTime Factors 2aUrinary Bladderxmetabolism 0aepithelium1 aRabon, E.C.1 aZeidel, M.L.0 tBiochemistry.g1993 Mar. 16, v. 32, no. 10 p.2459-2468x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00061a0023Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04209naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245016000184300001600344500002400360520265100384650002003035650001903055650002903074650001103103650001703114650001803131650000903149650001603158650000903174650001803183650000903201650001803210650001403228650001103242650001003253650001103263650001403274650001403288650001203302650002303314650001303337650001903350650001303369650001703382650001603399650001003415700001603425700001703441773009103458852000903549856008503558655001203643IND4457512320221122182640.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445751232DNAL7 a224454122pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311100017952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlevenhusen, F.10aEnteric and manure-derived methane and nitrogen emissions as well as metabolic energy losses in cows fed balanced diets based on maize, barley or grass hay  ap. 450-461.  aIncludes references  aRuminant husbandry constitutes the most important source of anthropogenic methane (CH4). In addition to enteric (animal-derived) CH4, excreta are another source of CH4, especially when stored anaerobically. Increasing the proportion of dietary concentrate is often considered as the primary CH4 mitigation option. However, it is unclear whether this is still valid when diets to be compared are energy-balanced. In addition, non-structural carbohydrates and side effects on nitrogen (N) emissions may be important. In this experiment, diet types representing either forage-only or mixed diets were examined for their effects on CH4 and N emissions from animals and their slurries in 18 lactating cows. Apart from a hay-only diet, treatments included two mixed diets consisting of maize stover, pelleted whole maize plants and gluten or barley straw and grain and soy bean meal. The diets were balanced in crude protein and net energy for lactation. After adaptation, data and samples were collected for 8 days including a 2-day CH4 measurement in respiratory chambers. Faeces and urine, combined proportionately according to excretion, were used to determine slurry-derived CH4 and N emissions. Slurry was stored for 15 weeks at either 14 degrees C or 27 degrees C, and temperatures were classified as 'coo' and 'warm', respectively. The low-starch hay-only diet had high organic matter and fibre digestibility and proved to be equally effective on the cows' performance as mixed diets. The enteric CH4 formation remained unaffected by the diet except when related to digested fibre. In this case emission was lowest with the hay-only diet (61 v. 88 to 101 g CH4/kg digested NDF). Feeding the hay diet resulted in the highest slurry-CH4 production after 7 weeks of storage at 14 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and after 15 weeks at 14 degrees C. CH4 emissions were, in general, about 10-fold higher at 27 degrees C compared with 14 degrees C but only after 15 weeks of storage. Urinary N losses were highest with the barley diet and lowest with the maize diet. There was a trend towards similar differences in N losses from the slurry of these cows (significant at 14 degrees C). However, contrary to CH4, slurry-N emissions seemed to be temperature-independent. In conclusion, energetically balanced diets proved to be widely equivalent in their emission potential when combining animal and their slurry, this even at a clearly differing forage : concentrate ratio. The variation in CH4 emission from slurry stored shortly or at cold temperature for 15 weeks was of low importance as such conditions did not support methanogenesis in slurry anyway. 3aadverse effects 3aanimal manures 3aanthropogenic activities 3abarley 3abarley straw 3acarbohydrates 3acorn 3acorn stover 3acows 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afeces 3agluten 3agrass hay 3alactation 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aslurries 3asoybean meal 3atemperature 3aurine1 aKreuzer, M.1 aSoliva, C.R.0 tAnimal.g2011 Mar., v. 5, no. 3 p.450-461dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100017953Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01535naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002000160245006600180300001800246520058400264650001200848650001700860650001100877650001600888700002100904700001300925773009200938852000901030856008101039939003301120945000801153946001301161990002301174655001201197IND9101494320221122154615.0910321e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910149432DNAL7 a185882222pmid7 a10.1002/bit.2603409152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarzebski, A.B.10aModeling of ethanol fermentation at high yeast concentrations  ap. 1225-1230.  aThree models of ethanol fermentation at high yeast concentrations were developed and verified by comparing them with experimental data.

They induce mitochondrial dysfunction through caspase dependent and caspase-independent pathways and destroy DNA and the integrity of the nucleus. For gaining a better understanding of the molecular function of granzyme M and its NK cell specificity, structural characterization of this enzyme by molecular modeling as well as its detailed comparison with other granzymes is presented in this study. The study includes mode of action of granzyme M using cationic binding sites, substrate specificity, post-translational structural modification and its functional relationship and interaction of the enzyme with inhibitor in an attempt to explore how the activity of human granzyme M is controlled under physiological conditions. It is concluded from the present study that the post-translational modification, including Oglycosylation of serine, phosphorylation of serine and threonine and myristoylation of glycine, play an important role in the interaction of enzyme with the cell surface membrane and regulate protein trafficking and stability. Phosphorylated serine and threonine also plays a role in tumor elimination, viral clearance and tissue repair. In Gzm M there are cationic sites, cs1 and cs2 that may participate in binding of Gzm M to the cell surface, thereby promoting its uptake and eventual release into the cytoplasm. Gzm M shows apoptotic activity both by caspase dependent and independent pathways. Modeling of inhibitors bound to the granzyme active site shows that the dimer also contributes to substrate specificity in a unique manner by extending the active-site cleft. 3aDNA 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3acaspases 3acytoplasm 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein transport 3aserine 3asubstrate specificity 3athreonine 3atissue repair 2aApoptosisxphysiology 2aBinding Sites 2aGranzymesxantagonists & inhibitorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aIsoenzymesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSerine Proteinase Inhibitorsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aSaleem, Mahjabeen1 aAkhtar, Muhammad Saleem1 aSalim, Asmat0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.2953-2960dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-9959-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03278naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002900110040001800139100002000157245011500177300001900292500001500311520161200326650002001938650001201958650002901970650001501999650002002014650004002034650005402074650002402128650002402152650003202176650006602208650002802274650002102302650002402323650004102347650002602388650004702414653001702461700001602478700002002494773007602514852000902590856007902599930003302678945001302711946001302724990002302737655001202760IND2035836520221122084426.0931117e19921201dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203583652DNAL7 a14459102pmid7 a10.1021/bi00162a0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomkinson, A.E.10aDNA ligase I from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: physical and biochemical characterization of the CDC9 gene product  ap. 11762-1171.  a2019-12-04  aGenetic studies have previously demonstrated that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC9 gene product, which is functionally homologous to mammalian DNA ligase I, is required for DNA replication and is also involved in DNA repair and genetic recombination. In the present study we have purified the yeast enzyme. When measured under denaturing conditions, Cdc9 protein has a polypeptide molecular mass of 87 kDa. The native form of the enzyme is an 80-kDa asymmetric monomer. Both estimates are in good agreement with the Mr = 84 406 predicted from the translated sequence of the CDC9 gene. Cdc9 DNA ligase acts via the same basic reaction mechanism employed by all known ATP-dependent DNA ligases. The catalytic functions reside in a 70-kDa C-terminal domain that is conserved in mammalian DNA ligase I and in Cdc17 DNA ligase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The ATP analog ATP alpha S inhibits the ligation reaction, although Cdc9 protein does form an enzyme-thioadenylate intermediate. Since Cdc9 DNA ligase exhibited the same substrate specificity as mammalian DNA ligase I, this enzyme can be considered to be the DNA ligase I of S. cerevisiae. There is genetic evidence suggesting that DNA ligase may be directly involved in error-prone DNA repair. We examined the ability of Cdc9 DNA ligase, to join nicks with mismatches at the termini. Mismatches at the 5' termini of nicks had very little effect on ligation, whereas mismatches opposite a purine at 3' termini inhibited DNA ligation. The joining of DNA molecules with mismatched termini by DNA ligase may be responsible for the generation of mutations. 3aDNA replication 3aenzymes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aDNA repair 3aenzyme activity 2aAdenosine Monophosphatexmetabolism 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDNAxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDNA Ligasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aThionucleotidesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0apurification1 aTappe, N.J.1 aFriedberg, E.C.0 tBiochemistry.g1992 Dec. 1, v. 31, no. 47 p.11762-1171x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi00162a0133Available from publisher's Web site  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03820naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245012300143300001400266500001500280520211600295650001902411650002402430650002302454650002302477650003002500650002802530650001302558650001802571650001902589650002502608650001802633650002202651650002802673650001402701650002102715650002202736650005602758650003102814650003202845650002402877650005502901653001702956653002802973653003903001700001703040700001403057700001703071773010003088852000903188930003303197945001303230946001103243655001203254IND2332876720221122084428.0030603e20030525ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233287672DNAL7 a126725892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlixt, Y.10aInterlaboratory random amplified polymorphic DNA typing of Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. enterocolitica-like bacteria  ap. 15-26.  a2019-12-05  aA random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) protocol was developed for interlaboratory use to discriminate food-borne Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 from other serogroups of Y. enterocolitica and from Y. enterocolitica-like species. Factors that were studied regarding the RAPD performance were choice of primers and concentration of PCR reagents (template DNA, MgCl2, primer and Taq DNA polymerase). A factorial design experiment was performed to identify the optimal concentrations of the PCR reagents. The experiment showed that the concentration of the PCR reagents tested significantly affected the number of distinct RAPD products. The RAPD protocol developed was evaluated regarding its discrimination ability using 70 different Yersinia strains. Cluster analysis of the RAPD patterns obtained revealed three main groups representing (i) Y. pseudotuberculosis, (ii) Y. enterocolitica and (iii) Y. kristensenii, Y. frederiksenii, Y. intermedia and Y. ruckeri. Within the Y. enterocolitica group, the European serovar (O:3) and the North American serovar (O:8) could be clearly separated from each other. All Y. enterocolitica O:3 strains were found in one cluster which could be further divided into two subclusters, representing the geographical origin of the isolates. Thus, one of the subclusters contained Y. enterocolitica O:3 strains originating from Sweden, Finland and Norway, while Danish and English O:3 strains were found in another subcluster together with O:9 and O:5,27 strains. The repeatability (intralaboratory) and reproducibility (interlaboratory) of the RAPD protocol were tested using 15 Yersinia strains representing different RAPD patterns. The intralaboratory and the interlaboratory studies gave similarity coefficients of the same magnitude (generally >70%) for the individual strains. In the present study, it was shown that interreproducible RAPD results could be it was shown that interreproducible RAPD results could be achieved by appropriate optimisation of the RAPD protocol. Furthermore, the study reflects the heterogeneous genetic diversity of the Y. enterocolitica species. 3aclassification 3aexperimental design 3amagnesium chloride 3afood contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amicrobial contamination 3aplasmids 3arapid methods 3afood pathogens 3anucleotide sequences 3arepeatability 3agenetic variation 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3avirulence 2aCluster Analysis 2aGenetic Variation 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Techniquexmethods 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aYersinia enterocoliticaxclassificationxgenetics. 0aoptimization 0amolecular sequence data 0apolymerase chain reaction reagents1 aKnutsson, R.1 aBorch, E.1 aRadstrom, P.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2003 May 25, v. 83, no. 1 p.15-26x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle03236naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245015100183300001800334500002400352520139100376650002101767650002801788650001701816650002001833650001401853650001001867650001501877650001201892650002201904650003701926650002101963650002201984650001402006650002702020650002802047650001202075650003602087650003302123650002102156650002502177650004502202650002202247650002802269650001302297650002502310650002602335650001602361650002402377700002602401700001802427773010702445852000902552856008502561655001202646IND4457560120221122065518.0110506s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445756012DNAL7 a201275212pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-010-9954-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhurana, Jyoti10aEngineering of Bacillus lipase by directed evolution for enhanced thermal stability: effect of isoleucine to threonine mutation at protein surface  ap. 2919-2926.  aIncludes references  aA lip gene from a Bacillus isolate was cloned and expressed in E. coli. By thermal denaturation analysis, T₁/₂ of lipase was observed to be 7 min at 50°C with less than 10% activity after 1 h incubation at 50°C. To expand the functionality of cloned lipase, attempts have been made to create thermostable variants of lip gene. A lipase variant with an isoleucine to threonine amino acid substitution at the protein surface was isolated that demonstrated higher thermostability than its wild type predecessor. To explore the structure-function relationship, the lip gene product of wild type (WT) and mutant was characterized in detail. The mutation enhanced the specific activity of enzyme by 2-folds when compared with WT. The mutant enzyme showed enhanced T₁/₂ of 21 min at 50°C. The kinetic parameters of the mutant enzyme were significantly altered. The mutant enzyme displayed higher affinity for substrate (decreased K m ) in comparison to the wild type. The k cat and catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m ) of mutant were also enhanced by two and five times, respectively, as compared with the WT. The mutation resides on the part of helix which is exposed to the solvent and away from the catalytic triad. The replacement of a solvent exposed hydrophobic residue (Ile) in WT with a hydrophilic residue (Thr) in mutant might impart thermostability to the protein structure. 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid substitution 3adenaturation 3aenzyme activity 3aevolution 3agenes 3aisoleucine 3amutants 3aprotein structure 3astructure-activity relationships 3asurface proteins 3athermal stability 3athreonine 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnimals 2aBacillusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aDirected Molecular Evolution 2aEnzyme Stability 2aIsoleucinexgenetics 2aLipasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aProtein Conformation 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 2aThreoninexgenetics1 aSiṃha, Raṇavīra.1 aKaur, Jagdeep0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 June, v. 38, no. 5 p.2919-2926dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-9954-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02504naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009700129300001600226520150800242650001401750650001601764650001801780650002301798650001001821650000901831650001101840650001701851650002401868653001601892700001601908700001501924700002201939773010301961852000902064930003302073945001302106946001102119655001202130IND2332668320221122053204.0030520e20020505ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233266832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeger, S. de.12aA collaborative study to validate novel field immunoassay kits for rapid mycotoxin detection  ap. 135-142.  aKits designed to detect ochratoxin A (OA) and T-2 toxin by a membrane-based flow-through enzyme immunoassay were studied collaboratively by screening cereals (wheat, rye, maize and barley) for the presence of these mycotoxins. Sample preparation and test procedure were clearly described in the instruction leaflets included in the kits. A simple methanol-based extraction followed by filtration and dilution steps was prescribed. Reagents were successively pipetted to the membrane of the device, then colour development was evaluated visually. Limits of detection for the ochratoxin A and T-2 toxin tests were 4 and 50 microgram kg(-1), respectively. Five laboratories took part in the first stage of this study, and five more joined the second stage. Cereal samples (blank, spiked or inoculated) were shipped with the kits to the participating laboratories, while results obtained were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for ochratoxin A and T-2 toxin, respectively. Some initial difficulties were encountered. In the second stage, four ochratoxin A and four T-2 toxin kits were used by 10 collaborators to analyse 21 cereal samples. For the ochratoxin A kits, the percentage of false positive and false negative results were 2% and 4%, respectively. The results of one T-2 toxin kit were outliers and when excluded, the overall percentage false positive and false negative results were 6% and 3%, respectively. 3aT-2 toxin 3aochratoxins 3arapid methods 3afood contamination 3awheat 3acorn 3abarley 3alaboratories 3aenzyme immunoassays 0acomparisons1 aSibanda, L.1 aDesmet, A.1 aPeteghem, C. van.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2002 May 5, v. 75, no. 1/2 p.135-142x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle00681naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245001400129300001400143520009900157650002600256653002400282773007200306852000900378939003300387945000800420946001100428655001200439991616862890742620221122053318.0840305s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840013562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiagi, F.10aAmebiasis  ap. 20-27.  aEntamoeba histolytica, human, current therapeutic management of various clinical forms, review 3aEntamoeba histolytica 0aTreatment / Control0 tAntibiotics and chemotherapy.g1981, v. 30 p.20-27x0066-47587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840305c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle00802naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245004200137300001600179520011700195650002600312650002000338653002400358700001900382773007400401852000900475939003300484945000800517946001100525655001200536991616862010742620221122042506.0840305s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840013612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeingassner, J.G.10aIntestinal and urogenital flagellates  ap. 163-202.  aGiardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, review of experimental and clinical chemotherapy, extensive bibliography 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3aGiardia lamblia 0aTreatment / Control1 aHeyworth, P.G.0 tAntibiotics and chemotherapy.g1981, v. 30 p.163-202x0066-47587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840305c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01074naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245001300133300001500146520012100161650001800282650002000300650002200320650002200342650002100364650002500385650003200410650002800442650002300470653004100493653002400534700002000558773007300578852000900651939003300660945000800693946001100701655001200712991616861460742620221122031556.0840305s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840013582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGemmell, M.A.10aCestodes  ap. 54-114.  acestodes affecting humans, domestic animals, and laboratory animals, current therapy, extensive bibliography, review 3aTaenia solium 3aTaenia saginata 3aTaenia pisiformis 3aTaenia hydatigena 3aHymenolepis nana 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aDipylidium caninum 0aDiphyllobothrium pacificum (Cestoda) 0aTreatment / Control1 aJohnstone, P.D.0 tAntibiotics and chemotherapy.g1981, v. 30 p.54-114x0066-47587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840305c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02775naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245017300166300001600339520152500355650001301880650001901893653001601912653001701928653001401945700001701959700001701976700002201993700002002015700002102035700002002056700001702076700002502093773013102118852000902249856008502258939003302343946001302376655001202389IND4449597420221121223546.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444959742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00280-010-1348-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Marisa E. 12aA phase I study of the biomodulation of capecitabine by docetaxel and gemcitabine (mGTX) in previously untreated patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  ap. 511-517.  aBackground Pancreas cancer remains a formidable challenge. We report the first prospective analysis of the 3-drug combination of gemcitabine (G), docetaxel (T) and capecitabine (X) (mGTX) with schedule modification to maximize biomodulation of X. Methods We conducted a dose escalation study of mGTX in first-line treatment of metastatic pancreas cancer using three dose levels (DL 1-3). Patients received docetaxel on days 1 and 8, gemcitabine on days 8 and 15, and capecitabine on days 8 through 21. Gemcitabine dose was fixed at 750 mg/m² over 75 min, capecitabine was given twice daily and escalated from 500 to 650 mg/m² at DL2 and docetaxel increased from 30 to 36 mg/m² at DL3. Results Twenty-one patients (18 evaluable) were enrolled in the study. MTD was reached at DL3 and one DLT was observed at DL2 (prolonged neutropenia). The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were leukopenia (29%) and neutropenia (29%) and fatigue (25%). Tumor growth control rate was 80% (11% PR; 69% SD lasting at least 3 months). Median progression-free-survival was 5.8 months (95% CI 2.7, 10.6) and median overall survival was 7.4 months (95% CI 3.8 16.8). CA 19-9 decreased by at least 50% from baseline in half the patients. Conclusion mGTX demonstrates acceptable tolerability with interesting activity in patients with pancreatic cancer. The recommended doses for phase II studies are docetaxel 36 mg/m² days 1 and 8, gemcitabine 750 mg/m² over 75 min days 8 and 15, and capecitabine 625 mg/m² twice daily days 8 through 21. 3apancreas 3aadenocarcinoma 0aGemcitabine 0aCapecitabine 0aDocetaxel1 aLi, Xiaobai 1 aKim, Sharon 1 aCampbell, Angela 1 aCuller, Kristy 1 aBloomston, Mark 1 aZalupski, Mark 1 aHejna, Gwen 1 aBekaii-Saab, Tanios 0 tCancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.g2011 Mar., v. 67, no. 3 p.511-517dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0344-57047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00280-010-1348-33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02924naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245016000172300001600332500002400348520174900372650001702121650000902138650001202147650001002159650001302169650001502182650001202197650001502209650001502224650002302239650001002262651001402272700003002286700002202316773009902338852000902437856009202446655001202538IND4457448720221121060104.0110429s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445744872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02153.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPOL, RODRIGO G.10aInfluence of temporal fluctuations in seed abundance on the foraging behaviour of harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex spp.) in the central Monte desert, Argentina  ap. 320-328.  aIncludes references  aThe simultaneous study of the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour, diet and seed abundance is essential to assess the way in which resources affect the behaviour and ecology of harvester ants. Here, we evaluate how fluctuations in grass seed abundance during three consecutive growing seasons influenced the foraging behaviour and diet of the harvester ants Pogonomyrmex rastratus, P. mendozanus and P. inermis in the central Monte desert, Argentina. Seed abundance of the most consumed grasses varied greatly through ant activity season, and ants altered their foraging behaviour in response to those changes. Foragers spent more time travelling and searching for food, and their foraging trips took longer during the low seed availability season. Foraging distance was very similar among species and, contrary to our expectations, did not vary between seasons. Foraging success of P. rastratus and P. inermis increased during the high availability season. This matched the seasonal pattern of foraging activity, suggesting that colonies may detect seed abundance and regulate their foraging effort with the rate of forager success. Although grass seeds were the main item in the diet of the three species, P. mendozanus, and to a lesser extent P. rastratus, turned more generalist when grass seeds were scarce. In contrast, P. inermis showed a very narrow diet breadth, only harvesting grass seeds in both seasons. Our results indicate the relevance of seed availability on foraging behaviour of harvester ants, which should be taken into account when predicting and evaluating the effect of ants on seed resources as well as numerical responses of harvester ant populations to the temporal and spatial variations in grass seed abundance. 3aPogonomyrmex 3adiet 3aecology 3afoods 3aforaging 3agrass seed 3agrasses 3aharvesting 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3aseeds 3aArgentina1 aLOPEZ DE CASENAVE, JAVIER1 aPIRK, GABRIELA I.0 tAustral ecology.g2011 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.320-328dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2010.02153.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01473naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245010700133300001600240500013600256520037100392650002300763650001000786650001300796650001000809653002400819653002100843653001800864700002000882700001800902700002500920700001600945773008900961852000901050939003301059945000801092946001101100655001201111991616853110742620221121044639.0830913s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830080642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEling, W.M.C.10aEndomyocardial lesion and endomyocardial fibrosis in experimental malaria (Plasmodium berghei) in mice  ap. 218-229.  aColloquium on the pathogenesis of disease induced through parasites, as compared to other noxious agents, Antwerp, Dec 11-13, 1981.  aPlasmodium berghei induced endocardial thrombosis in mice with primary lethal infection and endomyocardial fibrosis in infected and subsequently chemotherapeutically treated as well as chronically patent mice, these changes occurred in mice of different C57B1 strains (but not in mice of other strains), F1 offspring of C57B1 and other strains also developed lesions 3aPlasmodium berghei 3ahosts 3agenetics 3aheart 0aPathology, Protozoa 0aResistance, Host 0aStrains, Host1 aJerusalem, C.R.1 aHermsen, C.C.1 aHeinen-Borries, U.J.1 aWeiss, M.L.0 tContributions to microbiology and immunology.g1983, v. 7 p.218-229x0301-30817nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830913c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03314naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100002200138245015100160300001600311500002400327520159100351650002901942650002501971650002201996650001102018650001602029650001602045650002802061650001202089650002502101650001102126650005502137650003902192650001102231650001702242650003902259650001402298650005602312650004102368650004102409650002402450650004102474653002502515653001602540700001802556773011802574852000902692930003302701945002502734946001302759655001202772IND4387096120221121040224.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438709612DNAL7 a172351732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aAbuGhazaleh, A.A.14aThe Effect of Solids Dilution Rate and Oil Source on Trans C18:1 and Conjugated Linoleic Acid Production by Ruminal Microbes in Continuous Culture  ap. 963-969.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of solids dilution rate (SDR) and oil source [soybean oil (SBO) or linseed oil (LSO)] on the ruminal production of trans C18:1 and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). A dual-flow continuous culture system consisting of 4 fermenters was used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design with a factorial arrangement of treatments over 4 consecutive periods of 10 d each. Treatment diets (50:50 forage to concentrate) were fed at 120 g/d of dry matter (DM) in 3 equal portions. The concentrate mix contained 1% fish oil and either 2% SBO or 2% LSO on a DM basis. Treatments were as follows: 1) SBO at 6%/h SDR, 2) SBO at 3%/h SDR, 3) LSO at 6%/h SDR, and 4) LSO at 3%/h SDR. The oil source by SDR interaction was not significant for trans C18:1 and CLA fatty acids. The concentrations of trans C18:1 and vaccenic acid were greater in effluents when diets were supplemented with SBO vs. LSO (37.11 vs. 34.09 and 32.71 vs. 29.70 mg/g of DM, respectively) and at high SDR than low SDR (37.60 vs. 33.61 and 32.72 vs. 29.61 mg/g of DM, respectively). The concentration of cis-9, trans-11 CLA in effluents was also greater with SBO than LSO (0.81 vs. 0.40 mg/g of DM) supplementation and at high SDR than low SDR (0.68 vs. 0.54 mg/g of DM). Biohydrogenation of linoleic acid and linolenic acid increased at higher SDR within each oil treatment. Based on these results, SBO supplementation at high SDR enhances ruminal production of vaccenic acid, and therefore could potentially enhance cis-9, trans-11 CLA in milk fat through synthesis by Δ⁹-desaturase. 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3arumen microorganisms 3atrans fatty acids 3asolids 3alinseed oil 3asoybean oil 3acontinuous fermentation 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosage 2aLactation 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aLinseed Oilxadministration & dosage 2aOleic Acidsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aSoybean Oilxadministration & dosage 0asolids dilution rate 0atrans C18:11 aBuckles, W.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.963-969dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle01982naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010600143300001600249520062700265650002900892650001200921650001600933650002500949650001400974650001700988650002201005650002301027650002001050650004101070650002401111650002501135650002201160650003001182650004101212650002701253653001501280700001401295700001501309700001601324773010601340852000901446930003301455945001301488946001101501655001201512IND2042921720221121025318.0941031e199407  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204292172DNAL7 a79816642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTazuya, K.10aOrigin of the N-1, C-2 and C-2' atoms of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 769-774.  aThe precursor of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamin in S. cerevisiae was studied.

Prospective randomized study. Twenty-six healthy adult domesticated canaries of both sexes, weighing 18.3 ± 1.0 g. In Study 1 an attempt was made to determine the dose of each drug that allowed treated canaries to be laid in dorsal recumbency for at least 5 minutes, i.e. its effective dose. This involved the evaluation of various doses, during which equal volumes of the tested drug were administered slowly into each nostril. In study 2 the onset of action, duration and quality of sedation induced by each drug at its effective dose were evaluated. The efficacy of flumazenil and yohimbine in antagonizing the effects of the sedative drugs was also studied. In study 1 administration of 25 [mu]L per nostril diazepam (5 mg mL[superscript [-]1] solution) or midazolam (5 mg mL[superscript [-]1] solution) to each bird caused adequate sedation within 1-2 minutes; birds did not move when placed in dorsal recumbency. After administration of 12 [mu]L per nostril of either xylazine (20 mg mL[superscript [-]1]) or detomidine (10 mg mL[superscript [-]1]), birds seemed heavily sedated and assumed sternal recumbency but could not be placed in dorsal recumbency. Higher doses of xylazine (0.5 mg per nostril) or detomidine (0.25 mg per nostril) prolonged sedation but did not produce dorsal recumbency. In study 2 in all treatment groups, onset of action was rapid. Duration of dorsal recumbency was significantly longer (p < 0.05) with diazepam (38.4 ± 10.5 minutes) than midazolam (17.1 ± 2.2 minutes). Intranasal flumazenil (2.5 [mu]g per nostril) significantly reduced recumbency time. Duration of sedation was longer with [alpha]₂-agonists compared with benzodiazepines. Detomidine had the longest duration of effect (257.5 ± 1.5 minutes) and midazolam the shortest (36.9 ± 2.4 minutes). Nasally administered flumazenil significantly reduced the duration of sedation with diazepam and midazolam while yohimbine (120 [mu]g per nostril) effectively antagonized the effects of xylazine and detomidine. Intranasal benzodiazepines produce rapid and effective sedation in canaries. Intranasal [alpha]₂ agonists produce sedation but not sustained recumbency. Specific antagonists are also effective when used by this route. Intranasal sedative drug administration is an acceptable alternative method of drug delivery in canaries. 3adetomidine 3aagonists 3aveterinary drugs 3aanesthesia 3aintranasal administration 3adose response 3anormal values 3aantagonists 3adrug evaluation 3axylazine 3ayohimbine 3adosage 3ageneral anesthetics 3asedation 3adrug delivery systems 3adrug interactions 3adiazepam 3acanaries 0abenzodiazepines 0aflumazenil 0amidazolam 0asedatives1 aZare, Payman0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2006 May, v. 33, no. 3 p.143-148dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00244.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/02/28  aNon-US 7aarticle01098naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245011700131300001400248500013600262520014600398650002400544650002000568653003100588700002200619700001900641773008700660852000900747939003300756945000800789946001100797655001200808991616851030742620221121025418.0830912s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830080492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKestens, L.10aClearance of in vitro prepared heterologous antigen-antibody complexes in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni  ap. 63-72.  aColloquium on the pathogenesis of disease induced through parasites, as compared to other noxious agents, Antwerp, Dec 11-13, 1981.  aSchistosoma mansoni, clearance of intravenously administered heterologous antigen-antibody complexes from blood is decreased in infected mice 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aimmunopathology 0aImmunity, Immune complexes1 aVan Marck, E.A.E.1 aGigase, P.L.J.0 tContributions to microbiology and immunology.g1983, v. 7 p.63-72x0301-30817nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830912c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02493naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012500166300001800291500002400309520129700333650001101630650001301641650001101654650001601665650002201681650001401703650001101717650001701728650001301745650001501758650000901773650001001782650002601792650000901818700002301827700001901850700002401869700002201893773008701915852000902002856004802011655001202059IND4412967620221120232439.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441296762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-008-9192-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGleason, Sean M.10aCyclone Effects on the Structure and Production of a Tropical Upland Rainforest: Implications for Life-History Tradeoffs  ap. 1277-1290.  aIncludes references  aWind is known to alter the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. Because the intensity and frequency of severe wind events are likely to increase, it is important to understand the species- and substrate-specific effects of these disturbances. We assessed the structure and production among 63 species of trees in an Australian tropical rainforest before and after Cyclone Larry (March 2006). We assessed forest occurring on two different substrates: nutrient-poor schist and relatively nutrient-rich basalt. Leaf area reduction and stem breakage were markedly variable among species, but were more evident on basalt soils than schist soils, and were positively correlated with leaf N and P. In the 18-month period following the cyclone, litterfall, stem biomass increment, and ANPP were 44, 20, and 27% of pre-cyclone measurements and did not differ between soils. More severe modification of leaves, branches, and stems on basalt soils, relative to schist soils, suggests that trees/species growing on nutrient-limited soils are less susceptible to high winds. Disturbance regime and resource availability are likely to interact, creating potential plant strategies that increase fitness either by enhanced investments in carbon or enhanced investments in nitrogen and phosphorus. 3abasalt 3abranches 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3aforest ecosystems 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alife history 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3awind1 aWilliams, Laura J.1 aRead, Jennifer1 aMetcalfe, Daniel J.1 aBaker, Patrick J.0 tEcosystems.g2008 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.1277-1290dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-008-9192-6 7aarticle03317naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001900179245009200198300001400290500002400304500001500328520169000343650001502033650001802048650002902066650001102095650002402106650001402130650002202144650002202166650003202188650001202220650001802232650001102250650002802261650001902289650001802308650003802326653002202364653002302386653002602409700001202435700001902447700002002466700001602486773009402502852000902596856007502605930003302680945002502713946001302738655001202751IND4379421420221120213402.0060407e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437942142DNAL7 a160022562pmid7 a10.1016/j.domaniend.2005.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL6001 aBradford, B.J.10aPropionate is not an important regulator of plasma leptin concentration in dairy cattle  ap. 65-75.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPropionate was recently shown to increase leptin synthesis in rodents. To determine if a similar effect occurs in ruminants, propionate was administered to lactating dairy cows. In experiment 1, 31 cows were given an intrajugular Na propionate bolus (1040 micromol/kg body weight), increasing plasma propionate from 160 to 5680 micromolar and plasma insulin from 6.8 to 77.8 micro international units/mL. Plasma leptin concentration decreased from 2.11 ng/mL before bolus to 1.99 ng/mL after dosing (P < 0.05) with no differences in leptin concentrations at 20, 50, and 100 min post-bolus (P > 0.10). In experiment 2, 12 cows were used in a duplicated 6 x 6 Latin square experiment to assess the dose-response effect of ruminal propionate infusion on plasma leptin concentration. Sodium propionate was infused at rates of 0, 260, 520, 780, 1040, or 1300 mmol/h, while total short-chain fatty acid infusion rate was held constant at 1300 mmol/h by addition of Na acetate to the infusate. Coccygeal blood was sampled following 18 h of infusion. Increasing the rate of propionate infusion linearly increased plasma propionate concentration from 180 to 330 micromolar (P < 0.001) and plasma insulin concentration from 6.7 to 9.1 micro international units/mL (P < 0.05). There was a quadratic response in plasma leptin concentration (P = 0.04) with a maximum at 780 mmol/h propionate, but leptin concentrations increased by no more than 8% relative to the 0 mmol/h propionate infusion. Leptin concentrations were correlated with insulin concentrations but not with propionate concentrations in plasma. Propionate is not a physiological regulator of leptin secretion in lactating dairy cows. 3adairy cows 3adose response 3aphysiological regulation 3aleptin 3aapplication methods 3alactation 3asodium propionate 3ainsulin secretion 3aintraruminal administration 2aAnimals 2aCattlexblood 2aFemale 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aPropionatesxbloodxpharmacology. 0ahormone secretion 0aintrajugular bolus 0aintraruminal infusion1 aOba, M.1 aEhrhardt, R.A.1 aBoisclair, Y.R.1 aAllen, M.S.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2006 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.65-75dDomendox0739-72407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2005.05.0073electronic resource  a20060421b20060529c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle03745naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245006300213300001600276500002400292500001500316520163500331650001701966650001901983650000902002650001602011650001402027650001202041650001402053650001502067650001302082650001702095650001602112650003202128650001402160650004102174650003402215650001402249650001202263650004902275650000902324650001102333650003602344650002502380650000902405650002402414650004402438650002502482650002602507650002202533651002502555653002202580653001902602653002802621653002002649653001902669700002702688700002202715773010202737852000902839856009202848930003302940945002502973946001302998655001203011IND4379451220221120202927.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437945122DNAL7 a166350062pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00137.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aHobson, Howard Phil10aSurgery of Metastatic Anal Sac Adenocarcinoma in Five Dogs  ap. 267-270.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo identify survival and morbidity information after surgery for metastases from apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinomas (AGACA). Retrospective study. Five dogs with AGACA. Medical records of dogs that had surgery for treatment of metastatic AGACA between 1993 and 2003 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion required that dogs had lymphadenectomy, with or without further debulking, as part of their treatment for metastatic AGACA and that the tissue was histologically confirmed as consistent with the primary AGACA. Signalment, history, physical examination findings, clinicopathologic data, imaging findings, surgical complications, number of surgeries, survival times, and cause of death were recorded. All dogs had a complete blood count, serum biochemical profile, serum electrolytes, 3-projection thoracic radiographs, abdominal radiographs and/or abdominal ultrasonography, and histologic confirmation of metastatic AGACA invading the regional lymph nodes and caudal abdomen. No surgical complications occurred. Three dogs were euthanatized; median survival, 20.6 months. One dog was alive for 19 months postoperatively. One dog had 5 sequential surgical procedures: 1 iliac lymphadenectomy and 4 debulking procedures of metastatic neoplastic tissue around and dorsal to the iliac vessels extending into the pelvic cavity, and was alive 54 months after initial surgery. Dogs with anal sac adenocarcinoma metastases to the iliac lymph nodes can experience long-term survival after surgical excision of the metastatic lesion. Lymphadenectomy may afford long-term survival to patients with metastatic anal sac adenocarcinoma. 3adog diseases 3aadenocarcinoma 3adogs 3aanal glands 3aremission 3arelapse 3amorbidity 3ametastasis 3aexcision 3acase studies 3alymph nodes 3apostoperative complications 3amortality 2aAdenocarcinomaxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aAnal Gland Neoplasmsxsurgery 2aAnal Sacs 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxmortalityxpathologyxsurgery. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aLymph Node Excisionxveterinary 2aLymphatic Metastasis 2aMale 2aNeoplasm Metastasis 2aPostoperative Complicationsxveterinary 2aRecordsxveterinary. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSurvival Analysis 0aTexasxepidemiology. 0ailiac lymph nodes 0aapocrine gland 0aanal sac adenocarcinoma 0aexocrine glands 0adisease course1 aBrown, Marjorie Raquel1 aRogers, Kenita S.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2006 Apr., v. 35, no. 3 p.267-270dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00137.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle03925naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001400147245008900161300001600250500002400266500001500290520230700305650001502612650001802627650001902645650001302664650001002677650001502687650001202702650001102714650004902725650001102774650001402785650006502799650007302864650003102937650002002968650001802988650002003006650001303026653002503039653001403064653002603078653001703104700001903121700002103140773011803161852000903279930003303288945002503321946001303346655001203359IND4387090420221120202848.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438709042DNAL7 a172351442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL8401 aRovai, M.10aIncontinentia Lactis: Physiology and Anatomy Conducive to Milk Leakage in Dairy Cows  ap. 682-690.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIncontinentia lactis is a possible predisposing factor for an elevated level of intramammary infection. The goal of the present study was to investigate possible causes of incontinentia lactis in dairy cows. Two farms that differed in breed composition, but that had similar average milk yields were studied: herd A, 28 kg/d, 31 Red Holstein cows; and herd B, 26 kg/d, 16 Brown Swiss cows. Herd A was classified into 2 groups: incontinentia lactis (ILA group) and control, whereas herd B was exclusively a control herd. Milk samples that represented foremilk and the main milk fraction were collected during 4 milking sessions. In addition, milk leakage samples from the ILA group were collected at different time intervals from 0 to 5 h before milking. Measurements of the teat, milk flow, fractions of cisternal and alveolar milk, intramammary pressure, and blood oxytocin pattern also were obtained. The ILA cows did not have differences in fat content between milk leakage and cisternal milk fraction. Milk fat content, however, increased during milking in response to continuous milk ejection (1.95, 1.99, and 4.61% for milk leakage, cisternal, and main milk samples, respectively). Teat canals were 9% shorter in the ILA cows, which showed greater milk yield, peak, and average flow rates. Quarter cisternal milk yield of ILA cows tended to be greater (0.50 vs. 0.23 and 0.28 kg for ILA and controls from herds A and B, respectively), whereas percentages of cistern milk and alveolar milk did not differ from controls. The greater pressure in the ILA group, both before and after manual udder stimulation (ILA: 4.0 and 6.4 kPa; control: 2.0 and 5.0 kPa, respectively), could be an important cause for the leakage. Nevertheless, the increase in IMP that occurred after udder preparation affirms that milk ejection occurred in response to the tactile teat stimulation, but not before the onset of leakage. Blood oxytocin concentration in ILA cows was low until the start of udder preparation and increased in response to the milking stimulus (reaffirming the hypothesis that milk leakage occurred in the absence of milk ejection). In conclusion, milk losses by leakage are likely due to the large amount of cisternal milk, which creates pressure and causes leakage, in the absence of milk ejection. 3adairy cows 3amilk ejection 3amilk secretion 3aoxytocin 3ateats 3amilk yield 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLactation Disordersxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxpathologyxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aMastitis, Bovinexetiology 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Ejection 2aOxytocinxblood 2aPressure 0aincontinentia lactis 0alactation 0aintramammary pressure 0amilk leakage1 aKollmann, M.T.1 aBruckmaier, R.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.682-690dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle03400naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001900147245012100166300001600287500002400303520168800327650001602015650001402031650001502045650001402060650002302074650001802097650001002115650002202125650002102147650001202168650001102180650002202191650002002213650003102233650004302264650004602307650002202353650002102375650002002396650002802416650001602444650001402460650002102474650001802495650002802513653002502541700001902566700001502585773011802600852000902718930003302727945002502760946001302785655001202798IND4387090820221120202908.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438709082DNAL7 a172351462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL6001 aMabjeesh, S.J.10aEffect of Photoperiod in the Third Trimester of Gestation on Milk Production and Circulating Hormones in Dairy Goats  ap. 699-705.  aIncludes references  aMultiparous Israeli Saanen goats (n = 8) were blocked at dry off (approximately 45 d prepartum) into 2 treatments of 4 goats each based on body weight (BW), previous milk production, and the number of detected embryos in utero.

Milk protein and lactose contents were similar in both treatments and averaged 3.61 and 4.88%, respectively, whereas milk fat was greater in the long-day treatment (4.80 vs. 4.22%). Plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 was greater in the long-day treatment (149 vs. 73 ng/mL) during the dry period than in the short-day treatment, but was similar postkidding, averaging 76 ng/mL. Concentrations of triiodothyronine in plasma were similar in both treatments during the dry period, but greater during lactation in the short-day treatment (122.1 vs. 94.1 ng/mL). Plasma prolactin was greater in the long-day than in the short-day treatment during the dry period (28.0 vs. 17.5 ng/mL), whereas it was similar throughout lactation (11.7 ng/mL). These data support the idea that greater milk production in goats exposed to short days during the dry period is not explained by differences in feed intake or increased secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1. 3aphotoperiod 3apregnancy 3amilk yield 3aprolactin 3ahormone metabolism 3adairy animals 3agoats 3adry matter intake 3atriiodothyronine 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aHormonesxblood 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aLactationxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aLactosexanalysis 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPhotoperiod 2aPregnancy 2aProlactinxblood 2aSodiumxblood 2aTriiodothyroninexblood 0acirculating hormones1 aGal-Garber, O.1 aShamay, A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.699-705dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle03228naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245006600187300001600253500002400269500001500293520168800308650001601996650001302012650001002025650001802035650002702053650001402080650001402094650001702108650002302125650001202148650002502160650001202185650004302197650002802240650003602268650004002304650002602344651001802370651001902388653003602407700002002443700001902463700002102482700001402503773011702517852000902634856005502643655001202698IND4457969220221120190633.0110513e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445796922DNAL7 a210734922pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2010.00918.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIMPS, N.W.10aFirst report of the repellency of 2-tridecanone against ticks  ap. 202-208.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a2-Tridecanone and 2-undecanone are both found naturally in the trichomes of wild tomato plants and are important in plant resistance to herbivory. 2-Undecanone is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered active ingredient in the commercially available arthropod repellent, BioUD®. The goal of this study was to examine the tick repellency of 2-tridecanone. Two-choice bioassays were conducted using 8% 2-tridecanone vs. the repellent carrier (absolute ethanol) and compared with two-choice studies using 8% 2-undecanone vs. absolute ethanol. Unfed, host-seeking adult (mixed sex) Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) and Dermacentor variabilis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) were used to evaluate repellency and time to repellent failure at room temperature. The present study shows in filter paper assays (0.63 mg test compound/cm²) that 2-tridecanone was 87% repellent to A. americanum at 12 h after application, but had no statistically significant repellency at 15 h and 24 h, and was 72% repellent to D. variabilis at 15 h, but had no statistically significant repellency at 24 h. By contrast, 2-undecanone was 74% and 75% repellent to A. americanum and D. variabilis, respectively, at 2 h after application, but no statistically significant repellency was noted at 2.5 h and 3 h. In two-choice assays on cheesecloth, 2-tridecanone at 0.25 mg/cm² was 85% repellent to A. americanum 6 h after application, demonstrating its potential use as an arthropod repellent that can be used on clothing without the need for formulation. No statistically significant repellency was found at 9 h or 12 h. The potential use of 2-tridecanone as a tick repellent is discussed. 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3aticks 3a2-tridecanone 3aDermacentor variabilis 3atrichomes 3abioassays 3ahost seeking 3aactive ingredients 3aethanol 3aAmblyomma americanum 2aAnimals 2aDermacentorxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsect Repellentsxpharmacology 2aIxodidaexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aKetonesxpharmacology 3aUnited States 0aNorth Carolina 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aBISSINGER, B.W.1 aAPPERSON, C.S.1 aSONENSHINE, D.E.1 aROE, R.M.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2011 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.202-208dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2010.00918.x 7aarticle04191naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001500156245012200171300001600293500002400309500001500333520221900348650001802567650001802585650001002603650002102613650001702634650002202651650002102673650001402694650001102708650002302719650001202742650002202754650001502776650003202791650002102823650003802844650002302882650001102905650002202916650002202938650002102960650003802981650003103019650002803050650002403078650003803102650001903140653001103159653001703170700001503187700001603202700001703218700001503235700001803250700001503268773011803283852000903401930003303410945002503443946001303468655001203481IND4387092720221120181920.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438709272DNAL7 a172351562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL832 0aQ5011 aMoroni, P.10aInfluence of Estrus of Dairy Goats on Somatic Cell Count, Milk Traits, and Sex Steroid Receptors in the Mammary Gland  ap. 790-797.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo experiments were conducted to study the effect of the stage of a spontaneous estrus cycle on milk yield and constituents [somatic cell count (SCC), fat, protein, caseins, lactose, and urea content] and on estrogen receptor-α (ERα ) and progesterone receptor (PR) immunostaining in the mammary gland. In experiment I, the major components of milk and SCC were monitored weekly in 80 lactating Saanen goats for 6 wk, whereas detection of estrus was daily. In experiment II, milk samples were collected daily for SCC determination during 1 spontaneous estrus (d 0) until the second spontaneous estrus in 14 Saanen goats. The day of the estrous cycle was confirmed by plasma progesterone and 17β-estradiol levels. Immunoreactivity of ERα and PR was analyzed in mammary gland samples of 8 Saanen goats (d 0, n = 4; d 10, n = 4) and the number of positive nuclei and intensity of the staining were evaluated in 1,000 cells. In experiment I, milk casein and protein percentages were significantly affected by the stage of estrous cycle; during proestrus and estrus, these variables were higher (3.32 ± 0.06 and 4.44 ± 0.08) than during metestrus (3.03 ± 0.07 and 4.07 ± 0.10), but not higher than during diestrus (3.23 ± 0.06 and 4.35 ± 0.09, respectively). In experiment II, daily measurement of SCC revealed higher levels at estrus (7,195 ± 672 x 10³ cells/mL) and a decline toward the luteal phase (1,694 ± 672 ± 10³ cells/mL). Estrogen receptor-α and PR immunostaining were exclusively detected on epithelial cells. The percentage of positive nuclei to ERα was higher on d 0 than on d 10 (75.4 ± 8.8 vs. 68.3 ± 8.8%), but no change was observed for PR (4.0 ± 0.3 vs. 3.5 ± 0.4%). The average immunostaining intensity for both receptors was greater on d 0 than on d 10 (ERα : 1.44 ± 0.02 vs. 1.35 ± 0.02; PR: 0.079 ± 0.008 vs. 0.057 ± 0.008). The high SCC at estrus in experiment II was associated with high plasma estradiol and low progesterone, suggesting that the increased SCC could be brought about by the estrogen-induced proliferation and exfoliation of epithelial cells. In addition, this action may be supported by the higher sensitivity to estrogens (ERα content) found at d 0. 3amilk analysis 3adairy animals 3agoats 3amilk composition 3asex hormones 3ahormone receptors 3asteroid hormones 3agoat milk 3aestrus 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxanalysis 2aCell Count 2aEpithelial Cellsxchemistry 2aEstradiolxblood 2aEstrogen Receptor alphaxanalysis 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aLactosexanalysis 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMammary Glands, Animalxchemistry 2aMilkxchemistryxcytology. 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aProgesteronexblood 2aReceptors, Progesteronexanalysis 2aUreaxanalysis 0atraits 0amilk quality1 aPisoni, G.1 aSavoini, G.1 avan Lier, E.1 aAcuña, S.1 aDamián, J.P.1 aMeikle, A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.790-797dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle03609naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245008800188300001600276500002400292520226600316650001102582650000902593650001702602650001202619650000902631650001102640650005202651650005702703650000902760650005402769650005202823700001702875700001602892700001602908700003202924700001502956700002302971773011702994852000903111856005503120655001203175IND4397969320221120160623.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439796932DNAL7 a180213472pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00784.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihelić, D.10aN.

Besides the commonly described formation patterns of the mentioned nerves, some variations were also found. These variations were not gender-related, but on the other hand we discovered a certain correlation between the variations appearing in the formation of the femoral, obturator and the sciatic nerve. In 74.05% of cases, the femoral nerve was formed from ventral branches of the 4th, 5th and 6th lumbar nerve, and 16.98% of the dogs had the nerve formed from ventral branches of the 3rd, 4th and 5th lumbar nerve. Many dogs (i.e. 2.30%) had the femoral nerve formed from the ventral branches of the 5th, 6th and 7th, the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th or the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th lumbar nerve, respectively. In 1.88% of dogs in particular, the femoral nerve was formed from ventral rami of the 4th and 5th lumbar nerve. In 66.98% of the examined dogs, the obturator nerve was formed from the ventral branches of the 4th, 5th and 6th lumbar nerve, followed by 16.59% of the dogs with the obturator nerve formed from the ventral rami of the 4th and 5th lumbar nerve and 9.43% of dogs in which the nerve was formed from the ventral branches of the 5th and 6th lumbar nerve. In 4.71% of dogs, the obturator nerve was formed from the ventral rami of the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th lumbar nerve, while only 2.30% of the examined dogs had the same nerve formed from the ventral branches of the 5th, 6th and 7th lumbar nerve. The sciatic nerve was formed from ventral branches of the 6th and 7th lumbar nerve and the 1st sacral nerve in 86.79% of the dogs. In 5.18% of cases, the same nerve was formed from a junction of the ventral branches of the 7th lumbar and the 1st and 2nd sacral nerve, and, in the same percentage of cases, it was formed from a junction of ventral branches of the 6th and 7th lumbar nerve and the 1st and 2nd sacral nerve. In 2.83% of the dogs, it was formed from a junction of the ventral branches of the 6th and 7th lumbar and the 1st sacral nerve.

Lee and T. Mitchell-Olds.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBioluminescent colour in the Jamaican click beetle, Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus, is an ideal system for studies moving from gene to landscape to gain a holistic understanding of the molecular, ecological, and historical bases for adaptation. Previous studies have established the genetics of bioluminescent colour variation in the beetle to the level of the nucleotide base pair in the target gene luciferase. Three different luciferase colour alleles affecting ventral light organ colour [yellow-green (vYG), yellow (vYE), and orange (vOR)] were found segregating in P. plagiophthalamus populations. These alleles differ from each other in a number of replacement mutations (14 total), the majority of which (11) have a measurable effect on colour. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a long-term adaptive trend on Jamaica towards longer wavelength bioluminescence, culminating in the most recently derived vOR allele. Here, we further investigate the historical and geographic context of adaptive colour evolution by testing a vicariance model for the origins of the extant ventral light organ polymorphism: that the vOR allele arose and differentiated in an isolated deme on the east side of Jamaica before spreading westward. Comparisons of colour phenotypes, luciferase coding sequences, the third intron of the gene, mtDNA, and microsatellite data provided evidence for past population subdivision on Jamaica and ongoing gene flow, as has been found for other island endemics. However, the pattern of differentiation supported the allopatric divergence of vYG and vYE alleles. The vOR gene appears to have arisen relatively recently from a vYE precursor and postdates the period of major biogeographic isolation. We discuss the implications of the results for discerning ecological causation in the adaptive sequence from nucleotide to landscape to population change for bioluminescent colour. 3ageographical distribution 3aElateridae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3amitochondrial DNA 3azoogeography 3aluciferase 3aphylogeny 3amutation 3agene flow 3acolor 3abioluminescence 3aintrons 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxclassificationxgenetics. 2aColor 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aGeography 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aLuciferasesxgenetics 2aLuminescence 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhylogeny 3aJamaica 0aJamaica 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0areplacement mutations 0aPyrophorus plagiophthalamus1 aFeder, Jeffrey L.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Apr., v. 15, no. 5 p.1393-1404dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02793.x3electronic resource  a20060425b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002200186245011800208300001600326500002400342506007600366520112100442506003701563650001901600650000801619650001701627650001801644650002101662650003001683650001501713650001501728650001801743650002801761650002701789650001001816650001901826650000801845650001101853650003701864650001801901650001001919650003001929650001201959650004601971650004102017650003002058650002802088650002702116650002202143650002602165650003302191650003102224650003102255650004402286650002802330650002902358650003702387700002102424700002702445700002002472773010102492852000902593856004802602655001202650IND4424935720221207133912.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442493572DNAL7 a194490882pmid7 aPMC27761622pmcid7 a10.1007/s10265-009-0237-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatzinger, Astrid10aSalicylic acid and salicylic acid glucoside in xylem sap of Brassica napus infected with Verticillium longisporum  ap. 571-579.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalicylic acid (SA) and its glucoside (SAG) were detected in xylem sap of Brassica napus by HPLC-MS. Concentrations of SA and SAG in xylem sap from the root and hypocotyl of the plant, and in extracts of shoots above the hypocotyl, increased after infection with the vascular pathogen Verticillium longisporum. Both concentrations were correlated with disease severity assessed as the reduction in shoot length. Furthermore, SAG levels in shoot extracts were correlated with the amount of V. longisporum DNA in the hypocotyls. Although the concentration of SAG (but not SA) in xylem sap of infected plants gradually declined from 14 to 35 days post infection, SAG levels remained significantly higher than in uninfected plants during the whole experiment. Jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA) levels in xylem sap were not affected by infection with V. longisporum. SA and SAG extend the list of phytohormones potentially transported from root to shoot with the transpiration stream. The physiological relevance of this transport and its contribution to the distribution of SA in plants remain to be elucidated.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aDNA 3aVerticillium 3aabscisic acid 3adisease severity 3afungal diseases of plants 3aglucosides 3ahypocotyls 3ajasmonic acid 3aphysiological transport 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3asap 3ashoots 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3atranspiration 3axylem 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aBiomass 2aBrassica napusxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Fungalxmetabolism 2aGlucosidesxmetabolism 2aMass Spectrometry 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolism 2aPlant Exudatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 2aVerticilliumxphysiology 2aXylemxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aRiediger, Nadine1 avon Tiedemann, Andreas1 aKarlovsky, Petr0 tJournal of plant research.g2009 Sept., v. 122, no. 5 p.571-579dSpringer Japanx0918-94407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-009-0237-5 7aarticle04499naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198072000900207100001800216245007100234300001800305500013100323500002400454500001500478520212600493650001202619650001702631650002502648650003602673650001602709650002202725650002702747650002302774650001002797650003202807650002202839650002502861650001202886650003802898650001602936650002202952650002302974650002002997650004603017650004903063650004703112653003003159653002603189653002703215653002603242653002203268700001603290700001503306700001503321700002103336700001603357700001703373700002003390700001303410700001903423700001803442773010303460852000903563856007603572930003303648945002503681946001103706655001203717IND4379458520221120140856.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437945852DNAL7 a166264602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02749.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK001 0aF821 0aL300 0aL0011 aBangert, R.K.12aA genetic similarity rule determines arthropod community structure  ap. 1379-1391.  aIn the special issue: Ecological and evolutionary genomics of populations in nature / edited by C.E.

Mitchell-Olds.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe define a genetic similarity rule that predicts how genetic variation in a dominant plant affects the structure of an arthropod community. This rule applies to hybridizing cottonwood species where plant genetic variation determines plant-animal interactions and structures a dependent community of leaf-modifying arthropods. Because the associated arthropod community is expected to respond to important plant traits, we also tested whether plant chemical composition is one potential intermediate link between plant genes and arthropod community composition. Two lines of evidence support our genetic similarity rule. First, in a common garden experiment we found that trees with similar genetic compositions had similar chemical compositions and similar arthropod compositions. Second, in a wild population, we found a similar relationship between genetic similarity in cottonwoods and the dependent arthropod community. Field data demonstrate that the relationship between genes and arthropods was also significant when the hybrids were analysed alone, i.e. the pattern is not dependent upon the inclusion of both parental species. Because plant-animal interactions and natural hybridization are common to diverse plant taxa, we suggest that a genetic similarity rule is potentially applicable, and may be extended, to other systems and ecological processes. For example, plants with similar genetic compositions may exhibit similar litter decomposition rates. A corollary to this genetic similarity rule predicts that in systems with low plant genetic variability, the environment will be a stronger factor structuring the dependent community. Our findings argue that the genetic composition of a dominant plant can structure higher order ecological processes, thus placing community and ecosystem ecology within a genetic and evolutionary framework. A genetic similarity rule also has important conservation implications because the loss of genetic diversity in one species, especially dominant or keystone species that define many communities, may cascade to negatively affect the rest of the dependent community. 3ahybrids 3ainsect pests 3aphytophagous insects 3achemical constituents of plants 3ahost plants 3agenetic variation 3aplant-insect relations 3ainsect communities 3agenes 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aPopulus fremontii 3aPopulus angustifolia 2aAnimals 2aArthropodsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aGenetic Variation 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPopulusxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aTreesxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 0aleaf-modifying arthropods 0aarthropod communities 0aleaf-modifying insects 0acommunity composition 0acommunity ecology1 aTurek, R.J.1 aRehill, B.1 aWimp, G.M.1 aSchweitzer, J.A.1 aAllan, G.J.1 aBailey, J.K.1 aMartinsen, G.D.1 aKeim, P.1 aLindroth, R.L.1 aWhitham, T.G.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Apr., v. 15, no. 5 p.1379-1391dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02749.x3electronic resource  a20060421b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03649naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002000180245006700200300001800267500013100285500002400416520164600440650001402086650002402100650001802124650001302142650001402155650001002169650002002179650002602199650002902225650001802254650001602272650001602288650002602304650003102330650001602361650001202377650003602389650003602425650001402461650002502475650001802500650004202518650002202560650003402582650001502616650001402631650002702645653002302672653002402695700002302719773010302742852000902845856007602854930003302930945002502963946001102988655001202999IND4379456920221120140932.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437945692DNAL7 a166264522pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02744.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aMoran, Nancy A.10aFunctional genomics of Buchnera and the ecology of aphid hosts  ap. 1251-1261.  aIn the special issue: Ecological and evolutionary genomics of populations in nature / edited by C.E. Lee and T. Mitchell-Olds.  aIncludes references  aIn many animal groups, mutualistic bacterial symbionts play a central role in host ecology, by provisioning rare nutrients and thus enabling specialization on restricted diets. Among such symbionts, genomic studies are most advanced for Buchnera, the obligate symbiont of aphids, which feed on phloem sap. The contents of the highly reduced Buchnera genomes have verified its role in aphid nutrition. Comparisons of Buchnera gene sets indicate ongoing, irreversible gene losses that are expected to affect aphid nutritional needs. Furthermore, almost all regulatory genes have been eliminated, raising the question of whether and how gene expression responds to environmental change. Microarray studies on genome-wide expression indicate that Buchnera has evolved some constitutive changes in gene expression: homologues of heat stress genes have elevated transcript levels in Buchnera (relative to other bacteria) even in the absence of stress. Additionally, the microarray results indicate that responses to heat stress and to amino acid availability are both few and modest. Observed responses are consistent with control by the few ancestral regulators retained in the genome. Initial studies on the role of host genes in mediating the symbiosis reveal distinctive expression patterns in host cells harbouring Buchnera. In the near future, a complete genome of pea aphid will accelerate progress in understanding the functional integration of aphid and Buchnera genomes. Although information for other insect symbioses is relatively limited, studies on symbionts of carpenter ants and tsetse flies indicate many similarities to Buchnera. 3aAphididae 3aBuchnera aphidicola 3aendosymbionts 3agenomics 3amutualism 3agenes 3agene expression 3amicroarray technology 3atranscription (genetics) 3amessenger RNA 3aheat stress 3aamino acids 3anutrient availability 3agene expression regulation 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aBuchneraxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolyploidy 2aSymbiosis 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aliterature reviews 0afunctional genomics1 aDegnan, Patrick H.0 tMolecular ecology.g2006 Apr., v. 15, no. 5 p.1251-1261dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02744.x3electronic resource  a20060425b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04424naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147100001400156245010800170300001600278500002400294520264200318650002202960650001702982650002302999650001503022650002003037650002303057650001603080650001503096650001603111650002403127650004703151650001203198650002303210650000903233650001103242650001703253650002603270650002203296650001103318650002003329650002803349650002503377650001203402650001103414650001303425650002303438650001303461700001703474700002003491700001703511700001703528700001903545773011803564852000903682930003303691945002503724946001303749655001203762IND4387094920221120125843.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438709492DNAL7 a172351672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aR300 0aL500 0aL6001 aBurke, F.10aComparative Evaluation of Alternative Forages to Grass Silage in the Diet of Early Lactation Dairy Cows  ap. 908-917.  aIncludes references  aFifty-six autumn-calving Holstein-Friesian cows, blocked on the basis of days in milk (27.6 ± 10.65 d), lactation number (3.1 ± 2.21), and preexperimental milk yield (28.4 ± 6.69 kg) were used to examine the effects of replacing 330 g/kg of dry matter (DM) of first-cut perennial ryegrass silage with either fermented whole-crop wheat (WCW), urea-treated processed WCW, or corn silage on subsequent feed intake, milk production, and efficiency of nitrogen utilization. The DM (g/kg), crude protein (CP, g/kg of DM) and in vitro DM digestibility (g/kg) of the forages were 204, 179, and 762 for grass silage; 389, 90, and 711 for fermented WCW; 795, 141, and 768 for urea-treated processed WCW; and 346, 93, and 783 for corn silage, respectively. Four forage treatments were evaluated as follows: 1) grass silage as the sole forage (GS); 2) a mixture of grass silage and fermented WCW silage, (F-WCW); 3) a mixture of grass silage and urea-treated processed WCW, (UP-WCW); and 4) a mixture of grass silage and corn silage (CS). In all cases, the alternative forages comprised 67% of the forage mix on a DM basis. Isonitrogenous diets were formulated by offering all cows 8 kg of concentrate as fed, formulated to different CP concentrations. Cows were offered these diets from 28 to 104 d in milk. Total DM intake and milk yield were greater on UP-WCW (20.0 and 30.2 kg/d) and CS (18.3 and 33.2 kg/d) than on GS (13.5 and 26.5 kg/d). Although DM intake was greater on F-WCW (17.1 kg/d) than on GS, milk yield was not significantly greater (+2.7 kg/d). Milk protein concentration was greater on F-WCW (30.5 g/kg), UP-WCW (31.3 g/kg), and CS (30.7 g/kg) than on GS (28.5 g/kg). However, there was no difference between treatments in milk fat or lactose concentrations. Body weight change was greater for cows offered GS (-0.27 kg/d) than for those offered UP-WCW (-0.01 kg/d) and CS (+0.05 kg/d) but not compared with those offered F-WCW (-0.06 kg/d). There was no effect of treatment on plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, urea, or total protein at d 64 ± 17.4 and d 92 ± 17.4 postpartum. Efficiency of N utilization was greatest for CS with 0.36 of N intake being recovered in milk compared with 0.28, 0.32, and 0.26 for GS, F-WCW, and UP-WCW, respectively. There was no effect of treatment on milk urea N concentration or the urinary allantoin N to creatinine N ratio. The results of this experiment indicate that corn silage is a more suitable supplementary forage to grass silage than fermented or urea-treated processed WCW, with advantages realized in milk production and more efficient N utilization. 3aforage evaluation 3agrass silage 3aruminant nutrition 3adairy cows 3aearly lactation 3aexperimental diets 3afeed intake 3amilk yield 3acow feeding 3anitrogen metabolism 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLactosexanalysis 2aLolium 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPoaceae 2aSilage 2aTriticum 2aUreaxpharmacology 2aZea mays1 aMurphy, J.J.1 aO'Donovan, M.A.1 aO'Mara, F.P.1 aKavanagh, S.1 aMulligan, F.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2007 Feb., v. 90, no. 2 p.908-917dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20091010b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/09/25  aOther US 7aarticle03413naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002200189245011000211300001600321500002400337500001500361520117800376650002001554650002201574650001001596650000901606650001701615650000901632650002201641650001401663650002901677650001501706650001201721650001901733650001701752650003701769650003201806650001401838650001901852650001201871650003801883650000901921650003801930650000901968650001101977650005901988650000902047650004302056650003202099650002502131650002602156650003402182650002202216651002702238653003802265653002202303653002502325700002202350700002102372773010202393852000902495856009202504930003302596945002502629946001302654655001202667IND4379452320221120125903.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437945232DNAL7 a166350122pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00148.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL8001 aBright, Steven R.10aOutcomes of Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts Occluded with Ameroid Constrictors in Nine Dogs and One Cat  ap. 300-309.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo report outcome after ameroid constrictor (AC) use for single intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (IPSS). Retrospective study. Nine dogs and 1 cat. Medical records (1999-2003) of dogs and cats with surgically confirmed IPSS were reviewed. Recorded data was: breed, sex, weight, age at surgery, clinical signs, serum biochemical and hematologic data, shunt anatomy, AC size, hospitalization, complications, and owner perception of their animal's response to surgery. Owners were contacted twice postoperatively (between 20 and 75 months) and asked to complete a simple questionnaire. With this technique, complication rate was low and postligation neurologic dysfunction was not observed. In the cat and 7 dogs, clinical signs attributed to IPPS resolved and animals were fed a non-prescription diet without medication. One dog died suddenly 18 months after surgery from causes unrelated to hepatic disease. One dog was euthanatized 23 months after surgery because of repeated, increasingly refractory episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. AC provides a safe and effective method for occlusion of some IPPS. AC should be considered for occlusion of some IPPS in dogs and cats. 3aneurophysiology 3avascular diseases 3aliver 3acats 3adog diseases 3adogs 3along term effects 3amorbidity 3acongenital abnormalities 3ablood flow 3asurgery 3aliver diseases 3acat diseases 3amedical and veterinary equipment 3apostoperative complications 3amortality 3adisease course 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxmortalityxsurgery. 2aCats 2aDog Diseasesxmortalityxsurgery. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHypertension, Portalxcongenitalxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPortal Systemxabnormalitiesxsurgery. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRecordsxveterinary. 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSuture Techniquesxveterinary 2aTreatment Outcome 0aEnglandxepidemiology. 0aintrahepatic portosystemic shunts 0ablood circulation 0aameroid constrictors1 aWilliams, John M.1 aNiles, Jacqui D.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2006 Apr., v. 35, no. 3 p.300-309dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00148.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle01953naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006800167300001800235500002400253520092900277650002901206650003401235650001901269650002101288650001701309653000901326653001501335653000801350653001501358653001501373653001101388653002501399773011001424852000901534856004801543655001201591IND4441635220221120125949.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444163522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-009-9562-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Stefano, Lucia10aInternational Initiatives for Water Policy Assessment: A Review  ap. 2449-2466.  aIncludes references  aThe recent international agreement to implement principles of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) as a means to overcome the current world water crisis has brought about the need to measure countries' progress towards a new way of managing water. Several governmental and nongovernmental international organizations have taken up this challenge using different methods. This paper analyzes the methodological approaches currently applied to comparative water policy assessment, points out advantages and drawbacks of the different types of initiatives, and looks at where this relatively young field of research is heading. The technical and topical constraints of existing numerical indicators, the lack of consolidated qualitative assessments and the difficulty to measure real water policy implementation are among the main challenges to be addressed in the near future in the context of water policy assessment. 3ainternational agreements 3anongovernmental organizations 3awater currents 3awater management 3awater policy 0aIWRM 0aIndicators 0aWFD 0aAssessment 0aEvaluation 0aReview 0aComparative analysis0 tWater resources management.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 11 p.2449-2466dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-009-9562-7 7aarticle03331naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002500180245008400205300001600289500002400305500001500329520166400344650002102008650000902029650001402038650002202052650002602074650002202100650003202122650002102154650001202175650002202187650004802209650001202257650002802269650001802297650003402315650002102349650003802370653001602408653002602424653001002450700001902460700002402479773010202503852000902605856009202614930003302706945002502739946001302764655001202777IND4379451520221120105208.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437945152DNAL7 a166350082pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00144.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8001 aDemetriou, Jackie L.10aPullout Strength for Three Suture Patterns Used for Canine Tracheal Anastomosis  ap. 278-283.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo compare pullout strength of 3 suture patterns used for canine tracheal anastomosis. Experimental study. Cadaveric canine tracheae (n=20). Tracheal segments were anastomosed with 1 of 3 suture patterns: simple continuous, simple interrupted, and simple interrupted reinforced with horizontal mattress, each encircling annular cartilage rings adjacent to the transection site. Horizontal mattress sutures encircled the annular rings proximal and distal to the rings closest to the anastomosis. Each construct was distracted (0.5 mm/s) in a materials testing machine to failure. Load-displacement curves were generated and failure load (pullout strength) determined and mode of failure recorded. Tracheal anastomosis with a simple interrupted pattern was significantly weaker (mean±SD pullout strength, 102.55±30.14 N) than simple continuous (135.53±15.47 N) or simple interrupted plus horizontal mattress (132.39±21.46 N), which were not different from each other. Mode of failure was consistently by suture tear out. Both simple continuous and simple interrupted reinforced with horizontal mattress suture patterns have significant biomechanical advantage over a simple interrupted pattern alone in canine cadaveric tracheal anastomosis. The simple continuous pattern had the least variability in pullout strength. A simple continuous technique should be considered when selecting a tension-relieving pattern for canine tracheal anastomosis. It offers the same biomechanical advantage as a simple interrupted pattern reinforced with a horizontal mattress pattern and its strength appears to be reliably maintained when tested in canine cadaver tracheae. 3afatigue strength 3adogs 3aresection 3amaterials testing 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3asuture techniques 3apostoperative complications 3atensile strength 3asutures 3aprotective effect 2aAnastomosis, Surgicalxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aDogsxsurgery 2aSuture Techniquesxveterinary 2aTracheaxsurgery 2aTracheotomyxmethodsxveterinary. 0aanastomosis 0amechanical properties 0aloads1 aHughes, Rhodri1 aSissener, Thomas R.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2006 Apr., v. 35, no. 3 p.278-283dBlackwell Publishing Incx0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2006.00144.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/03/04  aOther US 7aarticle04233naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165072000900183072000900192072000900201100003000210245014800240300001800388500002400406500001500430506007600445520130100521506003701822650002601859650002501885650001001910650002301920650002001943650001301963650003001976650002002006650002202026650002302048650001802071650002702089650003302116650001202149650001402161650002002175650002802195650001202223650004302235650001202278650002002290650002402310650001802334650002302352650001602375650002002391650003102411650006002442650002802502650001302530650001902543650003102562650002302593650003402616650004702650650002602697650005302723653002402776653001902800653002002819653001502839653001702854700003202871700002202903700002002925700001702945700002502962773010802987852000903095856008203104856005003186930003303236945002503269946001303294655001203307IND4379493320221207134038.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437949332DNAL7 a165314902pmid7 aPMC14258462pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.106.0409982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF832 0aF2001 aGonzález-Lamothe, Rocío14aThe U-Box Protein CMPG1 Is Required for Efficient Activation of Defense Mechanisms Triggered by Multiple Resistance Genes in Tobacco and Tomato  ap. 1067-1083.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe previously identified three Avr9/Cf-9 Rapidly Elicited (ACRE) genes essential for Cf-9- and Cf-4-dependent hypersensitive response (HR) production in Nicotiana benthamiana. Two of them encode putative E3 ubiquitin ligase components. This led us to investigate other ACRE genes associated with the ubiquitination pathway. ACRE74 encodes a U-box E3 ligase homolog, highly related to parsley (Petroselinum crispum) CMPG1 and Arabidopsis thaliana PLANT U-BOX20 (PUB20) and PUB21 proteins, and was called Nt CMPG1. Transcript levels of Nt CMPG1 and the homologous tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Cmpg1 are induced in Cf9 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and Cf9 tomato after Avr9 elicitation. Tobacco CMPG1 possesses in vitro E3 ligase activity. N. benthamiana plants silenced for Nt CMPG1 show reduced HR after Cf-9/Avr9 elicitation, while overexpression of Nt CMPG1 induces a stronger HR in Cf9 tobacco plants after Avr9 infiltration. In tomato, silencing of Cmpg1 decreased resistance to Cladosporium fulvum. Overexpression of epitope-tagged tobacco CMPG1 mutated in the U-box domain confers a dominant-negative phenotype. We also show that Nt CMPG1 is involved in the Pto/AvrPto and Inf1 responses. In summary, we show that the E3 ligase Nt CMPG1 is essential for plant defense and disease resistance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPseudomonas syringae 3agenes 3abacterial proteins 3aPassalora fulva 3atomatoes 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3amessenger RNA 3aPhytophthora infestans 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aligases 3aubiquitin 3aenzyme activity 3ahypersensitive response 3atobacco 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3amutants 3afungal proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, Dominant 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseases 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aUbiquitinxmetabolism 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aE3 ubiquitin ligase 0aubiquitination 0aU-box E3 ligase 0aCMPG1 gene 0aFulvia fulva1 aTsitsigiannis, Dimitrios I.1 aLudwig, Andrea A.1 aPanicot, Mireia1 aShirasu, Ken1 aJones, Jonathan D.G.0 tplant cell.g2006 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.1067-1083dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1532-298X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.0409983Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org3electronic resource  a20060611b20060702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle01382naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002700133245009500160300001600255520015400271650001400425650001200439650002500451650003300476650000900509650003400518650004300552650003100595650003200626650003000658653002500688653002400713653004600737700002200783700002000805773008600825852000900911939003300920945000800953946001100961655001200972991616836030742620221120100200.0840802e198304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840047412DNAL7 a64161992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Jauregui, P.12aA case of sarcocystic myocarditis in a rhesus monkey.

We describe a novel role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in regulating the mutualistic interaction between a clavicipitaceous fungal endophyte, Epichloë festucae, and its grass host, Lolium perenne. In wild-type associations, E. festucae grows systemically in intercellular spaces of leaves as infrequently branched hyphae parallel to the leaf axis. A screen to identify symbiotic genes isolated a fungal mutant that altered the interaction from mutualistic to antagonistic. This mutant has a single-copy plasmid insertion in the coding region of a NADPH oxidase gene, noxA. Plants infected with the noxA mutant lose apical dominance, become severely stunted, show precocious senescence, and eventually die. The fungal biomass in these associations is increased dramatically, with hyphae showing increased vacuolation. Deletion of a second NADPH oxidase gene, noxB, had no effect on the E. festucae-perennial ryegrass symbiosis. ROS accumulation was detected cytochemically in the endophyte extracellular matrix and at the interface between the extracellular matrix and host cell walls of meristematic tissue in wild-type but not in noxA mutant associations. These results demonstrate that fungal ROS production is critical in maintaining a mutualistic fungus-plant interaction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLolium perenne 3aEpichloe 3aendophytes 3amutualism 3areactive oxygen species 3aNADH or NADPH oxidoreductases 3amutants 3aintercellular spaces 3aleaves 3aphenotype 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aLoliumxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNADPH Oxidasesxgenetics. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRestriction Mapping 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Deletion 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSymbiosis 2aTransformation, Genetic 0aEpichloe festucae 0aNADPH oxidase 0anoxA gene1 aChristensen, Michael J.1 aTakemoto, Daigo1 aPark, Pyoyun1 aScott, Barry0 tplant cell.g2006 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.1052-1066dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1532-298X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.105.0392633Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org3electronic resource  a20060611b20060702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/21  aOther US 7aarticle02402naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009800145300001600243520056300259650001800822650001000840650001900850650001700869650001500886650002200901650002400923650001200947650002300959650003700982650002801019650002401047650002101071650005601092650005301148650003901201650002501240650004401265650001201309650004301321650002801364650002301392650003401415653001501449653001601464653003501480653002501515653002801540653002501568700002001593700001501613773010601628852000901734930003301743945001301776946001101789655001201800IND2038108120221120064144.0940322e199311  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203810812DNAL7 a75096822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSairam, M.R.10aStructural characterization of gelonin: evidence for separate antigenic and cytotoxic domains  ap. 575-581.  aThe N-terminal sequence of the three isoforms of gelonin is identical.

Northern hybridization shows that administration of estradiol alone or with progesterone stimulates the synthesis of VTG mRNA. Gel mobility shift assay of DNA fragments containing the ERE and NF1 shows that estradiol done or with progesterone increases the levels of nuclear proteins that bind to these cis-acting elements of the promoter of the VTG gene. The cooperative effect of the two hormones seen at the level of expression of the VTG gene may be due to protein-protein interactions of trans-acting factors that bind to ERE and NF 1. 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3aregulatory sequences 3aprogesterone 3agenes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aCoturnix japonica 3aestradiol 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aCoturnixxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresisxmethods 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNFI Transcription Factors 2aProgesteronexpharmacology 2aReceptors, Estradiolxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTATA Box 2aTrans-Activatorsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 2aVitellogeninsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenetic regulation 0avitellogenins 0ainteractions 0aJapanese quails1 aUpadhayay, R.1 aKanungo, M.S.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1996 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.887-894x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02591naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245014300169300001600312520129500328650001301623650001501636650001401651650001001665650001301675650002501688650001201713650001201725650002401737650001401761650001101775650001101786700002701797700002101824700002801845700002901873773012901902852000902031856008502040939003302125946001102158655001202169IND4449589820221120053718.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444958982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-010-0611-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollmann, Gabriela 10aEffects of seasonality and moult cycle on the proliferation of nerve cells and on the labelling of ecdysone receptors in an estuarine crab  ap. 293-300.  aDecapod crustaceans show proliferation of the nerve cells in the olfactory lobe throughout their lives. However, the regulation of this process is still poorly understood, since it may vary with endogenous and exogenous factors. The objective of the present investigation was to quantify the proliferation of nerve cells and number of nerve cells with ecdysone receptors in the clusters of the central olfactory system in Neohelice granulata, according to moult stages and in different seasons (summer and winter). Three injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were administered to the crabs. Brains were sectioned by microtome and fixed on slides for immunohistochemistry with anti-BrdU and anti-EcR antibodies. The proliferation of nerve cells was higher in winter than in summer, probably because in winter the crabs do not breed and the premoult and postmoult periods are longer. Crabs in postmoult exhibited more BrdU-labelled cells than crabs in premoult or intermoult in winter, because of a greater number of mitoses related to an increase in body size and addition of olfactory receptor neurons. The number of EcR-labelled cells was higher in premoult than in postmoult or intermoult in winter. The proliferation of nerve cells is regulated seasonally and according to moult stages. 3aDecapoda 3aantibodies 3abody size 3acrabs 3aecdysone 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amolting 3aneurons 3aolfactory receptors 3areceptors 3asummer 3awinter1 aFonseca, Duane Barros 1 aAllodi, Silvana 1 aMartinez, Pablo Elías 1 aNery, Luiz Eduardo Maia 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2011 Mar., v. 197, no. 3 p.293-300dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-010-0611-83Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03186naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001500188245010200203300001400305500002400319520155900343650002101902650001901923650001701942650001301959650001201972650002801984650001902012650002002031650002302051650002402074650002502098650002102123650002002144650000902164650001802173650001802191651001002209700001402219700001502233700001502248700001702263700002002280700001402300700001702314773011102331852000902442856007602451930003302527945002502560946001102585655001202596IND4379255420140723000000.0060402e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437925542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00182.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF130 0aJ500 0aF600 0aX1001 aHirata, M.10aProductivity of Bahiagrass Pastures in South-western Japan: Synthesis of Data from Grazing Trials  ap. 79-91.  aIncludes references  aThis study examined the rate of herbage production and herbage quality of bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flügge) using data from five grazing trials in the low-altitude region of Kyushu, south-western Japan, in an effort to (a) evaluate productivity of bahiagrass pastures, (b) analyse its relationship to meteorological, vegetational and managerial variables, and (c) obtain implications for better management of bahiagrass pastures.

DMD was expressed by a regression equation where the day number from 1 April and herbage mass had negative effects, and the sampling height and nitrogen rate had positive effects. CP concentration was expressed by an equation showing a positive effect of nitrogen rate and a negative effect of herbage mass. The results indicate that management of bahiagrass pastures should aim at maintaining herbage mass closely above the critical level below which intake by grazing animals is restricted, in order to increase quality and ensure quantity. This is particularly important when nitrogen fertilizer is applied. 3aPaspalum notatum 3aforage grasses 3aforage crops 3apastures 3agrazing 3adry matter accumulation 3aforage quality 3acrop management 3aseasonal variation 3amathematical models 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aair temperature 3arain 3adigestibility 3acrude protein 3aJapan1 aOgawa, Y.1 aKoyama, N.1 aShindo, K.1 aSugimoto, Y.1 aHigashiyama, M.1 aOgura, S.1 aFukuyama, K.0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2006 Apr., v. 192, no. 2 p.79-91dBlackwell Verlagx0931-22507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00182.x3electronic resource  a20061004b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02936naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245012000147300001800267520128600285650002201571650002001593650001601613650001901629650001701648650001701665650001601682650001601698650002501714650001201739650001801751650001701769650001001786650001301796650001401809650002001823650003001843650001201873650002201885650002101907650003001928650001801958650002201976650002001998650003102018650002002049650001802069650001702087650001402104700001802118700002002136700001402156773008402170852000902254930003302263945001302296946001302309655001202322IND2322239420221120053700.0010727e200106  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232223942DNAL7 a114176922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetzger, L.E.10aEffect of milk preacidification on low fat Mozzarella cheese. II. Chemical and functional properties during storage  ap. 1348-1356.  aThe effect of milk preacidification on cheese manufacturing, chemical properties, and functional properties of low fat Mozzarella cheese was determined. Four vats of cheese were made in 1 d using no preacidification (control), preacidification to pH 6.0 and pH 5.8 with acetic acid, and preacidification to pH 5.8 with citric acid. This process was replicated four times. Modifications in the typical Mozzarella manufacturing procedures were necessary to accommodate milk preacidification. The chemical composition of the cheeses was similar among the treatments, except the calcium content and calcium as a percentage of protein were lower in the preacidified treatments. During refrigerated storage, the chemical and functional properties of low fat Mozzarella were affected the most by milk preacidification to pH 5.8 with citric acid. The amount of expressible serum, unmelted cheese whiteness, initial unmelted hardness, and initial apparent viscosity were lower with preacidification. The reduction in initial unmelted cheese hardness and initial apparent viscosity in the pH 5.8 citric treatments represents an improvement in the quality of low fat Mozzarella cheese that allows the cheese to have better pizza bake characteristics with shorter time of refrigerated storage. 3amozzarella cheese 3alow fat cheeses 3acheese milk 3aacidified milk 3apretreatment 3afood storage 3aacetic acid 3acitric acid 3achemical composition 3acalcium 3arefrigeration 3acold storage 3acolor 3ahardness 3aviscosity 3acooking quality 2aAcetic Acidxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCheesexanalysis 2aCitric Acidxpharmacology 2aFood Handling 2aFood Preservation 2aFood Technology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRefrigeration 2aTime Factors 2aViscosity1 aBarbano, D.M.1 aKindstedt, P.S.1 aGuo, M.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.1348-1356x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007300144300001800217500001500235520145600250650001501706650001701721650002401738650001801762650001501780650002401795650004201819650001201861650002201873650001101895650002201906650002301928650001101951650005101962650002602013650002102039650002602060650002902086650002302115653001502138653001702153653001602170653002302186653002802209653001202237773008402249852000902333930003302342945001302375946001302388655001202401IND2322238720221120042352.0010727e200106  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232223872DNAL7 a114176852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucy, M.C.10aReproductive loss in high-producing dairy cattle: where will it end?  ap. 1277-1293.  a2019-12-05  aThe dairy industry in the United States has changed dramatically in the last decade. Milk production per cow has increased steadily because of a combination of improved management, better nutrition, and intense genetic selection. Dairy farms are larger, and nearly 30% of the dairy cows in the United States are on farms with 500 or more cows. The shift toward more productive cows and larger herds is associated with a decrease in reproductive efficiency. Cows with the greatest milk production have the highest incidence of infertility, but epidemiological studies suggest that, in addition to milk production, other factors are probably decreasing reproductive efficiency in our dairy herds. The reproductive physiology of dairy cows has changed over the past 50 yr, and physiological adaptations to high milk production may explain part of the reproductive decline. Critical areas for new research include control of the estrous cycle, metabolic effects of lactation on reproduction, mechanisms linking disease to reproduction, and early embryonic mortality. Solving reproductive loss in dairy cows will not be easy because only a small number of research groups study reproduction in postpartum dairy cows. Therefore, the present research base will need to be expanded. For this to occur, research funding must be increased above its current level and a renewed emphasis must be placed on solving the emerging crisis of infertility in dairy cows. 3ametabolism 3adairy cattle 3asexual reproduction 3aestrous cycle 3amilk yield 3aembryonic mortality 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAwards and Prizes 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethods 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aInfertility, Femalexepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aPregnancyxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSelection, Genetic 0aefficiency 0areproduction 0ainfertility 0aliterature reviews 0areproductive physiology 0aovaries0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.1277-1293x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02999naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001700128245008900145300001600234500002400250500001500274520126700289650002501556650002101581650001801602650002101620650001801641650001101659650001801670650001301688650002101701650002301722650002601745650001201771650001701783650000901800650001401809650001801823650001101841650001201852650002101864653001901885653001601904653002101920653002001941653001601961653003101977653001802008700001502026700001402041700001502055700001302070773012302083852000902206856007702215930003302292945002502325946001102350655001202361IND4379296520221120042440.0060403e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437929652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1401 aVelcheva, M.10aRegeneration of Aloe arborescens via somatic organogenesis from young inflorescences  ap. 293-301.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA system for in vitro regeneration of Aloe arborescens was developed using young inflorescences as explants. Different phytohormone combinations of N-phenyl-N'-1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl urea (TDZ), benzyladenine (BA), 6-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl-amino)purine riboside (2iPR), zeatin ribozide (ZR), N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) and kinetin (K), with or without ancymidol, were examined in order to induce plant regeneration. Efficient shoot regeneration was initiated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with BA or TDZ. MS medium enriched with 19.6, 22.2 micromolar BA and 3.92 micromolar ancymidol (MSBA5/1 medium), promoted organogenesis enabling 87.3% of the explants to regenerate 6.04 +/- 1.79 shoots/explant. Subsequent shoot elongation and plant regeneration were strongly affected by the medium composition used for shoot induction. Optimal elongation (three to four shoots per explant) was obtained when shoots, initiated on MSBA5/1 medium, were subsequently transferred onto MS containing only 4.4 micromolar BA. Rooting was performed on MS media lacking growth regulators. Histological analysis revealed that the initiated shoots originated from the receptacle tissue surrounding the residual vascular tissue of the flower buds. 3adevelopmental stages 3amedicinal plants 3abenzyladenine 3amicropropagation 3aorganogenesis 3ashoots 3adose response 3aexplants 3aAloe arborescens 3aisopentenyladenine 3ain vitro regeneration 3akinetin 3aplant growth 3abuds 3ahistology 3aculture media 3azeatin 3aflowers 3aplant morphology 0ainflorescences 0amethodology 0ain vitro culture 0azeatin riboside 0athidiazuron 0aMurashige and Skoog medium 0aplant anatomy1 aFaltin, Z.1 aVardi, A.1 aEshdat, Y.1 aPerl, A.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2005 Dec., v. 83, no. 3 p.293-301dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/05/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03623naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100001500155245010600170300001600276500002400292500001500316520236300331650001702694650003502711650003502746650001502781651001402796653002102810653003502831653002502866653002502891700002002916700001802936773011102954852000903065856007003074930003303144945002503177946001103202655001203213IND4387136320221120024110.0070123e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438713632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2006.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH0001 aAres, J.O.10aExploring improved pesticide management in sub-tropical environments with GIS-supported fate modeling  ap. 189-210.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe sensitivity analysis of pesticide models to input parameters related to crop management practices supplies working hypotheses to improve pesticide uses and environmental quality. Parameters of pesticide models that are influential to model output vary depending on regional environmental conditions, and their probability distribution functions must be identified on a case-oriented basis. While the performance of pesticide models has been extensively tested in temperate regions, comparative studies in subtropical areas are relatively scarce. In this study, we coupled results of landscape analyses supported with a geographical information system (GIS), field data and information about management scenarios of citrus crops in Misiones (Argentina) to inspect the behavior of a field-scale pesticide model (GLEAMSv3.0). Probability distribution functions of model parameters relevant to hydrology, geo-forms and crop distribution were derived from satellite imagery (SAC-C, SRTM), while crop characteristics, information on soils and pesticides were obtained from field data. Spatial descriptors were used to generate sensitivity scenarios to explore the potential effect of management practices on the fate of the pesticides chlorpyrifos, mancozeb, mercaptothion, copper hydroxide, carbendazem, glyphosate and 2-4-D used in citrus crops. Our results indicate that management practices to change the roughness-contouring of the soil, maintaining a high vegetation cover below the citrus crops, and devising pesticide spraying techniques that would efficiently increase the contact with the crop leaves would be expected to significantly reduce pesticide losses. Plant spacing, improving soil textural conditions through soil-correction practices and selecting adequate soil conditions for installing new crops are also potentially effective techniques to the same goal. Glyphosate losses are almost insensitive to management manipulation, which is a favorable trait in cases where management alternatives are constrained by practical or economic considerations. We present comparisons of the sensitivity of the pesticide model in these scenarios in relation to previously reported results with the same model in other cases, and formulate proposals on a normalized format to report sensitivity results to facilitate comparisons among models and cases. 3aGLEAMS model 3atropical and subtropical crops 3ageographic information systems 3apesticides 3aArgentina 0apesticide models 0aagricultural management models 0apesticide management 0asensitivity analysis1 aValle, H.F. del1 aOlinuck, J.A.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 Dec., v. 91, no. 3 p.189-210dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2006.02.0073electronic resource  a20070305b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03286naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001300164245009900177300001600276500002400292520216800316650001702484650001902501650001502520650002402535651001002559653002002569700001102589700001502600700002602615773011102641852000902752856007002761930003302831945002502864946001102889655001202900IND4387136120221117182220.0070123e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438713612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2006.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aJ5001 aChen, J.10aFactors affecting soil quality changes in the North China Plain: A case study of Quzhou County  ap. 171-188.  aIncludes references  aAt the end of the 1970s there were 3,300,000 ha of salt-affected land in the North China Plain. After the successful removal of the salt in the 1980s, the land has gradually been used for increasing intensive forms of agriculture. The Household Responsibility System (HRS) was adopted in Chinese rural areas at the time of the economic reform of the early 1980s. Farm households became the basic decision-making units that could directly control soil quality. This paper describes the change in soil fertility after 20 years of intensive agriculture and the driving factors of soil fertility change. Quzhou County was selected as it is representative for the North China Plain. The soil fertility status and nutrient flows of the salt-affected land for 1980-1981 and 1999 in Quzhou County were evaluated. Over 20 years, the total nitrogen (N), the extractable phosphorus (P) and the soil organic matter (SOM) in salt-affected land increased by 127%, 601% and 51% respectively; but exchangeable potassium decreased by 31%. The N, P, K and SOM balance in 1980-1981 was -15, -2, -29 and -24 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, but in 1999 the N and P balance had changed to 24 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ and 25 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ as a result of the widespread use of N and P fertilizer. With the rapid increase in crop production and the sparse use of K fertilizer, the K balance continues to be negative. Straw production increased along with crop yields and there was a development of stock breeding. Together with better straw restitution practices, the SOM balance increased to a positive 613 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. The analysis of farm household land-use and inputs indicated that there were significant differences in behaviour between almost totally off-farm households and other household types. These differences were in the choice of land-use type, the use of fertilizers and crop residue management. However, there was no significant relationship between socio-economic factors and fertilizer inputs. Current nutrient management is not optimal. Therefore, it is important to establish a better system for bottom-up knowledge collection and transfer of scientific information to farmers. 3asoil quality 3asoil fertility 3ahouseholds 3anutrient management 3aChina 0afarmer behavior1 aYu, Z.1 aOuyang, J.1 aMensvoort, M.E.F. van0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 Dec., v. 91, no. 3 p.171-188dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2006.02.0053electronic resource  a20070305b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/05  aNon-US 7aarticle04100naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001300164245015000177300001600327500002400343520260500367650000902972650001302981650001302994650002603007650002903033650001603062650002003078650002503098650002503123650002203148653002303170653002903193653001103222653001603233653004403249700001503293700002003308700001703328773011303345852000903458856007003467930003303537945002503570946001103595655001203606IND4387135720140723000000.0070123e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438713572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2006.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF1201 aLink, J.10aEvaluating the economic and environmental impact of environmental compensation payment policy under uniform and variable-rate nitrogen management  ap. 135-153.  aIncludes references  aSite-specific nitrogen (N) management has been suggested as a management tool to increase N fertilizer efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Farmers in governmental designated water saving regions will be paid a compensation for following N management plans that reduce N levels below a target threshold value in the soil after harvest, making an efficient use of N input crucial. Precision agriculture aims at increasing this efficiency by incorporating spatial and temporal variation into N management. Crop models can help to determine the optimum N rate across a field. The purpose of this paper was to use the CERES-Maize crop growth model and the APOLLO precision agriculture decision support system to asses the importance of accounting for spatial variation in the design of policies to control groundwater nitrate concentration under the EU legislation. The policy was evaluated for uniform and variable-rate N management on a small-scale field, which was divided into 30 grid cells. The model was calibrated using 5 years of data from 30 grid cells in the field in the Upper Rhine Valley, Germany. The model simulated yield variability in the different grid cells quite well and explained approximately 60% of the yield variability. Once the model was calibrated, optimum N rate to maximize the marginal net return considering the given target threshold value of soil N after harvest was computed for each grid cell using 28 years of historical weather data. Results indicated a spatial distribution of optimum N rates for grid cells across the field. Variable-rate management required lower amounts of N fertilizer (20-25%), achieved similar yield levels and resulted in higher net returns over the 28 years of weather data when compared to current N management. Higher marginal net return in variable-rate management was achieved because the target N level left in the soil was satisfied in most grid cells under variable-rate management resulting in a compensation payment for the farmer. This did not occur as often under current uniform management practices, especially under extreme weather conditions. These results support the relevance of managing temporal and spatial variation on fields for groundwater protection applying dynamic N management strategies. 3acorn 3aZea mays 3anitrogen 3aprecision agriculture 3adecision support systems 3acrop models 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental policy 3aspatial variation 0auniform management 0avariable-rate management 0aAPOLLO 0aCERES-Maize 0aspatially targeted groundwater policies1 aGraeff, S.1 aBatchelor, W.D.1 aClaupein, W.0 tAgricultural systems.g2006 Nov., v. 91, no. 1-2 p.135-153dElsevier Applied Science [etc.]x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2006.02.0033electronic resource  a20070307b20070402c00000000  aINDdRLGe2007/03/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198072000900207100001800216245012300234300001600357500002400373520085200397650001301249650001701262650001101279650002701290650001701317650002501334650002401359650002201383650002201405650003101427650001801458650002301476650002601499650001201525650002801537650001101565650003901576650002001615650000901635650004501644650004001689650005201729650003101781653001401812653002701826653002901853700002001882700001401902700002001916700001701936773010801953852000902061856007602070930003302146945002502179946001102204655001202215IND4379259820221123035320.0060402e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437925982DNAL7 a166407312pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00629.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aL200 0aL001 0aL6001 aKeeling, C.I.10aEffects of juvenile hormone on gene expression in the pheromone-producing midgut of the pine engraver beetle, Ips pini  ap. 207-216.  aIncludes references  aJuvenile hormone III (JH III) stimulates biosynthesis of the monoterpenoid aggregation pheromone component, ipsdienol, in the anterior midgut of the male pine engraver beetle, Ips pini (Say).

During the first year (period 1), herds were evaluated by a specific procedure by one individual. Three herds were not supplemented and two herds were supplemented with zinc methionine. During the subsequent year (period 2) all herds were switched to a combination of zinc methionine, copper lysine, manganese methionine, and cobalt glucoheptonate and evaluated in the same way as during period 1. There was no effect of period on incidence of heel erosion and interdigital dermatitis. During period 2, there was a reduced incidence of double soling, white line separation, sole hemorrhages, sole ulcers, and papillomatous digital dermatitis, and the incidence of wall ridges tended to be reduced compared with period 1. There was no effect of period on the incidence of abaxial wall lesions, digital arthritis, or foot rot, although the overall incidence of these disorders was low. During period 2, when cows were fed a combination of complexed trace minerals, there was a general reduction in the incidence of digital disorders associated with the laminitis syndrome complex compared with period 1; however, other time-related differences existed that may confound interpretation. 3adairy cows 3amanganese 3alysine 3alactation stage 3acobalt 3azinc 3acopper 3alaminitis 3alameness 3ahooves 3afootrot 3alactation number 3amethionine 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxprevention & control 2aCobaltxadministration & dosage 2aDermatitisxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aHoof and Claw 2aLameness, Animalxprevention & control 2aLysinexadministration & dosage 2aManganesexadministration & dosage 2aMetalsxadministration & dosage 2aMethioninexadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aOrganometallic Compoundsxadministration & dosage 2aSugar Acidsxadministration & dosage 0adouble soles 0adorsal wall ridges 0asoles 0ainterdigital dermatitis 0alesions 0aheel erosions 0ahocks 0afoot diseases 0acomplete feeds 0adigits1 aJohnson, A.B.1 aSocha, M.T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2000 July, v. 83, no. 7 p.1553-1572x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03085naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245006000144300001800204520159700222650001601819650001401835650002401849650001901873650001601892650002201908650001401930650001501944650001501959650002801974650002002002650001602022650001202038650003402050650001402084650001602098650001102114650003702125650004102162650003702203650000902240650002302249650001302272650001402285650001902299650001702318653001402335700001902349773008302368852000902451930003302460945001302493946001302506655001202519IND2321793220221121013326.0010628e200105  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232179322DNAL7 a113840512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClay, J.S.10aComputing mating bull fertility from DHI nonreturn data  ap. 1238-1245.  aAnimal model methodology was used to compute yearly measures of relative fertility of Holstein AI mating bulls based upon 70-d nonreturn of first breedings as reported to U.S. DHIA from 1988 through 1997. Estimated Relative Conception Rates (ERCR) were computed for bulls with a minimum of 50 first breedings in a single year using variance ratios 45.5 for mating bull, 45.5 for animal genetic effects, and 31 for permanent environment. The model assumed repeatability across lactations of 0.05 and included fixed effects of herd-year-month bred and classes of parity, early lactation energy-corrected milk and days open when bred. Estimates of fertility were greater for breedings to cows that were young, had low early lactation production, and were in late stages of lactation. ERCR were expressed as difference in nonreturn from the average AI mating bull of herdmates. Values ranged from -18 to +13. For ERCR computed from a minimum of 1000 breedings, 90% were within four units of zero. Early ERCR computed from a few breedings in a single year were tested for ability to predict later ERCR computed from a minimum of 1000 different breedings. Early ERCR computed from 300 or more matings accurately predicted later independent ERCR. For yearly estimates each based upon a minimum of 1000 breedings, 8% changed more than three units, and 4% declined more than three units. Correlations between ERCR and predicted transmitting abilities protein and type production index were significant but accounted for little variance. Correlations between ERCR and other traits were not significant. 3adairy bulls 3afecundity 3amathematical models 3apregnancy rate 3ameasurement 3agenetic variation 3alactation 3amilk yield 3aestimation 3aartificial insemination 3aconception rate 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aComputers 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aPedigree 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aTime Factors 0aopen days1 aMcDaniel, B.T.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.1238-1245x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03168naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245014700144300001800291500001500309520148400324650001501808650002301823650001101846650001301857650001801870650001701888650001301905650002801918650001401946650004901960650001202009650001102021650003702032650001102069650003902080650004202119650003902161650002102200650003902221650002002260650004302280650001702323653002102340653001602361653001502377700001602392700001302408700001802421773008302439852000902522930003302531945001302564946001302577655001202590IND2321791920221120202843.0010628e200105  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232179192DNAL7 a113840462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCant, J.P.10aMilk composition responses to unilateral arterial infusion of complete and histidine-lacking amino acid mixtures to the mammary glands of cows  ap. 1192-1200.  a2019-12-05  aTo evaluate a close mammary infusion technique for the study of milk protein responses to blood amino acid profile, five early-lactation, multiparous Holstein cows were surgically fitted with catheters in both external iliac arteries. Animals were infused into one arterial catheter with five different solutions on 5 consecutive days in a Latin square design. Infusions began at 0800 h and continued until 1800 h. The five infusates were a 3% saline control, 15 g/h of complete amino acid mix, 15 g/h of imbalanced amino acid mix (minus His), 30 g/h of complete amino acid mix, and 30 g/h of imbalanced amino acid mix (minus His). Cows were fed a total mixed ration twice daily containing 16% crude protein and 1.7 Mcal/kg of net energy for lactation. Infusion of the complete amino acid mix elevated amino acid concentrations in arterial plasma two- to threefold but caused only a small dose-dependent increase in milk protein content and yield. Fat percentage in milk was decreased from 4.08 to 3.35% by the complete amino acid infusions so that the protein:fat ratio climbed from 0.76 on the control to 0.99 with 30 g/h of amino acid. Removal of His from the infusate caused plasma His concentrations to drop but had no effect on any other circulating amino acids. Milk composition was restored to control levels by removal of the single amino acid. A short-term circulating amino acid imbalance depresses milk protein percentage and increases milk fat content in dairy cows. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3audders 3amixtures 3acrude protein 3ablood plasma 3aarteries 3amilk protein percentage 3ahistidine 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aHistidinexadministration & dosage 2aInfusions, Intra-Arterialxveterinary 2aLactationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysisxdrug effects. 2aTime Factors 0amilk composition 0aamino acids 0amilk yield1 aTrout, D.R.1 aQiao, F.1 aMcBride, B.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.1192-1200x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03070naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009100145300001800236500001500254520132300269650002001592650001201612650001201624650002301636650002401659650000901683650001901692650002201711650002101733650001201754650002201766650002301788650006201811650001301873650001101886650001401897650001801911650001401929650004901943650002601992650001502018650001102033650001402044650002902058650001202087650001702099651001102116651002602127653001702153653001902170653002402189700001502213700001602228700002402244773008402268852000902352930003302361945001302394946001302407655001202420IND2322239920221120191048.0010727e200106  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232223992DNAL7 a114176972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillund, P.10aBody condition related to ketosis and reproductive performance in Norwegian dairy cows  ap. 1390-1396.  a2019-12-05  aThe relationships between body condition score (BCS) and ketosis, and between BCS and reproductive performance in 732 moderate yielding, dual-purpose cows were studied. The cows were of the breed Norwegian Cattle. Farms with tie-stall barns and a history of high ketosis incidence were chosen for the study. Sixteen assessors visited the farms monthly and the same assessor assigned a BCS to each cow once a month. A BCS of 3.5 or higher at calving was associated with increased risk for ketosis. Cows that subsequently developed ketosis had higher BCS than healthy cows before the disease was diagnosed, and they lost more body condition than did the latter after ketosis had occurred. Summer calving cows and primiparous cows showed the lowest risk of ketosis. A history of ketosis before first service decreased the likelihood of conception to that service. Loss in body condition during the postpartum period was associated with decreased likelihood of conception to first service, prolonged calving to conception intervals and increased number of artificial inseminations per conception. Reproductive performance was not associated with BCS at calving. We concluded that BCS is a useful method of monitoring relations among nutritional management, reproduction, and ketosis in moderate yielding dual-purpose cows. 3aconception rate 3aketosis 3acalving 3aseasonal variation 3asexual reproduction 3acows 3abody condition 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Constitution 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aHealth Status 2aIncidence 2aKetosisxepidemiologyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aLactationxphysiology 2aOdds Ratio 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 3aNorway 0aNorwayxepidemiology. 0areproduction 0acalving season 0adual purpose cattle1 aReksen, O.1 aGrohn, Y.T.1 aKarlberg, Kimberly.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.1390-1396x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02913naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011900145300001600264520079300280650001801073650001601091650001901107650001401126650001701140650001901157650001701176650001801193650001701211650001201228650001201240650002001252650002401272650004001296650002001336650002201356650003401378650002201412650002101434650002901455650003301484650004701517650004701564650005801611650003601669650005701705650001201762650000901774650003001783650002901813650004301842650004101885650002601926653002501952653002601977700001902003700001502022700001802037773010602055852000902161930003302170945001302203946001102216655001202227IND2041203120221120160644.0940802e199403  at |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204120312DNAL7 a75182792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrigotti, M.10aRNA present in post-ribosomal supernatants makes ribosomes susceptible to inactivation by gelonin and alpha-sarcin  ap. 585-596.  aThe remarkable resistance of isolated ribosomes to gelonin is overcome by Cofactors present in post-ribosomal supernatants. In rat liver post-ribosomal supernatant RNA is the cofactor responsible of the sensitization of ribosomes. Isolated RNA, which consists mostly of deacylated tRNA, accounts for less than 10 per cent of the activity of the original supernatant. The activity of the supernatant is completely destroyed by micrococcal nuclease and RNAase A and also by proteinase K, suggesting that some protein enhances the effect of RNA. RNA has a role also in the sensitization of ribosomes to alpha-sarcin, an RNAase which inactivates ribosomes by hydrolyzing a single phosphodiester bond in the same region of 28S rRNA which is the target of the N-glycosidase activity of gelonin. 3aEuphorbiaceae 3aAspergillus 3aArtemia salina 3aribosomes 3ainactivation 3aplant proteins 3acytotoxicity 3aribosomal RNA 3atransfer RNA 2aAnimals 2aArtemia 2aAutoradiography 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEndopeptidase K 2aEndoribonucleases 2aFungal Proteinsxpharmacology 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMolecular Weight 2aPhosphorus Radioisotopes 2aPlant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aProtein Synthesis Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRNAxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Ribosomalxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 28Sxmetabolism 2aRNA, Transferxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aReticulocytesxmetabolism 2aRibonuclease, Pancreatic 2aRibosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1 2aRibosomesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSerine Endopeptidases 0agelonium multiflorum 0aaspergillus giganteus1 aCarnicelli, D.1 aSperti, S.1 aMontanaro, L.0 tBiochemistry and molecular biology international.g1994 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.585-596x1039-97127nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02933naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245008600162300001800248520153900266650001501805650001901820650001901839650002001858650001601878650000701894650001301901650002101914650002101935650001101956650001001967700002201977700002501999700002002024700002402044700002302068700002202091700002002113700002002133700002002153700001702173700001902190773009502209852000902304856008202313930003302395946001102428655001202439IND4395621120221120160715.0070930e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439562112DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2007000422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZinellu, Angelo10aProtein-bound glutathione measurement in cultured cells by CZE with LIF detection  ap. 3277-3283.  aProtein modification due to S-glutathio(ny)lation, usually a reversible process in intact cells, arises interest as a possible mode of regulatory events that may potentially modify a large number of cellular processes. However, since less than 1% of the total protein is S-thiolated in resting cells, high sensitivity methods are required for its evaluation. We set up a new method by CE with LIF detection that allows to measure all forms of intracellular GSH involved in the process. For total and reduced glutathione, cell lysates were rapidly derivatized by 5-iodoacetoamidofluorescein (5-IAF), a selective reagent which traps thiol groups, thus minimizing auto-oxidation. Derivatized samples were separated in a 47 cmx75 μm id capillary by using 7 mmol/L sodium phosphate at pH 11.6. For the evaluation of S-glutathio(ny)lation, intracellular proteins from cell lysates were precipitated and washed to eliminate free GSH. After protein resuspension with NaOH and reduction treatment with tri-n-butylphosphine (TBP), the freed GSH was dried in a vacuum concentrator and directly dissolved in the derivatization mixture. GSH-IAF adduct was detected in a 6 mmol/L sodium phosphate, 3 mmol/L boric acid, and 75 mmol/L N-methylglucamine run buffer in less than 5 min. The high sensitivity ensured by 5-IAF use and sample concentration, allowed to quantify GSH at levels as low as 5 nmol/L, value suitable for the evaluation of protein S-glutathio(ny)lation. The method suitability was checked both in HUVEC and ECV304 cultured cells. 3aboric acid 3acultured cells 3aderivatization 3aelectrophoresis 3aglutathione 3apH 3aproteins 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium phosphate 3athiols 3atraps1 aSotgia, Salvatore1 aPosadino, Anna Maria1 aPasciu, Valeria1 aZinellu, Elisabetta1 aUsai, Maria Franca1 aScanu, Bastianina1 aChessa, Roberto1 aGaspa, Leonardo1 aTadolini, Bruna1 aDeiana, Luca1 aCarru, Ciriaco0 tElectrophoresis.g2007 Sept., v. 28, no. 18 p.3277-3283dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007000423Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01477naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245007400161300001800235520064800253650002000901650001400921650001400935700002000949773009500969852000901064856008201073930003301155946001101188655001201199IND4395621420221120160620.0070930e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439562142DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2007000012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chang Yi10aEOF using the Ritz method: Application to superelliptic microchannels  ap. 3296-3301.  aAn efficient Ritz method is developed from the variational principle to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation under the Debye-Hückel approximation for studying the EOF in microchannels.

Several accurate tables presented are useful for design of electroosmotic channels, especially rectangular channels with rounded corners.

This research was conducted to obtain information on the chemistry, mineralogy, and reactivity of these materials in representative soils from this region. Using a combination of classical and nonclassical chemical and mineralogical methods, four Spodosols from Adirondack State Park, New York, were characterized. The principal clay-sized layer silicates identified included: kaolinite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, and hydroxy-interlayered smectite. These tended to be concentrated in E horizons. Minor amounts of clay-sized feldspar and mica were also identified. Para- and noncrystalline materials were the most abundant constituents of the less than 2-micrometer clay from B and C horizons. Up to 720 g/kg of the less than 2-micrometer B horizon clay was para- or noncrystalline materials. In contrast, these materials, on average, accounted for only 65 g/kg in the E horizon less than 2-micrometer clays. Reaction with NaF indicated that these materials have very high surface reactivities. Infrared spectrophotometry, Mossbauer, electron microscopy, and selective dissolution studies were used to characterize the less than 2- and less than 0.5-micrometer clay fractions. Imogolite-like materials, so called because of the lack of a characteristic imogolite doublet near 1000 cm-1 in the infrared, indicating poor development in the imogolite c-axis direction, were identified in the less than 0.5-micrometer clays from B and C horizons. Characteristic imogolite tubular morphology was not observed by electron microscopy. Mossbauer experiments indicated the presence of microcrystalline goethite and ferrihydrite; electron microscopy confirmed their presence. Para- and noncrystalline aluminosilicates appear to be a significant component of these soils; their high surface reactivities may have large influence on the chemical reactivity and physical characteristics of these soils. 3akaolinite 3amica 3aclay fraction 3aMossbauer spectroscopy 3avermiculite 3agoethite 3aelectron microscopy 3aphysicochemical properties 3asoil horizons 3aSpodosols 3asoil analysis 3aimogolite 3aferrihydrite 3aNew York 0asmectites 0ainfrared spectrophotometry 0acharacterization 0amineralogy1 aMcBride, M.B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 , v. 53, no. 2 p.482-490x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03201naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010800127300001600235520203300251650002202284650001702306650001402323650001102337650001002348650000902358650002302367650002302390650002302413650000902436650001502445650002102460650001902481650003102500653001702531653002102548653001402569700001802583700001802601773009302619852000902712930003302721946001302754655001202767IND8903756820221120142126.0890713e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890375682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahler, R.L.10aEvaluation of factors affecting emergence of winter wheat planted with seed-banded nitrogen fertilizers  ap. 571-575.  aNitrogen use efficiency by cereal crops may be increased by the placement of fertilizer with the seed; however, high N concentrations often cause injury and reduce both germination and emergence. Two studies were conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions to evaluate factors affecting emergence of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) planted with seed-banded N fertilizers. Soil from the Ap horizon of a Palouse silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxeroll) was used in both studies. Two N materials (ammonium nitrate and urea) were banded with the winter wheat seed (S̀tephens') at N rates of 0, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, and 66 kg ha-1, and placed in soils at soil matric potentials of -0.15, -0.25, and -0.35 MPa. The tolerance of five winter wheat cultivars D̀aws', H̀ill 81', Nugaines', Peck', and Stephens to sulfur-coated urea (SCU) materials SCU-10, SCU-20, and SCU-30 was evaluated in a separate study. Nitrogen rates of 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1 were used at a soil matric potential of -0.20 MPa. In the first study significant N source X water potential (P less than 0.0003) and water potential X N rate (P less than 0.0001) interactions were observed. In the second study, significant N source X N rate X cultivar (P less than 0.0001), N source X N rate (P less than 0.0001), and N source X cultivar (P less than 0.0001) interactions were found. The N source, N application rate, soil-water potential, and winter wheat cultivar main effects were all significant for winter wheat emergence. Ammonium nitrate reduced winter wheat emergence 5 to 26% less than urea when comparable quantities of N were placed with the seed. Winter wheat emergence decreased as soil-water potential decreased (became more negative). These studies demonstrated how the evaluated factors are interrelated with regard to winter wheat emergence. Consequently, guidelines routinely used for seed-banded N fertilization that only consider N application rate should be modified to also consider N source and soil moisture. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3acultivars 3asowing 3aseeds 3aurea 3aseedling emergence 3asulfur-coated urea 3asoil water content 3asilt 3aloam soils 3aammonium nitrate 3aband placement 3agreenhouse experimentation 0ainteractions 0amatric potential 0aplacement1 aLutcher, L.K.1 aEverson, D.O.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 , v. 53, no. 2 p.571-575x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02001naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006800129300001600197520099500213650001901208650001701227650001501244650001601259650001801275650002401293650002301317650000901340650001501349651001501364653001701379653001401396653002301410700001801433700001601451773009301467852000901560939003301569946001301602655001201615IND8903756520221120142155.0890713e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890375652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadulovich, R.10aSoil macropore size distribution from water breakthrough curves  ap. 556-559.  aA new method for characterizing macropore size distribution is presented for a well-aggregated Oxic Dystropept at La Selva, Costa Rica, known to exhibit macropore flow. Samples were taken as undisturbed cores from a secondary forest and an abandoned pasture. The method is based on hydraulic principles including the Poiseulle equation, and on water breakthrough curves obtained by timing and measuring water flow through the cores from a drained state (simulating field capacity) to a saturated steady-state flow condition. Application of the method to the La Selva soil (0- to 20-cm depth) yielded macropore radii between 50 and 200 micrometer, with a peak between 80 and 140 micrometer. The macropore size distributions thus obtained were coupled to micropore size distributions calculated from moisture release curves to yield a set of complete pore size distributions.

In Triton X-100 extracts of heavy bovine heart mitochondria (HBHM) and mitoplasts, but not submitochondrial particles (MgATP-SMP), dimers had greater specific activity than monomers: at 30°C, the dimer/monomer activity ratios were 2.3, 1.4, and 1.0, respectively. These differences in HBHM and mitoplasts extracts were enhanced at 37°C but lost at 20°C. In mitoplasts but not in MgATP-SMP, dimers were selectively shielded from limited chymotrypsin degradation of F₁ α subunit, possibly due to interactions with other proteins or ligands in the native inner membrane. Despite these differences, all three preparations had similar percentages of dimers and similar contents of the native inhibitor IF₁ in Vm (monomer) and (dimer) Vd. These results suggest that, in native membrane, monomers and dimers are functionally distinct. 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acattle 3achymotrypsin 3aheart 3amitochondria 3aoctoxynol 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins1 aDi Pancrazio, Francesca1 aSimula, Maria Paola1 aMavelli, Irene1 aLippe, Giovanna0 tElectrophoresis.g2007 Sept., v. 28, no. 18 p.3178-3185dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007000663Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03338naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001400119245009200133300001600225500002400241520197000265650002202235650001402257650001602271650001202287650001502299650001802314650002502332650002202357650002302379650001202402650001402414650001202428650001502440650002402455651001202479653002502491653002302516700001202539700001202551700001502563773009502578852000902673856009302682930003302775945002502808946001102833655001202844IND4379324420221120105613.0060403s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437932442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF3001 aYin, Z.Y.10aSeasonal changes in spatial patterns of two annual plants in the Chihuahuan Desert, USA  ap. 189-199.  aIncludes references  aSpatial pattern of a biotic population may change over time as its component individuals grow or die out, but whether this is the case for desert annual plants is largely unknown. Here we examined seasonal changes in spatial patterns of two annuals, Eriogonum abertianum and Haplopappus gracilis, in initial (winter) and final (summer) densities. The density was measured as the number of individuals from 384 permanent quadrats (each 0.5 m x 0.5 m) in the Chihuahuan Desert near Portal, Arizona, USA. We used three probability distributions (binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial or NB) that represent three basic spatial patterns (regular, random, and clumped) to fit the observed frequency distributions of densities of the two annuals. Both species showed clear clumped patterns as characterized by the NB and had similar inverse J-shaped frequency distribution curves in two density categories. Also, both species displayed a reduced degree of aggregation from winter to summer after the spring drought (massive die-off), as indicated by the increased k-parameter of the NB and decreased values of another NB parameter p, variance/mean ratio, Lloyd's Index of Patchiness, and David and Moore's Index of Clumping. Further, we hypothesized that while the NB (i.e., Poisson-logarithmic) well fits the distribution of individuals per quadrat, its components, the Poisson and logarithmic, may describe the distributions of clumps per quadrat and of individuals per clump, respectively. We thus obtained the means and variances for (1) individuals per quadrat, (2) clumps per quadrat, and (3) individuals per clump. The results showed that the decrease of the density from winter to summer for each plant resulted from the decrease of individuals per clump, rather than from the decrease of clumps per quadrat. The great similarities between the two annuals indicate that our observed temporal changes in spatial patterns may be common among desert annual plants. 3aXanthisma gracile 3aEriogonum 3aHaplopappus 3aannuals 3axerophytes 3aplant density 3aspatial distribution 3aplant communities 3aseasonal variation 3adrought 3amortality 3adeserts 3adry season 3apopulation dynamics 3aArizona 0aEriogonum abertianum 0aspatial patterning1 aGuo, Q.1 aRen, H.1 aPeng, S.L.0 tPlant ecology.g2005, v. 178, no. 2 p.189-199dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-0237/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080813b20080905c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02542naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007400127300001800201520149500219650002001714650001601734650001401750650001301764650001901777650003201796650002601828650002401854651001501878653003201893653002601925653002801951653002201979700001702001773009502018852000902113939003302122946001302155655001202168IND8906560620221120095553.0891218e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890656062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerman, D.J.10aNitrogen isotope fractionation in burned and unburned chaparral soils  ap. 1229-1236.  aPlant and soil processes involving N-transformations have been monitored by techniques measuring the 15N/14N ratio in a sample relative to the atmosphere (delta 15N). Ususually low delta 15N values have been reported in the tissues of chaparral shrubs. The primary objective of this study was to investigate soil N-cycling processes which may yield the low plant tissue delta 15N levels. Since the chaparral is subject to periodic brush fires, which in turn result in high levels of inorganic N-forms in the soil during the first year following the burn, possible effects of burning on soil delta 15N were also investigated. Incubations were conducted on soils from an area which had been subjected to a brush fire, and an adjacent unburned area; both soils are fine, thermic, schistose, very steep Ultic Haploxeralfs. Concentrations and delta 15N of soil NH4(1+) and NO3(-1) were periodically measured. A C- and N-rich ash resulted in rapid mineralization of N in the burned soil; a substrate more resistant to biological degradation resulted in an initial loss, then subsequent slow accumulation of inorganic-N in the unburned soil. Nitrate was the dominant mineral species in each soil after a few weeks. As nitrification progressed, delta 15N of NH4(1+) increased and delta 15N of NO3(-1) decreased. Since the mineral pool in each soil became dominated by NO3(-1) delta 15N of the mineral pool became strongly negative. A mathematical model of isotope dynamics fits empirical data well. 3achaparral soils 3aburnt soils 3achaparral 3anitrogen 3aammonification 3abiological activity in soil 3anutrient availability 3amathematical models 3aCalifornia 0anutrient contents of plants 0anitrogen assimilation 0anitrogen mineralization 0aisotope labelling1 aRundel, P.W.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 , v. 53, no. 4 p.1229-1236x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02702naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001800119245008600137300001600223500002400239500001500263520141700278650001901695650002201714650002501736650002601761650001701787650001301804650002401817650001901841651001601860653002501876653001601901653002301917653002201940653001101962653001701973773009501990852000902085856009302094930003302187945002502220946001102245655001202256IND4379325220221120085419.0060403s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437932522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF3001 aGeertsema, W.10aSpatial dynamics of plant species in an agricultural landscape in the Netherlands  ap. 237-247.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study examined the changes in distribution patterns of 13 herbaceous plant species from 1998 to 2000 in ditch banks along the edges of arable fields in the Netherlands. The objective was to test if spatial dynamics could be related to spatial isolation and disturbance of habitat and to the dispersal and seed bank characteristics of the species. Knowledge of these relations should be used to increase the effectivity of agri-environmental schemes aiming at an increase of botanical diversity. All species frequently colonized empty patches and populations in occupied patches frequently went extinct. Most colonization events occurred within 50 m of conspecific source patches in the preceding year, but colonization events in patches at distances more than 200 m from conspecific source patches were also observed. The colonization probabilities decreased with isolation distance. For nine species this relation was statistically significant, after correction for year and habitat. The extinction probabilities increased with isolation. For only four species this relation was statistically significant. Both colonization and extinction probabilities were more often statistically significant related to isolation for species with transient seed banks than species with persistent seed banks. Implications for management options aiming at survival of plant species in fragmented landscapes are discussed. 3aagroecosystems 3aagricultural land 3aspatial distribution 3abotanical composition 3aburied seeds 3ahabitats 3apopulation dynamics 3aseed dispersal 3aNetherlands 0aecological isolation 0aditch banks 0aplant colonization 0aspecies diversity 0aplants 0abiodiversity0 tPlant ecology.g2005, v. 178, no. 2 p.237-247dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-0237/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080813b20080905c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03053naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245012700161300001800288520193600306650002502242650001302267650001702280650002002297650003102317650002002348650002402368650001402392650002002406700001802426700001702444773009502461852000902556856008202565930003302647946001102680655001202691IND4394659220221120080345.0070902e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439465922DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2007000612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Zhongmei10aImmobilized capillary enzyme reactor based on layer-by-layer assembling acetylcholinesterase for inhibitor screening by CE  ap. 2981-2987.  aA method for creating an immobilized capillary acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactor based on a layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly for inhibitor screening is described. The unique capillary AChE reactor was easily prepared by the instrument in three steps: first, a 0.5 cm long plug of a solution of the cationic polyelectrolyte polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) was injected into the capillary to produce a positively charged coating on the surface of the capillary; subsequently, the enzyme solution with the same plug length was injected into the capillary and incubated for 10 min to immobilize the enzyme on the capillary wall via electrostatic interaction; third, PDDA solution with the same plug length was injected again into the capillary to cover the immobilized enzyme by forming PDDA-AChE-PDDA sandwich-like structure. The enzyme reactor can be easily renewed after removing the immobilized enzyme by flushing the column with 1 M NaCl solution. Activity of the immobilized enzyme can be assayed simply by carrying out an electrophoretic separation, i.e., the substrate solution was injected and incubated for a short time, followed by applying a voltage to separate the product from the unreacted substrate. The measured peak area of the product then represented the enzyme activity. For enzyme inhibitor screening, the mixture solution of the substrate and the inhibitor was injected and assayed the reduction of the enzyme activity. The immobilized enzyme could withstand 100 consecutive assays by only losing 10% activity. The reproducibility in terms of time-to-time, day-to-day, and batch-to-batch was measured with RSD% less than 4.7%. Furthermore, the screening system was validated by a known inhibitor. Finally, screening a small compound library containing four known AChE inhibitors and 42 natural extracts was demonstrated, and species with inhibition activity can be straightforwardly identified with the system. 3aacetylcholinesterase 3acoatings 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3ascreening 3asodium chloride1 aWang, Tongdan1 aKang, Jingwu0 tElectrophoresis.g2007 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.2981-2987dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007000613Available from publisher's Web site  a20070902b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03681naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245016300147300001800310500001500328520159000343650002601933650001901959650002201978650001502000650002302015650002502038650002002063650002802083650001902111650002102130650001602151650002202167650002602189650002302215650000902238650001202247650001802259650002302277650002202300650000702322650000902329650001702338650001602355650001202371650002102383650001602404650002302420650002102443650001102464650002102475650001102496650001702507650003102524650001402555650002002569650002802589650002202617650001902639650001302658653001902671653001502690653002102705700001602726700001702742773008402759852000902843930003302852945001302885946001302898655001202911IND2321827320221120080137.0010629e200007  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232182732DNAL7 a109080602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoriano, F.D.10aMilk production and composition, rumen fermentation parameters, and grazing behavior of dairy cows supplemented with different forms and amounts of corn grain  ap. 1520-1529.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives were to compare milk production and composition, change in body weight and body condition score, rumen fermentation parameters and grazing patterns by cows when supplemented with different forms and amounts of corn grain. In experiment 1, 36 Holstein cows were supplemented with either 6, 6, 6, or 4 kg/d of dry matter of high moisture corn, coarsely ground corn, finely ground corn, or high moisture corn in two equal daily feedings, respectively. Milk yield (30.3 kg/d), milk protein (2.97%), and milk urea N (14.7 mg/dl) were not different among treatments. Body weight change and body condition score change were similar (23.1 kg and -0.24) for the 10-wk study. During experiment 2, four rumen cannulated cows in midlactation were supplemented with 6 kg/d of dry matter from either coarsely ground corn or high moisture corn in two equal feedings after milking. After the p.m. milking, ruminal pH was measured and rumen fluid samples were collected from cows to determine ammonia N and volatile fatty acids at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, ...8 h post-corn feeding during grazing. Ruminal pH values were similar for corn supplements, and, with one exception, were 6.0 or below between 5 and 8 h. Ruminal ammonia-N concentrations reached a maximum at 7 h also. In experiment 3, 40 cows were observed for grazing behavior every 30 min for two consecutive days. Cows grazed an average of 6.4 h/d, 4.1 h in the afternoon and 2.3 h in the morning. Milk yield, milk composition, change in body weight, and body condition were similar regardless of the type or amount of corn supplemented. 3aproximate composition 3amilk fat yield 3aammonium nitrogen 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3avolatile fatty acids 3aliveweight gain 3amilk protein percentage 3abody condition 3afeed supplements 3abody weight 3aphysical activity 3abotanical composition 3arotational grazing 3acorn 3amilling 3awater content 3arumen fermentation 3afeeding frequency 3apH 3aurea 3arumen fluids 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aEating 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aUreaxanalysis 2aZea mays 0asolids not fat 0amilk yield 0amilk composition1 aPolan, C.E.1 aMiller, C.N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2000 July, v. 83, no. 7 p.1520-1529x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01817naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245011400163300001800277520086000295650001901155650002001174650002401194700002301218700002201241700002201263773009501285852000901380856008201389930003301471946001101504655001201515IND4394658920221120080220.0070902e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439465892DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2006006922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlas, Maximilien10aNumerical simulations of the second-order electrokinetic bias observed with the gated injection mode in chips  ap. 2961-2970.  aIt is well known that sample introduction via electrokinetic mode leads to a bias in conventional CE, which is proportional to the difference of electrophoretic mobilities between species. In electrophoretic separation chips using the gated injection mode, flow distribution at the crossjunction, which is linked to the electric field strength distribution during the loading step, induces an additional contribution to species discrimination. This second-order bias has a similar effect on quantitation like usual electrokinetic bias: the higher the analyte's apparent mobility, the larger the amount injected into the separation channel. The present paper assesses by numerical simulations the influence of several parameters, namely the injected amount, the electric field distribution, and the analyte-apparent Peclet number on this second-order bias. 3aelectric field 3aelectrophoresis 3amathematical models1 aDelaunay, Nathalie1 aFerrigno, Rosaria1 aRocca, Jean-Louis0 tElectrophoresis.g2007 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.2961-2970dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2006006923Available from publisher's Web site  a20070902b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03123naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001700137245013500154300001600289500002400305500001500329520165300344650001801997650002102015650001802036650001002054650001602064650000902080650001802089650001802107650002302125650002102148650002102169650001202190650001202202650001102214650001102225653001402236653001602250700001802266700001502284700001602299773012302315852000902438856007702447930003302524945002502557946001102582655001202593IND4379297420221120065631.0060403e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437929742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF400 0aF1101 aAlbany, N.R.10aComparative study of morphological parameters of Grand Nain banana (Musa AAA) after in vitro multiplication with growth retardants  ap. 357-361.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe incorporation of growth retardants (GR) such as ancymidol (ANC) or paclobutrazol (PBZ) in liquid culture media during multiplication stage of bananas decreases the excessive growth of stems and leaves. However, it is unknown if these chemicals have residual effect on further plant growth. To study the effect of ANC and PBZ on Grand Nain banana shoots, they were subcultured for five cycles in the multiplication stage and evaluated in elongation-rooting and acclimatization stages. Multiplication basal medium was Murashige and Skoog supplemented with 1.0 mg l(-1) thiamine-HCl and 17.7 micromolar 6-benzylaminpurine (6-BAP), 9.75 micromolar ANC or 8.5 micromolar PBZ. Multiplied Grand Nain banana shoots were transferred to elongation-rooting stage and later on to ex-vitro conditions. The evaluation of GR residual effect and somaclonal variation on Grand Nain banana plants was determined through a comparative study of several morphological parameters in elongation-rooting and acclimatization stages. All morphological parameters evaluated in the elongation-rooting stage showed a similar performance with the exception of the pseudo-stem diameter of the vitroplants treated with both GR. There were significant differences for plant height in the acclimatization stage when shoots were multiplied in a medium containing ANC. The similarities of the parameters evaluated in both stages and the normal morphology recovery of vitroplants multiplied with PBZ suggest that there were no residual effects by adding PBZ to the culture media. The addition of ANC induced significant differences in plant height during the acclimatization stage. 3apaclobutrazol 3ain vitro culture 3adose response 3astems 3acell growth 3aMusa 3aculture media 3abenzyladenine 3agrowth retardation 3amicropropagation 3aplant morphology 3abananas 3athiamin 3aleaves 3ashoots 0aancymidol 0amethodology1 aVilchez, J.A.1 aGarcia, L.1 aJimenez, E.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2005 Dec., v. 83, no. 3 p.357-361dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0167-6857/contents3electronic resource  a20060713b20060804c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/05/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03820naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245012400148300001800272520191600290650001502206650001402221650002002235650001502255650002002270650001302290650001702303650001502320650002102335650001802356650002602374650002402400650001502424650001002439650001002449650000902459650001502468650001402483650002602497650001802523650001502541650001202556650002302568650004602591650001402637650002102651650001102672650002602683650005102709650004002760650004202800650004902842650002202891653002102913700001802934700002802952700001502980773008302995852000903078930003303087945001303120946001303133655001203146IND2321792320221120032232.0010628e200105  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232179232DNAL7 a113840482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowlton, K.F.10aNitrogen and phosphorus partitioning in lactating Holstein cows fed different sources of dietary protein and phosphorus  ap. 1210-1217.  aTo evaluate dietary N and P partitioning, 36 Holstein cows grouped by parity were assigned at calving to diets supplemented with soybean meal (S) or a combination of S and blood meal (B). Diets S and B were formulated to contain 16.2% CP and 0.35% P using mono- and dicalcium phosphate (PM) or wheat bran (WB) as the supplemental source of P. Actual dietary P contents were 0.38, 0.36, 0.34, and 0.34% for SPM, BPM, SWB, and BWB. Two-day total collections of feces, urine, and milk were conducted between 30 and 45 d in milk (DIM), then all cows were fed a control diet until 120 DIM. Between 120 and 150 DIM, cows were again fed the diet assigned at calving, then 2-d total collections of feces, urine, and milk were conducted. Milk production was similar for cows fed diets containing WB (SWB or BWB) when compared with cows fed PM. However, DMI tended to be lower, and P intake and total P excretion were lower in response to WB (20.7 kg/d, 71.9 g/d, and 40.3 g/d) compared with cows fed PM (23.0, 86.7, and 46.8 g/d). Apparent digestibility of dietary P did not differ due to source of supplemental P, averaging 45% across diets. The lower P intake by cows fed WB resulted in lower absorbed P and lower retained P (32.2 and 7.5 g/d) compared with those fed PM (40.6 and 13.4 g/d). Apparent N digestibility, urinary N, and N retention were not affected by P source. Blood meal decreased apparent N digestibility and absorbed N, and also decreased P retention compared with S. In later lactation, cows retained proportionately more absorbed N and P in body tissue and secreted less in milk than they did in early lactation. Results indicated the organic source of P (phytate-P) in WB can be used to provide a substantial portion of the P needed in dairy cattle diets after peak lactation, but the amount of WB in the diet during early lactation should be limited to prevent suppression of DMI and P retention. 3adairy cows 3alactation 3adietary protein 3aphosphorus 3anutrient intake 3anitrogen 3asoybean meal 3ablood meal 3afeed supplements 3acrude protein 3amonocalcium phosphate 3adicalcium phosphate 3awheat bran 3afeces 3aurine 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aexcretion 3anutrient availability 3adigestibility 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDigestion 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMineralsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aPhosphorusxbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aPostpartum Period 0anutrient sources1 aHerbein, J.H.1 aMeister-Weisbarth, M.A.1 aWark, W.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.1210-1217x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03379naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245015900198300001600357500002400373500001500397520163700412650001402049650001302063650001602076650002202092650002102114650002602135650002102161650001902182650001302201650000902214650001502223650001302238650001902251650002602270650001802296650001502314651001202329653002002341700001702361700001602378700001902394700001402413773012202427852000902549856008502558856007702643930003302720945002502753946001102778655001202789IND4379340820221120032205.0060404e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437934082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-005-3821-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF120 0aJ700 0aJ5001 aOkogun, J.A.10aOn-farm evaluation of biological nitrogen fixation potential and grain yield of Lablab and two soybean varieties in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria  ap. 267-275.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeveral legumes with high biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) potentials have been studied in on-station trials. The processes involved in BNF and the benefits of these species to crop production need to be evaluated using farmers' management practices in farmers' fields. An on-farm trial with 20 farmers was conducted in the northern Guinea savanna (NGS) of Nigeria. The aims were to evaluate the BNF potentials of an improved soybean variety (TGx 1448-2E) and a local variety (Samsoy-2) when inoculated with Bradyrhizobium strains, and of Lablab in farmer-managed and researcher-managed soybean-maize and Lablab-maize crop rotation systems. The level of soil P was generally low with more than 50% of the fields having less than the critical P level. The plant available P content was statistically significantly (P = 0.05) correlated with P in grain (r = 0.60), P in the shoot (r = 0.68), grain yield (r = 0.40) and nodule weight (r = 0.35). Variations in plant parameters (nodulation, shoot dry matter, percentage nitrogen derived from the air %Ndfa, grain yield, and nutrient uptake) among and within farmers' fields were attributed to differences in soil fertility and crop management. About 60% of the fields were moderately fertile, sufficient to support legume establishment, while about 30% of the farmers' fields had a low fertility level. For farmers in the study area to benefit from the BNF potentials of the legumes, an external P fertilizer input was necessary as well as suitable crop management practices because all parameters measured in the researcher-managed plots were higher than in the farmer-managed plots. 3acultivars 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3anitrogen fixation 3aon-farm research 3along term experiments 3aLablab purpureus 3aBradyrhizobium 3asoybeans 3acorn 3acrop yield 3asavannas 3asoil fertility 3afield experimentation 3acrop rotation 3aphosphorus 3aNigeria 0acrop management1 aSanginga, N.1 aAbaidoo, R.1 aDashiell, K.E.1 aDiels, J.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2005 Nov., v. 73, no. 2-3 p.267-275dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-005-3821-73Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-1314/contents3electronic resource  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03224naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015000165300001600315520172600331650002902057650002502086650002002111650002302131650001102154650001002165650001302175650001502188650001802203650001702221650001402238650003002252650002502282650000902307651002102316653001902337653002402356700002202380700002402402700002702426700002302453773012802476852000902604856008502613939003302698946001102731655001202742IND4449614620221120032201.0110225e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444961462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-010-9719-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErincik, Ömer 10aDiversity and spatial distribution of vegetative compatibility types and mating types of Cryphonectria parasitica in the Aydın Mountains, Turkey  ap. 555-566.  aIn this study, the population structure of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica in the Aydın Mountains was investigated to make inferences about fungal reproduction and population diversity. A total of 213 C. parasitica isolates from eight subpopulations were used to determine vegetative compatibility (vc) and mating types of the population. Furthermore geostatistical analysis was performed to define the spatial structure of the population. The results showed that the isolates were vegetatively compatible with the European vc types of either EU-1 or EU-12. Both vc types were found in almost all subpopulations, but their frequencies varied depending on location. The results of a PCR assay showed that both mating types of C. parasitica (MAT-1 and MAT-2) exist in the population. MAT-1 comprised 65% of the total isolates, and the ratio of mating types was significantly skewed from 1:1. Genotyping based on combined vc and mating type data revealed four genotypes: EU-1/MAT-1 (28.6%), EU-1/MAT-2 (34.7%), EU-12/MAT-1 (36.2%) and EU-12/MAT-2 (0.5%). Geostatistatical analysis indicated that vc types, mating types and vc/mating genotypes were spatially autocorrelated and clustered in their distributions. Results suggested that C. parasitica could have a clonal population structure that is generated by asexual reproduction. Low vc-type diversity suggests that the C. parasitica population in the Aydın Mountains may be highly suitable to hypovirus invasion, thereby providing a high potential for successful biological control. However, co-occurrence of sexually compatible strains of EU-1 and EU-12 at the same locations in close proximity creates a high risk of increase in vc-type diversity. 3aCryphonectria parasitica 3aasexual reproduction 3aautocorrelation 3abiological control 3aclones 3afungi 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ageostatistics 3amating types 3amountains 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3arisk 3aTurkey (country) 0aChesnut blight 0aPopulation analysis1 aÖzdemir, Zahide 1 aDurdu, Ömer Faruk 1 aDöken, Mustafa Timur 1 aAçıkgöz, Serap 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2011 Apr., v. 129, no. 4 p.555-566dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-010-9719-53Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02770naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008700126300001800213520179500231650001402026650001702040650001502057650001102072650002402083650001502107650002302122650001302145650001802158650001502176650001502191651001002206653001402216700001602230773009502246852000902341939003302350946001302383655001202396IND9000169220221120024347.0900110e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900016922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVance, G.F.10aEffect of acid treatment on dissolved organic carbon retention by a spodic horizon  ap. 1242-1247.  aProcesses involving the movement of organic substances in forest soils are not well understood.

For the O and O/B columns, DOC in the leachates decreased (7550 to 3350 and 2380 to 850 micromole C L-1, respectively) with an increase in acidic inputs; for the B horizon, the reverse was the case (435 to 1570 micromole C L-1). The DOC in leachates from the O horizon was dominated by hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids (68 and 20% of DOC with no acid addition), which were altered by acidic inputs (46 and 36% of DOC at p[H+] = 2). The hydrophobic acid percentage in leachates from O/B horizon columns decreased from 52 to 28%, whereas hydrophilic acids increased from 27 to 47% with H2O and p[H+] = 2 treatments, respectively. Ionic strength adjustment (I = 0.01) of treatment solutions reduced C solubilization in O and O/B horizon leachates, leading to lower DOC leaching. The SO4(2-) adsorption in O over variable B horizon columns deceased with greater B horizon mass due to pH dependent SO4(2-) adsorption processes. The B horizon adsorption of DOC from field collector leachates showed that hydrophobic acids were selectively adsorbed, as indicated by initial mass isotherm coefficients. The results indicated that acidity, salt effects, and B horizon mass are significant factors in controlling both the amount and composition of DOC in surface and groundwaters. 3aSpodosols 3aforest soils 3awatersheds 3acarbon 3asoil organic matter 3aadsorption 3asorption isotherms 3aleaching 3aacidification 3asoil salts 3asoil depth 3aMaine 0aretention1 aDavid, M.B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 , v. 53, no. 4 p.1242-1247x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03640naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137072000900155072000900164100001400173245013100187300001600318500002400334500001500358520168600373650002202059650002102081650001102102650001702113650003002130650001802160650002002178650001402198650001802212650002702230650001802257650001902275650002302294650002902317650001602346650004102362650002902403650003302432650002402465651001002489653004202499653001102541653001302552653001702565653003002582653001802612653002402630653001502654653001502669700001902684700001602703773010902719852000902828856006002837930003302897945002502930946001102955655001202966IND4379366920221120024335.0060405e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437936692DNAL7 a164752392pmid7 a 10.1002/ps.11492doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF6001 aAguin, O.10aIn vitro selection of an effective fungicide against Armillaria mellea and control of white root rot of grapevine in the field  ap. 223-228.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aArmillaria mellea (Vahl ex Fr) Kummer is an aggressive pathogen which causes white root rot in a wide range of hosts. Most chemicals tested so far against Armillaria, both in vitro and in the field, have not been effective in reducing fungal growth and/or preventing plant decline and mortality. In the present work the effects of four DMI (sterol demethylation inhibitor) fungicides, cyproconazole, hexaconazole, propiconazole and tetraconazole, and another six downwardly mobile systemic chemicals, azoxystrobin, cubiet (copper bis(ethoxy-dihydroxy-diethylamino)sulfate), fosetyl-Al, potassium phosphite, sodium tetrathiocarbonate (STTC) and 2-(thiocyanomethylthio)benzothiazole (TCMTB), on the mycelial growth of A. mellea were compared and evaluated; the product yielding the best results in in vitro experiments was selected to determine its efficacy in preventing decline and mortality of grapevines in the field. Best results on in vitro fungal growth reduction were obtained with the four azoles tested, in particular with cyproconazole and hexaconazole, achieving 67-72% mycelial growth inhibition at the lowest dose. Results obtained in the field showed that a dose of 50 mg AI litre(-1) of cyproconazole once or twice a year was efficient in controlling the disease even in vines seriously affected by the pathogen. However, further research is required to study minimum effective doses, residual effects and the convenience of the application of annual dressings in damaged vineyards, so as to gradually reduce the pathogen inoculum potential in soil and control the disease while reducing chemical residues in the plant and preventing development of fungal resistance. 3aArmillaria mellea 3ain vitro culture 3agrapes 3ahexaconazole 3afungal diseases of plants 3apropiconazole 3adisease control 3abioassays 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3acyproconazole 3aVitis vinifera 3aselection criteria 2aAgaricalesxdrug effects 2aAgriculture 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aPhytosterolsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aVitisxmicrobiology 3aSpain 0a2-(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole 0acubiet 0asymptoms 0aazoxystrobin 0asodium tetrathiocarbonate 0atetraconazole 0apotassium phosphite 0afungicides 0aFosetyl-Al1 aMansilla, J.P.1 aSainz, M.J.0 tPest management science.g2006 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.223-228dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/ 10.1002/ps.11493electronic resource  a20060714b20060804c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/06/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02686naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013500168300001600303520165300319651001001972653003301982653000802015653002902023700002702052700002502079700002302104773010702127852000902234856008502243939003302328946001102361655001202372IND4449610820221120024338.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444961082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9598-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConforti, Massimo 10aGeomorphology and GIS analysis for mapping gully erosion susceptibility in the Turbolo stream catchment (Northern Calabria, Italy)  ap. 881-898.  aThis work summarizes the results of a geomorphological and bivariate statistical approach to gully erosion susceptibility mapping in the Turbolo stream catchment (northern Calabria, Italy). An inventory map of gully erosion landforms of the area has been obtained by detailed field survey and air photograph interpretation. Lithology, land use, slope, aspect, plan curvature, stream power index, topographical wetness index and length-slope factor were assumed as gully erosion predisposing factors. In order to estimate and validate gully erosion susceptibility, the mapped gully areas were divided in two groups using a random partitions strategy. One group (training set) was used to prepare the susceptibility map, using a bivariate statistical analysis (Information Value method) in GIS environment, while the second group (validation set) to validate the susceptibility map, using the success and prediction rate curves. The validation results showed satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on gully areas locations; therefore, over 88% of the gullies of the validation set are correctly classified falling in high and very high susceptibility areas. The susceptibility map, produced using a methodology that is easy to apply and to update, represents a useful tool for sustainable planning, conservation and protection of land from gully processes. Therefore, this methodology can be used to assess gully erosion susceptibility in other areas of Calabria, as well as in other regions, especially in the Mediterranean area, that have similar morphoclimatic features and sensitivity to concentrated erosion. 3aItaly 0aGully erosion susceptibility 0aGIS 0aInformation value method1 aAucelli, Pietro P.

Its impact was felt from Hyères to Menton, France. The main effect of this tsunami was flooding in the neighborhoods of La Salis and La Garoupe, Antibes, France. A synthesis of unpublished reports written in the context of an administrative investigation was conducted. Various archives were also consulted (newspapers, fire and rescue unit reports, insurance reports, etc.), and a field survey was organized in 2009 to record testimonies from the inhabitants who witnessed the flood in La Salis, Antibes, the area where the effects of the tsunami were the greatest. A geo-database of the neighborhood of La Salis was built using available aerial imagery, land cover data and digital terrain models, to reconstruct the surface of the flooded area as it was in 1979 and as it is now. Comparing precise testimonies and the 1979 topographic information available allowed the authors to precisely map the flood and to deduce the runup values which reached 3.5 m locally, with a maximal distance of flooding of 150 m inland. This paper provides modelers with precious information about the extent of flooding and the time sequence in order to reconstitute the propagation and flooding of the 16 October 1979 tsunami. This information highlights the fact that the French Riviera is a low hazard, but high vulnerability area. 3aMediterranean Sea 0aTsunami 0aNice airport 0aAntibes 0aMapping 0aGeo-database1 aLemahieu, Anne0 tNatural hazards.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.833-840dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9594-63Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03530naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011000147300001800257500001500275520147900290650001501769650001601784650001901800650001301819650002101832650001801853650002701871650001401898650002101912650001301933650001501946650001601961650001201977650001101989650002202000650003202022650001102054650004502065650005902110650001802169650002802187650003502215650000902250650001502259650001402274650001902288650003102307651001802338653001202356653001002368653002502378653001302403653001402416653002802430700001602458700001702474700001702491700001902508700001602527700001802543700002102561700001802582700002102600773008302621852000902704930003302713945001302746946001302759655001202772IND2321789120221120024457.0010628e200105  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232178912DNAL7 a113840362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollier, R.J.10aEffects of sustained release bovine somatotropin (Sometribove) on animal health in commercial dairy herds  ap. 1098-1108.  a2019-12-05  aThe health of dairy cows given bovine somatotropin (bST) for one lactation was evaluated in 28 commercial herds located in four regions of the United States. At least six herds were in a region and at least one herd/region contained fewer than 60 cows. Cows (n = 1213) were assigned randomly to control or bST groups and were treated beginning in wk 9 to 10 of lactation and every 14 d until dry-off or d 400 of lactation. Management was according to site practices. Cows were observed for health-related signs by farm personnel daily and by the herd veterinarian biweekly. Average 305-d test-day milk yields were 932 kg greater for bST-treated cows. Pregnancy rates, days open, twinning, cystic ovaries, or abortions were unaffected by treatments. Supplementation of cows with bST had no effect on total mastitis cases, total days of mastitis, duration of mastitis, or the odds ratio of a cow to develop mastitis. Cows supplemented with bST used more medications for health events other than mastitis. This usage was associated primarily with treatments for disorders of the foot and hock. Supplemented cows had a slight increase in foot disorders. There was no effect of supplementation with bST on culling from the herd or removal from study. Overall, the results confirm that label directions for bST are adequate for safe use under field conditions. All clinical signs observed in this study occur normally in dairy herds and were managed in cows supplemented with bST. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3apregnancy rate 3amastitis 3aanimal husbandry 3afoot diseases 3ageographical variation 3alactation 3aovarian diseases 3aduration 3amilk yield 3alitter size 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethods 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aFemale 2aFoot Diseasesxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aHealth Status 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiology 2aMilk 2aOdds Ratio 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aReproductionxdrug effects 0aUnited States 0aculling 0ahocks 0aHealth and Pathology 0aabortion 0aopen days 0acystic ovarian diseases1 aByatt, J.C.1 aDenham, S.C.1 aEppard, P.J.1 aFabellar, A.C.1 aHintz, R.L.1 aMcGrath, M.F.1 aMcLaughlin, C.L.1 aShearer, J.K.1 aVeenhuizen, J.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 May, v. 84, no. 5 p.1098-1108x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01630naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007100167300001600238520079100254653000901045653001701054653001201071653002401083773010701107852000901214856008501223939003301308946001101341655001201352IND4449608420221117181548.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444960842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9682-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuiling, R.

To prevent a repetition, a geyser-like system has been installed, which lifts the bottom waters. When the pressure diminishes, bubbles of CO₂ nucleate and bubble upward, thus preventing the accumulation of this greenhouse gas in the bottom waters. In this note, another way of tackling the problem is proposed, by which the CO₂ is transformed into bicarbonate in a layer of olivine spread over the lake bottom. Although the volume of the gas is modest at Nyos, the approach can function as a model for other and more voluminous CO₂ emissions in the world, to prevent their escape into the atmosphere. 0aNyos 0aCO2 emission 0aOlivine 0aEnhanced weathering0 tNatural hazards.g2011 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.559-562dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9682-73Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02025naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245011200166300001800278520090300296650002701199650001701226650002101243650000901264650002301273650001801296650001901314650003901333650001901372650001901391700002401410773009401434852000901528856008201537930003301619946001101652655001201663IND4396354320221117162845.0071021e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439635432DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2007000412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Stephanie A.10aSensitive fluorescence detection of polyphosphate in polyacrylamide gels using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol  ap. 3461-3465.  aPAGE is commonly used to identify and resolve inorganic polyphosphates (polyP). We now report highly sensitive and specific staining methods for polyP in polyacrylamide gels based on the fluorescent dye, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI). DAPI bound to polyP in gels fluoresced yellow while DAPI bound to nucleic acids or glycosaminoglycans fluoresced blue. Inclusion of EDTA prevented staining of glycosaminoglycans by DAPI. We also identified conditions under which DAPI that was bound to polyP (but not nucleic acids or other anionic polymers) rapidly photobleached. This allowed us to develop an even more sensitive and specific negative staining method that distinguishes polyP from nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans. The lower LOD using DAPI negative staining was 4 pmol (0.3 ng) phosphate per band, compared to conventional toluidine blue staining with a lower LOD of 250 pmol per band. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agels 3aglycosaminoglycans 3anucleic acids 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyphosphates 3atoluidine blue1 aMorrissey, James H.0 tElectrophoresis.g2007 Oct., v. 28, no. 19 p.3461-3465dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007000413Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02598naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001500158245008900173300001600262500002400278520140400302650001801706650001701724650002101741650002601762650001801788650001901806653002501825653002301850653002501873700001301898700001301911773010901924852000902033856008902042930003302131945002502164946001102189655001202200IND4379353020221117162901.0060404e20060203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437935302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.08.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aYang, J.H.10aPreparation and properties of ethylenebisformamide plasticized potato starch (EPTPS)  ap. 218-223.  aIncludes references  aEthylenebisformamide plasticized potato starch (EPTPS) was prepared by extrusion. Starch was blended with ethylenebisformamide at 25, 30, and 35% (W/W) and extruded in a single-screw extruder. The samples were extruded at 135-140-135-135 degrees C from feed zone to die. FT-IR expressed that the microcosmic chemical environments of the group in EPTPS compared to the native potato starch, which indicated that, the strong and stable hydrogen bond had been formed between ethylenebisformamide and starch. By Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) native potato starch granules were proved to transfer to a continuous phase. After being stored for 1 week at RH=33%, the mechanical properties of ethylenebisformamide plasticized thermoplastic starch (EPTPS) was also studied and the elongation reached to 140% utmost with a decrease of the tensile strength. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the typical B-style crystallinity in the native potato starch has been destructed. On the other hand, water resistance of EPTPS was better than glycerol plasticized potato starch (GPTPS). It decreased from 50.2% for the glycerol plasticized potato starch down to 35.3% for the ethylenebisformamide plasticized sample at RH 100%. EPTPSs proved to be having good thermal stability by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). T(g) (detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) of EPTPS was higher than that GPTPS. 3apotato starch 3aplasticizers 3athermal analysis 3amechanical properties 3awater content 3aheat stability 0athermoplastic starch 0aplasticized starch 0astress-strain curves1 aYu, J.G.1 aMa, X.F.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2006 Feb. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.218-223dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.08.0593Available from publisher's Web site  a20120525b20120604c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02465naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001100158245012000169300001600289500002400305520115800329650002301487650001701510650001001527650001401537650001901551650002301570650001701593650002601610650002201636650002601658653002501684653002101709700001301730700001201743773010901755852000901864856008901873930003301962945002501995946001102020655001202031IND4379352720221123041325.0060404e20060203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437935272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLu, Y.10aMorphological, thermal and mechanical properties of ramie crystallites--reinforced plasticized starch biocomposites  ap. 198-204.  aIncludes references  aA series of environmentally friendly glycerol plasticized starch (PS) biocomposites were successfully prepared, using ramie cellulose nanocrystalites (RN) of 0-40 wt% as fillers. The ramie cellulose nanocrystalites, having lengths of 538.5+/-125.3 nm and diameters of 85.4+/-25.3 nm on average, were prepared from ramie fibers by acid hydrolysis. The morphology, thermal behavior and mechanical properties of the resulting composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning thermal analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and measurements of mechanical properties and water absorption. The results indicate that the synergistic interactions between fillers and between filler and PS matrix play a key role in reinforcing the composites. The PS/RN composites, conditioned at 50% relative humidity, increases, respectively, in both tensile strength and Young's modulus from 2.8 MPa for PS film to 6.9 MPa and from 56 MPa for PS film to 480 MPa with increasing RN content from 0 to 40 wt%. Further, incorporating RN fillers into PS matrix also leads to a decrease in water sensitivity for the PS based biocomposites. 3acomposite polymers 3awheat starch 3aramie 3acellulose 3aultrastructure 3athermal properties 3awater uptake 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3amodulus of elasticity 0astress-strain curves 0ananocrystallites1 aWeng, L.1 aCao, X.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2006 Feb. 3, v. 63, no. 2 p.198-204dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2005.08.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20120525b20120604c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03046naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245007800191300001600269500002400285520157900309650001301888650000901901650001601910650002601926650001801952650002401970650001501994650001902009650001902028650002602047650002002073650003102093700001802124700001302142700001402155700002102169773012202190852000902312856008502321856007702406930003302483945002502516946001102541655001202552IND4379340120221123041249.0060404e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437934012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-005-0593-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ700 0aJ1001 aRandhawa, P.S.10aEffect of green manure addition on soil organic phosphorus mineralisation  ap. 181-189.  aIncludes references  aThe mineralization of organic forms of phosphorus (P) in soil contributes significantly to plant P uptake, although quantification of organic P mineralisation has been impeded by methodological difficulties. An isotopic dilution method, based on tracer kinetic theory, was used to study the organic P flux rates for unamended and green manure amended soil in an incubation experiment carried out over 35 days. Firstly, the specific activity (SA) between two points of time as affected by dominant biological processes (under conditions of constant soil respiration rates) was determined in a series of successive labelling incubation experiments. Secondly, the instantaneous specific activity ((inst)SA) between two points of time was also determined by shaking an unlabelled soil with 33P, i.e. soil samples that were not labelled with 33P, but kept under conditions identical to the labelled soil samples. This gives the net size of the exchangeable inorganic P pool in the labelling experiments at two points of time during incubation. The SA dilution in the labelling experiments at a constant exchangeable inorganic P pool between two times was attributed to the release of non-labelled inorganic P from the organic P pool by mineralisation. The daily gross organic P mineralisation rates for the 21 days of incubation were 0.06 and 0.27 mg P kg(-1) day(-1) for unamended and green manure amended soils, respectively. The study demonstrated that green manure amendment contributed to an overall increase in soil P availability through enhanced organic P mineralisation. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3aLupinus angustifolius 3agreen manures 3asoil organic matter 3aphosphorus 3amineralization 3asoil fertility 3anutrient availability 3anutrient uptake 3aisotope dilution technique1 aCondron, L.M.1 aDi, H.J.1 aSinaj, S.1 aMcLenaghen, R.D.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2005 Nov., v. 73, no. 2-3 p.181-189dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-005-0593-z3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/1385-1314/contents3electronic resource  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle04041naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024001200169040001800181100001600199245008700215300001800302506017300320520189600493592002802389650002002417650003102437650002002468650001202488650001402500650002302514650001402537650002302551650001702574650001402591650001002605650001702615650003002632650002702662650001402689650001402703650002502717650002002742650002802762650001802790650003502808700002702843700002002870700002302890700001802913700002102931700001502952700001602967773012102983856011403104856008203218956008503300961000903385852000903394655001203403IND60537261920221214230903.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053726192DNAL7 a3262542aris7 a10113/53726192hdl7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2719-x2doi8 ans12199  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuhui10aQTL mapping for downy mildew resistance in cucumber inbred line WI7120 (PI 330628)  ap. 1493-1505.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aKEY MESSAGE : Host resistance in WI7120 cucumber to prevailing downy mildew pathogen field populations is conferred by two major-effect, one moderate-effect and two minor-effect QTL. Downy mildew (DM) caused by the obligate oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis is the most devastating fungal disease of cucumber worldwide. The molecular mechanism of DM resistance in cucumber is poorly understood, and use of marker-assisted breeding for DM resistance is not widely available. Here, we reported QTL mapping results for DM resistance with 243 F₂:₃ families from the cross between DM-resistant inbred line WI7120 (PI 330628) and susceptible ‘9930’. A linkage map was developed with 348 SSR and SNP markers. Phenotyping of DM inoculation responses were conducted in four field trails in 2 years at three locations. Four QTL, dm2.1, dm4.1, dm5.1, and dm6.1 were consistently and reliably detected across at least three of the four environments which together could explain 62–76 % phenotypic variations (R ²). Among them, dm4.1 and dm5.1 were major-effect QTL (R ² = 15–30 %) with only additive effects; dm2.1 (R ² = 5–15 %) and dm6.1 (R ² = 4–8 %) had moderate and minor effects, respectively. Epistatic effects were detected for dm2.1 and dm6.1 with both dm4.1 and dm5.1. One additional minor-effect QTL, dm6.2 (R ² = 3–5 %) was only detectable with the chlorosis rating criterion. All alleles contributing to DM resistance were from WI7120. This study revealed two novel QTL for DM resistance and the unique genetic architecture of DM resistance in WI7120 conferring high level resistance to prevailing DM populations in multiple countries. The effects of disease rating scales, rating time and criteria, population size in phenotyping DM resistance on the power of QTL detection, and the use of DM resistance in WI7120 in cucumber breeding were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aPseudoperonospora cubensis 3aadditive effect 3aalleles 3achlorosis 3achromosome mapping 3acucumbers 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3aepistasis 3afungi 3ainbred lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation size 3aquantitative trait loci 3arating scales 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aVandenLangenberg, Kyle1 aWehner, Todd C.1 aKraan, Peter A.

For [In(OH)(bdc)]n, the tastant interacts stereochemically with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and alters its conformations. The frequency and magnitude of chelation between COO− pendant groups of PAA and In3+ nodes of [In(OH)(bdc)]n framework influence the corresponding PL reponses. For MOF-76, the tastant interacts with incorporated water in MOF-76 through hydrogen bonding. The limitation of O–H bond stretching of water results in the enhancement of the PL intensity. For [Ca3(BTC)2(DMF)2(H2O)2]·3H2O, it is added as a third MOF component to increase the precision on taste discrimination. The significance of MOF-based “biomimetic tongue” includes: (1) PAA on [In(OH)(bdc)]n mimics the taste receptor cells (TRCs) for their structural flexibility, (2) the Weber-Fechner law of human sensing that sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity is observed between the PL emission response of MOF-76 and the concentration of tastant, (3) the strength of taste is quantified by the τ scale and the PL emission intensity of MOF-76, which are dependent on the logarithmic tastant concentration, (4) the tastant is identified by the shape of the 3D principal component analysis contour map (i.e., pattern recognition method), and (5) the fabrication of [In(OH)(bdc)]n/PAA film by brushing is illustrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylic acid 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3acaffeine 3achelation 3acitric acid 3aemissions factor 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3amonosodium glutamate 3aphotoluminescence 3aprincipal component analysis 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 3ataste 3ataste receptors 3aumami 3awater 0aBiomimetic tongue 0aPhotoluminescence 0aτ Scale 0aMetal–organic frameworks1 aLin Lee, Hung1 aHsun Tsai, Meng1 aCheng, Shao-Liang1 aLee, Sheng-Wei1 aHu, Jung-Chih1 aChen, Lien Tai,0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 May 15, v. 43 p.56-62dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100006200186245014300248300001600391500002000407506007600427520202800503592002802531506003702559650002102596650003302617650001702650650002002667650002502687650002602712650001502738650001802753650001002771650001602781650001002797650001702807650001102824650001502835650001402850650000902864650001402873650001602887650002402903700002602927700003002953700002102983700002503004700002203029773012603051856008003177852000903257655001203266IND60589288020221207084356.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058928802DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.130702doi7 aPMC58774782pmcid7 a296105402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerant, Michelle L.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6994-625710aDeterminants of Pseudogymnoascus destructans within bat hibernacula: Implications for surveillance and management of white‐nose syndrome  ap. 820-829.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFungal diseases are an emerging global problem affecting human health, food security and biodiversity. Ability of many fungal pathogens to persist within environmental reservoirs can increase extinction risks for host species and presents challenges for disease control. Understanding factors that regulate pathogen spread and persistence in these reservoirs is critical for effective disease management. White‐nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease of hibernating bats caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), a fungus that establishes persistent environmental reservoirs within bat hibernacula, which contribute to seasonal disease transmission dynamics in bats. However, host and environmental factors influencing distribution of Pd within these reservoirs are unknown. We used model selection on longitudinally collected field data to test multiple hypotheses describing presence–absence and abundance of Pd in environmental substrates and on bats within hibernacula at different stages of WNS. First detection of Pd in the environment lagged up to 1 year after first detection on bats within that hibernaculum. Once detected, the probability of detecting Pd within environmental samples from a hibernaculum increased over time and was higher in sediment compared to wall surfaces. Temperature had marginal effects on the distribution of Pd. For bats, prevalence and abundance of Pd were highest on Myotis lucifugus and on bats with visible signs of WNS. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that distribution of Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) within a hibernaculum is driven primarily by bats with delayed establishment of environmental reservoirs. Thus, collection of samples from Myotis lucifugus, or from sediment if bats cannot be sampled, should be prioritized to improve detection probabilities for Pd surveillance. Long‐term persistence of Pd in sediment suggests that disease management for white‐nose syndrome should address risks of sustained transmission from environmental reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMyotis lucifugus 3aPseudogymnoascus destructans 3abiodiversity 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3afood security 3afungi 3ahibernation 3ahosts 3ahuman health 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3arisk 3asediments 3atemperature 3awhite-nose syndrome1 aBohuski, Elizabeth A.1 aRichgels, Katherine L.

The amount of these two aza-BODIPY dyes, within the P3HT and PCBM matrix, was systematically varied, and the characteristics of the respective devices were recorded. Although the addition of both aza-BODIPY dyes enhanced the absorption of the blends, only the addition of 1 improved the overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the near-infrared (IR) region.

To achieve this purpose, a lower cumulative consumption pattern is a critical benchmark for the effectiveness of such strategies in the sharing economy. In this paper, we define and model consumption patterns and behaviour changes from the perspective of perceived systemic risks (both scarcity and reciprocity risk) in the sharing economy and test our proposed model in the case of EVCARD, an electric vehicle (EV)-sharing system in Shanghai, China. Our analysis shows that the perceived scarcity risk of the EV-sharing significantly affects access-based consumption behaviour, collaborative consumption behaviour and substitutive behaviour intentions. We also show that the perceived reciprocity risk only has a significant effect on access-based consumption behaviour intentions. Moreover, the moderating effects of access variables are tested. We conclude that sharing businesses can achieve their win-win strategies by mitigating perceived systemic risks, influencing the consumer’s desire and capability to substitute private ownership with access-based, collaborative consumption.  aPublisher supplied data  a642018cGlobal Climate Forum 3abehavior change 3abusiness enterprises 3aclimate change 3aeconometric models 3aelectric vehicles 3aprivate ownership 3arisk 3asocial sustainability 3aviability 3aChina1 aMangalagiu, Diana1 aMa, Yuge1 aThornton, Thomas F.1 aZhu, Dajian0 tClimatic change.g2020 June, v. 160, no. 4 p.655-669dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02439-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245012300201300002000324506007600344520158000420592002802000506003702028650003002065650002402095650002402119650001502143650001302158650001902171650001502190650001202205650002202217650001602239650001702255650001302272650001602285700002202301700001602323773011302339856007502452852000902527655001202536IND60529877320221207084317.0160720e20141021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052987732DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50285342doi7 aPMC42049122pmcid7 a253317742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGemperline, Erin10aOptimization and Comparison of Multiple MALDI Matrix Application Methods for Small Molecule Mass Spectrometric Imaging  ap. 10030-10035.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe matrix application technique is critical to the success of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) experiment. This work presents a systematic study aiming to evaluate three different matrix application techniques for MALDI mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) of endogenous metabolites from legume plant, Medicago truncatula, root nodules. Airbrush, automatic sprayer, and sublimation matrix application methods were optimized individually for detection of metabolites in the positive ionization mode exploiting the two most widely used MALDI matrices, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). Analytical reproducibility and analyte diffusion were examined and compared side-by-side for each method. When using DHB, the optimized method developed for the automatic matrix sprayer system resulted in approximately double the number of metabolites detected when compared to sublimation and airbrush. The automatic sprayer method also showed more reproducible results and less analyte diffusion than the airbrush method. Sublimation matrix deposition yielded high spatial resolution and reproducibility but fewer analytes in the higher m/z range (500–1000 m/z). When the samples were placed in a humidity chamber after sublimation, there was enhanced detection of higher mass metabolites but increased analyte diffusion in the lower mass range. When using CHCA, the optimized automatic sprayer method and humidified sublimation method resulted in double the number of metabolites detected compared to standard airbrush method.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 3aMedicago truncatula 3aapplication methods 3adesorption 3ahumidity 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3alegumes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aroot nodules 3asprayers 3asublimation1 aRawson, Stephanie1 aLi, Lingjun0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 21, v. 86, no. 20 p.10030-10035dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50285343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010700172520224300279592002802522650001902550650002302569650002302592650002302615650001602638650002202654650002202676650001202698650001702710650001602727650000902743650001502752651001202767651001002779651001302789651001302802651001002815653002002825653002702845653003702872653002002909653002202929700002002951700002002971700002002991773009403011856008403105852000903189655001203198IND60674187820221116191403.0200221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067418782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1110552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZalzar, Shaghayegh14aThe impacts of an integrated European adjustment market for electricity under high share of renewables  aThe European Commission has set a target of establishing an integrated Europe-wide electricity market for day-ahead and intraday transactions. However, there are still many open questions on the potential benefits of a Europe-wide intraday market integration and the harmonizing market rules. This paper intends to provide a precise insight into the potential impacts of EU policies regarding integrating electricity markets on market efficiency and on different market players with the aim of supporting policy makers to increase the penetration of renewables in a cost efficient manner. In this paper, we investigate and compare the current option of regional intraday electricity market with the option of an integrated Europe-wide one, with reference to the three European test cases with high renewable penetration: the Iberian electricity market including Spain and Portugal, the Italian electricity market including Italy and Slovenia, and the electricity market of Germany. We consider two 2030 scenarios: (i) the regional/local intraday electricity market, and (ii) the integration of the current regional intraday market of the test cases into a single intraday market in Europe. The two scenarios are modelled through stochastic Monte Carlo simulation, considering uncertainty on electricity demand, wind and solar power. The performance of the intraday market under the two options are compared in terms of generation cost, electricity prices, producer’ surplus, and load expenditure inside the European test cases. The simulation results lead to the conclusion that integrating to a Europe-wide intraday electricity market is not advantageous for power producers inside the European countries with high share of variable renewable generation, in terms of annual generation surplus. However, from the customers’ point of view, intraday market integration is beneficial, leading to lower cost to loads. Furthermore, it is shown that the flexibility provided by the installed capacity of hydro pumped-storage generators within Europe, by 2030, eliminates the planned curtailment of renewable energy sources in day-ahead and intraday markets and confines the impact of market integration on the market performance indicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aMonte Carlo method 3aconsumers (people) 3acost effectiveness 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3asolar energy 3auncertainty 3awind 3awind power 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aPortugal 3aSlovenia 3aSpain 0aIntraday market 0aMonte-carlo simulation 0aMixed-integer linear programming 0aMarket coupling 0aOperating reserve1 aBompard, Ettore1 aPurvins, Arturs1 aMasera, Marcelo0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Jan., v. 136 p.111055-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.1110553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100002100196245008300217300001600300506007600316520166400392592002802056506003702084650002002121650001702141650002002158650002302178650002202201650002502223650001802248650001702266650001202283650001302295650001302308650001702321650003302338650001002371650001502381650002302396650001202419650001702431650001502448650002202463650002202485650000902507650002102516650002002537650001702557650001702574650001602591653002802607653002602635653001002661653001202671700002102683700006102704700002002765700001302785700002302798700002002821700002202841700001702863773007702880856008902957852000903046655001203055IND60556745420221207074654.0161102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055674542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0692doi7 aPMC55601072pmcid7 a277108862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Scott D.10aDevelopmental effects of fipronil on Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos  ap. 511-520.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPesticides in urban runoff are a major source of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems. Fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide, found in structural pest control products, turf grass control, and home pet flea medication, has recently increased in use and is commonly detected in urban runoff. However, little is known about the effects of fipronil on aquatic organisms at early developmental stages. Here, we evaluated toxicity of fipronil to embryos of Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes, Qurt strain) using a high-throughput 96-well plate toxicity test. Male and female embryos (<6 h post fertilization) were exposed to concentrations of fipronil ranging from 0.1 to 910 μg L−1 for 14 days or until hatching. Embryos were subjected to gross and microscopic examinations of developmental adverse effects as well as transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq. Results indicated a positive dose-response in reduced hatching success, increased gross deformity (tail curvature) at a lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) of 200 μg L−1 and delayed hatching (∼1 day at the highest concentration, LOEC = 600 μg L−1). The transcriptome analysis indicated that fipronil exposure enhanced expression of titin and telethonin, which are responsible for muscle development. It is therefore possible that the formation of a tail curvature is due to asymmetrical overgrowth of muscle. Our results indicate that sub-lethal effects occur in embryonic stages of an aquatic vertebrate following exposure to high concentrations of fipronil, although no adverse effects at the highest published environmentally relevant concentration (6.3 μg L−1) were observed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryzias latipes 3aSiphonaptera 3aadverse effects 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic organisms 3adevelopmental stages 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3afemales 3afipronil 3ahatching 3ainsecticides 3alowest observed effect level 3amales 3amicroscopy 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3apest control 3apollutants 3asequence analysis 3asublethal effects 3atail 3atoxicity testing 3atranscriptomics 3aturf grasses 3aurban runoff 3avertebrates 0aDevelopmental deformity 0aMulti-model inference 0aELISA 0aRNA-seq1 aKurobe, Tomofumi1 aHammock, Bruce G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1408-83171 aLam, Chelsea H.1 aWu, Gary1 aVasylieva, Natalia1 aGee, Shirley J.1 aHammock, Bruce D.1 aTeh, Swee J.0 tChemosphere.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.511-520dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04182naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245008700201520213600288592002802424650002202452650002302474650001902497650001302516650002902529650002002558650000902578650001502587650003102602650001902633650002402652650001902676650001102695650001302706650001102719650001502730650001302745650002002758650001602778650000902794650002302803650002002826650002302846650001102869650001502880650001302895650001502908650001902923650001102942651001002953653001802963653002102981653001403002653002403016653004903040700005503089700005603144700002003200700001803220700001503238700001403253773012503267856008303392852000903475655001203484IND60684960220221118155734.0200318e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068496022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2020.1068832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9969-874910aAgriculture driven nitrogen wet deposition in a karst catchment in southwest China  aNitrogen (N) deposition plays a key role in ecosystem function as one of the major N sources for natural vegetation, particularly in karst agricultural areas with thin soil cover, which drive the karst N fate via rainwater. To understand the seasonal and spatial variation in nitrogen deposition and to identify the major sources of nitrate in wet deposition in a karst agricultural area (Houzhai Catchment) in southwestern China, two sites with different land use were selected to assess wet and dry deposition for one year. Houzhai village (HZV) is an area highly influenced by agriculture, whereas Muzhu reservoir (MZR) is a more pristine environment with less anthropogenic influence. Nitrogenous species and dual nitrate isotopes were analyzed. The results showed that agriculture-derived NH₄⁺ was the major contributor of annual total wet N deposition (>55 %). The contribution of NH₄⁺ to wet N deposition was 1.63 times higher than that of NO₃⁻ and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). The annual nitrogen deposition in this study was approximately twice as much as the average wet N deposition over China, while lower dry N deposition relative to other Chinese monitoring sites was observed. The δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻ showed a seasonal trend of negative summer values and positive winter values, which were primarily controlled by the variations in NOₓ emission sources. Seasonal variation in δ¹⁸O-NO₃⁻ was mainly controlled by NOₓ oxidation pathways and showed a similar trend to δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻. The contributions from four endmembers (coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, biomass burning, and soil emission) were calculated using a stable isotope mixing model. Contributions show a clear seasonal variation (except vehicle exhaust), with the four sources accounting for 20.0 %, 25.6 %, 22.9 % and 31.5 % respectively (annual mean probability estimate, AMPE) at HZV, and 19.0 %, 27.8 %, 23.2 % and 30.0 % (AMPE) at MZR. Isotopic evidence determined agricultural soil emission is a major contributor to rainwater during the summer growing season, which can significantly impact the agricultural ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aagroecosystems 3aammonium 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass burning 3acoal 3acombustion 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3adry deposition 3aecological function 3agrowing season 3akarsts 3aland use 3amixing 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen oxides 3aprobability 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3asummer 3avegetation 3avillages 3awatersheds 3awet deposition 3awinter 3aChina 0aNitrogen flux 0aNitrate isotopes 0aRainwater 0aCarbonate rock area 0aAgriculture-related microbial nitrogen cycle1 aYue, Fu-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3733-72161 aLi, Si-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0295-96751 aWang, Zhong-Jun1 aQin, Cai-Qing1 aWu, Qi-Xin1 aXu, Sheng0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 June 01, v. 294 p.106883-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1068833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014100162300001600303520129500319592002801614650001901642650001701661650001301678650001001691650001301701650001801714650001601732650001301748650001101761650003901772650002301811650002501834651001301859653001801872653001601890653001301906653001701919653002501936700001601961700001301977700001401990700001702004700001602021700001302037773014302050856004802193852000902241655001202250IND50076520720221121231739.0140410e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007652072DNAL7 a10.1080/109429109032776972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddiq, M.10aCharacterization of New Tart Cherry (Prunus cerasus L.): Selections Based on Fruit Quality, Total Anthocyanins, and Antioxidant Capacity  ap. 471-480.  aTart cherries (Prunus cerasus L.) are rich in anthocyanins and possess high antioxidant activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate six Michigan tart cherry selections for different quality attributes; fruit weight, firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity, instrumental color parameters, total anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity, determined as Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Generally, significant (p < 0.01) differences were observed across tart cherry selections for fruit weight, firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, and color values. As compared to 13.7°B for Montmorency (control), the TSS contents of all the tart cherry selections were significantly higher; ranging from 15.8 °B in selection 27–10(50) to 20.2°B in Erdi Jubileum. Fruit weight also showed significant differences, which were in the range of 3.95–8.17 g/fruit. In comparison to Montmorency, other tart cherry selections showed significantly higher titratable acidity (1.20–1.41% vs. 1.132%); higher anthocyanins (78.9–391.4 μg/g vs. 33.1 μg/g, as gallic acid equivalent); and higher ORAC values (up to 145.4% more). With respect to cost and better marketability, the results of this study could be useful for the cherry juice/concentrate industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus cerasus 3aanthocyanins 3acherries 3acolor 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3agallic acid 3aindustry 3ajuices 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aMichigan 0aTart Cherries 0aFruit color 0aFirmness 0aAnthocyanins 0aAntioxidant capacity1 aIezzoni, A.1 aKhan, A.1 aBreen, P.1 aSebolt, A.M.1 aDolan, K.D.1 aRavi, R.0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 2 p.471-480dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942910903277697  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011900211300001600330520130900346592002801655650001901683650001501702650001101717650002901728650002101757650001501778651001201793700002201805700001801827700002001845773011301865856008201978852000902060655001202069IND60701697520221120022721.0200714e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070169752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-019-02478-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaar, Abdel-Maoula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0264-543010aTransition towards sustainability in a post-conflict country: a neo-institutional perspective on the Lebanese case  ap. 691-709.  aIn this paper, we aim to understand how transition towards sustainability processes might arise and develop in a post-conflict country. We analyse the case of the development of renewable energy in Lebanon to understand how green initiatives might emerge, without a prior master plan in a country that was torn by war. We focus on the structured action being developed in cooperation with the UNDP to enable Lebanon to fulfil its international commitment of achieving a 12% target of renewable energy in its energy mix by 2020. The process began in 2010 with the installation of photovoltaic systems in the capital Beirut. This initiative has led to the creation of what appears to be today a viable business ecosystem which makes the 12% a target that seems within reach. We analyse this “success” using a sociotechnical approach with a neo-institutional perspective. We show that the support of international agencies in post-conflict reconstruction modifies radically the dynamic evolution of sociotechnical regimes and links the transition context to the different phases leading to the institutionalization of a new technology. Finally, we propose a framework based on a critical interpretation of the multi-level perspective for the sustainability transition process in post-conflict countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3atechnology 3aLebanon1 aMangalagiu, Diana1 aKhoury, Aliaa1 aNicolas, Matteo0 tClimatic change.g2020 June, v. 160, no. 4 p.691-709dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02478-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245021600165300001400381520153600395592002801931650002301959650001101982650001801993650001402011650002302025650001302048650002002061650001802081650001202099650002002111650002202131650001802153650001902171650001802190650001102208650001502219650001402234653002902248653002002277653001702297653002002314653003402334700001402368700001602382700001602398700001702414700001802431700001402449773009302463856008202556852000902638655001202647IND60091653120221122033650.0161021e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haijun13aAn ultrasensitive peroxydisulfate electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for Streptococcus suis serotype 2 based on l-cysteine combined with mimicking bi-enzyme synergetic catalysis to in situ generate coreactant  ap. 63-68.  aA novel signal amplification strategy of mimicking bi-enzyme synergetic catalysis to generate coreactant in situ was designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive peroxydisulfate electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for detection of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2). It was the first time to detect SS2 by using ECL. Through the interaction between l-cysteine (l-cys) and hollow PtPd bimetal alloy nanoparticles (HPtPd) to form ((l-cys-HPtPd)n) nanocomposites, the loading amount of l-cys and HPtPd was greatly increased, which could greatly enhance the ECL signal of peroxydisulfate. At the same time, Glucose Oxidase (GOD), used to block nonspecific binding sites of (l-cys-HPtPd)n nanocomposites, could rapidly oxidize d-glucose in the detection solution into gluconic acid accompanying with the generation of H2O2, which was further catalyzed by HPtPd to generate O2. And O2, acted as the coreactant of peroxydisulfate, could greatly amplify the ECL signal. In the process, HPtPd could be regarded as mimicking enzyme, the effect of which was similar to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in generating O2. With the several amplification factors of a sandwich-type structure we designed, a wide linear ranged from 0.0001 to 100ngmL−1 was acquired with a relatively low detection limit of 33fgmL−1 for SS2. The present work demonstrated that the novel strategy had the great advantages in sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility which might hold a new promise for highly sensitive bioassays applied in clinical detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus suis 3aalloys 3abinding sites 3abioassays 3acatalytic activity 3acysteine 3adetection limit 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmunosensors 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aperoxidase 3aserotypes 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aPeroxydisulfate 0aImmunosensor 0aMimic bi-enzyme 0aStreptococcus suis serotype 21 aYuan, Ruo1 aChai, Yaqin1 aCao, Yaling1 aGan, Xianxue1 aChen, Yinfeng1 aWang, Yan0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 May 15, v. 43 p.63-68dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04202naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011300204300001600317500001900333520198500352536030202337592002802639596011702667596011402784596007002898650001902968650000802987650001502995650001503010650001003025650001103035650002303046650001403069650002003083650001103103650001603114650001603130650001503146651001003161653001403171653001503185653001903200653001203219653002303231700001703254700001903271700001703290700001203307700001403319700001203333700001703345700001503362700001703377773010503394856008003499852000903579655001203588IND60730301420221122123832.0210307e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073030142DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836209727772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaonan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6947-945X10aSedimentary grain-size record of Holocene runoff fluctuations in the Lake Lugu watershed, SE Tibetan Plateau  ap. 346-355.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChanges in moisture conditions or precipitation in the SE Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene have been studied using various environmental archives and proxies. However, due to different interpretations of the proxies and records, the pattern of Holocene precipitation/moisture variations in the region remains unclear. A lake-sediment-based reconstruction of runoff variations, which can directly and sensitively reflect changes in precipitation, provides the opportunity to reconstruct the evolution of moisture conditions in the SE Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. In this study, we used a well-dated sediment core (LGH2) from Lake Lugu, a deep alpine lake charged mainly by precipitation on the lake surface and by runoff from the watershed, to reconstruct variations in runoff during the Holocene. In addition, 70 lake surface sediment samples were collected to examine the spatial variation of grain size. Endmember modeling analysis of the grain-size data was used to characterize the processes of sediment transport and runoff fluctuations. The carbonate content of core LGH2 shows that the lake level was generally high during 11,600–3100 cal years BP, and that the lake basin was closed after 3100 cal years BP and semi-closed since 90 cal years BP. Grain-size endmember EM 3, which represents the runoff input clastic materials, is used to reconstruct runoff fluctuations in the Lake Lugu watershed. The record indicates a gradual increase in runoff during 11,600–9000 cal years BP, stable and high runoff during 9000–2000 cal years BP, and weak runoff and a low lake level since 2000 cal years BP. Our reconstruction of runoff fluctuations tracks changes in regional temperature and tropical SSTs rather than in boreal summer insolation. This finding supports the hypothesis that increasing tropical SSTs strengthened ITCZ convection which enhanced the flux of water vapour from the ocean to the air, and hence the moisture supplies to SW China.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported the Yunnan Provincial Government Leading Scientist Program (Grant No. 2015HA024) and the NSFC (Grant Nos. 41820104008 and 41901104).  aPublisher supplied data  a41820104008cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41901104cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2015HA024cYunnan Provincial Government Leading Scientist Program 3aHolocene epoch 3aair 3acarbonates 3aconvection 3alakes 3arunoff 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aendmember 0alake level 0alake sediments 0amonsoon 0asouthwestern China1 aZhang, Hucai1 aChang, Fengqin1 aAshraf, Umar1 aWu, Han1 aPeng, Wei1 aLiu, Qi1 aLiu, Fengwen1 aZhang, Yun1 aDuan, Lizeng0 tHolocene.g2021 Mar., v. 31, no. 3 p.346-355dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836209727773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003200188245006300220300001800283506007600301520112500377592002801502506003701530650001401567650002201581650002201603650003701625650002101662650002501683650002401708650002901732700002001761700001801781773008801799856008101887852000901968655001201977IND60575341820221207100348.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057534182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-017-2404-72doi7 aPMC54372582pmcid7 a282839092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopolska-Woś, Agnieszka M.10aMAP kinase p38 is a novel target of CacyBP/SIP phosphatase  ap. 1069-1076.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are important players in cellular signaling pathways. Recently, it has been shown that CacyBP/SIP serves as a phosphatase for one of the MAP kinases, ERK1/2. Through dephosphorylation of this kinase CacyBP/SIP modulates the transcriptional activity of Elk-1 and the activity of the CREB-BDNF pathway. In this work, using NB2a cell lysate and recombinant proteins, we show that CacyBP/SIP binds and dephosphorylates another member of the MAP kinase family, p38. Analysis of recombinant full-length CacyBP/SIP and its three major domains, N-terminal, middle CS and C-terminal SGS, indicates that the middle CS domain is responsible for p38 dephosphorylation. Moreover, we show that CacyBP/SIP might be implicated in response to oxidative stress. Dephosphorylation of phospho-p38 by CacyBP/SIP in NB2a cells treated with hydrogen peroxide is much more effective than in control ones. In conclusion, involvement of CacyBP/SIP in the regulation of p38 kinase activity, in addition to that of ERK1/2, might point to the function of CacyBP/SIP in pro-survival and pro-apoptotic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3adephosphorylation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3arecombinant proteins 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aRosińska, Sara1 aFilipek, Anna0 tAmino acids.g2017 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.1069-1076dSpringer Viennax0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-017-2404-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013400170300001800304520109600322592002801418650002101446650001701467650001701484650001001501650001801511650001401529650002101543653001701564653002101581653001301602700001901615700002201634700001901656700002501675700002001700700002401720700001901744700003101763700002201794700002201816773013701838856008701975852000902062655001202071IND60676127920221120124812.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067612792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddoun, Noura10aStructural features and rheological behavior of a water-soluble polysaccharide extracted from the seeds of Plantago ciliata Desf.  ap. 1333-1341.  aA water-soluble polysaccharide (PSPC) was extracted from the seeds of Plantago ciliata Desf., a spontaneous Algerian Saharan plant by a hot aqueous extraction then purified by successive ethanolic precipitations. The final extraction yield for PSPC was close to 18.6% (w/v). PSPC was then investigated regarding its global composition, structural features and rheological properties. PSPC is a neutral arabinoxylan, composed of a β-(1,3)/β-(1,4)-d-xylan backbone with side chains of Xylp, and Araf residues attached in O-2 and O-3 positions. The macromolecular characteristics of PSPC in water was determined by SEC/MALLS, with a high molecular weight (Mw) of 700 kDa, a low polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.47 and an intrinsic viscosity [η] close to 157 mL/g. PSPC showed a pseudoplastic behavior in semi-dilute media and the critical overlay concentration (C*) was estimated around 0.32–0.37% (w/v). This current research has supplied original structural information on a new arabinoxylan which could be particularly useful as a novel source of soluble fiber belonging to psyllium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlantago ciliata 3aarabinoxylan 3apsyllium gum 3aseeds 3asoluble fiber 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 0aArabinoxylan 0aPlantago ciliata 0aRheology1 aBoual, Zakaria1 aDelattre, Cédric1 aUrsu, Alina V.1 aDesbrières, Jacques1 aLe Cerf, Didier1 aGardarin, Christine1 aHentati, Faiez1 aEl-Hadj, Mohamed Didi Ould1 aMichaud, Philippe1 aPierre, Guillaume0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 15, v. 155 p.1333-1341dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002400136245008700160300001600247520165700263592002801920650002101948650001201969650001201981650002401993650001302017650001002030650001302040650001202053650002202065650001202087650001302099650001502112650002202127650001402149651001702163773010602180856007202286852000902358655001202367IND60131440320221120113747.0151127e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013144032DNAL7 a10.1676/03-0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYahner, Richard H.,10aResponses of bird communities to early successional habitat in a managed landscape  ap. 292-298.  aI examined short and long term responses of breeding bird communities to the systematic creation of early successional habitat resulting from forest management at a 1,120-ha study site in the Ridge and Valley Province of Pennsylvania, from 1998 through 2002. Species richness and abundances of all species combined and of early successional species increased from precut (1998––1999) to postcut eras (2001––2002) in a treated sector (aspen, Populus spp., and mixed oak, Quercus spp., areas combined), an uncut control sector, and the total study site (treated and control sectors combined) after the fourth cutting cycle. Abundances of a woodland species (Red-eyed Vireo, Vireo olivaceus) and four early successional species (e.g., Field Sparrow, Spizella pusilla) also increased. Over the past 15 years, which spans the third and the fourth cutting cycles at the study site, three woodland species increased significantly in both treated and control sectors (Red-eyed Vireo) or in the treated sector only (Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapillus, and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla). The population of an early successional species (Indigo Bunting, Passerina cyanea) increased significantly in both treated and control sectors. Population trends of three woodland and three early successional species at the study site paralleled statewide or provincial increases in these species over the past two decades. My study has shown that the management of early successional habitats in extensively forested areas will be of benefit for the long term conservation of both early successional and mature forest bird species within a forested landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasserina cyanea 3aPopulus 3aQuercus 3aSetophaga ruticilla 3aSpizella 3abirds 3abreeding 3acutting 3aforest management 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3awoodlands 3aPennsylvania0 tWilson bulletin.g2003 Sept., v. 115, no. 3 p.292-298dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F03-0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014200161520166200303592002801965650001501993650001902008650002302027650003202050650002602082650002402108650002602132650001502158650001802173650002402191650001902215650001902234650001602253650001502269651001002284653000902294653000802303653000902311653000802320653000702328653000802335653000702343653000802350653000902358653002502367653001302392653002902405700001402434700001602448700001602464700001302480700001802493700001702511773012502528856008302653852000902736655001202745IND60684960320221118155757.0200601e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068496032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2020.1068842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wei10aDistribution pattern of antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial community in agricultural soil samples of Wuliangsuhai watershed. China  aThe occurrence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) constitute a major concern worldwide, and pose crucial threats to public health. The current study focused on this issue in the agricultural soils of Wuliangsuhai watershed in China. A total of 33 ARGs, belonging to 8 major types, were identified in the soil samples, mexF, blaTEM, vanD, sulI, sulII, and oprJ being the predominant ones. The abundance of ARGs ranged from 2.18 × 10⁻⁶–1.9 × 10⁻² copies/16S rRNA gene copies. Results of correlation analyses confirmed that intI1 significantly correlated with ARGs (aadA1, aadA2, mphA, sulI, and sulII), indicating the potential horizontal transfer capability of these genes in soil. Based on the proximity of different sampling sites with urban areas, we found the abundance of bacterial community and ARGs to significantly increase in the sites proximal to urban area, which indicated the agricultural activities and industrial pollution might alter the bacterial community structure and spatial distribution of ARGs. In addition, the correlation between ARGs and environmental factors confirmed the association of microbial community distribution with environmental factors, such as soil organic matter (SOM), available phosphorus (AP), and total nitrogen (TN). The co-occurrence pattern of ARGs and bacterial taxa indicated the succession of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria to possibly be the potential driver for variation in ARGs in the different sampling sites examined. These findings are expected to improve the current understanding of ARG distribution and their relationship with microbial community succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aagricultural soils 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3aphosphorus 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pollution 3atotal nitrogen 3aurban areas 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aARGs 0aARB 0aMGEs 0aHGT 0aAP 0aSOM 0aTN 0aRAP 0aARGs 0aSpatial distribution 0aBacteria 0aHorizontal gene transfer1 aLiu, Yong1 aLi, Junjian1 aZhang, Hong1 aShi, Rui1 aChen, Jianwen1 aLi, Hongjian0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 June 15, v. 295 p.106884-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1068843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010200170300001400272520107300286592002801359650001101387650001601398650001401414650002101428650002201449650001601471650001901487700001701506700001501523700001901538700001501557700002101572773010501593856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60555584420221120174016.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055558442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-016-0194-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazeroms, W.

First of all, we consider a stable boundary layer used as the well-known first test case from the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS1). The model is shown to agree well with data from large-eddy simulations (LES), and this agreement is significantly better than for a standard operational scheme with a prognostic equation for turbulent kinetic energy. Furthermore, we apply the model to a case with a (idealized) diurnal cycle and make a qualitative comparison with a simpler first-order model. Some interesting features of the model are highlighted, pertaining to its stronger foundation on physical principles. In particular, the use of more prognostic equations in the model is shown to give a more realistic dynamical behaviour. This qualitative study is the first step towards a more detailed comparison, for which additional LES data are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aequations 3ahydrologic cycle 3asimulation models 3atroposphere 3aturbulent flow1 aSvensson, G.1 aBazile, E.1 aBrethouwer, G.1 aWallin, S.1 aJohansson, A.

K.10aEquilibrium and Kinetic Studies on Biosorption of Heavy Metals by Leaf Powder of Paper Mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera)   ap. 177-188.  aPaper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) leaf powder was used to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions. The specific uptakes of Cu (II), Pb (II), and Cd (II) by the leaf powder were 43.40 ± 0.2, 43.9 ± 0.5, and 30.65 ± 0.9 mg g−1, respectively, when 500 mg L−1 of the metal solutions were used. The data fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm. The process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and intraparticle diffusion played an important role in the adsorption process. On the basis of the calculated thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy (ΔH°), entropy (ΔS°) and free energy change (ΔG°), it was inferred that the sorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. The surface properties of the leaf powder (revealed by scanning electron microscopic observations) were suitable for the metal adsorption process. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis confirmed the sequestration of the metal ions by the leaf powder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy implicated that different functional groups on the leaf powder were involved in the metal adsorption process. The results obtained from this study implicated that the B. papyrifera leaf powder was a good choice as a metal adsorbent. This abundantly available natural and eco-friendly biosorbent could be effectively used to develop a technology in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBroussonetia papyrifera 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3aleaves 3ametal ions 3apowders1 aBankar, Ashok V.1 aPawar, Namdeo J.1 aKapadnis, Balu P.1 aZinjarde, Smita S.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 Feb., v. 215, no. 1-4 p.177-188dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0468-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245005000164500002000214520173700234592002801971650002101999650002402020650001402044650001602058650001602074650000902090650001002099650002002109650001402129650002302143650003102166650001302197650001302210650002702223650001202250650001602262650004402278700002502322700002102347773015302368856007802521852000902599655001202608IND60687784920221122095355.0200404e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068778492DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2019001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDadfar, Tahereh10aBleaching of Olive Oil by Membrane Filtration  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study the application of membrane processes for olive oil bleaching is investigated. Olive oil is treated by adding 0.7 wt% of bleaching earth, 0.3 wt% of activated charcoal, and 5% wt% of sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (0.05 m) and then charged into the membrane cell. Operating conditions including pressure ((2−4) × 10⁵ Pa), temperature (25–45 °C), and stirring rate (100–300 rpm) are optimized. Physico‐chemical properties of membrane bleached oil are evaluated and compared with crude and industrially bleached olive oil. Results show that the filtration conditions for the optimized point are as follows: pressure = 3.7 bar (3.7×10⁵ Pa), temperature = 36.5 °C, and stirring rate = 300 rpm. Under optimum conditions, the amounts of carotenoid and chlorophyll contents are decreased (71.3% and 40.42%, respectively). Acidic and thiobarbituric acid values reduction in membrane‐processed oil (12.42% and 14.46%, respectively) are more than the industrial one. Also, some bioactive compounds such as sterols and phenolic compounds are increased in the membrane‐filtered sample (23.13% and 57.12%, respectively). Practical Applications: Olive oil bleaching is an important step along the refining process. Pigments and minor impurities that reduce olive oil stability are removed in this step. Given the disadvantages of conventional bleaching, alternative methods are introduced. In this study, the effect of membrane filtration on olive oil color is studied. Because of the mild operating conditions, the reduction of clay percentage, as well as the increase of bioactive compounds in optimum conditions, this method has the potential to be a good alternative to conventional bleaching processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abioactive compounds 3ableaching 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aclay 3acolor 3amicrofiltration 3aolive oil 3aphenolic compounds 3aphysicochemical properties 3apigments 3arefining 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asterols 3atemperature 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aSahari, Mohammad Ali1 aBarzegar, Mohsen0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2020 Apr., v. 122, no. 4 p.e1900151-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3921629x1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.2019001513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010000167300001600267520169100283592002801974650002102002650001502023650001902038650001302057650001302070650001102083650001202094650001302106650001202119650002502131650001502156650001302171650001002184650002502194650001302219650001402232650001902246650001202265650001302277651001902290653001402309653002702323653001102350653001102361700002002372700002102392700002002413700002002433700003102453773012102484856008302605852000902688655001202697IND60557969920221120181411.0200612e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055796992DNAL7 a10.1515/macvetrev-2016-00892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussar, Piret10aComparative Study of Glucose Transporters GLUT-2 and GLUT-5 in Ostriches Gastrointestinal Tract  ap. 225-231.  aThe knowledge about transport of sugars in animals and birds gastrointestinal tract is very important for science as carbohydrates are the main energy source of food. Since until now there is few information about the localization of glucose transporters - integral membrane proteins that mediate the transport of glucose and related substances across the cellular membranes - in birds gastrointestinal tract, the aim of the present study was to localize glucose transporters-2 and -5 (GLUT-2 and -5) in three parts of the ostriches gastrointestinal tract – proventriculus, duodenum and ileum - comparatively in ostrich chicken in their early ontogenesis period. Material from the superficial gland zone of the proventriculus, duodenum and terminal zone of the ileum were collected from eight female ostriches (Struthio camelus var. Domesticus): two chickens after hatching, three 7 and three 30-days old ostriches. The material was fixed with 10% formalin, embedded into paraffin, slices 7 μm thick were cut followed by immunohistochemical staining with polyclonal primary antibodies Rabbit anti-GLUT-2 and Rabbit anti-GLUT-5, carried out according to the manufacturers guidelines (IHC kit, Abcam, UK). The results showed that the staining for both antibodies was weaker in all parts of the gastrointestinal tract of ostriches after hatching compared to 7 and 30 days old ostriches showing that the gastrointestinal tract of ostriches immediately after hatching is not entirely capable of transportation of carbohydrates. The results of our study may indicate the possibility of a close relationship between feeding and the ability to transport sugars in the gastrointestinal tract.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStruthio camelus 3aantibodies 3acell membranes 3achickens 3aduodenum 3aenergy 3afemales 3aformalin 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aguidelines 3ahatching 3aileum 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aontogeny 3aostriches 3aproventriculus 3aslicing 3astaining 3aUnited Kingdom 0aostriches 0agastrointestinal tract 0aGLUT-2 0aGLUT-51 aKärner, Martin1 aJärveots, Tõnu1 aPendovski, Lazo1 aDuritis, Ilmars1 aPopovska-Percinic, Florina0 tMacedonian veterinary review.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 39, no. 2 p.225-231dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21442x1409-76217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/macvetrev-2016-00893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245012900213520119800342592002801540650001801568650001801586650001401604650003001618650002101648650001001669650002701679650001501706650001201721650001501733650001901748650001601767650001601783650001901799653001301818653001401831653001801845653001301863653001801876653000801894653001001902653000801912653000801920653000901928653000801937653000701945653000901952653000701961653000801968653000701976653000701983653000701990653000701997653001202004653000802016653000702024653000702031653000702038653000702045653000802052653000902060653000902069653000702078653000802085653000702093653000702100653000902107700006502116700006202181700006502243700006002308700005902368700005802427700006102485700002202546700005602568773011902624856008602743852000902829655001202838IND60743886620221120104356.0211009e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Rienzi, Sara C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6188-663X14aThe microbiome affects liver sphingolipids and plasma fatty acids in a murine model of the Western diet based on soybean oil  aStudies in mice using germfree animals as controls for microbial colonization have shown that the gut microbiome mediates diet-induced obesity. Such studies use diets rich in saturated fat, however, Western diets in the United States America are enriched in soybean oil, composed of unsaturated fatty acids, either linoleic or oleic acid. Here, we addressed whether the microbiome is a variable in fat metabolism in mice on a soybean oil diet. We used conventionally-raised, low-germ, and germfree mice fed for 10 weeks diets either high or low in high-linoleic-acid soybean oil as the sole source of fat. Conventional and germfree mice gained relative fat weight and all mice consumed more calories on the high fat vs. low fat soybean oil diet. Plasma fatty acid levels were generally dependent on diet, with microbial colonization status affecting iso-C18:0, C20:3n-6, C14:0, and C15:0 levels. Colonization status, but not diet, impacted levels of liver sphingolipids including ceramides, sphingomyelins, and sphinganine. Our results confirm that absorbed fatty acids are mainly a reflection of the diet and that microbial colonization influences liver sphingolipid pools regardless of diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern diets 3aanimal models 3aceramides 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobiome 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3asaturated fats 3asoybean oil 3asphinganine 3asphingomyelins 0agermfree 0aadiposity 0alinoleic acid 0aceramide 0asphingomyelin 0aALA 0aANOVA 0aCer 0aCLA 0aClnA 0aCNV 0aCt 0aDGLA 0aDH 0aEPA 0aFA 0aGC 0aGF 0aHF 0aHPLC-MS 0aHSD 0aLA 0aLF 0aLG 0aMS 0aPBS 0aPCoA 0aqPCR 0aSa 0aSBO 0aSM 0aSo 0aTBHQ1 aJohnson, Elizabeth L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8290-11221 aWaters, Jillian L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4460-15911 aKennedy, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7934-13071 aJacobson, Juliet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1700-07551 aLawrence, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8083-00921 aWang, Dong Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9894-74591 aWorgall, Tilla S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0587-52231 aBrenna, J.

One major problem in quantifying the fitness relevance of timing is that individual differences between pairs may cause the seasonal trend. Differentials in juvenile survival due to pre‐fledging timing decisions often only appear after fledging of the chicks. Therefore, timing decisions in the post‐fledging period, i.e., the duration of parental care, might additionally influence juvenile survival. We tested the effects of timing and parental competence on the post‐fledging survival of second‐brood juvenile Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica L.) by swapping earlier and later hatching clutches and radio‐tracking the juvenile subjects. The mark–recapture models controlled for the effects of duration of post‐fledging care and food availability. There was an annually varying negative seasonal trend in offspring survival that was associated with environmental conditions. Directional selection for early breeding occurred in the two years with scarce autumnal food supply. Furthermore, we found strong selection for long post‐fledging parental care. The duration of care neither declined seasonally, nor did longer care compensate for the seasonal decline of juvenile survival. Hence, the reproductive output three weeks after fledging was determined by two parental timing decisions: the timing of breeding and the timing of family breakup. We suggest that differential survival of second‐brood fledglings in relation to these decisions is an important part of the selective mechanisms shaping the reproductive system of Barn Swallows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHirundo rustica 3abreeding 3achicks 3aenvironmental factors 3afledglings 3afood availability 3ahatching 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3areproductive system1 aNaef-Daenzer, Beat0 tEcology.g2008 Oct., v. 89, no. 10 p.2736-2745dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0786.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014800172300001600320506011700336506007600453520128500529592002801814506003701842650001501879650002601894650001901920650002001939650001601959650002101975650001701996650001702013650000902030650001502039650001702054650001602071650001702087650001302104653001602117700002402133700002602157700002602183773009302209856005102302852000902353655001202362IND60772524520221207072653.0220404s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077252452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijitkul, Pachara10aInvestigation of genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and cytotoxicity in erythrocytes of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) after fluoxetine exposure  ap. 588-596.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFluoxetine (FLX) is an antidepressant that is increasingly being detected in aquatic environments. However, this contaminated FLX can affect aquatic organisms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic, mutagenic, and cytotoxic potential of FLX on erythrocytes in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) after acute exposure. Fish were exposed to different concentrations of FLX (10, 100 and 1000 µg/L) for 96 h. Then, the condition factor (K value) was used to assess the general fish condition. The genotoxicity was investigated using a comet assay, and the mutagenicity was examined using micronucleus (MN) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays. In addition, the cytotoxicity was analyzed by erythrocyte morphometry and erythrocyte maturity index (EMI). The results showed that FLX did not affect the fish’s health. Nevertheless, 100 and 1000 µg/L FLX significantly increased DNA damage. Furthermore, a higher concentration of FLX presented a significantly increased frequency of MNs and ENAs, also leading to changes in some erythrocyte morphometric indices and significantly decreased mature erythrocytes. In conclusion, our results indicate that FLX induces genotoxic, mutagenic, and cytotoxic effects in erythrocytes of O. niloticus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aacute exposure 3aantidepressants 3acomet assay 3acondition factor 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3afluoxetine 3agenotoxicity 3amorphometry 3amutagenicity 3amutagens 0aErythrocyte1 aKongsema, Mesayamas1 aToommakorn, Thularath1 aBullangpoti, Vasakorn0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.588-596dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.031  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245018000168300001600348520141100364592002801775650005601803650002001859650001001879650001301889650001901902650002101921650001001942650002101952650002101973650002801994650001202022650001402034650002902048650001202077650001602089650001302105650001202118650001202130653002102142653003202163653005602195653002502251653000802276700002002284700001602304700001902320700001702339700001602356700001702372700001802389773010802407856008502515852000902600655001202609IND60611072420221118062133.0200503e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061107242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Jiwoon10aCross-protection of a modified-live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-2 vaccine against a heterologous PRRSV-1 challenge in late-term pregnancy gilts  ap. 119-125.  aWe have evaluated the cross-protection of a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine based on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-2, against a heterologous PRRSV-1 challenge in late term pregnancy gilts. Gilts were vaccinated 42 days prior to breeding and then challenged intranasally with PRRSV-1 at 93 days of gestation. No local or systemic adverse effects related to vaccination were observed in the vaccinated gilts throughout the study. Vaccination resulted in a longer gestation period, a higher number of live-born and weaned piglets, and a significant decrease in the number of stillborn piglets compared to the unvaccinated group. The PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine was also able to significantly reduce PRRSV-1 viremia. At the time of PRRSV-1 challenge, vaccinated gilts had significantly higher PRRSV-1 specific interferon-γ secreting cells but low neutralizing antibody titers against PRRSV-1 compared to unvaccinated gilts. This correlated with a reduction of PRRSV-1 viremia, indicating that cell-mediated rather than humoral immunity played a role in PRRSV-1 clearance from the blood. Fetal thymic tissues from vaccinated pregnant gilts had fewer PRRSV-1 positive cells compared to unvaccinated gilts. Taken together these results indicate that vaccination of gilts with PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine can provide cross-protection against PRRSV-1 challenge and improve reproductive performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aadverse effects 3ablood 3abreeding 3across immunity 3agestation period 3agilts 3ahumoral immunity 3ainterferon-gamma 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3atissues 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviremia 3aviruses 0aCross-protection 0aModified-live virus vaccine 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 0aReproductive failure 0aSow1 aPark, Changhoon1 aOh, Taehwan1 aPark, Kee Hwan1 aYang, Siyeon1 aKang, Ikjae1 aPark, Su-Jin1 aChae, Chanhee0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Sept., v. 223 p.119-125dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008400162300001800246520098500264592002801249596005901277596006701336650001201403650001401415650002501429650002201454650002401476650001801500650002101518650002301539650001501562650002201577650001401599700001701613700001701630700001401647700001501661700005701676773011601733856008201849852000901931655001201940IND60662398920221120200826.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066239892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-019-02634-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Peng10aEffect of enzymatic treatment on the thermal stability of cellulose nanofibrils  ap. 7717-7725.  aIn this work, bagasse pulp was used to prepare cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) by enzymatic assisted mechanical treatment. A xylanase pretreatment was applied for varying the hemicellulose content in the pulp fibers, and the contribution of this pretreatment to the post-mechanical treatment was investigated. The results showed that CNFs prepared after xylanase pretreatment exhibited enhanced thermal stability with an increase in crystallinity. However, the overall thermal stability of the CNFs decreased significantly after xylanase was applied directly to the mechanical treated CNFs. The results indicate that the presence of hemicellulose in the fiber could affect the thermal stability of CNFs. The direct application of xylanase to CNFs could affect both the hydrogen bond between the hemicellulose and the cellulose and the covalent bond between the hemicellulose molecules, which partially destroys the internal network structure and reduces of thermal stability of CNFs.  aPublisher supplied data  a31760192cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018GXNSFDA281050cGuangxi Natural Science Foundation of China 3abagasse 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrystal structure 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogen bonding 3amechanical methods 3apulp fiber 3athermal stability 3axylanases1 aWu, Zhengmei1 aXing, Chuyue1 aZhang, Qi1 aWei, Zuyun1 aNie, Shuangxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9695-30220 tCellulose.g2019 Sept., v. 26, no. 13-14 p.7717-7725dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-019-02634-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009100171300001600262520116800278592002801446650001301474650001901487650001301506650001401519650001801533650001601551653001301567653002101580653001401601653001401615653001501629700002301644700002601667773011401693856008601807852000901893655001201902IND60573051120221116142705.0180831e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057305112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutknecht, Toni10aInvestigations into high temperature separation of antimony from metal oxide varistors  ap. 474-483.  aVery little research has been done into methods for recycling antimony from end of life products. This study investigates separation of antimony from metal oxide varistors (MOVs), where antimony is present between 3 and 5 wt%. In MOVs, antimony is found in spinel (Zn2.33Sb0.67O4, Zn7Sb2O12) and pyrochlore (Zn2Bi3Sb3O14) compounds. Due to the low concentration of antimony in MOVs, a leaching pretreatment using dilute sulfuric acid was performed where antimony remained in an insoluble solid. The leaching pretreatment resulted in a more than fivefold increase in the antimony concentration. In order to separate antimony from the MOV leaching residue, it was subjected to a simple thermal treatment and carbothermal reduction at temperatures of 500–1300 °C. Results showed that 80% of antimony can be separated from the leach residue by heat treatment at 1100 °C, while 85% of antimony can be separated from the leach residue at 1100 °C using carbothermal reduction. Once separated, antimony can be recovered from the gaseous phase due to its volatile nature. Results show that antimony recycling from MOVs is a promising source of secondary antimony.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aheat treatment 3aleaching 3arecycling 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 0aAntimony 0aCharacterisation 0aRecycling 0aReduction 0aSeparation1 aForsgren, Christer1 aSteenari, Britt-Marie0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 162 p.474-483dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245013000159520159700289592002801886650001601914650002301930650001801953650001601971650001201987650002301999650001002022650001002032650001002042650002102052650001902073650001802092650002002110650001702130650001102147700001802158700001902176700001702195700001602212700001802228773011902246856007502365852000902440655001202449IND60742442420221120213202.0210624e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074244242DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110614882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Zhenming 10aEffects of Dietary Rapeseed Meal on Growth Performance, Carcass Traits, Serum Parameters, and Intestinal Development of Geese  aThe use of inexpensive nonconventional feed materials, such as rapeseed meal (RSM), could help alleviate the shortage of feed materials in the poultry industry. This study was to investigate the effects of dietary double-low RSM on growth performance, carcass traits, serum parameters, and intestinal development of geese. A total of 270 healthy 35-day-old male Jiangnan White geese were randomly divided into five treatments, with six replicate pens of nine geese each. The geese were fed five isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets containing 0%, 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% RSM replacing dietary soybean meal for 35 days. At 35, 49, and 70 d, the BW and feed intake were recorded. All Samples were collected at 70 d of age. The results showed that dietary RSM up to 16% did not affect the BW, ADFI, ADG, and feed/gain ratio (F/G) during 35 to 49 d, 49 to 70 d, and 35 to 70 d periods (p > 0.05). At 70 d, no difference was observed in carcass yield or serum biochemical parameters among groups (p > 0.05). Dietary 12% and 16% RSM significantly increased the concentration of serum GH compared with 0%, 4%, 8% groups (p < 0.01), but serum TSH, T3 and T4 were unaffected (p > 0.05). The relative weights of heart, liver, spleen, proventriculus, gizzard, and small intestine were similar among groups (p > 0.05). However, the geese fed dietary 16% RSM had greater bursa of Fabricius than geese in the 8% group (p < 0.05). Intestinal morphology was unaffected by treatments (p > 0.05). According to the findings, dietary RSM up to 16% can be used in geese diets without impact on production performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abursa of Fabricius 3acarcass yield 3afeed intake 3agizzard 3agrowth performance 3aheart 3aliver 3amales 3apoultry industry 3aproventriculus 3arapeseed meal 3asmall intestine 3asoybean meal 3aspleen1 aSu, Guoqiang 1 aYang, Haiming 1 aSun, Qingyu 1 aZhong, Tao 1 aWang, Zhiyue 0 tAnimals.g2021 May 21, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110614883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245016200189300001600351500001500367520174900382592002802131650001302159650004102172650002602213650001502239650001902254650002502273650001502298650002102313650001902334650001702353650004802370650001802418650001402436650001602450650002002466650001602486650001302502650001802515650001202533650002502545650001602570650001002586650005402596650002802650650002602678650001302704650002402717653002802741653001502769653002302784653001502807653002002822653001202842700002002854700002502874700001902899700002402918773012302942856008503065852000903150655001203159IND60113901120221120142643.0190410e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011390112DNAL7 a232621852pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Maqshoof10aEfficacy of Rhizobium and Pseudomonas strains to improve physiology, ionic balance and quality of mung bean under salt-affected conditions on farmer's fields  ap. 170-176.  a2019-12-04  aHigh ethylene concentration under different environmental stresses such as salinity is one of the contributing factors for premature senescence of different plant parts. Plants under salinity stress produce increased levels of ethylene which inhibit the plant growth and physiology thus deteriorating the quality of the produce. Some plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have the ability to improve quality of crops through reduction in detrimental effects of salinity on plant growth and physiology by lowering endogenous level of ethylene along with other mechanisms. Two field trials were conducted to evaluate the Rhizobium and Pseudomonas containing ACC-deaminase for their efficacy to reduce the effect of salinity on physiology, ionic and nutrient balance of mung bean. Results showed that salinity stress adversely affected the physiological parameters of mung bean. It decreased the CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance of water, relative water content, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and chlorophyll contents in mung bean but inoculation of either Rhizobium or Pseudomonas alone reduced adverse effect of salinity significantly. However, co-inoculation with Rhizobium and Pseudomonas was the most effective treatment and it diluted the adverse effects of salinity on relative water contents and CO2 assimilation rate thus improving the photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency and chlorophyll content over the un-inoculated control. Co-inoculation improved the ionic balance and also increased the phosphorus and protein concentration in grain of mung bean. The results suggested that these strains could be effectively used to improve the growth, physiology and quality of mung bean under salt-affected conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3afield experimentation 3aphosphorus 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3amung beans 3anutrient balance 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3awater content 3aRhizobium 3aPseudomonas 3aadverse effects 3asalt stress 3asalinity 3aplant anatomy 3afarmers 3awater use efficiency 3achlorophyll 3acrops 2aFabaceaexdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPseudomonasxphysiology 2aRhizobiumxphysiology 2aSalinity 2aSaltsxpharmacology 0aPseudomonas fluorescens 0aPhysiology 0aRhizobium phaseoli 0asenescence 0aSalinity stress 0aQuality1 aZahir, Zahir A.1 aKhālid, Muḥammad,1 aNazli, Farheen1 aArshad, Muḥammad,0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 63 p.170-176dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03930naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017200169520170400341592002802045650001802073650001302091650000902104650002602113650003302139650001202172650002502184650001202209650001602221650001202237650002302249650001402272650004902286650002102335650001402356650001202370650001302382650001202395650003002407650000902437653003402446653000802480653000702488653000802495653000802503653000802511653001202519653000802531653000902539653000802548653000802556653000802564653000802572653000702580653000902587653000802596653000902604653000802613653001002621653001102631653000902642653000902651653000902660653000902669653000802678653001002686653001002696653000902706700001302715700001202728700001202740700001602752700002002768700001502788700001702803700001802820773011902838856008602957852000903043655001203052IND60743886820221120104354.0210904e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xueqiong10aZinc, selenium and chromium co-supplementation improves insulin resistance by preventing hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress in diet-induced gestational diabetes rats  aGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy complications and results in adverse outcomes for pregnant women and their offspring. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with insulin resistance and implicates in the development of GDM. Zinc, selenium and chromium have been shown to maintain glucose homeostasis via multiple mechanisms, but how these trace elements affect the insulin resistance and ER stress in GDM are largely unknown. To address this, a GDM rat model was induced by feeding female Sprague-Dawley rats a high-fat (45%) and sucrose diet, while zinc (10 mg/kg.bw), selenium (20 ug/kg.bw), chromium (20 ug/kg.bw) were daily supplemented alone or in combination from 6 weeks before mating to the end of lactation period. Maternal metabolic parameters, hepatic ER stress and insulin signaling were analyzed. The results showed that zinc, selenium and chromium co-supplementation dramatically alleviated high-fat and sucrose-induced glucose intolerance and oxidative stress during entire experiment period. Hepatic ER stress as well as the unfolded protein response was activated in GDM dams, characterized by the up-regulation of glucose-regulated protein 78, phosphorylated the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α. Zinc, selenium and chromium supplementation significantly prevented this activation, by which contributes to the promotion of the phosphorylated protein kinase B related insulin signaling and maintenance of glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, zinc, selenium and chromium supplementation may be a promising way to prevent the development of GDM by alleviating hepatic ER stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3achromium 3adiet 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afemales 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alactation 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aselenium 3asucrose 3aunfolded protein response 3azinc 0aGestational diabetes mellitus 0aGDM 0aER 0aUPR 0aHFS 0aFBG 0aHOMA-IR 0aAUC 0aOGTT 0aMDA 0aCAT 0aSOD 0aGPx 0aHE 0aPVDF 0aAKT 0aPERK 0aJNK 0aGRP78 0aeIF2α 0aATF4 0aATF6 0aCHOP 0aTRB3 0aSTZ 0aPTPN2 0aSTAT1 0aXBP11 aLiu, Rui1 aLi, Xiu1 aLi, Yan1 aZhang, Zhen1 aHuang, Shanshan1 aGe, Yanyan1 aChen, Xiuzhi1 aYang, Xuefeng0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2021 Oct., v. 96 p.108810-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2021.1088103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03959naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010600173300001600279520177100295592002802066650001802094650001302112650001102125650002302136650001402159650002902173650001202202650002502214650002102239650001302260650001102273650001802284650002002302650000902322650002202331650001002353650001802363650001602381653001602397653002702413653002702440653001902467653002602486653002102512700002802533700003502561700002402596700002202620700001602642700002902658700002802687700003502715700003102750700002402781700003202805700003802837700002402875700002502899700003102924700003002955700003202985700002403017773010303041856008403144852000903228655001203237IND60609260020221119040558.0180822e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060926002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCariñanos, Paloma10aAssessing allergenicity in urban parks: A nature-based solution to reduce the impact on public health  ap. 219-227.  aUrban parks play a key role in the provision of ecosystem services, actively participating in improving the quality of life and welfare of local residents. This paper reports on the application of an index designed to quantify the allergenicity of urban parks in a number of Spanish cities. The index, which records biological and biometric parameters for the tree species growing there, classifies parks in terms of the risk they pose for allergy sufferers, graded as null, low, moderate or high. In this initial phase, the index was applied to 26 green areas in 24 Spanish cities; green areas varied in type (urban park, historical or modern garden, boulevard, square or urban forest), size 1–100 ha), geographical location, species richness, number of trees and tree density (number of trees / ha.). The data obtained were used to calculate the percentage of allergenic species in each park, which varied between 17–67%; density ranged from 100 to 300 trees/ha. The index values recorded ranged from a minimum of .07 to a maximum of .87; a significant correlation was found between index value and both number of trees and tree density. Taking an index value of .30 as the threshold considered sufficient to trigger allergy symptoms in the sensitive population, 12 of the parks studied may be regarded as unhealthy at any time of the year. Corrective measures to mitigate the impact of pollen emissions include the implementation of nature-based solutions at various levels: planning and design, handling and management, and strengthening of urban green-infrastructure elements. The index proved to be a useful tool for environmental analysis, and complies with the principles of portability and scalability central to current and horizon scientific research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3abiometry 3acities 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3agardens 3agreen infrastructure 3ahypersensitivity 3aplanning 3apollen 3apublic health 3aquality of life 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aurban forests 3aurban parks 0aUrban Parks 0aIndex of allergenicity 0aNature-based solutions 0aPollen allergy 0aEcosystem disservices 0aAllergenic flora1 aCasares Porcel, Manuel,1 aDíaz de la Guardia, Consuelo,1 aAira, María Jesús1 aBelmonte, Jordina1 aBoi, Marzia1 aElvira-Rendueles, Belén1 aDe Linares, Concepción1 aFernández-Rodriguez, Santiago1 aMaya-Manzano, José María1 aPérez-Badía, Rosa1 aRodriguez-de la Cruz, David1 aRodríguez-Rajo, Francisco Javier1 aRojo-Úbeda, Jesús1 aRomero-Zarco, Carlos1 aSánchez-Reyes, Estefanía1 aSánchez Sánchez, José,1 aTormo Molina, R.q(Rafael),1 aVega Maray, Ana Mª0 tEnvironmental research.g2017 May, v. 155 p.219-227dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009500157300001800252500002000270520188600290592002802176650002002204650001002224650001702234650001402251650001402265650002502279650003102304650001402335650001102349650001402360650002202374651002102396700002302417700002202440773013302462856007302595852000902668655001202677IND60587643120221120201746.0180102e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058764312DNAL7 a10.1890/13-1201.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYau, Annie J.10aFishery management priorities vary with self‐recruitment in sedentary marine populations  ap. 1490-1504.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFisheries science often uses population models that assume no external recruitment, but nearshore marine populations harvested on small scales of <200 km often exhibit an unknown mix of self‐recruitment and recruitment from external sources. Since empirical determination of self‐recruitment vs. external recruitment is difficult, we used a modeling approach to examine the sensitivity of fishery management priorities to recruitment assumptions (self [closed], external [open]) in a local population of harvested giant clams (Tridacna maxima) on Mo'orea, French Polynesia. From 2006 to 2010, we measured growth, fecundity, recruitment, and survival (resulting from natural and fishing mortality). We used these data to parameterize both a closed (complete self‐recruitment) and an open (no self‐recruitment) integral projection model (IPM), and then calculated elasticities of demographic rates (growth, survival, recruitment) to future population abundance in 20 years. The models' lowest projected abundance was 93.4% (95% CI, [86.5%, 101.8%]) of present abundance, if the local population is entirely open and the present level of fishing mortality persists. The population will exhibit self‐sustaining dynamics (1 ≤ λ ≤ 1.07) as for a closed population if the ratio of self‐recruits per gram of dry gonad is >0.775 (equivalent to 52.85% self‐recruitment under present conditions). Elasticity analysis of demographic parameters indicated that future abundance can most effectively be influenced by increasing survival of mid‐sized clams (∼80–120 mm) if the population is self‐sustaining, and by increasing survival of juvenile clams (∼40–70 mm) if the population is non‐self‐sustaining (as for an open population). Our results illustrate that management priorities can vary depending on the amount of self‐recruitment in a local population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTridacna maxima 3aclams 3aelasticities 3afecundity 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3aintegrated pest management 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3aFrench Polynesia1 aLenihan, Hunter S.1 aKendall, Bruce E.0 tEcological applications.g2014 Sept., v. 24, no. 6 p.1490-1504dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1201.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245014900210300001600359520138700375592002801762650001501790650002301805650000901828650001001837650001801847650001901865650003301884650001301917650001701930650001801947650000901965650001101974650001301985650002201998650001402020651001402034651001102048700001802059700002402077700002702101700002202128700002202150773012802172856008202300852000902382655001202391IND60682497320221122004747.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068249732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06566-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreigert, Valentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0975-194910aLocally acquired infection with Dibothriocephalus nihonkaiense (=Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense) in France: the importance of molecular diagnosis  ap. 513-518.  aDiphyllobothriasis is a parasitic fish-borne disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Dibothriocephalus (=Diphyllobothrium). The majority of reported cases are attributed to D. latum, based on morphological identification of eggs or proglottids. However, numerous reports in recent years suggested that other Dibothriocephalus species could be involved in human infections, mainly after consumption of salmonid fish. Among these, D. nihonkaiense has been predominantly reported from Eastern Asia and probably underestimated in the rest of the world. We report here a clinical case of D. nihonkaiense in a French patient (without history of travel abroad) after consumption of salmon. Suspected on morphological characteristics, the final identification of D. nihonkaiense was performed using molecular methods by sequencing nad1, cox1, and 5.8S rRNA (containing ITS1 and 2) genes sequences. The patient was successfully treated by a single dose of praziquantel. Reports of diphyllobothriasis due to D. nihonkaiense are rare outside Asia, but worldwide demand of seafood could lead to the globalization of cases and reflect the need to monitor the distribution of Dibothriocephalus species. Thus, clinical parasitologists should be aware of this risk and able to raise the possibility of infections by non-endemic Dibothriocephalus species in order to use the proper molecular tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonidae 3adiphyllobothriasis 3aeggs 3agenes 3aglobalization 3ahuman diseases 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apatients 3apraziquantel 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3asalmon 3aseafoods 3asequence analysis 3atapeworms 3aEast Asia 3aFrance1 aBrunet, Julie1 aPfaff, Alexander W.1 aLemoine, Jean-Philippe1 aCandolfi, Ermanno1 aAbou-Bacar, Ahmed0 tParasitology research.g2020 Feb., v. 119, no. 2 p.513-518dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06566-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002700135245010500162300001700267500002000284520241800304592002802722650002602750650001602776650002402792650001002816650001402826650001302840650001402853650001402867650001202881650001402893650002302907650003202930650001402962650001002976650002802986773009703014852000903111856007103120655001203191IND4371239120221121164617.0170626e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437123912DNAL7 a10.1890/03-00672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabowski, Jonathan H.10aHabitat complexity disrupts predator–prey interactions but not the trophic cascade on oyster reefs  ap. 995-1004.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite recognition of the significance of both food web interactions and habitat complexity in community dynamics, current ecological theory rarely couples these two processes. Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster‐reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri‐trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters. The indirect effects of toadfish on oysters emerged through their influence on how intensely mud crabs preyed on oysters. Augmentation of habitat complexity by substituting vertically oriented, living oysters for the flat shells of dead oysters disrupted both of the direct trophic linkages but did not alter the magnitude of the indirect effect of toadfish on juvenile oysters. This paradox can be understood by partitioning the mechanisms by which toadfish influence mud crabs and ultimately juvenile oysters. Trait‐mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs; i.e., predator‐avoidance behavior in mud crabs) accounted for 95.6–98.2% of toadfish indirect benefits to oyster survival and, consequently, were a much greater contributor than density‐mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs; i.e., the reduction in crab abundance by toadfish). Avoidance behavior was unaffected by modification in habitat complexity. Complex reefs increased total oyster survival because added habitat complexity reduced mud crab predation on oysters. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was much greater than the increase in oyster mortality as a result of complex reefs disrupting toadfish predation on mud crabs. This experimental demonstration of how habitat complexity modifies trophic interactions in a temperate reef community has fundamental implications for our understanding of species interaction webs and community structure. The influence of habitat complexity on the strength of a trophic cascade generally may depend upon whether physical complexity provides actual and perceived refuges for component predator–prey pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aOpsanus tau 3acommunity structure 3acrabs 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3aoysters 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3areefs 3atritrophic interactions0 tEcology.g2004 Apr., v. 85, no. 4 p.995-1004dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-00673Available from publisher's site 7aarticle05068naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003200148245013300180300001600313500001500329520281600344592002803160650002503188650002003213650001203233650002803245650002503273650001403298650001303312650001403325650001603339650002003355650002003375650001103395650002203406650001403428650001203442650002303454650002003477650001203497650003703509650001103546650001803557650001303575650001903588651001103607653002203618653001703640653002003657700002703677700002803704700002103732700002103753700003303774700002503807700002803832700003103860700002303891700002703914700002803941700002203969700003103991700003904022700002904061700003304090773010604123856008404229852000904313655001204322IND4472299220221120110623.0150808e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447229922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Doris Sobral Marques10aEvaluation of tropical water sources and mollusks in southern Brazil using microbiological, biochemical, and chemical parameters  ap. 153-161.  a2019-12-06  aFlorianópolis, a city located in the Santa Catarina State in southern Brazil, is the national leading producer of bivalve mollusks. The quality of bivalve mollusks is closely related to the sanitary conditions of surrounding waters where they are cultivated. Presently, cultivation areas receive large amounts of effluents derived mainly from treated and non-treated domestic, rural, and urban sewage. This contributes to the contamination of mollusks with trace metals, pesticides, other organic compounds, and human pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoan. The aim of this study was to perform a thorough diagnosis of the shellfish growing areas in Florianópolis, on the coast of Santa Catarina. The contamination levels of seawater, sediments, and oysters were evaluated for their microbiological, biochemical, and chemical parameters at five sea sites in Florianópolis, namely three regular oyster cultivation areas (Sites 1, 2, and oyster supplier), a polluted site (Site 3), and a heavily polluted site (Site 4). Samples were evaluated at day zero and after 14 days. Seawater and sediment samples were collected just once, at the end of the experiment. Antioxidant defenses, which may occur in contaminated environments in response to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by organisms, were analyzed in oysters, as well as organic compounds (in oysters and sediment samples) and microbiological contamination (in oysters and seawater samples). The results showed the presence of the following contaminants: fecal coliforms in seawater samples (four sites), human adenovirus (all sites), human noroviruses GI and GII (two sites), Hepatitis A viruses (one site), JC Polyomavirus in an oyster sample from the oyster supplier, Giardia duodenalis cysts, and Cryptosporidium sp oocysts (one site). Among organochlorine pesticides, only DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) were detected in some sediment and oysters samples in very low levels; site 4 had the highest concentrations of total aliphatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) found either in oysters or in sediment samples. The major concentration of fecal sterol coprostanol was found at site 4, followed by site 3. After 14 days of allocation in the four selected sites, there was a significant difference in the enzymes analyzed at the monitored spots. The detection of different contaminants in oysters, seawater, and sediment samples in the present study shows the impact untreated or inadequately treated effluents have on coastal areas. These results highlight the need for public investment in adequate wastewater treatment and adequate treatment of oysters, ensuring safe areas for shellfish production as well as healthier bivalve mollusks for consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman polyomavirus 2 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aenzymes 3areactive oxygen species 3awastewater treatment 3ashellfish 3aBivalvia 3asediments 3acoprostanol 3aCryptosporidium 3aGiardia lamblia 3acoasts 3acoliform bacteria 3aeffluents 3aoocysts 3avertebrate viruses 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aoysters 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asewage 3aHepatovirus A 3aseawater 3atrace elements 3aBrazil 0aHepatitis A virus 0aantioxidants 0aJC polyomavirus1 aRamos, Ana Paula Dores1 aNunes, Fabrício Flores1 aMoresco, Vanessa1 aTaniguchi, Satie1 aGuiguet Leal, Diego Averaldo1 aSasaki, Silvio Tarou1 aBícego, Márcia Caruso1 aMontone, Rosalinda Carmela1 aDurigan, Maurício1 aTeixeira, Adriano Luiz1 aPilotto, Mariana Rangel1 aDelfino, Nicésio1 aFranco, Regina Maura Bueno1 ade Melo, Cláudio Manoel Rodrigues1 aBainy, Afonso Celso Dias1 aBarardi, Célia Regina Monte0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 76 p.153-161dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002000172245012300192300001600315520049900331592002800830650002800858650002400886650001200910650001600922650001800938650001600956650001400972650001300986650001900999650003401018650003701052650003601089650002701125650003701152650004001189700001701229700001701246700002001263700001801283700001701301773008201318856008901400852000901489655001201498IND4466503220221119182522.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446650322DNAL7 a223861082pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.12.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shenghua10aMercury capture into biogenic amorphous selenium nanospheres produced by mercury resistant Shewanella putrefaciens 200  ap. 621-624.  aShewanella putrefaciens 200, resistant to high concentration of Hg(II), was selected for co-removal of mercury and selenium from aqueous medium.

We recently demonstrated that FxOH could induce anoikis-like cells in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Thus, we developed molecular hallmarks for anoikis in vitro, and to confirm induction of such molecular hallmarks in an azoxymethane/ dextran sodium sulfate carcinogenic model by Fx ingestion. During the process of anoikis by FxOH (2.5 μmol/l) in DLD-1 cells, the cells show the characteristics of integrin β1low/−, p-FAK(Tyr397)low/− or p-Paxillin(Tyr31)low/− cells with cleaved caspase-3high, which may be useful as molecular hallmarks. Fx administration (30 mg/kg body weight) significantly suppressed the number and size of polyps compared with untreated control mice. In addition, the incidence and multiplicity of colonic lesions tended to reduce. Moreover, cells showing integrin β1low/−, p-FAK(Tyr397)low/− and p-Paxillin(Tyr31)low/− with cleaved caspase-3high in colonic crypts were significantly increased 2.2-, 4.8- and 5.2-fold by Fx administration compared with untreated control mice, respectively. Our results suggest that Fx showed a chemopreventive effect in the carcinogenic models through anoikis-like cells induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abody weight 3acarcinogenesis 3achemoprevention 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3ahumans 3aingestion 3aintegrins 3amice 3amodels 3amucosa 3axanthophylls 0aAnoikis 0aCancer chemoprevention 0aCarotenoid 0aColorectal cancer 0aFucoxanthin 0aAOM 0aBSA 0abw 0aCRC 0aDAPI 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aDSS 0aFAK 0aFBS 0aFx 0aFxOH 0aPBS 0aMAPK 0aStat1 aIida, Tatsuya1 aKikuchi, Fubuki1 aTamura, Kanae1 aEndo, Tetsuya1 aKuramitsu, Yasuhiro1 aTanaka, Takuji1 aMaeda, Hayato1 aMiyashita, Kazuo1 aMutoh, Michihiro0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2019 Feb., v. 64 p.198-205dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245020500164520146200369592002801831650002601859650001401885650001901899650001601918650001601934650001501950650001801965650002701983650000902010650001702019650002402036650002102060650001402081650001702095700001702112700002302129700002602152700002102178700002002199773011902219856007502338852000902413655001202422IND60742442620221121101328.0210624e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074244262DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110615882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, Magdalena 10aSoybean Meal Can Be Replaced by Faba Beans, Pumpkin Seed Cake, Spirulina or Be Completely Omitted in a Forage-Based Diet for Fattening Bulls to Achieve Comparable Performance, Carcass and Meat Quality  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the complete substitution of imported soybean meal in beef cattle diets and the consequences on performance, meat, and adipose tissue quality. Thirty growing crossbred Limousin bulls, with an initial bodyweight of 164 ± 13 kg and 4.3 ± 0.3 months of age, were fed a grass/maize-silage based diet with little additional concentrate (0.5:0.3:0.2). Concentrates contained either soybean meal (positive control), faba beans, pumpkin seed cake, or spirulina (Arthrospira platensis), resulting in about 226 g crude protein (CP)/kg concentrate dry matter (DM) and 158 g CP/kg total diet DM. A grain-based concentrate providing just 135 g CP/kg concentrate DM and 139 g CP/total diet DM served as a negative control. Bulls of all groups had comparable average daily gains (1.43 ± 0.1 kg) and feed intakes (6.92 ± 0.37 kg). Carcass and meat quality did not differ among groups. The fatty acid profile of meat lipids was hardly affected. These results indicate that soybean meal can be replaced by any of the tested protein sources without impairing performance or meat quality. Importantly, bulls fed the negative control achieved a fattening and slaughter performance comparable to that of the protein-supplemented groups without affecting meat and adipose tissue quality. Thus, the present findings suggest that feeding crossbred bulls a grass/maize-silage based diet does not require additional protein supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aSpirulina 3aadipose tissue 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acrossbreds 3acrude protein 3afatty acid composition 3ameat 3ameat quality 3aprotein supplements 3apumpkin oil cake 3aslaughter 3asoybean meal1 aReidy, Beat 1 aScheurer, Andreas 1 aEggerschwiler, Lukas 1 aMorel, Isabelle 1 aGiller, Katrin 0 tAnimals.g2021 May 28, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110615883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01283naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245010200160300001800262520032200280592002800602650002300630650002300653650002200676650001300698650001400711650002100725700002600746773012800772856007200900852000900972655001200981IND60657521020221120132044.0190816e20040510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065752102DNAL7 a10.1039/b402939a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInfantes, Lourdes14aThe probable number of hydrogen-bonded contacts for chemical groups in organic crystal structures  ap. 1166-1167.  aA new database has been created for chemical groups and their hydrogen-bonded contacts for 41055 organic crystals.

However, very few studies have assessed the frequency of these transpositions during the evolutionary history of a specific taxonomic group. Here we used the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as a case study to determine the frequency and relative timing of nuclear transfers of mitochondrial control region sequences. For this, phylogenetic and coalescent analyzes were performed on NUMTs and authentic mtDNA sequences generated from eight horseshoe bat species. Our results suggest at least three independent transpositions, including two ancient and one more recent, during the evolutionary history of Rhinolophus. The two ancient transpositions are represented by the NUMT-1 and -2 clades, with each clade consisting of NUMTs from almost all studied species but originating from different portions of the mtDNA genome. Furthermore, estimates of the most recent common ancestor for each clade corresponded to the time of the initial diversification of this genus. The recent transposition is represented by NUMT-3, which was discovered only in a specific subgroup of Rhinolophus and exhibited a close relationship to its mitochondrial counterpart. Our similarity searches of mtDNA in the R. ferrumequinum genome confirmed the presence of NUMT-1 and NUMT-2 clade sequences and, for the first time, assessed the extent of NUMTs in a bat genome. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the frequency of transpositions of mtDNA occurring before the common ancestry of a genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinolophus 3aancestry 3acase studies 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenome 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 0amt 0aMyr 0arRNA 0atRNA 0aND1 0aND2 0aND3 0aND4L 0aND4 0aND5 0aND6 0aCOXI 0aCOXII 0aCOXIII 0aATP6 0aATP8 0aCYTB 0aNuclear insertions 0aNUMTs 0aPhylogenetic analysis 0aRhinolophus1 aDong, Ji1 aIrwin, David M.1 aZhang, Shuyi1 aMao, Xiuguang0 tGene.g2016 May 01, v. 581, no. 2 p.161-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245013900186300001600325520116100341592002801502650001901530650003601549650002501585650002101610650002401631650002601655650002501681650003101706650001401737650001701751650001501768650001201783650002601795650001201821650001701833650001301850650001701863650002901880650001601909650003601925650005801961650001702019650003802036650002802074650002902102650003102131650002402162653001402186653002302200653001402223653001702237653002202254653002902276653000802305653000802313653000802321653000802329653000702337653000702344700002302351700002102374700002502395773012302420856008502543852000902628655001202637IND60113901320221120142600.0190410e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011390132DNAL7 a232663632pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Jay K.10aRespiratory complex I deficiency results in low nitric oxide levels, induction of hemoglobin and upregulation of fermentation pathways  ap. 185-190.  aThe cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) mutant of Nicotiana sylvestris which lacks NAD7, one of the subunits of respiratory complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.5.3), is characterized by very low (∼10 times lower as compared to the wild type plants) emissions of nitric oxide (NO) under hypoxic conditions. The level of the non-symbiotic class 1 hemoglobin, as shown by Western blotting, is increased compared to the wild type plants not only under hypoxia but this protein reveals its marked expression in the CMS mutant even under normoxic conditions. The activity of aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3) is low in the CMS mutant, especially in the mitochondrial compartment, which indicates the suppression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The CMS mutant exhibits the severalfold higher activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) and lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) under the normoxic conditions as compared to the wild type plants. It is concluded that the lack of functional complex I results in upregulation of the pathways of hypoxic metabolism which include both fermentation of pyruvate and scavenging of NO by the non-symbiotic hemoglobin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 3aNicotiana sylvestris 3aWestern blotting 3aaconitate hydratase 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aanaerobic conditions 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aemissions 3afermentation 3ahemoglobin 3ahypoxia 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amutants 3anitric oxide 3anormoxia 3apyruvic acid 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3aubiquinones 2aAconitate Hydratasexmetabolism 2aElectron Transport Complex Ixdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxmetabolism 0aAconitase 0aCMS tobacco mutant 0aComplex I 0aFermentation 0aNitric oxide (NO) 0aNon-symbiotic hemoglobin 0aADH 0aAOX 0aCMS 0aLDH 0aNO 0aNR1 aCochrane, Devin W.1 aDe Paepe, Rosine1 aIgamberdiev, Abir U.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 Feb., v. 63 p.185-190dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2012.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05440naa a2201309 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024001700136024002300153024003900176024001200215040001800227100001900245245012400264300001400388506017300402506007600575506003100651520179000682592002802472596008302500596004502583506003702628650002102665650002802686650001402714650001602728650001302744650002502757650002002782650001102802650001602813650002302829650001602852650001702868650001802885650000902903650003202912650001202944650002002956650001802976650002502994650001303019650000903032650003203041653000903073653000803082653000803090653000803098653000803106653000703114653000803121653000803129653000803137653000903145653000803154653000803162653000703170653000803177653000803185653000903193653000803202653000703210653000703217653001003224653001103234653000803245653001003253653001003263653000703273653000903280653001003289653000703299653000803306653000703314653000703321653000803328653000703336653000803343653000803351653000703359653000903366653000903375653001003384653000803394653000703402653000803409653001003417653000903427653003103436653001503467653001203482653001403494653002303508653001403531700002203545700001703567700001903584700001703603700001703620700002003637700002003657773011703677856008603794856011403880956009803994961001704092852000904109655001204118IND60619711220221207085107.0190207e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061971122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.10.0052chorus7 a3522022aris7 a10113/61971122hdl7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.10.0052doi8 ans16194  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽáček, Petr10aDietary saturated fatty acid type impacts obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and plasma lipidomic signatures in mice  ap. 32-44.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSaturated fatty acid (SFA) intake is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, but scant work examines the impact of SFA type upon these outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet prepared with medium chain SFA (MCSFA), mostly as lauric acid-derived from coconut oil, reduces obesity-induced outcomes compared to obesogenic diets prepared with increasing amounts long chain SFA (LCSFA), primarily palmitic acid. Mice were fed (16 weeks) a control, low fat diet or obesogenic diets prepared with differing content of MCSFA or LCSFA in which polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; MUFA) were kept constant. Inclusion of MCSFA in an obesogenic diet prevented hepatic lipid accumulation and lowered indices of insulin resistance. Obesogenic diets reduced hepatic levels of de novo lipogenesis proteins (SCD1 and FASN) but elevated the adipose levels of mRNA for the pro-inflammatory markers Mcp-1 and Tnfα. Lipidomic analysis of plasma indicated that MCSFA intake resulted in a different lipidomic signature than LCSFA intake, prevented elevation of pro-inflammatory ceramides, but elevated concentrations of some lipids associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk. Intake of the obesogenic diets in an SFA-type dependent manner elevated plasma concentrations of several phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids having the long chain PUFA (LCPUFA) arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), altered phospholipid ethers, and changed the triacylglyceryl environments of these LCPUFA. Our data indicate that (1) MCSFA reduce the severity of some obesogenic co-morbidities, (2) SFA-type modulates lipidomic signatures associated with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and (3) dietary SFA type impacts LCPUFA metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarachidonic acid 3acardiovascular diseases 3aceramides 3acoconut oil 3adiabetes 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adodecanoic acid 3aethers 3afatty liver 3ainsulin resistance 3alipogenesis 3alow fat diet 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aobesity 3aobesogenic diet 3apalmitic acid 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aproteins 3arisk 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aACC1 0aALA 0aARA 0aBHT 0aCER 0aCE 0aCVD 0aDAG 0aDNL 0aDTPA 0aDHA 0aDPA 0aEn 0aEAT 0aEPA 0aFASN 0aIL6 0aIS 0aLA 0aLCSFA 0aLCPUFA 0aLPC 0aMCSFA 0aMCP-1 0aMS 0aMUFA 0aMxSFA 0aNL 0aNLS 0aOA 0aPC 0aPCO 0aPE 0aPEO 0aPIS 0aPL 0aPUFA 0aPAI1 0aSCD-1 0aSFA 0aSM 0aTAG 0aTNFα 0aVLDL 0aMedium chain triglycerides 0aLipidomics 0aObesity 0aSteatosis 0aInsulin resistance 0aCeramides1 aBukowski, Michael1 aMehus, Aaron1 aJohnson, LuAnn1 aZeng, Huawei1 aRaatz, Susan1 aIdso, Joseph P.1 aPicklo, Matthew0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2019 Feb., v. 64 p.32-44dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2018.10.0053Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/61971123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Journal%20Article_2.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003000141245019100171520130100362592002801663650001701691650002001708650001401728650001701742650001201759650002401771650002301795650002701818650001101845650001101856650001301867650001201880650000901892650002101901650001001922650002401932650001301956650001401969650001501983650001001998700002502008700002502033700002002058700002102078700002502099700001902124773011902143856007502262852000902337655001202346IND60742442720221121101335.0210624e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074244272DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110615892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColonna, Maria Antonietta10aDietary Supplementation with Camelina sativa (L.

Twenty Ionica goats were randomly assigned to the following two groups (n = 10): the control received a traditional forage mixture (Avena sativa, 70%; Vicia sativa, 20%; Trifolium spp., 10%), while the experimental group was given Camelina sativa fresh forage (CAM). All of the dams grazed on pasture and received a commercial feed (500 g/head/day) at housing. The milk from the CAM group showed a higher (p < 0.05) content of dry matter, fat, lactose and concentrations of C6:0, C11:0, C14:0, C18:2 n-6, CLA and PUFA, while lower (p < 0.05) amounts of C12:0, C18:0 and saturated long chain FA (SLCFA). The Caciotta cheese from the CAM group showed a greater (p < 0.05) content of n-6 FA and n-6/n-3 ratio, although close to four, thus resulting adequate under the nutritional point of view. The overall liking, odour, taste, hardness, solubility and “goaty” flavour were better (p < 0.05) in the CAM cheeses. Further investigation would be advisable in order to evaluate the effect of feeding Camelina forage obtained from different phenological stages, and the application of ensiling techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aCamelina sativa 3aTrifolium 3aVicia sativa 3acheeses 3adietary supplements 3adry matter content 3afatty acid composition 3aflavor 3aforage 3ahardness 3alactose 3amilk 3amilk composition 3aodors 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apastures 3aphenology 3asolubility 3ataste1 aGiannico, Francesco 1 aTufarelli, Vincenzo 1 aLaudadio, Vito 1 aSelvaggi, Maria 1 aDe Mastro, Giuseppe 1 aTedone, Luigi 0 tAnimals.g2021 May 28, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110615893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024001200173040001800185100001400203245009300217300001400310506017300324520139100497592002801888650001001916650002201926650001601948650001101964650001801975650001801993650001202011650001102023650000902034650001602043650002102059653002602080653001902106653001802125653001602143773011502159856008602274856011402360956008402474961001302558852000902571655001202580IND60568664120221214223454.0190408e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056866412DNAL7 a3324682aris7 a10113/56866412hdl7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.05.0072doi8 ans13419  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJong, Lei10aReinforcement effect of soy protein nanoparticles in amine-modified natural rubber latex  ap. 53-62.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aMechanical properties of natural rubber reinforced with soy protein nanoparticles are useful for various rubber applications. However, the properties is further improved by improving interactions between soy protein and rubber. A novel method is used to modify particle surface of natural rubber latex by grafting with diallylamine. The improved polymer-filler interactions caused tensile stress at 300% elongation to match that of carbon black, which is a breakthrough for organic fillers. The grafting was demonstrated with infrared and particle size measurements. The size of natural rubber latex particles increased 8% after the grafting and the infrared spectra showed an increase of amine groups in coagulated NR latex. The curing rate of modified NR reinforced with soy protein matches that of carbon black composite. With the addition of 10% soy protein nanoparticles, the tensile strength of natural rubber and modified natural rubbers increased from 9 to 15MPa to 19–25MPa. Both dynamic mechanical strain and swelling measurements indicate modified natural rubber composites have a higher degree of polymer-filler interaction. The change of reinforcement factors with filler fraction can be described by modified Mooney model that includes anisotropic reinforcement elements. Tanδ at 60°C indicates the modified composite has a better rolling resistance than carbon black.  aPublisher supplied data 3alatex 3amechanical stress 3amethodology 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3arolling 3arubber 3asoot 3asoy protein 3atensile strength 0aMechanical properties 0aNatural rubber 0aRubber filler 0aSoy protein0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 105 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/56866413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/11106.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008000209300001600289506007600305520174300381592002802124506003702152650001402189650001302203650002002216650001402236650001602250650003102266650001002297650002002307650002402327650002602351650001402377650001902391650001802410650001602428650002202444650001802466650002002484650002702504653000702531653001202538653000902550653000802559653001002567653000902577653000902586653000802595653000702603653001102610653001502621653000702636653000802643653001002651653000802661653000702669653000702676653001102683653000702694653000802701653001802709653002802727653001402755653001402769653001602783653001302799653000902812653000902821700001702830700001602847700001302863700001902876700002002895700001802915700002102933700002002954773009402974856008303068852000903151655001203160IND60530150420221207095410.0180830e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053015042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.01.0362doi7 aPMC47676192pmcid7 a268123552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yao-zhong,10aRNA-sequencing study of peripheral blood monocytes in chronic periodontitis  ap. 152-160.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMonocytes are an important cell type in chronic periodontitis (CP) by interacting with oral bacteria and mediating host immune response. The aim of this study was to reveal new functional genes and pathways for CP at monocyte transcriptomic level.We performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) study of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) in 5 non-smoking moderate to severe CP (case) individuals vs. 5 controls. We took advantage of a microarray study of periodontitis to support our findings. We also performed pathway-based analysis on the identified differentially expressed (DEx) transcripts/isoforms using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery).Through differential expression analyses at both whole gene (or whole non-coding RNA) and isoform levels, we identified 380 DEx transcripts and 5955 DEx isoforms with a PPEE (posterior probability of equal expression) of <0.05. Pervasive up-regulation of transcripts at isoform level in CP vs. control individuals was observed, suggesting a more functionally active monocyte transcriptome for CP. By comparing with the microarray dataset, we identified several CP-associated novel genes (e.g., FACR and CUX1) that have functions to interact with invading microorganisms or enhance TNF production on lipopolysaccharide stimulation. DAVID analysis of both the RNA-seq and the microarray datasets leads to converging evidence supporting “endocytosis”, “cytokine production” and “apoptosis” as significant biological processes in CP.As the first RNA-seq study of PBMs for CP, this study provided novel findings at both gene (e.g., FCAR and CUX1) and biological process level. The findings will contribute to better understanding of CP disease mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aendocytosis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3alipopolysaccharides 3amicroarray technology 3amonocytes 3anon-coding RNA 3aperiodontitis 3aprobability 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atumor necrosis factors 0aCP 0aRNA-seq 0aPBMs 0aDEx 0aDAVID 0aPPEE 0aPPDE 0aDCs 0aTh 0aLSUHSC 0aLSUHSC SOD 0aAA 0aCAL 0aPBMCs 0aRIN 0aNB 0aGO 0aPostFC 0aRA 0aMHC 0aPeriodontitis 0aRNA sequencing analysis 0aMonocytes 0aApoptosis 0aEndocytosis 0aCytokine 0aFCAR 0aCUX11 aManey, Pooja1 aPuri, Jyoti1 aZhou, Yu1 aBaddoo, Melody1 aStrong, Michael1 aWang, Yu-Ping1 aFlemington, Erik1 aDeng, Hong-wen,0 tGene.g2016 May 01, v. 581, no. 2 p.152-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006900156300001800225500002000243520132800263592002801591650001301619650001101632650002201643650002501665650001601690650001301706773009901719856007301818852000901891655001201900IND60569999120221120043202.0170626e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056999912DNAL7 a10.1890/08-0071.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnape, Jonas10aEstimability of density dependence in models of time series data  ap. 2994-3000.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEstimation of density dependence from time series data on population abundance is hampered in the presence of observation or measurement errors. Fitting state–space models has been proposed as a solution that reduces the bias in estimates of density dependence caused by ignoring observation errors. While this is often true, I show that, for specific parameter values, there are identifiability issues in the linear state–space model when the strength of density dependence and the observation and process error variances are all unknown. Using simulation to explore properties of the estimators, I illustrate that, unless assumptions are imposed on the process or observation error variances, the variance of the estimator of density dependence varies critically with the strength of the density dependence. Under compensatory dynamics, the stronger the density dependence the more difficult it is to estimate in the presence of observation errors. The identifiability issues disappear when density dependence is estimated from the state–space model with the observation error variance known to the correct value. Direct estimates of observation variance in abundance censuses could therefore prove helpful in estimating density dependence but care needs to be taken to assess the uncertainty in variance estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acensuses 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3avariance0 tEcology.g2008 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.2994-3000dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0071.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245010000209300001600309506007600325520168800401592002802089506003702117650002202154650001202176650001702188650001102205650001602216650001302232650002002245650004402265650001102309650001302320650002502333650001302358650002102371650004302392650002802435650005202463650001102515650001202526650001102538650001302549700002702562700002202589700002702611700002902638700002602667700002202693700002502715773011902740856008102859852000902940655001202949IND60477908120221207141419.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047790812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-015-2615-92doi7 aPMC47036182pmcid7 a264674742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚliwka, Jadwiga10aMapping of quantitative trait loci for tuber starch and leaf sucrose contents in diploid potato  ap. 131-140.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE : Most QTL for leaf sucrose content map to positions that are similar to positions of QTL for tuber starch content in diploid potato. In the present study, using a diploid potato mapping population and Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, we identified twelve quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tuber starch content on seven potato chromosomes: I, II, III, VIII, X, XI, and XII. The most important QTL spanned a wide region of chromosome I (42.0–104.6 cM) with peaks at 63 and 84 cM which explained 17.6 and 19.2 % of the phenotypic variation, respectively. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is the key enzyme for starch biosynthesis. The gene encoding the large subunit of this enzyme, AGPaseS-a, was localized to chromosome I at 102.3 cM and accounted for 15.2 % of the variance in tuber starch content. A more than 100-fold higher expression of this gene was observed in RT-qPCR assay in plants with the marker allele AGPaseS-a₁₃₃₄. This study is the first to report QTL for sucrose content in potato leaves. QTL for sucrose content in leaves were located on eight potato chromosomes: I, II, III, V, VIII, IX, X and XII. In 5-week-old plants, only one QTL for leaf sucrose content was detected after 8 h of darkness; four QTL were detected after 8 h of illumination. In 11-week-old plants, 6 and 3 QTL were identified after dark and light phases, respectively. Of fourteen QTL for leaf sucrose content, eleven mapped to positions that were similar to QTL for tuber starch content. These results provide genetic information for further research examining the relationships between metabolic carbon molecule sources and sinks in potato plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalleles 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3agene expression 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3aleaves 3alighting 3aphenotypic variation 3apotatoes 3aprotein subunits 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative trait loci 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astarch 3asucrose 3atubers 3avariance1 aSołtys-Kalina, Dorota1 aSzajko, Katarzyna1 aWasilewicz-Flis, Iwona1 aStrzelczyk-Żyta, Danuta1 aZimnoch-Guzowska, Ewa1 aJakuczun, Henryka1 aMarczewski, Waldemar0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Jan., v. 129, no. 1 p.131-140dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-015-2615-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014600166300001200312520208300324592002802407650002702435650002402462650001302486650001002499650001602509650001702525650001602542650002502558650001702583650001402600650001902614650001102633650001502644650001102659650001402670650001602684650001202700650001502712650001002727700002102737700002202758700002702780700002502807773011302832856008102945852000903026655001203035IND60572353120221120232823.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057235312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-017-2404-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaterska, Maja10aChemical composition of horse-chestnut (Aesculus) leaves and their susceptibility to chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimić  ap. 105.  aFor over 20 years, trees of Aesculus spp. have been attacked by the larvae of Cameraria ohridella, which causes damage to the leaves. It has been observed that members of the genus Aesculus are characterized by diverse susceptibility to C. ohridella. Four specimens of the Aesculus genus which differ in susceptibility to this leaf miner—Aesculus turbinata (susceptible), Aesculus × neglecta (resistant) and two specimens of Aesculus hippocastanum (relatively susceptible and relatively resistant)—were examined. The levels of substances which may function as attractants (chloroplast pigments, anthocyanins), deterrents or repellents (flavonols, phenols), or a source of nutrients (free α-amino acids and carbohydrates) were determined in leaves of these four trees during two growing seasons. The results showed that the more pest-susceptible A. turbinata had, in both growing seasons, significantly higher levels of leaf carbohydrates and anthocyanins than the resistant Ae. × neglecta. Thus, anthocyanins and carbohydrates may be the traits which affect oviposition preference and favor the feeding of C. ohridella in the susceptible Ae. turbinata. The relatively susceptible specimen of Ae. hippocastanum contained slightly higher carbohydrate and anthocyanin levels than the relatively resistant one, but only in one growing season. Therefore, it does not explain the causes of their different susceptibility to the pest. The concentration of phenolics in the susceptible Ae. turbinata tree and the relatively susceptible Ae. hippocastanum individual was higher than in the resistant Ae. × neglecta and relatively resistant Ae. hippocastanum, respectively. This may suggest that leaf phenolic composition, but not overall concentration, is responsible for different susceptibility of examined trees of Aesculus spp. to the horse-chestnut leaf miner. The present results also demonstrate that the determined chemical compounds do not constitute a complete description of the biochemical relationships between C. ohridella and the examined horse-chestnut trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAesculus hippocastanum 3aCameraria ohridella 3aCastanea 3aacids 3aamino acids 3aanthocyanins 3aattractants 3achemical composition 3achloroplasts 3aflavonols 3agrowing season 3alarvae 3aleafminers 3aleaves 3anutrients 3aoviposition 3aphenols 3arepellents 3atrees1 aBandurska, Hanna1 aWysłouch, Joanna1 aMolińska-Glura, Marta1 aMoliński, Krzysztof0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2017 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.105-105dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-017-2404-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008200164300001600246506011700262506007600379520159100455592002802046506003702074650002202111650001602133650001602149650002402165650001502189650001802204650001702222650002302239650001902262650001102281650001402292650001102306650001402317650002102331650001502352653001802367653002202385653001302407700001402420700001702434700001102451700001602462773009302478856005102571852000902622655001202631IND60772525020221207073518.0220404s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077252502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jie12aA review on the ecotoxicological effect of sulphonamides on aquatic organisms  ap. 534-540.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntibiotics are extensively used to treat human and animal diseases and are especially used in animal production to promote the growth performance of livestock and aquatic animals. Sulphonamides, as important drugs for aquatic animals, are often used in aquaculture to prevent and treat diseases. However, various antibiotics found in the aquatic environment exhibit varying degrees of toxicity to aquatic organisms. Antibiotics in wastewater produced in industrial and agricultural processes are not thoroughly removed by sewage treatment and are released into water, which results in varying degrees of pollution of the surrounding water environment, forcing people to pay attention towards the ecosystem. Several studies have investigated the impact of antibiotics on aquatic organisms in water environment; however, only a few studies have investigated the underlying mechanism. Antibiotics persisting in an aquatic environment for a long time can cause genotoxicity and histopathological changes in various aquatic organisms. Therefore, this paper reviews the sources of antibiotics in aquatic environment, the pollution status of sulfonamides in aquatic environment at home and abroad, and focuses on the research status of ecotoxicological effects of sulfonamides on aquatic organisms. Because there are not only antibiotic pollution, but also many other pollutants, such as heavy metals, micro plastics and other chemicals, it will be a challenge to determine the combined effects of antibiotics or other pollutants on aquatic organisms in future environmental toxicity studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal production 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic environment 3aecosystems 3aecotoxicology 3agenotoxicity 3agrowth performance 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3alivestock 3apeople 3apollution 3asewage treatment 3awastewater 0aSulphonamides 0aAquatic organisms 0aToxicity1 aYun, Xiao1 aWang, Jiting1 aLi, Qi1 aWang, Yanli0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.534-540dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.03.034  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001800268520192400286592002802210650002402238650002302262650001102285650001902296650001302315650001102328650002802339650001702367650001702384650002102401650001602422650001902438650001202457653002102469653001502490653002102505653003302526653001802559653001302577700002302590700002102613773011602634856008602750852000902836655001202845IND60573051620221116144814.0180831e20170910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057305162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiltner, Martin10aReview on available biogas upgrading technologies and innovations towards advanced solutions  ap. 1329-1337.  aBiogas from anaerobic digestion of organic wastes or energy crops has proven to be a valuable alternative energy source both climate-neutral and sustainable on a global scale. The alternate valorization path of cleaning the biogas for the production of biomethane to be injected into the natural gas grid or to be used as a local vehicle fuel has gained significant importance in the last years. Considerable efforts in contemporary research are undertaken in order to improve efficiency and flexibility of biogas upgrading to enhance economic viability of biogas plants in times of expiring green-electricity feed-in tariffs, rising or strongly fluctuating costs for substrates and the currently low global energy prices. Current work tries to contribute to these questions suggesting and introducing innovative and highly effective technologies along the whole chain of biomethane production. A novel technique to separate high and fluctuating amounts of hydrogen sulphide from raw biogas is presented that relies on a highly intensified method of chemical-oxidative scrubbing. Single-stage separation efficiencies of 92% have been identified with this technology. A recently commissioned three-staged demonstration plant with an expected separation efficiency >99% is presented briefly. Furthermore, membrane-based gaspermeation is presented as a capable and economic method of CO2 removal and drying of raw biogas. While this technique is not new, authors try to demonstrate the huge potential for further development and exploitation peculiar to this method. Specific power demand for upgrading of 0.26 kWh/m³ biogas and specific upgrading costs of less than 0.15 €/m³ biomethane can be achieved. Today and in the future similar concepts and systems will be able to increase economic and ecologic performance of biogas plants thus contributing to strengthen biogas industry within the renewable energy sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy industry 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3acleaning 3adrying 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy costs 3aenergy crops 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anatural gas 3aorganic wastes 3atariffs 0aBiogas upgrading 0aBiomethane 0aDesulphurization 0aChemical-oxidative scrubbing 0aGaspermeation 0aMembrane1 aMakaruk, Alexander1 aHarasek, Michael0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 10, v. 161 p.1329-1337dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009200177300001400269520084300283592002801126650002201154650001601176650000901192650003301201653002501234653001501259653002101274653002501295653002601320653003301346700002001379700001701399700002901416700002201445700002801467773011501495856008601610852000901696655001201705IND60568664220221121141830.0190408e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056866422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoriz, Custódio Lobo10aModern extraction techniques optimized to extract betacyanins from Gomphrena globosa L.  ap. 29-40.  aGomphrena globosa L. is a source of betacyanins, molecules with high colorant power. In order to replace conventional extraction techniques, microwave (MAE) and ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) processes were optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM) to maximize the recovery of betacyanins from G. globosa. A five-level full factorial design of 24 combinations and 4 replicates was implemented for MAE and UAE. The optimum processing conditions for MAE (t=8min; T=60°C; Et=0%; and S/L=5g/L) conducted to an extraction yield of 39.6±1.8mg/g dry weight, while for UAE (t=22min; P=500%; Et=0%; and S/L=5g/L) a value of 46.9±4.8mg/g was achieved, validating the UAE more suitable to obtain the target compounds. This technique can provide extracts rich in betacyanins and with high potential to be used as natural colorants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGomphrena globosa 3abetacyanins 3adyes 3aresponse surface methodology 0aGomphrena globosa L. 0aBetacyanin 0aNatural colorant 0aMicrowave extraction 0aUltrasound extraction 0aResponse surface methodology1 aBarros, Lillian1 aPrieto, M.A.1 aBarreiro, Maria Filomena1 aMorales, Patricia1 aFerreira, Isabel C.F.R.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 105 p.29-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245010000157500002000257520159400277592002801871650001501899650001101914650001301925650001501938650001501953651001101968700002201979700001802001700002902019700003402048700003202082700001402114773012502128856007602253852000902329655001202338IND60792804220221123042908.0220909e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079280422DNAL7 a10.1029/2008JB0058302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ting10aSeismic structure beneath the Rivera subduction zone from finite‐frequency seismic tomography  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe subduction zone of western Mexico is a unique region on Earth where microplate capture and overriding plate disruption are occurring today. The young, small Rivera plate and the adjacent Cocos plate are subducting beneath the Jalisco block of Mexico. Here, we present a P wave tomographic model of the upper mantle to 400 km depth beneath the Jalisco block and surrounding regions using teleseismic P waves recorded by the Mapping the Rivera Subduction Zone (MARS) and Colima Volcano Deep Seismic Experiment (CODEX) seismic arrays. The inversion used 12,188 P wave residuals and finite‐frequency theory to backproject the 3‐D traveltime sensitivity kernels through the model. Below a depth of 150 km, the tomography model shows a clear gap between the Rivera and Cocos slabs that increases in size with depth. The gap between the plates lies beneath the northern part of the Colima graben and may be responsible for the location of Colima volcano. The images indicate that the deep Rivera plate is subducting more steeply than does the adjacent Cocos plate and also has a more northerly trajection. At a depth of about 100 km, both the Rivera and Cocos slabs have increased dips such that the slabs are deeper than 200 km beneath the Trans‐Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). It is also found that the Rivera plate is at roughly 140‐km depth beneath the young central Jalisco Volcanic lineament. Our images suggest that the Rivera plate and westernmost Cocos plate have recently rolled back toward the trench. This scenario may explain the unusual magmatic activity seen in the TMVB.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3asubduction 3atomography 3aMexico1 aGrand, Stephen P.1 aWilson, David1 aGuzman‐Speziale, Marco1 aGomez‐Gonzalez, Juan Martin1 aDominguez‐Reyes, Tonatiuh1 aNi, James0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2009 Jan., v. 114, no.

A stakeholder study  ap. 427-437.  aRapid urbanization poses a significant challenge of accommodating the poor, particularly in developing countries such as China where affordable housing has only been initiated a few years ago and will continue to be developed in the coming years. Two major considerations in affordable housing programs are cost and time, as the ability to meet the needs of low-income households is the main target of these programs. However, it is not a common strategy to address affordable housing shortage by means of incorporating sustainability features. One of critical issues is the lack of sustainability framework to integrate sustainability in affordable housing. This paper aims to identify the key sustainability performance indicators (KSPIs) which are useful to guide the development of affordable housing. A preliminary list of 42 key sustainability performance indicators of affordable housing was identified through an extensive literature review. This was followed by a questionnaire survey to solicit the professional views from three stakeholder groups, namely government, developers and academics in the Chinese construction industry. Via the fuzzy set theory and variance analysis, 24 KSPIs were finally highlighted. These findings provide useful references for policy makers as well as industry practitioners to develop affordable housing programs in a sustainable manner. This helps to achieve the sustainable development at the regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3aconstruction industry 3adeveloping countries 3aissues and policy 3alow income households 3amathematical theory 3aquestionnaires 3aresidential housing 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3avariance 3aChina 0aAffordable housing 0aSustainability 0aStakeholders 0aUrbanization 0aChina1 aZuo, Jian1 aWu, Peng1 aWang, Jun1 aChang, Ruidong1 aWen, Tao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 162 p.427-437dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245006400129300001800193520075900211592002800970650001400998650001601012650002001028650001101048650001301059650001601072650001101088650002101099650001401120650001001134653001801144653000701162653001501169653002501184700001901209773010701228852000901335655001201344IND60709834620221122223308.0200908e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070983462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangle, S.M.10aInduced mutational studies in M₁ generation of pigeon pea  ap. 1026-1031.  aEffect of EMS and SA and gamma rays on seeds of two pigeonpea varieties Amol (BDN-708) and Vaishali (BSMR- 853) was studied.

The scope of our study is bins used to collect food waste at individual households. - with mass treatment is often adopted as a viable solution for GHG reduction. The aim of this study is to explore attitudinal and situational predictors of support for residential curbside green bin programs. Using responses to 517 household surveys from the mid-sized Canadian cities of London, Ontario (proposed green bin program) and Kitchener-Waterloo (KW), Ontario (operating green bin program for 10+ years) comparison of means t-tests, correlations and linear regression are used to test five hypotheses derived from the food waste and waste diversion literatures that predict green bin support: situational factors, current food wasting, theory of planned behaviour attitudes, concern that green bin encourages food wasting, and concern that food waste ends up in the garbage regardless of green bin. There is some support for all five hypotheses. Residents in Kitchener-Waterloo were significantly more supportive (83%) than those in London (65%). While residents in both communities are supportive because of the perceived convenience and environmental benefits of the green bin, the number of regression model predictors is greater in London (16 compared to 9 for Kitchener-Waterloo). The findings overall suggest sustained municipal education at the implementation stage may lead to positive resident habituation to green bin and thus, durable public buy-in.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3afood waste 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabituation 3amunicipal solid waste 3apollution control 3aregression analysis 3at-test 3aterminology 3aOntario 0aGreen bin 0aCurbside 0aTPB 0aConvenience 0aComparative1 aBaxter, Jamie1 aWerf, Paul van der,1 aGilliland, Jason A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2909-21780 tWaste management.g2021 July 15, v. 131 p.258-267dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011300128300001800241520057700259592002800836650001000864650002000874650001800894650002300912650002800935650001300963650001500976650002300991650001401014650001801028650001501046650001101061650000901072653001501081653001801096653001801114653002301132653002301155700002201178773010701200852000901307655001201316IND60709834720221122223355.0200908e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070983472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadhuri, V.10aCompatibility of herbicides with fungicides against Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium udum  ap. 1032-1036.  aThe effect of herbicides along with fungicides was tested bypoisoned food technique against three soil borne pathogens i.e. Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium udum under in vitro conditions.

However, the effects of paddy rice cultivation history on vertical water flows and related soil properties have been rarely studied. The objectives were to identify the differences in soil physical properties and macropore parameters and to reveal the effects of these soil properties on vertical water flow patterns in paddy fields under different cultivation times. In this study, soil physical properties in a very young paddy field (2 y, VYPF), a young paddy field (18 y, YPF), and an old paddy field (>100 y, OPF) were analyzed. Meanwhile, macropore parameters (resolution of 0.6 mm) and vertical water flow patterns in these fields were identified by computed tomography and dye tracing experiment, respectively. As cultivation history lengthened in paddy rice, the average content of soil clay and organic carbon in the 80 cm depth soil profile increased, as did the thickness and bulk density of the plow pan. Also, macroporosity, macropore area density, macropore number density, node density, macropore angle, and hydraulic radius significantly decreased as length of cultivation age increased. As a result, differences in these soil propeties affected vertical water flow in three studied paddy fields. Steady-state infiltration rates decreased significantly in accordance with the reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil cores from the plow pan; median values were 9.76 cm d⁻¹, 2.93 cm d⁻¹, and 0.13 cm d⁻¹ for VYPF, YPF, and OPF, respectively. A greater abundance and distribution of a dye tracer and a higher stained area ratio under the plow pan in younger paddy fields indicated that more obvious preferential water flows occurred in VYPF and YPF than in OPF. This implied that the conversion of farmland from upland field to paddy field resulted in greater use of irrigation water and also posed a risk of groundwater pollution through increased percolation. Therefore, a longer puddling time before planting paddy rice should be conducted in paddy fields (i.e. YPF and VYPF) with a short cultivation history, which can reduce water percolation by enhancing bulk density, reducing macropores, and lowering the saturated water conductivity of the plow pan.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclay 3acomputed tomography 3acrop production 3adyes 3aenvironmental exposure 3agroundwater contamination 3ahighlands 3ainfiltration rate 3airrigation water 3amacropores 3aorganic carbon 3apaddies 3aplanting 3aplow pans 3aplows 3apuddling 3arice 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil profiles 3awater flow 0aPuddling 0aPlow pan 0aSoil physical properties 0aComputed tomography 0aInfiltration rate 0aDye tracer experiment 0aPaddy field1 aQiu, Weiwen1 aHu, Wei1 aZhang, Hailin1 aLiu, Muxing1 aZhang, Dongyou1 aWu, Tieniu1 aTian, Pei1 aJiang, Yan0 tSoil & tillage research.g2020 June, v. 200 p.104613-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.1046133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007100164300001600235520089100251592002801142650002401170650001701194650001501211650001601226650001801242650001301260650001301273650001201286653002301298653001801321773016301339856007401502852000901576655001201585IND60742133220221119211205.0210623e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074213322DNAL7 a10.2744/CCB-1469.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinneary, Joseph J.10aPerspectives on Salinity, Immunity, and the Common Snapping Turtle  ap. 144-148.  aA review of laboratory and field data, together with recent growth experiments, show that Chelydra serpentina, the common snapping turtle, is unable to hypoosmoregulate in salinities more concentrated than their internal osmotic concentration, about one third that of seawater (100% seawater is defined as 35 parts per thousand = 1000 milliosmoles). Circumstantial evidence suggests an understanding of the nascent stages of adaptation of freshwater vertebrates to high salinity habitats should include incidental immune system effects. Recent advances in the study of autoimmunity and ecoimmunology indicate the immune system of vertebrates plays an integrative role in maintaining homeostasis in the face of changing internal and external stimuli and may clarify why a small percentage of snapping turtle hatchlings can grow at relatively high salinities, at least up to 40% seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelydra serpentina 3aautoimmunity 3afreshwater 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune system 3asalinity 3aseawater 3aturtles 0anatural antibodies 0aecoimmunology0 tChelonian conservation and biology.g2021 June 7, v. 20, no. 1 p.144-148dChelonian Research Foundation and Turtle ConservancywJournal:19714x1943-39567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2744/CCB-1469.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245022900156300001800385520120700403592002801610650001101638650001801649650002301667650001801690650001101708650002201719650002101741650002201762650001101784650002401795650002101819650001001840700002001850773012701870856007401997852000902071655001202080IND60638341120221117222118.0190429e20160128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063834112DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay02497h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabaei, Ali10aSelective simultaneous determination of levodopa and acetaminophen in the presence of ascorbic acid using a novel TiO₂ hollow sphere/multi-walled carbon nanotube/poly-aspartic acid composite modified carbon paste electrode  ap. 1135-1144.  aA novel modified carbon paste electrode based on TiO₂ hollow spheres (TOHS), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and poly-aspartic acid (P-ASP) films (P-ASP/TOHS/MWCNT/CPE) was developed and used as a selective electrochemical sensor for simultaneous determination of levodopa (LD) and acetaminophen (ACT) in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA). The measurements were carried out by the application of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) methods. The prepared electrode presented rapid acceleration in electron transfer reactions of LD and ACT and showed no significant interference of AA as electro-active coexistent compounds with LD and ACT in biological systems. The DPV data showed that under optimal conditions, the obtained anodic peak currents were linearly dependent on the LD and ACT concentrations in the range of 0.4–450 and 0.1–300 μM, respectively. The fabricated sensor offered numerous advantages such as convenient preparation, good stability and high sensitivity towards LD and ACT determination. The applicability of the modified electrode was also demonstrated for simultaneous determination of LD and ACT in human urine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3aacetaminophen 3aanalytical methods 3aascorbic acid 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectron transfer 3ahumans 3asensors (equipment) 3atitanium dioxide 3aurine1 aSohrabi, Masoud0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 5 p.1135-1144dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay02497h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008300168300001600251520135400267592002801621650002101649650000901670650002101679650001001700650000801710650001901718650001501737650000701752650001501759650001901774650001501793650001001808650001301818650001701831650003401848653002401882653001701906653001501923653002501938700002101963700003101984700001702015773014302032856004802175852000902223655001202232IND50076519320221122002711.0140410e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007651932DNAL7 a10.1080/109429109031778222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifian, Salim10aQuality Assessment of Tiger Tooth Croaker (Otolithes ruber) During Ice Storage  ap. 309-318.  aQuality and shelf life of tiger tooth croaker (Otolithes ruber) during 19 days of iced storage were investigated in terms of sensory, chemical (total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric values (TBA), peroxide value (PV), free fatty acid (FFA), and pH) and microbiological (total viable count, TVC and total psychrotrophic count. TPC) aspects. Acceptability quality of Tiger tooth croaker determined by panelists was 15–17 days. Limiting factors for acceptability were eye, gills, peritoneum, smell of gills and abdominal cavity, internal organs and flesh. Bacterial loads in samples were higher than limiting level (3 × 10⁶ CFU g⁻¹) between 15–17 days of ice storage. Of the chemical indicators of spoilage, the initial value of pH was 6.71 and increased to 7.35 at the end of storage. TVB-N content was 15.31mg N/100g on day 0 and reached to 36.52 on day 19. The acceptability of tiger tooth croaker decreased as FFA, PV and TBA values increased (P < 0.05). The release of FFA increased from an initial value of 4.15 (expressed as % of oleic acid) to a final value of 12.75 during the storage period. The initial PV value was 11.69 meq/kg and it increased to 50.75 meq/kg on day 12 and then started to decrease to 35.82 meq/kg at the end of storage period.

Theory suggests that heritable epigenetic marks that increase fitness should increase in frequency in a population, and these changes may result in novel morphology, behaviour, or physiology, and ultimately reproductive isolation. Therefore, epigenetic variation might provide the first substrate for selection during the course of evolutionary divergence. This hypothesis predicts that populations in the earliest stages of divergence will differentiate in their methylome prior to any genetic differentiation. While several studies have investigated natural epigenetic variation, empirical studies that test predictions about its role in speciation are surprisingly scarce. Here, we investigate DNA methylation variation using an isoschizomeric digest method, Methyl‐Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism, across multiple stages of evolutionary divergence in natural populations of North American stream fishes. We show that epigenetic differentiation between methylomes is greater than genetic divergence among closely related populations across two river drainages. Additionally, we demonstrate that epigenetic divergence is a stronger predictor of the strength of behavioural reproductive isolation and suggest that changes in the methylome could influence the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Our findings suggest a role for epigenetics not only in the initiation of divergence, but also in the maintenance of species boundaries over greater evolutionary timescales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3adivergent evolution 3aepigenetics 3afish 3agenetic variation 3aphysiology 3aprediction 3areproductive isolation 3arivers1 aMartin, Michael D.1 aNguyen, Michael1 aMendelson, Tamra C.0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 25, no. 8 p.1883-1894dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.135613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008200164520140300246592002801649650001601677650001801693650001701711650001201728650001201740650002301752650001001775650002001785650001201805650002201817650001301839650001901852650001501871650001401886650001601900650001201916650001001928650001001938650002401948650001301972650003401985650000902019650002902028653001502057653002402072653001502096653000702111653000802118653000902126653000802135653000802143653000902151653000802160653001002168653000802178653000802186653000702194653001002201653000802211653000802219653000702227653000702234700001802241700001702259700001502276700001902291700001502310700001302325700005602338773011202394856008202506852000902588655001202597IND60674186420221118144050.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067418642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.1108942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Zonghao10aEffect of acrylamide on glucose homeostasis in female rats and its mechanisms  aAcrylamide (AA), a food contaminant, caused islet remodeling and increased hepatic glycogen content in male rats, but the effect of AA on glucose homeostasis in female rats remains unclear. In this study, female SD rats were orally treated with 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg·bw AA for 3 weeks. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose after oral administration of glucose, plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen were measured. The histology of the pancreas was observed, and the transcription of key genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in liver were determined. Compared with the control, exposure to 30 mg/kg·bw of AA significantly increased FBG level, reduced hepatic glycogen content and impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, damaged islets were observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg·bw AA-exposed groups. In addition, AA exposure significantly promoted gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (up-regulation of pc, g6p and gp) and decreased glycolysis (down-regulation of gck and pfk). Alternations in these processes may be associated with decreased plasma insulin levels and inhibited insulin-regulated IRS/PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 signaling transduction under AA exposure. Overall, our findings demonstrated that AA disrupted glucose homeostasis and elevated FBG level in female rats possibly by interfering with glucose metabolism and hampering the physiological effect of insulin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3ablood glucose 3ablood plasma 3afasting 3afemales 3afood contamination 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycogen 3aglycogenolysis 3aglycolysis 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3aliver 3amales 3aoral administration 3apancreas 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3arats 3atranscription (genetics) 0aAcrylamide 0aGlucose homeostasis 0aFemale rat 0aAA 0aFBG 0aOGTT 0aIRs 0aIRS 0aPI3K 0aAkt 0aFoxO1 0aGCK 0aPFK 0aPC 0aPEPCK 0aG6P 0aFBP 0aGS 0aGP1 aChen, Yanjuan1 aSong, Yujuan1 aZhang, Jie1 aYang, Xingdong1 aWang, Jian1 aLi, Lili1 aSun, Zhongke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9784-97690 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 Jan., v. 135 p.110894-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.1108943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147242045200170245010400622300001700726520182400743592002802567650001802595650001202613650001402625650001302639650003002652650002002682650002802702650001602730650001602746650001102762650002402773650001102797650000902808650001802817700002402835700002302859700001902882773010702901856008103008852000903089655001203098IND60575340420221120185210.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057534042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-017-1543-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Heather M.10aRevue: Preuves épidémiologiques de la contribution des eaux souterraines aux maladies entériques au niveau mondial entre 1948 et 2015 Revisión: Evidencia epidemiológica de la contribución del agua subterránea a la enfermedad entérica global, 1948–2015 回顾:地下水对全球肠道疾病的贡献流行冰雪证据 Revisão: Evidência epidemiologicada contribuição das águas subterrâneas para doença entérica global, 1948–201510aReview: Epidemiological evidence of groundwater contribution to global enteric disease, 1948–2015  ap. 981-1001.  aGlobally, approximately 2.2 billion people rely on groundwater for daily consumption. It is widely accepted that groundwater is more pristine than surface water but while this assumption is frequently the case, groundwater is not ubiquitously free of contaminants; accordingly, this presumption can result in an unfounded and potentially hazardous sense of security among owners, operators and users. The current paper presents a review of published literature providing epidemiological evidence of the contribution of groundwater to global human enteric infection. An emphasis is placed on enteric pathogens transmitted via the faecal-oral route, and specifically those associated with acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI). The review identified 649 published groundwater outbreaks globally between 1948 and 2013 and several epidemiological studies that show there is an increased risk of AGI associated with the consumption of untreated groundwater. The review identified that the following five pathogens were responsible for most outbreaks: norovirus, Campylobacter, Shigella, Hepatitis A and Giardia. Crudely, the authors estimate that between 35.2 and 59.4 million cases of AGI per year globally could be attributable to the consumption of groundwater. Although groundwater is frequently presumed to be a microbiologically safe source of water for consumption, this review demonstrates that consumers served by an untreated groundwater supply remain at risk to enteric disease. The authors conclude that collaboration between microbiologists, hydrogeologists and epidemiologists is needed to better understand pathogen occurrence, persistence, detection and transport in groundwater as well as build stronger epidemiological evidence documenting the true magnitude of disease associated with groundwater globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aGiardia 3aNorovirus 3aShigella 3adigestive system diseases 3aenteropathogens 3aepidemiological studies 3agroundwater 3ahepatitis A 3ahumans 3apathogen occurrence 3apeople 3arisk 3asurface water1 aPrioleau, Morgan D.1 aBorchardt, Mark A.1 aHynds, Paul D.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2017 June, v. 25, no. 4 p.981-1001dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-017-1543-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012300169300001600292520079700308592002801105650001801133650001701151650001301168650001101181650002101192650002301213650001401236650002201250650001501272650001001287650002301297650001201320651002101332653002501353653004101378653004601419700002701465773014301492856004801635852000901683655001201692IND50076519420221122002745.0140410e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007651942DNAL7 a10.1080/109429109031778302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendirci, Perihan10aInvestigation of Volatile Compounds and Characterization of Flavor Profiles of Fresh Pistachio Nuts (Pistacia vera L.)  ap. 319-330.  aVolatile compounds and flavor characteristics of Uzun, Kirmizi, Halebi, Siirt ve Ohadi varieties of fresh pistachio nuts cultivated in the Pistachionut Research Institute located in Gaziantep, Turkey were investigated by using Solid Phase Micro Extraction/Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (SPME/GC/MS) and sensory flavor profile analysis techniques.

Seven-day observation periods were centered on two full moons when ambient light was maximal and auxiliary lighting unnecessary. We recorded avocet density, habitat use, interbird distances, and behavior three times daily (beginning at 07:00, 15:00, 23:00 PST) for 14 days. We calculated the mean proportion of individuals within flocks engaged in four behavior classes (foraging, copulating, agonistic, other). Foraging birds were further subdivided by technique (pecking, dunking, scything). Avocets copulated with similar frequencies during the morning, afternoon, and night. Avocets were more aggressive and closely spaced at night than during day. The full repertoire of behaviors seen during daylight also occurred at night, though frequencies of particular behaviors, flock location, and interbird distances varied among morning, afternoon, and nighttime observations. The role of nocturnal reproductive behavior should be assessed in species generally perceived as being diurnal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3acopulation 3aflocks 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3alighting 3anocturnal activity 3apecking 3areproductive behavior 3awetlands 3aGreat Basin States 3aUnited States1 aBeckmann, Jon P.,1 aORING, LEWIS W.0 tWilson bulletin.g2003 June, v. 115, no. 2 p.176-185dWilson Ornithological Societyx0043-56437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676%2F03-0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008300166300001600249520074400265592002801009650001501037650001501052650001201067650001701079650001701096650002801113650001901141650001301160650001101173650000901184650001401193650001201207653001601219653001301235653000801248653002701256653000901283653001701292700002401309700001501333700001201348700001601360700001401376700001901390700001801409700001501427700001301442773009501455856008201550852000901632655001201641IND60091651820221121234048.0161021e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Mingsheng12aA Rat Basophilic Leukaemia cell sensor for the detection of pathogenic viruses  ap. 412-418.  aA Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cell sensor is developed for the detection and identification of pathogenic viruses. Recombinant sdAb-Fc antibodies were constructed by linking virus-specific single domain antibody to mouse IgE-Fc fragment. The sdAb-Fc can bind to FcεRI receptors on RBL cells and can be cross-linked by target viruses leading to cell activation and Ca2+ influx reflected by the increase of intracellular fluorescence. The responses of RBL cells to viruses in real time could be observed using fluorescence microscopy. 103 TCID50 of H5N1 viruses and 10 LD50 of rabies viruses could be detected in less than three minutes.

The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acomputer software 3afabrics 3afluid mechanics 3aindustry 3astatic pressure 3atextile fibers 3aviscosity 0aCFD simulation 0acoating process 0ano-slip condition 0aprocessing 0arheology1 aSchloßer, Uwe1 aSchollmeyer, E.q(Eckhard),0 tTextile research journal.g2009 May, v. 79, no. 7 p.579-584dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175080934403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04161naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245016800166300001800334520254000352592002802892650001202920650001002932650001602942650001002958650000902968650001202977650002002989650001303009650002703022650002103049650001203070650001403082650001203096650003303108650001203141650001203153650002803165650002003193650001003213650002503223653001903248653002003267653001403287653001203301700002303313700002403336700002103360700002103381773011703402856007903519852000903598655001203607IND60557968220221121201830.0180620e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055796822DNAL7 a10.1515/aoas-2016-00392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanczakowska, Ewa14aThe Effect of Supplementing Sodium Butyrate Containing Feed with Glutamine and/or Glucose on the Structure of the Piglet Digestive Tract and Selected Blood Indices  ap. 1127-1139.  aThe effect of supplementing the standard piglet diet containing sodium butyrate with glutamine and/or glucose on the structure of the piglet digestive tract and the small intestine epithelium, acidity and volatile fatty acid content of its digesta was investigated. The free amino acids level, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration in the blood were also analysed. The experiment was performed on 156 piglets (15 litters) allocated to 5 experimental groups, 3 litters in each. Group I (C, negative control) received a basal mixture with no supplement. Group II (SB, positive control) was fed the same basal diet containing additionally 3 g of sodium butyrate per kg. Group III and IV, besides sodium butyrate, received additionally 10 g of glutamine (GT) or glucose (GC), respectively. The last group V received all these supplements, i.e. SB+GT+GC (3, 10, 10 g per kg, respectively). At 60 days of age, the piglets (6 animals from each group) were slaughtered and their intestines were measured and weighed. The piglets in group SB+GT+GC receiving all the supplements grew slightly faster than the others, and at the end of the experiment the differences in body weight were significant. The total intestinal mass of the piglets fed with glucose or all the supplements was significantly higher than that of the piglets receiving glutamine but there was no significant difference in the total length of intestines. There was also no significant difference in acidity of chyme along the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract. Digesta in the jejunum of both control groups (C, SB) contained significantly more SCFA than the remaining groups. In the caecum their content in the negative control and the group fed with all supplements was significantly higher when compared to the butyrate and glucose group. In the duodenum villus height was similar in all the groups but in the jejunum it was significantly higher in the group receiving all supplements than in other groups. Free amino acids level was lowest in the piglets receiving glucose but there was no difference between the remaining groups. The lowest level of IGF-1 was found in the same group and this difference was significant when compared with remaining groups, except C. It is concluded that glutamine and glucose, when given together with sodium butyrate, improve the structure of piglet jejunum epithelium and average body weight gains. A supplement of glucose significantly lowers free amino acid content and IGF-1 level in piglet blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3ablood 3abody weight 3acecum 3adiet 3adigesta 3adigestive tract 3aduodenum 3afatty acid composition 3afree amino acids 3aglucose 3aglutamine 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ajejunum 3apiglets 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asodium butyrate 3avilli 3avolatile fatty acids 0apiglet feeding 0asodium butyrate 0aglutamine 0aglucose1 aNiwińska, Barbara1 aGrela, Eugeniusz R.1 aWęglarzy, Karol1 aOkoń, Krzysztof0 tAnnals of animal science.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 16, no. 4 p.1127-1139dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aoas-2016-00393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014800164300001800312500001500330520110500345592002801450650002601478650002001504650002001524650002401544650002601568650001801594650001701612650002501629650002001654650001501674650001001689650002201699650002301721650002101744653002001765700001601785700001301801700001201814773013901826856008101965852000902046655001202055IND60555583020221120235914.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055558302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-016-1817-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuangfu, Jie10aOverexpressing target helper genes enhances secretion and glycosylation of recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris under simulated microgravity  ap. 1429-1439.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, the potential helper genes were identified through the data analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in recombinant Pichia pastoris cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG). Co-expressing of four genes PRX1, YAP1, AHA1, and YPT6, involved in the oxidative stress response and protein folding, exhibited promising helper factor effects on the recombinant protein yields in engineered P. pastoris, respectively. When two of the above genes were co-expressed simultaneously, β-glucuronidase (PGUS) specific activity was further increased by 30.3–50.6 % comparing with that of single helper gene, particularly when the oxidative stress response and protein folding genes were both present in the combinations. In addition, co-expressing co-chaperone AHA1 and transcription factor YAP1 not only enhanced PGUS secretion, but also affected its glycosylation. Thus, through deep “omics” analysis of SMG effects, our results provided combined impact of new helper factors to improve the efficacy of recombinant protein secretion and glycosylation in engineered P. pastoris.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3aprotein folding 3agene overexpression 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aglycosylation 3amicrogravity 3arecombinant proteins 3astress response 3aproteomics 3agenes 3aprotein secretion 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aoxidative stress 0aPichia pastoris1 aXu, Yinghua1 aLi, Chun1 aLi, Jun0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 43, no. 10 p.1429-1439dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-016-1817-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015600170300001800326520142200344592002801766650002201794650000801816650002901824650002701853650002601880650001801906650002201924650002001946650002001966650003201986650001402018650001402032650002202046650001502068650001202083650001802095650001402113650001002127650001102137653002202148653002402170653004402194700001802238700001802256700002502274700001902299700002202318700002102340700001602361700002002377773013702397856008702534852000902621655001202630IND60676126720221120222526.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067612672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagucci, Sara10aEffect of an additional N-terminal methionyl residue on enzymatic and antifungal activities of Ageritin purified from Agrocybe aegerita fruiting bodies  ap. 1226-1235.  aAgeritin, a specific ribonuclease, damaging the largest rRNA in the highly conserved α-sarcin/ricin stem-loop (SRL) has been well characterized from edible mushroom Agrocybe aegerita. Given its peculiar characteristic, Ageritin is the prototype of a new ribotoxins family expressed in basidiomycetes.In this framework, we report the characterization of Met-Ageritin, an isoform of Ageritin with an additional N-terminal methionyl residue. This difference affects the enzymatic features of this toxin despite is able to release α-fragment when acting on yeast, rabbit or Trichoderma asperellum ribosomes. Met-Ageritin inhibits protein synthesis in vitro with an IC₅₀ = 2.8 nM that is 21-fold lower than that of Ageritin, while not show endonuclease activity on DNA. Subsequently, we explored the antifungal activity of both isoforms against T. asperellum, pathogen for A. aegerita and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, used as eukaryotic model microorganism. The presence of an additional N-terminal methionyl residue in Met-Ageritin abolishes antifungal activity towards T. asperellum, while neither of two isoforms is able to inhibit the growth of S. cerevisiae. Overall, these data highlight the importance of the N-terminal region of this toxin that likely alters the conformational state of this enzyme considering the presence in this region of metal binding sites necessary for explicate enzymatic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrocybe aegerita 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTrichoderma asperellum 3aantifungal properties 3abinding sites 3aendoribonucleases 3aenzyme activity 3afruiting bodies 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amushrooms 3apathogens 3aprotein synthesis 3aprototypes 3arabbits 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 3aricin 3ayeasts 0aAgrocybe aegerita 0aAntifungal activity 0aAdditional N-terminal methionyl residue1 aLandi, Nicola1 aRusso, Rosita1 aValletta, Mariangela1 aCitores, Lucia1 aIglesias, Rosario1 aPedone, Paolo V.1 aPizzo, Elio1 aDi Maro, Antimo0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 15, v. 155 p.1226-1235dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.11.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010700167300001800274520105100292592002801343596012101371596009901492650002301591650001801614650001701632650002001649650001201669650001901681650002801700650001801728650001001746650001901756650002701775650001801802650001901820650001101839653002901850653004401879653001001923653001601933653001101949700002001960700006001980700002002040700001902060700005802079773012202137856008002259852000902339655001202348IND60655007720221119053322.0190729e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065500772DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175187943462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Sŭng-ho,10aPreparation of hydrophobic fabric using cross-linked fluorinated poly methacryalte copolymer nanobeads  ap. 2057-2066.  aIn this study, we synthesized cross-linked poly methyl methacrylate beads and cross-linked fluorinated poly methacryalte copolymer (F-cPMMA) beads by the dispersion polymerization method with methyl methacrylate monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and 2,2,2-trifuloroethyl methacrylate.

Roadside habitats often exhibit altered soil and plant chemistry due to pollution from maintenance (e.g. de-icing salt), car deterioration, and exhaust. Roadside plants may attract animals due to elevated levels of sodium or nitrogen, but high concentrations of heavy metals and sodium can be toxic, potentially setting an ecological trap. In this study, we determine how roads influence the chemistry of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) as it is the primary roadside host plant for the declining monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) in the eastern United States. Even though road salt is applied during the winter, we detect enhanced sodium along roads the following growing season. Road salts increase soil sodium, which in turn elevates host-plant foliar sodium (occasionally to toxic levels in <10% of plants) and sodium content in monarch caterpillars feeding on these plants. Sodium levels of milkweed leaves are highest close to the edge of busy roads. Some heavy metals (lead, zinc) are also elevated in roadside soils or plants. Nitrogen content was affected by adjacent agricultural use, but not traffic volume or proximity to a road. Other potential road pollutants (e.g. nickel) were not elevated in soil or plants. Despite a clear signature of road pollution in the chemistry of milkweed, most plants are likely still suitable for developing monarchs. Nonetheless, restoration investments in snowy regions should prioritize sites with lower-traffic density that are further from the road edge to minimize toxic impacts of high sodium. To extend this research to other insects of conservation concern, future work should characterize the nutritional quality of nectar, pollen, and other species of host-plants in roadside habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsclepias syriaca 3aDanaus plexippus 3aanimals 3aecological traps 3agrowing season 3aheavy metals 3ahost plants 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3alead 3aleaves 3anectar 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutritive value 3aplant biochemistry 3apollen 3apollutants 3apollution 3aroads 3aroadside plants 3aroadside soils 3aroadsides 3asalts 3asodium 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3awinter 3azinc 3aEastern United States 0aEcological trap 0aHerbivory 0aPollinators 0aRight-of-way 0aVerge1 aAgnew, Lauren1 aMeyer, Rebecca1 aSikkink, Kristin L.1 aOberhauser, Karen S.1 aBorer, Elizabeth T.1 aSnell-Rood, Emilie C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 01, v. 724 p.138045-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1380453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010900164300001600273500001500289520164600304592002801950650001301978650001601991650001102007650001102018650002602029650001102055650001402066650002802080650001102108650000902119650001302128650003402141650001302175653001002188700001702198700001202215700001702227700001802244700001502262773010502277856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60537261020221121171606.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053726102DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-016-0393-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Meihong10aGenomics and expression analysis of DHHC-cysteine-rich domain S-acyl transferase protein family in apple  ap. 671-684.  a2019-12-06  aS-acylation is one of a group of lipid modifications that occurs on eukaryotic proteins, mediated by DHHC-CRD-containing proteins, which plays an important role in regulating the membrane association, trafficking and function of target proteins. Although genome-wide identification of PAT family has been carried out in yeast, mice, humans and Arabidopsis, little is known about apple PAT genes. In this study, a total of 33 putative apple PAT proteins, containing DHHC-CRD by domain analysis, have been identified, and were classified into three groups according to the phylogenetic analysis of PAT proteins in apple and Arabidopsis. More complex TMDs in the most MdPATs revealed the PM location of the gene family. Gene structure, gene chromosomal location and paralogs analysis of MdPAT genes within the apple genome demonstrated that tandem and segmental duplications, as well as whole genome duplications, have likely contributed to the expansion and evolution of the PAT gene family in apple. According to the microarray and expressed sequence tag (ESTs) analysis, the different expression patterns indicate that they may play different roles during fruit development and rootstock-scion interactions process. Moreover, PATs were performed expression profile analyses in different tissues, indicating that the PATs are involved in various aspects of physiological and developmental processes of apple. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a genome-wide analysis of the apple PAT gene family, and this genomic analysis of apple DHHC-CRD PAT genes provides the first step towards a functional study of this gene family in apple.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3aArabidopsis 3aapples 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3ayeasts 3aphylogeny 3aexpressed sequence tags 3alipids 3amice 3agenomics 3arootstock-scion relationships 3afruiting 0agenes1 aZhao, Xiuyan1 aXu, Nan1 aLuo, Xiaocui1 aZhang, Yuemin1 aXu, Ruirui0 tGenes & genomics.g2016 Aug., v. 38, no. 8 p.671-684dThe Genetics Society of Koreax1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-016-0393-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245010900203300001800312520119300330592002801523596008301551650001501634650001501649650002401664650000801688650001301696650001201709650001401721650001201735650002101747650001001768650001701778650001701795650001301812650001901825653001301844653001301857653002101870653001301891653002301904700001701927700002401944773012201968856008002090852000902170655001202179IND60655007820221119053201.0190729e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065500782DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175187973322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuvari, Fatih1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5708-799310aInfluence of sea polymer removal on sound absorption behavior of islands-in-the-sea spunbonded nonwovens  ap. 2444-2455.  aThis work presents the results of efforts focused on the development of relatively lightweight and fibrous acoustic webs. For this objective, nonwoven webs that contain bicomponent filaments with islands-in-the-sea cross sections were produced by spunbonding, which involves the extrusion of sea and island polymer melts through dies, cooling and attenuating the bicomponent filaments by high-velocity air streams. Nylon 6 and polyethylene were used as the island and sea polymers, respectively. Webs were hydroentangled with high-pressure water jets prior to the dissolving process to obtain fiber entanglement. Sea polymer was removed from the spunbonded nonwovens by using a reflux dissolution setup. Weight, thickness, air permeability, pore size and sound absorption coefficients of the nonwoven samples were measured before and after the sea polymer removal. Results demonstrated that sea polymer removal led to further bicomponent filament fibrillation, which affected sound absorption positively. The structure with the higher number of island fibers had better acoustical properties. Lightweight and fibrous acoustic nonwovens can be obtained with the method given in this study.  aPublisher supplied data  a215M340cThe Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aacoustic properties 3aair 3aair flow 3acooling 3aextrusion 3amelting 3anonwoven fabrics 3anylon 3apermeability 3apolyethylene 3aporosity 3atextile fibers 0anonwoven 0aspunbond 0asound absorption 0aacoustic 0aislands-in-the-sea1 aUlcay, Yusuf1 aPourdeyhimi, Behnam0 tTextile research journal.g2019 June, v. 89, no. 12 p.2444-2455dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175187973323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011300153300001800266520128500284592002801569650001701597650003801614650001301652650000901665650001201674650001801686650001701704650001901721653002501740653001501765653002301780653002701803700001401830700001801844700001901862700001801881700001801899700001201917700002601929700001801955773012701973856007302100852000902173655001202182IND60527455320170818000000.0160715e20130626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052745532DNAL7 a10.1021/am400769j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jun10aTriple Shape Memory Effects of Cross-Linked Polyethylene/Polypropylene Blends with Cocontinuous Architecture  ap. 5550-5556.  aIn this paper, the triple shape memory effects (SMEs) observed in chemically cross-linked polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) blends with cocontinuous architecture are systematically investigated. The cocontinuous window of typical immiscible PE/PP blends is the volume fraction of PE (vᴾᴱ) of ca. 30–70 vol %. This architecture can be stabilized by chemical cross-linking. Different initiators, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-hexane (DHBP), dicumylperoxide (DCP) coupled with divinylbenzene (DVB) (DCP–DVB), and their mixture (DHBP/DCP–DVB), are used for the cross-linking. According to the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and gel fraction calculations, DHBP produces the best cross-linking and DCP–DVB the worst, and the mixture, DHBP/DCP–DVB, is in between. The chemical cross-linking causes lower melting temperature (Tₘ) and smaller melting enthalpy (ΔHₘ). The prepared triple shape memory polymers (SMPs) by cocontinuous immiscible PE/PP blends with vᴾᴱ of 50 vol % show pronounced triple SMEs in the dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and visual observation. This new strategy of chemically cross-linked immiscible blends with cocontinuous architecture can be used to design and prepare new SMPs with triple SMEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3agels 3amelting 3amelting point 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 0ashape memory polymer 0apolyolefin 0amultiple actuation 0achemical cross-linking1 aChen, Min1 aWang, Xiaoyan1 aZhao, Xiaodong1 aWang, Zhenwen1 aDang, Zhi-Min1 aMa, Lan1 aHu, G.-H.q(Guo-Hua),1 aChen, Fenghua0 tACS applied materials .g2013 June 26, v. 5, no. 12 p.5550-5556dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am400769j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014800156300002000304520143200324592002801756650001301784650002201797650001301819650001901832650002501851650001701876650001601893650001401909650001301923650001601936650001201952650001101964650003401975650001902009700001702028700001702045700001602062700001502078700001602093700001702109700001902126773013602145856007502281852000902356655001202365IND60537635020221120131508.0160809e20131226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053763502DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402903m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Zhixin10aExperimental and Modeling Study on Phase Equilibria of Semiclathrate Hydrates of Tetra-n-butyl Ammonium Bromide + CH4, CO2, N2, or Gas Mixtures  ap. 18440-18446.  aTetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) is most-widely used as a hydrate promoter in the separation of flue gases and CO₂ sequestration. Because of the complicacy of semiclathrate hydrate formed by TBAB aqueous solution and gases, few researchers have investigated the thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria of semiclathrate hydrates. In this work, the CH₄–N₂ hydrate dissociation conditions were determined in TBAB solution first, and then a thermodynamic model for gas hydrate proposed by Chen and Guo was extended for semiclathrate hydrates of gas mixtures in TBAB aqueous solution. The Patel-Teja equation of state (PT EoS) was used for calculation of the fugacity of the gas phase. To evaluate the activity of water and activity coefficients of TBAB in TBAB aqueous solution, a correlation on the basis of existing osmotic coefficient and activity coefficient values is employed. For modeling the hydrate phase, parameters for sII hydrates proposed in the Chen–Guo hydrate model were used to calculate the fugacity of gases in hydrate phase, and parameters of TBAB were obtained from the correlation with the literature dissociation data for the pure gas + TBAB + water system. Then the presented model was used to predict dissociation data for the gas mixtures + TBAB + water system, and the results show acceptable agreement with other literature data and the experimental data for CH₄–N₂ in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aaqueous solutions 3abromides 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adissociation 3aengineering 3aequations 3aflue gas 3agas hydrate 3amethane 3amodels 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3athermodynamics1 aGuo, Xuqiang1 aZhao, Yanyan1 aWang, Yiwei1 aSun, Qiang1 aLiu, Aixian1 aSun, Changyu1 aChen, Guangjin0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Dec. 26, v. 52, no. 51 p.18440-18446dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie402903m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001800285520131500303592002801618650002301646650001001669650002801679650001801707650001601725650000901741650001401750650001401764650001101778700003701789700002501826700002801851700003001879700001901909773013901928856008102067852000902148655001202157IND60555583220221120235943.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055558322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-016-1828-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAb Kadir, Safuan10aEvaluation of commercial soy sauce koji strains of Aspergillus oryzae for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production  ap. 1387-1395.  aIn this study, four selected commercial strains of Aspergillus oryzae were collected from soy sauce koji. These A. oryzae strains designated as NSK, NSZ, NSJ and NST shared similar morphological characteristics with the reference strain (A. oryzae FRR 1675) which confirmed them as A. oryzae species. They were further evaluated for their ability to produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by cultivating the spore suspension in a broth medium containing 0.4 % (w/v) of glutamic acid as a substrate for GABA production. The results showed that these strains were capable of producing GABA; however, the concentrations differed significantly (P < 0.05) among themselves. Based on the A. oryzae strains, highest GABA concentration was obtained from NSK (194 mg/L) followed by NSZ (63 mg/L), NSJ (51.53 mg/L) and NST (31.66 mg/L). Therefore, A. oryzae NSK was characterized and the sequence was found to be similar to A. oryzae and A. flavus with 99 % similarity. The evolutionary distance (K ₙᵤc) between sequences of identical fungal species was calculated and a phylogenetic tree prepared from the K ₙᵤc data showed that the isolate belonged to the A. oryzae species. This finding may allow the development of GABA-rich ingredients using A. oryzae NSK as a starter culture for soy sauce production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3afungi 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aglutamic acid 3aingredients 3akoji 3aphylogeny 3asoy sauce 3aspores1 aWan-Mohtar, Wan Abd Al Qadr Imad1 aMohammad, Rosfarizan1 aAbdul Halim Lim, Sarina1 aSabo Mohammed, Abdulkarim1 aSaari, Nazamid0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 43, no. 10 p.1387-1395dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-016-1828-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014700165300001800312500001500330520180900345592002802154650001602182650002002198650002902218650002002247650001402267650002002281650001002301650002002311650001402331650001002345650000902355650002602364650001202390650001102402650002002413650001202433650001102445653001002456700002002466700002202486700002602508700001902534700002002553773011202573856007302685852000902758655001202767IND60519322820221119105338.0160426e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051932282DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.134832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubenstein, Dustin R.10aSex‐specific fitness effects of unpredictable early life conditions are associated with DNA methylation in the avian glucocorticoid receptor  ap. 1714-1728.  a2019-12-06  aOrganisms can adapt to variable environments by using environmental cues to modulate developmental gene expression. In principle, maternal influences can adaptively adjust offspring phenotype when early life and adult environments match, but they may be maladaptive when future environments are not predictable. One of the best‐studied ‘maternal effects’ is through modification of the offspring's hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine system that controls responses to stress. In addition to the direct transfer of glucocorticoids from mother to offspring, offspring HPA function and other phenotypes can also be affected by epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor promoter. Here we examine how among‐year variation in rainfall is related to DNA methylation during development and fitness in adulthood in the superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), which lives in a climatically unpredictable environment where early life and adult environments are unlikely to match. We found that DNA methylation in the putative promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor gene is reduced in chicks – particularly in males – born following drier prebreeding periods. Additionally, DNA methylation is lower in males that become breeders than those that never breed. However, there is no relationship in females between DNA methylation and the likelihood of dispersing from the natal group to breed elsewhere. These results suggest that early life conditions may positively affect fitness in a sex‐specific manner through chemical modification of an HPA‐associated gene. This study is the first to show that epigenetic modifications during early life may influence the fitness of free‐living organisms adapted to unpredictable environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepigenetics 3amaternal effect 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3aDNA methylation 3aphenotype 3astress response 3amales 3agene expression 3aadulthood 3agenes 3arain 3aneurosecretory system 3aprogeny 3achicks 3aglucocorticoids 3afemales 3aadults 0abirds1 aSkolnik, Hannah1 aBerrio, Alejandro1 aChampagne, Frances A.1 aPhelps, Steven1 aSolomon, Joseph0 tMolecular ecology.g2016 Apr., v. 25, no. 8 p.1714-1728dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.134833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147242065000167245011200817300001800929520156100947592002802508650001302536650001202549650001102561650001402572650002402586650001602610650003002626650002702656650001502683650001502698650001902713650001402732650000902746650001902755650001002774651001202784700002102796700002002817700001702837700001702854700002302871700002802894773010802922856008103030852000903111655001203120IND60575340920221121044650.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057534092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-016-1527-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuroda, Keisuke10aDes sédiments estuariens Holocènes en tant que source d’arsenic dans les eaux souterraines du Pléistocène dans la banlieue de Hanoi, Vietnam Los sedimentos estuáricos del Holoceno como una fuente de arsénico en el agua subterránea del Pleistoceno en los suburbios de Hanoi, Vietnam 全新世河口沉积物成为越南河内郊区更新世地下水中的砷来源 Sedimentos estuarinos do Holoceno como fonte de arsênio em águas subterrâneas do Pleistoceno nos subúrbios de Hanói, Vietnam Trầm tích cửa sông Holocene là một nguồn asen trong nước ngầm Pleistocene tại khu vực ngoại thành Hà Nội, Việt Nam10aHolocene estuarine sediments as a source of arsenic in Pleistocene groundwater in suburbs of Hanoi, Vietnam  ap. 1137-1152.  aGroundwater pollution by arsenic is a major health threat in suburban areas of Hanoi, Vietnam. The present study evaluates the effect of the sedimentary environments of the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits, and the recharge systems, on the groundwater arsenic pollution in Hanoi suburbs distant from the Red River. At two study sites (Linh Dam and Tai Mo communes), undisturbed soil cores identified a Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA) and Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) as major aquifers, and Holocene estuarine and deltaic sediments as an aquitard layer between the two aquifers. The Holocene estuarine sediments (approximately 25–40 m depth, 9.6–4.8 cal ka BP) contained notably high concentrations of arsenic and organic matter, both likely to have been accumulated by mangroves during the Holocene sea-level highstand. The pore waters in these particular sediments exhibited elevated levels of arsenic and dissolved organic carbon. Arsenic in groundwater was higher in the PCA (25–94 μg/L) than in the HUA (5.2–42 μg/L), in both the monitoring wells and neighboring household tubewells. Elevated arsenic concentration in the PCA groundwater was likely due to vertical infiltration through the arsenic-rich and organic-matter-rich overlying Holocene estuarine sediments, caused by massive groundwater abstraction from the PCA. Countermeasures to prevent arsenic pollution of the PCA groundwater may include seeking alternative water resources, reducing water consumption, and/or appropriate choice of aquifers for groundwater supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater extraction 3amolybdenum 3amonitoring 3aorganic matter 3asea level 3asoil 3asuburban areas 3awells 3aVietnam1 aHayashi, Takeshi1 aFunabiki, Ayako1 aDo, An Thuan1 aCanh, Vu Duc1 aNga, Tran Thi Viet1 aTakizawa, Sq(Satoshi),0 tHydrogeology journal.g2017 June, v. 25, no. 4 p.1137-1152dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-016-1527-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245012600160300001600286500002000302520169000322592002802012650002302040650001202063650002102075650000902096650001802105650001802123650002702141650001902168650001302187650002502200650001902225650001602244650001302260650001602273650001802289650001702307650001102324650001502335650001102350650001202361650001602373650001002389650000902399651001102408700004102419700002502460700003202485700003002517700003602547700002002583700002802603700002802631700002802659700002102687700001702708700002702725773012902752856007202881852000902953655001202962IND60648200520221122053326.0190627e20150402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064820052DNAL7 a10.3390/f60409732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulito, Ana Paula10aAvailable Nitrogen and Responses to Nitrogen Fertilizer in Brazilian Eucalypt Plantations on Soils of Contrasting Texture  ap. 973-991.  aJournal Article  aEucalyptus plantations have seldom responded to N fertilization in tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil. This implies that rates of N mineralization have been adequate to supply tree needs. However, subsequent crop rotations with low N fertilization may result in declining concentrations of organic and potentially mineralizable N (N₀), and consequent loss of wood productivity. This study investigated (a) in situ N mineralization and N₀ in soils of eucalypt plantations in São Paulo state, Brazil; (b) tree growth responses to N fertilizer applied 6–18 months after planting; and (c) the relationships between N₀, other soil attributes and tree growth. We established eleven N fertilizer trials (maximum 240 kg ha−1 of N) in E. grandis and E. grandis x urophylla plantations. The soil types at most sites were Oxisols and Quartzipsamments, with a range of organic matter (18 to 55 g kg−1) and clay contents (8% to 67%) in the 0–20 cm layer. Concentrations of N₀ were measured using anaerobic incubation on soil samples collected every three months (different seasons). The samples collected in spring and summer had N₀ 140–400 kg ha−1 (10%–19% total soil N), which were best correlated with soil texture and organic matter content. Rates of in situ net N mineralization (0–20 cm) ranged from 100 to 200 kg ha−1 year−1 and were not correlated with clay, total N, or N₀. These high N mineralization rates resulted in a low response to N fertilizer application during the early ages of stand growth, which were highest on sandy soils. At the end of the crop rotation, the response to N fertilizer was negligible and non-significant at all sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aOxisols 3aQuartzipsamments 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3acrop rotation 3afertilizer application 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic matter 3aplantations 3aplanting 3asandy soils 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3aspring 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atexture 3atree growth 3atrees 3awood 3aBrazil1 aLeonardo de Moraes Gonçalves, José1 aSmethurst, Philip J.1 aJunior, José Carlos Arthur1 aAlvares, Clayton Alcarde,1 aHenrique Tertulino Rocha, José1 aHübner, Ayeska1 aFabiano de Moraes, Luiz1 aMiranda, Aline Cristina1 aKamogawa, Marcos Yassuo1 aGava, José Luiz1 aChaves, Raul1 aSilva, Claudio Roberto0 tForests.g2015 Apr. 02, v. 6, no. 4 p.973-991dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f60409733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011300170300001800283520111400301592002801415650004401443650001301487650002201500650002001522650002601542650002501568650001401593650001601607650001301623650002601636650001301662650001801675650003201693650001001725650001301735650001401748650004301762650001301805650002001818650000901838650003301847650001501880650001901895653003101914653002601945653003501971700002302006700002902029700002502058700002402083700002402107773013702131856008702268852000902355655001202364IND60676127020221120110436.0220328e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067612702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArun, Ganesan10aSynergistic effect of novel chitosan combined metformin drug on streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus rat  ap. 1335-1349.  aMetformin is widely used as a frontline medicine of type-II diabetes.

The chitosan was combined with metformin by sonication and confirmed through XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis. The enhanced activity was observed in 100 mg/kg metformin combined with CSN500mg/kg. The level of serum bilirubin, total protein, SGH, liver glycogen, Glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6- phosphatase values were significantly similar to metformin 300 mg/kg treated group. With this beneficiary, the novel chitosan was recommended to administrate with metformin to improve the drug efficacy and reduction of overdose lethal effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHydrozoa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadverse effects 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidant activity 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3achitosan 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3aglycogen 3ahigh fat diet 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliver 3amedicine 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoverdose 3aprotein content 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asonication 3astreptozotocin 0aFTIR and SEM of T. ramosus 0aDrug biocompatibility 0aCarbohydrate metabolic enzymes1 aRajaram, Rajendran1 aKaleshkumar, Karunanidhi1 aGayathri, Nambirajan1 aSivasudha, Thilagar1 aKandasamy, Singaram0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 June 15, v. 153 p.1335-1349dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010100163300001800264520180400282592002802086650001802114650002102132650001802153650001202171650001102183650001402194650001802208650000902226650001702235650000902252650001302261650003102274650002002305650001402325653001302339653001002352653001702362653002002379653001702399700002302416700002402439773011702463856007902580852000902659655001202668IND60557968520221120161524.0180620e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055796852DNAL7 a10.1515/aoas-2016-00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamski, Marek14aThe Effects of Strain and Caponisation on Carcass and Meat Traits of Cockerels Aged Twenty Weeks  ap. 1227-1239.  aThe analysis of slaughter yield and meat quality was performed on a total number of 96 birds from four medium-heavy weight pedigree strains. Based on their strain, cockerels were divided into the following groups: group I - strain N88 (originating from New Hampshire), group II - strain R55 (Rhode Island Red), group III - strain S11 (Sussex) and group IV - strain P55 (Plymouth Rock). Each group consisted of 24 birds. At 12 weeks of age, half of the cockerels from each group was caponised. In total, 48 birds were caponised (12 birds in each strain). Based on the strain, capons were then divided into groups V (N88), VI (R55), VII (S11) and VIII (P55). It was noted that the strain and caponisation had influence on differences in such traits as the weight of eviscerated carcass with neck and slaughter yield. On the other hand, it was observed that caponisation did not affect significantly the total weight, percentage share of breast and drumstick muscles in carcasses of birds from analysed strains. No significant differences were observed between groups in terms of physicochemical properties of meat. The highest content of water in breast and drumstick muscles was observed among cockerels and capons from strain N88 (groups I and V). Protein content in cockerels’ breast muscles differed depending on their strain whilst among capons (groups V-VIII) it was similar. It was also noted that capons originating from strains S11 (VII) and P55 (VIII) stood out significantly with higher fat content in breast muscles compared to cockerels from the same strain (groups III and IV). The effect of caponisation on higher fat content in drumstick muscles was confirmed in all observed groups. Capons from all strains had more fat in drumstick muscles compared to cockerels of the same origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlymouth Rock 3aRhode Island Red 3abreast muscle 3abreasts 3acapons 3acockerels 3alipid content 3ameat 3ameat quality 3aneck 3apedigree 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprotein content 3aslaughter 0acockerel 0acapon 0acaponisation 0aslaughter yield 0ameat quality1 aKuźniacka, Joanna1 aBanaszak, Mirosław0 tAnnals of animal science.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 16, no. 4 p.1227-1239dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aoas-2016-00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03832naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011900169520197900288592002802267650001202295650002902307650003002336650001902366650002102385650001502406650002402421650001502445650002202460650001302482650001202495650002102507650001402528650001902542650001502561650005002576650001502626650004302641650001402684650002502698650001602723650001502739650001302754651001002767653001602777653002302793653000902816653001502825653000902840653002502849700001302874700001402887700001802901700001802919700005302937773011902990856008803109852000903197655001203206IND60688995320221121221823.0210519e20200710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068899532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1380962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Shaojie10aMonitoring the spatio-temporal dynamics of the wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake by Landsat and MODIS observations  aPoyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, provides critical ecological functions for water circulation and biodiversity conservation as a dynamic wetland system. However, recent climate change and human activities exerted strong pressures on this ecosystem. In this paper, we applied object-based image analysis (OBIA) and Radom Forests (RF) classifier to ten Landsat images to examine the land cover composition and its change during 1987–2017 low water season at Poyang Lake. NDVI time series (2000–2017) derived from MODIS imagery was used to document the changes of vegetation growth status. To investigate the potential driving mechanism of the inundation patterns, we differentiated the spatial-temporal changes of vegetation coverage and NDVI accumulation on eight elevation bands. Major result indicates that the vegetation area increased by 15.5% of the lake area during 1987–2017. A much faster-increasing rate (58.0 km² year⁻¹) can be observed during 2001–2009 as compared to that of the overall study period (18.4 km² year⁻¹). Analysis of NDVI accumulation showed that 42.1% of the lake's area displayed a significant increasing trend during 2000–2017. Spatially, the increase of vegetation area and NDVI accumulation mainly took place in the 11–12 m elevation band in the lower lake center. Early dry season and prolonged exposure period after the operation of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) was the major reason for the spatio-temporal evolution of the wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake. The Lake's water level started to fall below 12 m before 9th November might cause a boost of vegetation growth in the low lake center, and in turn, triggering xerophilization for the vegetation in the highlands and a shift in foraging patterns of waterbirds due to phenology variations. The findings of this study provide a clear reference for sustaining the inter-annual stability of the ecosystem by controlling the depth of water in the lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3adams (hydrology) 3adry season 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aexposure duration 3aforaging 3aforests 3afreshwater lakes 3ahighlands 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3atime series analysis 3awater birds 3awater flow 3awetlands 3aChina 0aPoyang Lake 0aWetland vegetation 0aOBIA 0aLand cover 0aNDVI 0aVegetation phenology1 aLi, Bing1 aYao, Jing1 aYang, Guishan1 aWan, Rongrong1 aXu, Xibao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1448-82920 tScience of the total environment.g2020 July 10, v. 725 p.138096-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1380963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245006400180300001800244520098800262592002801250650001901278650001401297650003001311650001501341650002201356650001201378650001101390650001301401700001901414700001901433700002001452700002101472700002901493773010001522856008601622852000901708655001201717IND60086315620221120032249.0141101e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008631562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraeten, Bart van der,10aMarkets of concentration permits: The case of manure policy  ap. 2098-2104.  aConcentration permits are regarded as an interesting policy tool for regulating emissions where, besides absolute amounts, also local concentration is important. However, effects of governance structure, trading system and possible policy interventions in the permits' allocation are not yet well analysed and understood. This paper explores in how far tradable fertilisation standards can be seen as a concentration permit trading (CPT) system which can be fine-tuned for further policy intervention. Indeed fertilisation standards such as obliged by the EU Nitrate Directive can be regarded as local nitrate emissions limits, and thus concentration permits. A multi-agent spatial allocation model is used to simulate the impact of defining the manure problem in terms of concentration permits rather than conventional emission permits. Impacts are simulated in terms of environmental performance and increased reallocation costs. The model is applied on the Flemish manure problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aemissions 3aenvironmental performance 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3anitrates1 aBuysse, Jeroen1 aNolte, Stephan1 aLauwers, Ludwig1 aClaeys, Dakerlia1 aHuylenbroeck, Guido van,0 tEcological economics.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 70, no. 11 p.2098-2104dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012100163300001800284520174500302592002802047650000802075650002002083650002502103650002302128650004302151650001602194650001402210650002702224650000902251650002302260650001402283650002602297700001802323700002102341700001902362700002602381773011202407856007302519852000902592655001202601IND60519322920221119105413.0160426e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051932292DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.135022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilschut, Rutger A.10aNatural epigenetic variation contributes to heritable flowering divergence in a widespread asexual dandelion lineage  ap. 1759-1768.  aEpigenetic variation has been proposed to contribute to the success of asexual plants, either as a contributor to phenotypic plasticity or by enabling transient adaptation via selection on transgenerationally stable, but reversible, epialleles. While recent studies in experimental plant populations have shown the potential for epigenetic mechanisms to contribute to adaptive phenotypes, it remains unknown whether heritable variation in ecologically relevant traits is at least partially epigenetically determined in natural populations. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DNA methylation variation contributes to heritable differences in flowering time within a single widespread apomictic clonal lineage of the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale s. lat.). Apomictic clone members of the same apomictic lineage collected from different field sites showed heritable differences in flowering time, which was correlated with inherited differences in methylation‐sensitive AFLP marker profiles. Differences in flowering between apomictic clone members were significantly reduced after in vivo demethylation using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor zebularine. This synchronization of flowering times suggests that flowering time divergence within an apomictic lineage was mediated by differences in DNA methylation. While the underlying basis of the methylation polymorphism at functional flowering time‐affecting loci remains to be demonstrated, our study shows that epigenetic variation contributes to heritable phenotypic divergence in ecologically relevant traits in natural plant populations. This result also suggests that epigenetic mechanisms can facilitate adaptive divergence within genetically uniform asexual lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aadaptive radiation 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aepigenetics 3aflowering 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aloci 3amethyltransferases 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity1 aOplaat, Carla1 aSnoek, L.

This study compared the glycerol uptake and electricity generation of a co-culture of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Klebsiella pneumonia J2B in a MFC with that of a single species inoculated counterpart. Glycerol was metabolized successfully in the co-culture MFC (MFC-J&M) with simultaneous electricity production but it was not utilized in the MR-1 only MFC (MFC-M). A current density of 10 mA/m² was obtained while acidic byproducts (lactate and acetate) were consumed in the co-culture MFC, whereas they are accumulated in the J2B-only MFC (MFC-J). MR-1 was distributed mainly on the electrode in MFC-J&M, whereas most of the J2B was observed in the suspension in the MFC-J reactor, indicating that the co-culture of both strains provides an ecological driving force for glycerol utilization using the electrode as an electron acceptor. This suggests that a co-culture MFC can be applied to electrical energy recovery from glycerol, which was previously known as a refractory substrate in a bioelectrochemical system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aacetates 3abioelectrochemistry 3abioenergy 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3acoculture 3aelectricity 3aelectrodes 3aenergy recovery 3afeedstocks 3aglycerol 3alactic acid 3amicrobial fuel cells1 aSong, Young Eun1 aLee, Cho Rong1 aJeon, Byong-Hun1 aKim, Jung Rae0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 43, no. 10 p.1397-1403dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-016-1807-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012500164300001600289520109700305592002801402650001301430650002001443650003801463650001101501650001401512650001801526650000901544650002401553651001401577651001401591700001901605700001801624700002101642700001701663700001901680700002301699773012001722856004801842852000901890655001201899IND4478861820221121091947.0120328e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447886182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-011-1963-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, James W.10aSynthesis and Characterization of New Biodiesels Derived From Oils of Plants Growing in Northern Wisconsin and Minnesota  ap. 721-725.  aWe report on the preparation and selected properties of some new biodiesels which we synthesized from oils of plants growing in Northern Wisconsin and Minnesota.

Some of these biodiesels exhibited remarkably good low-temperature characteristics. In order to further improve these properties, we use a variety of alcohols during the transesterification process, including isopropyl, 2-butyl, and isoamyl alcohols. Using several parameters such as oil content and crystallization onset temperature T c, plant species that appear most promising have been identified, among those highbush cranberry (T c ≈ −31 °C for its methyl esters, T c ≈ −41 °C for its 2-butyl esters), dotted horsemint (T c ≈ −17 °C for its methyl esters, T c ≈ −40 °C for its 2-butyl esters), and American hazelnut (T c ≈ −19 °C for its methyl esters, T c ≈ −30 °C for its 2-butyl esters).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aesters 3ahazelnuts 3alipid content 3aoils 3atransesterification 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin1 aHukriede, Kurt1 aJersett, Adam1 aKoirala, Damodar1 aLevings, Dan1 aStewart, Aaron1 aWaxman, Michael A.0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2012 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.721-725dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-011-1963-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012300164300001600287520068700303592002800990650002701018650001501045650001401060650002001074650001501094650001301109650002201122650001901144650001801163650001301181653001801194653001801212653002901230700001901259700001501278700001601293700001701309773009501326856008201421852000901503655001201512IND60091652320221122033655.0161021e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009165232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lijuan10aPrussian blue @ platinum nanoparticles/graphite felt nanocomposite electrodes: Application as hydrogen peroxide sensor  ap. 120-124.  aIn this study, we report a triple-component sensor fabricated by freestanding graphite felt (GF), platinum nanoparticles (Pt) and Prussian blue (PB).

Ashgourd and radish fibers demonstrated significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher water binding capacity and swelling capacity in stomach pH, i.e., 1.8; whereas pea peel and cardamom peel fibers exhibited higher hydration capacity at duodenal pH, i.e., 8.7. Ashgourd fiber (30 mesh) showed higher glucose adsorption capacity (452.1 μm/g) and exhibited maximum retarding effect on the flow of glucose across the dialysis bag for 12 h in comparison with other fiber sources. The 30 mesh (250–380 μm) and 60 mesh (150–230 μm) fiber particles showed better hydration properties as well as hypoglycemic effect as compared to 100 mesh (40–110 μm) particles. These fibers showed an excellent performance in relation to functional properties and hypoglycemic effect thus can be incorporated as low calorie bulk ingredient in high fiber foods to reduce calorie level and to help in controlling blood glucose concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ablood glucose 3acardamom 3adialysis 3adietary fiber 3afoods 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahuman physiology 3aingredients 3apH 3aparticle size 3apeas 3aradishes 3astomach 3awater binding capacity 0aDietary fiber 0aParticle size 0aFunctional properties 0aHypoglycemic effect 0aFiber components1 aPremavalli, K.S.0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 2 p.397-410dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942910903207736  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010400170520120200274592002801476650000901504650001501513650001601528650001901544653004201563653002101605653002001626653003601646653005701682700001401739700001301753700001501766700001901781700001401800700001501814700001301829700001801842773012001860856008801980852000902068655001202077IND60778714020221123005431.0221004e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077871402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Junfang10aMolecular characterization of nitrogen-containing organic compounds in the winter North China Plain  aThe molecular characteristics of organic aerosols (OAs) in heavily polluted areas affected by coal combustion (CC) were investigated. In terms of relative abundance, the total nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOC) accounted for about 61%–68% of all molecules detected in methanol-soluble organic carbon (MSOC) by LC − Q-TOF − MS. More than 85% of the CHON- formulas are nitro-aromatic compounds, which are generally considered to be secondary organic compounds, as evidenced by the lower degree of overlap of these substances in the atmospheric samples and CC samples. Some polycyclic aromatic compounds with 4 N and 1–2O and very low H/C and O/C ratio produced by CC are unstable and easily react to form compounds with higher degrees of saturation. Almost all of the CHON+ homologues detected in the CC samples were also found in the atmospheric samples, indicating that the large amount of CHON+ compounds produced by CC are stable during atmospheric processes. The CHN+ compounds produced by CC contain a certain amount of highly unsaturated compounds, among which 1 N-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (1 N-PAHs) is stable in atmosphere and can serve as markers of CC.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenvironment 3aorganic carbon 0aNitrogen-containing organic compounds 0aOrganic aerosols 0aCoal combustion 0aMethanol-soluble organic carbon 0aNitrogen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aCheng, Yi1 aBai, Zhe1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Linyuan1 aChen, Hui1 aWang, Lina1 aLi, Ling1 aChen, Jianmin0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156189-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015500162300001800317520191500335592002802250650001602278650001202294650001602306650001302322650001502335650003402350650001302384650001602397650001402413650002702427650002502454650002802479650002202507650003502529650001302564651001002577700001502587700001802602700001902620700001202639700001902651700001702670700001702687700001502704773012102719856008102840852000902921655001202930IND60537261420221121171543.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053726142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-016-2724-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Shan10aDetecting the QTL-allele system of seed isoflavone content in Chinese soybean landrace population for optimal cross design and gene system exploration  ap. 1557-1576.  aKEY MESSAGE : Utilizing an innovative GWAS in CSLRP, 44 QTL 199 alleles with 72.2 % contribution to SIFC variation were detected and organized into a QTL-allele matrix for cross design and gene annotation. The seed isoflavone content (SIFC) of soybeans is of great importance to health care. The Chinese soybean landrace population (CSLRP) as a genetic reservoir was studied for its whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTL) system of the SIFC using an innovative restricted two-stage multi-locus genome-wide association study procedure (RTM-GWAS). A sample of 366 landraces was tested under four environments and sequenced using RAD-seq (restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing) technique to obtain 116,769 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) then organized into 29,119 SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks (SNPLDBs) for GWAS. The detected 44 QTL 199 alleles on 16 chromosomes (explaining 72.2 % of the total phenotypic variation) with the allele effects (92 positive and 107 negative) of the CSLRP were organized into a QTL-allele matrix showing the SIFC population genetic structure. Additional differentiation among eco-regions due to the SIFC in addition to that of genome-wide markers was found. All accessions comprised both positive and negative alleles, implying a great potential for recombination within the population. The optimal crosses were predicted from the matrices, showing transgressive potentials in the CSLRP. From the detected QTL system, 55 candidate genes related to 11 biological processes were χ ²-tested as an SIFC candidate gene system. The present study explored the genome-wide SIFC QTL/gene system with the innovative RTM-GWAS and found the potentials of the QTL-allele matrix in optimal cross design and population genetic and genomic studies, which may have provided a solution to match the breeding by design strategy at both QTL and gene levels in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acrossing 3aecoregions 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3aisoflavones 3alandraces 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoybeans 3aChina1 aHe, Jianbo1 aZhao, Tuanjie1 aXing, Guangnan1 aLi, Yan1 aYang, Shouping1 aLu, Jiangjie1 aWang, Yufeng1 aGai, Junyi0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2016 Aug., v. 129, no. 8 p.1557-1576dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-016-2724-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007900169300001600248520098900264592002801253650001301281650002701294650001501321650002601336650002901362650002901391650001401420650002701434650001501461650001101476650002001487650000901507650001301516653002301529653002001552653002701572653001501599653001001614700002101624700002701645700002201672700002901694700002801723773014301751856004801894852000901942655001201951IND50076520120221122002702.0140410e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007652012DNAL7 a10.1080/109429109032077442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, José G.M.10aAntibacterial Properties of Pequi Pulp Oil (Caryocar coriaceum – WITTM.)  ap. 411-416.  aPequi fruits have a high nutritional value, and they are rich in protein and vitamins. This work reports the results of the chemical characterization and antibacterial activity of “pequi” fruit pulp oil of Caryocar coriaceum (Wittm). Chemical composition was assessed by GLC and the antibacterial activity was assayed by the disk diffusion method. GLC indicated the following fatty acid content: oleic (55.79 g/100 g oil), palmitic (34.18 g/100 g oil), heptadecenoic (5.86 g/100 g oil), linoleic (1.80 g/100 g oil), stearic (1.73 g/100 g oil), eicosenoic (0.37 g/100 g oil), and palmitoleic (0.27 g/100 g oil). The oil showed antibacterial activity, inhibiting the growth of Salmonella cholerasuis (MIC < 1.25%), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 1.25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 1.25%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC 5%). There is great interest in extending the use of this natural product so that derivatives with combined social, economic and therapeutic value can be produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaryocar 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantibacterial properties 3aeconomics 3afatty acid composition 3afruit pulp 3afruits 3anutritive value 3aoils 3avitamins 0aCaryocar coriaceum 0aOil composition 0aAntibacterial activity 0aOleic acid 0aPequi1 aBrito, Samara A.1 aNascimento, Eidla M.M.1 aBotelho, Marco A.1 aRodrigues, Fabíola F.G.1 aCoutinho, Henrique D.M.0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 14, no. 2 p.411-416dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942910903207744  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011100164300001800275520097400293592002801267650002001295650001301315650004301328650001301371650001601384700002201400700002101422700002101443700002301464773012601487856007401613852000901687655001201696IND60638341920221117222009.0190429e20160204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063834192DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ay02528a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, Brendan J.10aOvercoming solvent mismatch limitations in 2D-HPLC with temperature programming of isocratic mobile phases  ap. 1293-1298.  aThis work describes a method for two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography (2D-HPLC) that uses an isocratic mobile phase with a temperature gradient in the first dimension. Temperature programming was used to manipulate solvent elution strength in place of a mobile phase concentration gradient. This ensured that all eluent fractions transferred into the second dimension were of an identical solvent composition, i.e. the second dimension injection solvent did not increase during the course of the analysis. When applied to a complex natural product extract of coffee, the separation was completed in 35 min and had an orthogonality of 35% (calculated using the bins method) and a spreading angle of 52° as determined via a geometric approach to factor analysis. This approach, incorporating a temperature gradient in the first dimension, compared favourably to previously reported 2D-HPLC separations of coffee, with similar or shorter analysis times.  aPublisher supplied data 3afactor analysis 3ageometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aConlan, Xavier A.1 aFrancis, Paul S.1 aBarnett, Neil W.1 aStevenson, Paul G.0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Feb. 4, v. 8, no. 6 p.1293-1298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay02528a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245008000168300001600248520131500264592002801579650000801607650001801615650001001633650001401643650002101657650001201678650002301690650001001713650003701723650003101760650002101791650002001812650001501832650001301847650001701860650002401877650002001901653002101921653002901942653002601971653002301997653002102020653000802041653000802049653000702057653000802064653001002072653001302082653001202095653000902107653000802116653001102124653001102135653000802146653000902154653000902163653000902172700001702181700001702198700001602215700001402231773007702245856008902322852000902411655001202420IND60556744820221120083936.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055674482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Wei10aNO2 inhalation causes tauopathy by disturbing the insulin signaling pathway  ap. 248-256.  aAir pollution has been evidenced as a risk factor for neurodegenerative tauopathies. NO2, a primary component of air pollution, is negatively linked to neurodegenerative disorders, but its independent and direct association with tau lesion remains to be elucidated. Considering the fact that the insulin signaling pathway can be targeted by air pollutants and regulate tau function, this study focused on the role of insulin signaling in this NO2-induced tauopathy. Using a dynamic inhalation treatment, we demonstrated that exposure to NO2 induced a disruption of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle, liver, and brain, with associated p38 MAPK and/or JNK activation. We also found that in parallel with these kinase signaling cascades, the compensatory hyperinsulinemia triggered by whole-body insulin resistance (IR) further attenuated the IRS-1/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway in the central nervous system, which consequently increased the phosphorylation of tau and reduced the expression of synaptic proteins that contributed to the development of the tau pathology. These findings provide new insight into the possible mechanisms involved in the etiopathogenesis of NO2-induced tauopathy, suggesting that the targeting of insulin signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3abrain 3abreathing 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anitrogen dioxide 3aphosphorylation 3apollutants 3aproteins 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 0aNitrogen dioxide 0atau hyperphosphorylation 0aSynaptic protein loss 0aInsulin resistance 0aHyperinsulinemia 0aNO2 0aCNS 0aIR 0aBBB 0aIRS-1 0aPKB /AKT 0aGSK-3β 0aMAPK 0aJNK 0aPSD-95 0aErk1/2 0aROS 0aAMPA 0aNMDA 0aPI3K1 aKu, Tingting1 aYue, Huifeng1 aLi, Guangke1 aSang, Nan0 tChemosphere.g2016 Dec., v. 165 p.248-256dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.09.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03924naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132024002200167024001900189024001100208040001800219100002100237245015700258300001600415506007600431506017300507520162300680506003702303650002602340650001102366650001302377650001102390650001902401650001002420650000902430650001402439650002202453650001302475650001102488650001702499650001002516650001302526650000702539650001102546650001002557650002302567650001402590650002002604650001102624650001102635650001102646700001802657700001802675700001802693700002002711700002002731700002002751700001802771773011302789856011202902856004803014956014603062961000903208852000903217655001203226IND50068991320221214230909.0130814e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006899132DNAL7 a2309762aris7 a10113/573042hdl7 a10.1007/s00284-008-9312-82doi7 aPMC45262342pmcid7 a189823882pmid8 ans2727  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdrington, T.

The current research aimed to examine the effect of season, diet, EHEC shedding, and location within the GIT on AHL prevalence in the ruminant. Luminal content samples were collected from the rumen and rectum of feedlot cattle at slaughter in the spring, summer, fall, and winter for culture of E. coli O157:H7 and AHL determination. During the spring collection, samples were additionally collected from the cecum and small intestine, but these samples all were AHL negative and therefore not examined again. To assess the influence of diet on AHL prevalence, 14 lambs were fed either 100% forage or 80% concentrate diets and experimentally inoculated with EHEC. At 8 days after infection, all the lambs were killed, and necropsies were taken, with luminal contents collected from the GIT. The collections from the feedlot cattle had AHL in 100% of the rumen content samples from the spring, summer, and fall, but not in any of the winter samples. No other GIT samples from feedlot cattle were AHL positive, and all the samples from the sheep study were AHL negative. The cattle seemed to show a weak correlation between ruminal AHL and EHEC prevalence. This research found AHL only in the rumen and not in the lower GIT of feedlot cattle. However, it is unclear whether this is because the pH of the lower gut destroys the AHL or because a lack of certain bacteria in the lower gut producing AHL.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aautumn 3abacteria 3acattle 3acattle feeding 3acecum 3adiet 3aexcretion 3afeed concentrates 3afeedlots 3aforage 3alamb feeding 3alambs 3anecropsy 3apH 3arectum 3arumen 3aseasonal variation 3aslaughter 3asmall intestine 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter1 aFarrow, R.

As people become increasingly aware of the importance of wildlife to biological and environmental sustainability, newspapers can be important sources of information, especially in developing countries, such as Iran. Three major Iranian daily newspapers were analysed for news items related to wildlife. Over the 7-year study period, 434 articles presented environmental news, of which 61 items referred to wildlife. Each wildlife item was recorded in terms of message, contributor, spatiality, and allocated space. Structure query language (SQL) was used to analyse relationships between the 915 fields/entries. Wildlife items were characterised by public awareness (51%), columnist contributions (46%), and local spatiality (43%). Most items (82%) were allocated space of less than half a page. Of the categorised topics, those of combined endangered land (30%) and marine (5%) species exceeded items on global conservation (24%). Results highlighted the minimal number and small space devoted to wildlife news items and their concentrations (67%) in one of the three sampled newspapers. Although nature has historically been important in Iranian culture, current attitudes to wildlife, as reflected in newspaper coverage, do not seem to mirror these traditional perspectives. Given the widespread distribution of newspapers and their roles (i.e., as sources of information and opinion influencers), global wildlife conservation issues would benefit from much greater coverage in the daily press.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3apeople 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aIran1 aDragovich, D.,0 tAnimals.g2021 May 21, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110614873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007800162300001600240500002000256520166700276592002801943650003501971650002302006650001102029650001702040650001002057650001002067650001602077650001102093650001402104650001702118650001302135650001002148650002302158650002202181650001302203650002202216651001402238700002502252700001802277700002402295773013002319856007302449852000902522655001202531IND60587642320221121002703.0180102e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058764232DNAL7 a10.1890/13-0389.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeard, Geoffrey W.10aWetland characteristics influence disease risk for a threatened amphibian  ap. 650-662.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIdentifying determinants of the probability and intensity of infections is important for understanding the epidemiology of wildlife diseases, and for managing their impact on threatened species. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has decimated populations of some amphibians. However, recent studies have identified important environmental constraints on the disease, related to the pathogen's physiological tolerances. In this study, we identified several intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of the probability and intensity of chytrid infections for the threatened growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in southeastern Australia, and used mark–recapture to estimate the effect of chytrid infections on the probability of survival of these frogs. Water temperature and salinity had negative effects on both the probability and intensity of chytrid infections. We coupled models of the infection process with a model of the effect of chytrid infections on the probability of survival to assess variation in the impact of chytridiomycosis between wetlands with differing temperature and salinity profiles. Our results suggest that warm, saline wetlands may be refuges from chytridiomycosis for L. raniformis, and should be priorities for protection. Our results also suggest that management actions that increase water temperature (e.g., reducing canopy shading) and salinity (e.g., complementing inflows with groundwater) could be trialed to reduce the impacts of chytridiomycosis on this species. This and other recent studies highlight the value of research on environmental risk factors for chytridiomycosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aLitoria raniformis 3acanopy 3aepidemiology 3afrogs 3afungi 3agroundwater 3amodels 3apathogens 3arisk factors 3asalinity 3ashade 3athreatened species 3awater temperature 3awetlands 3awildlife diseases 3aAustralia1 aScroggie, Michael P.1 aClemann, Nick1 aRamsey, David S.

One of the aqueous PAM solutions and an aqueous dispersion of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibril (TOCN) were mixed at various PAM/TOCN weight ratios, and self-standing PAM/TOCN composite films were prepared by casting and drying. Because nonionic and cationic PAM molecules may have had some attractive interactions with anionic TOCN elements, the visual appearances and particle sizes of the mixtures varied depending on the charge densities of PAMs. In particular, PAM molecules with electric charge densities with +0.54 and +0.98 meq/g formed polyelectrolyte complexes with anionic TOCN elements, resulting in formation of large agglomerates in the aqueous mixtures. The PAM/TOCN composite films at weight ratios of 10/90 and 25/75 had higher Young’s moduli and tensile strengths than those of 100 % TOCN film, when PAMs with charge densities from −1.64 to +0.54 were used. The PAM/TOCN composite films at the weight ratio of 10/90 had elongations at break similar to that of 100 % TOCN film, resulting in higher work of fracture values or ductile properties, whereas the PAM/TOCN composite films at the weight ratio of 25/75 were rather brittle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3adrying 3aelectrolytes 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization1 aIsogai, Akira0 tCellulose.g2015 Feb., v. 22, no. 1 p.499-506dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-014-0478-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016000164520139800324592002801722650004401750650002601794650001201820650001701832650001601849650001401865650001001879650001801889650001401907650002601921650001301947650001801960650002101978650001901999650001402018650002002032650002202052650003302074650001102107650001102118650001602129653003702145653002002182700001702202700001502219700001302234773010202247856008602349852000902435655001202444IND60679982820221121051617.0200503e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067998282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Yan10aDevelopment of active and intelligent packaging by incorporating betalains from red pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) peel into starch/polyvinyl alcohol films  aThis study aims to develop active and intelligent packaging films based on starch/polyvinyl alcohol incorporated with betalains-rich red pitaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) peel extract. The microstructure, physical and functional properties of the films with different contents of the extract (0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 wt% on starch basis) were measured. Results showed betacyanins were the main components in the extract, which presented significant color changes under alkaline conditions. Scanning electron microscopy observation revealed the compactness of the films was improved by the extract addition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that betacyanins in the extract could interact with starch, polyvinyl alcohol and glycerol through hydrogen bonds. The incorporation of the extract enhanced the water vapor barrier and ultraviolet–visible light barrier ability, and mechanical, antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the films. The film containing 1.00 wt% of the extract was more sensitive to ammonia than other films. When applied to monitor the freshness of shrimp, the film containing 1.00 wt% of the extract presented visible color changes due to the accumulated volatile nitrogen compounds during the spoiling process of shrimp. Our results suggest the film containing 1.00 wt% of the extract can be used as active and intelligent packaging in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHylocereus polyrhizus 3aammonia 3aantioxidants 3abetacyanins 3abetalains 3acolor 3afood industry 3afreshness 3afunctional properties 3aglycerol 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrostructure 3apackaging 3apackaging films 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrimp 3astarch 3awater vapor 0aActive and intelligent packaging 0aRed pitaya peel1 aLiu, Yunpeng1 aZhang, Xin1 aLiu, Jun0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Mar., v. 100 p.105410-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1054103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013000175300001400305520064000319592002800959650002400987650001701011650001401028650002301042650001201065650001801077650001801095650001401113650001301127650001401140650001301154650001401167653001901181653002301200653002601223653002301249653000801272700002201280773013201302856008601434852000901520655001201529IND60552818220221118021208.0161021e20140820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055281822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPremkumar, Thathan10aPalladium nanostructures: Solvent-less, one-pot mechano-chemical synthesis using poly(vinylpyrolidone) and catalytic activity  ap. 49-54.  aPalladium nanoparticles are synthesized by an one-step, solvent-less, mechano-chemical reduction of potassium tetrachloropalladate(II) using an amphiphilic organic polymer, poly(vinylpyrrolidone).

Trichoderma spp. and phosphites, ordinarily used as biocontrol agents, can trigger phytostimulation, also promoting endogenous mechanisms involved in plant growth and development. The present study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a phosphite-based formulation (Phosphit-One) and Trichoderma harzianum-T22 on the morpho-physiological response and modulation of the metabolomics profile in zucchini squash plants (Cucurbita pepo L.) cultivated in controlled growth conditions (Fitotron®). The highest values of fresh biomass production (390.9 g plant⁻¹) and root dry weight (5.6 g plant⁻¹) were obtained for Trichoderma-treated plants. This last treatment resulted in an improved physiological performance (SPAD index, CO₂ assimilation rate, and Fᵥ/Fₘ ratio) measured 30 days after transplanting. Both Trichoderma and phosphite treatments induced a broad metabolic reprogramming in leaves, evident also for the phosphite treatment that did not result in a growth promotion. The microbial and the non-microbial treatments showed distinctive signatures in secondary metabolism yet, common responses could be also highlighted. For instance, both Trichoderma and phosphite triggered ROS-mediated signaling processes, together with the accumulation of phenylpropanoids, glucosinolates, and phytoalexins. Furthermore, a significant alteration of phytohormones was observed, with terpenoid gibberellins and brassinosteroids showing the largest differences. The metabolomic signatures induced by Trichoderma and phosphite in zucchini squash provided molecular insights into the processes underlying elicitation of plant defense due to biostimulation. Interestingly, the modulation of plant secondary metabolism by both treatments did not impair plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3aTrichoderma 3aagronomy 3abiological control 3abiomass production 3abrassinosteroids 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop production 3agibberellins 3aglucosinolates 3agrowth promotion 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3aphenylpropanoids 3aphytoalexins 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3asecondary metabolites 3azucchini1 aMiras-Moreno, Begoña 1 aCiriello, Michele 1 aEl-Nakhel, Christophe 1 aCorrado, Giandomenico 1 aLucini, Luigi 1 aColla, Giuseppe 1 aRouphael, Youssef 0 tAgronomy.g2021 June 14, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110612053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04490naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002100186245012000207300001100327506007600338520199600414592002802410506003702438650001302475650002202488650001202510650001002522650001202532650001102544650002202555650001902577650001502596650001602611650001202627650001002639650002802649650003602677650003202713650001102745650001102756650000902767650001602776650001902792650002602811650001502837650003202852650001502884650001702899650002102916650002402937650002602961650002102987651001003008651002503018700002303043700001703066700001703083700001903100700002403119700002203143700002403165700001803189700002103207700002903228700002503257700001703282700001703299700002303316700002103339710005303360773015903413856007903572852000903651655001203660IND50074552820221207092727.0151107e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007455282DNAL7 a245719152pmid7 aPMC39740632pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-11-262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnjana, Ranjit M10aPhysical activity and inactivity patterns in India – results from the ICMR-INDIAB study (Phase-1) [ICMR-INDIAB-5]  ap. 26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of diabetes and obesity in India can be attributed, at least in part, to increasing levels of physical inactivity. However, there has been no nationwide survey in India on physical activity levels involving both the urban and rural areas in whole states of India. The aim of the present study was to assess physical activity patterns across India - as part of the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. METHODS: Phase 1 of the ICMR-INDIAB study was conducted in four regions of India (Tamilnadu, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chandigarh representing the south, west, east and north of India respectively) with a combined population of 213 million people. Physical activity was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) in 14227 individuals aged ≥ 20 years [urban- 4,173; rural- 10,054], selected from the above regions using a stratified multistage design. RESULTS: Of the 14227 individuals studied, 54.4% (n = 7737) were inactive (males: 41.7%), while 31.9% (n = 4537) (males: 58.3%) were active and 13.7% (n = 1953) (males: 61.3%) were highly active. Subjects were more inactive in urban, compared to rural, areas (65.0% vs. 50.0%; p < 0.001). Males were significantly more active than females (p < 0.001). Subjects in all four regions spent more active minutes at work than in the commuting and recreation domains. Absence of recreational activity was reported by 88.4%, 94.8%, 91.3% and 93.1% of the subjects in Chandigarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Tamilnadu respectively. The percentage of individuals with no recreational activity increased with age (Trend χ ²: 199.1, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that a large percentage of people in India are inactive with fewer than 10% engaging in recreational physical activity. Therefore, urgent steps need to be initiated to promote physical activity to stem the twin epidemics of diabetes and obesity in India.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiabetes 3adisease outbreaks 3afemales 3amales 3aobesity 3apeople 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3arecreation 3arural areas 3asurveys 2aAdult 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitusxepidemiology 2aDyslipidemiasxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotor Activity 2aObesityxepidemiology 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRecreation 2aRisk Factors 2aRural Population 2aSedentary Behavior. 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aUrban Population 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology.1 aPradeepa, Rajendra1 aDas, Ashok K1 aDeepa, Mohan1 aBhansali, Anil1 aJoshi, Shashank R.,1 aJoshi, Prashant P1 aDhandhania, Vinay K1 aRao, Paturi V1 aSudha, Vasudevan1 aSubashini, Radhakrishnan1 aUnnikrishnan, Ranjit1 aMadhu, Sri V1 aKaur, Tanvir1 aMohan, Viswanathan1 aShukla, Deepak K2 afor the ICMR– INDIAB Collaborative Study Group0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.26-26dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-11-263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245009300177300001600270520054500286592002800831650001400859650000800873650001400881650001300895650001800908650001100926650001200937650002200949700001900971700002000990700001801010700002201028773010701050856008301157852000901240655001201249IND60084729320221122103053.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2010.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIturbe-Ormaetxe, Iñaki12aA simple protocol to obtain highly pure Wolbachia endosymbiont DNA for genome sequencing  ap. 134-136.  aMost genome sequencing projects using intracellular bacteria face difficulties in obtaining sufficient bacterial DNA free of host contamination.

This study aimed to determine the frequency and level of exposure to Alternaria mycotoxins (tenuazonic acid, TeA; alternariol, AOH; alternariol monomethyl ether, AME; tentoxin, TEN; and altenuene, ALT) in human urine from Beijing adults. A total of 2212 urine samples were collected and analyzed for five mycotoxins using LC–ESI–MS/MS. More than 98% of the samples had at least one Alternaria mycotoxin detected. Among the mycotoxins, AME had the highest detection rate (96.0%), followed by TeA (70.5%). The calculated average daily intake values of AME (12.5 ng/kg b.w.) was 5 times the TTC value (2.5 ng/kg b.w.) set by the EFSA, indicating the potential health risks associated with mycotoxins. Immediate attention and subsequent actions should be taken to identify the sources of mycotoxins and the corresponding exposure pathways to humans in the investigated regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aadverse effects 3aaltenuene 3aaverage daily intake 3agrain foods 3ahumans 3atenuazonic acid 3aurine 3aChina 0aAlternaria mycotoxin 0aBiomonitoring 0aUPLC-MS/MS 0aExposure assessment 0aAdults1 aLi, Gang1 aZhang, Jing1 aDu, Jing1 aYang, Yunjia1 aYin, Jie1 aLi, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6480-58661 aXie, Jie1 aJiang, You1 aFang, Xiang1 aDai, Xinhua1 aShao, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5631-68890 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 Aug., v. 118 p.122-129dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012100167300001600288520070500304592002801009650002001037650001001057650001901067650001301086650001701099700002101116700001801137700001801155700002401173773010701197856008301304852000901387655001201396IND60084729420221122081724.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2010.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbebe, Gemeda10aTuberculosis drug resistance testing by molecular methods: Opportunities and challenges in resource limited settings  ap. 155-160.  aOne of the greatest threats to global tuberculosis (TB) control is the growing prevalence of drug-resistant bacilli. Correctly diagnosing drug-resistant TB patients is more problematic in resource-limited settings as there is no or limited infrastructure for drug susceptibility testing (DST) of TB bacilli. The conventional phenotypic DST method for TB takes weeks before declaring the results and initiating proper anti-TB treatment. Molecular DST offers advantages over the phenotypic methods mainly because of the short turnaround time. This review summarizes the different molecular DST methods for TB and discusses challenges and opportunities in implementing them in resource-limited settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3ainfrastructure 3apatients 3atuberculosis1 aPaasch, Fabienne1 aApers, Ludwig1 aRigouts, Leen1 aColebunders, Robert0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2011 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.155-160dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2010.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245015000213300001400363520142000377592002801797650001901825650002201844650003501866650001601901650001301917650001601930650002001946650002301966650000901989650001601998650001802014650002302032650001402055650001402069650002202083650001702105650001802122650001002140650001202150650003702162650001302199653001102212653001702223653001902240653003702259653002002296653001802316653000702334653000702341653001202348653000702360653000702367653000802374653000802382653000702390653001102397653000802408653000802416653000802424653000802432700006002440700002202500700002402522700002202546700002402568700002002592773012202612856008502734852000902819655001202828IND60634121420221121050831.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063412142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTombuloglu, Huseyin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8546-265810aImpact of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and ionic iron on physiology of summer squash (Cucurbita pepo): A comparative study  ap. 56-65.  aThis study investigates the effect of SPIONs (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, ∼12.5 nm in size) on summer squash plant (Cucurbita pepo) in the presence and absence of supplementary iron (Fe(II)-EDTA). The plants were grown in nutrient solution with different iron sources: (i) Fe(II)-EDTA, (ii) without Fe(II)-EDTA (iii) SPIONs only, and (iv) Fe(II)-EDTA with SPIONs. Plant growth and development were assessed after 20 days of soaking by measuring phenological parameters such as plant biomass, chlorophyll content, amount of carotenoids, and the catalase enzyme activity. Transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and vibrating sample magnetometer methods were used to detect uptake and translocation of SPIONs in plant tissues. Our results showed that SPIONs treatment (without Fe(II)-EDTA) caused growth retardation and decreased the plant biomass and chlorophyll content. Hence, they are not efficient sources to compensate for iron demand of squash plant. Electron microscopy observations, magnetization and elemental analyses revealed that SPIONs are taken-up by plant roots but not translocate to upper organs. In roots, SPIONs use a symplastic route for intercellular transfer. These findings suggest that as an iron source, SPIONs alone are not efficient for plant growth, but can contribute it together with Fe(II)-EDTA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth retardation 3airon 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3anutrient solutions 3aphenology 3aphytomass 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3asoaking 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azucchini 0aSPIONs 0aPlant growth 0aCucurbita pepo 0aTransmission electron microscopy 0aIron deficiency 0aMagnetization 0aFM 0aHc 0aICP-OES 0aMr 0aMs 0aNPs 0aPBS 0aPM 0aSPIONs 0aSPM 0aTEM 0aVSM 0aXRD1 aSlimani, Yassine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2579-16171 aTombuloglu, Guzin1 aDemir Korkmaz, Ayse1 aBaykal, Abdulhadi1 aAlmessiere, Munirah1 aErcan, İsmail,0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 June, v. 139 p.56-65dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169300001600273520119100289592002801480650003601508650001901544650001101563650002001574650003201594650001901626650001801645650001401663650004401677650003001721653003001751653002301781653002101804700003501825700002401860700002001884700002601904700002601930700002601956700002201982700002202004700002302026700002202049700002102071773007602092856008402168852000902252655001202261IND60568598920221116150839.0170709e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056859892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Manna, Sara10aCharacterization of linear mimetic peptides of Interleukin-22 from dissection of protein interfaces  ap. 106-115.  aInterleukin-22 (IL-22) belongs to the family of IL-10 cytokines and is involved in a wide number of human diseases, including inflammatory disorders and cancer pathology. The ligand-receptor complex IL-22/IL-22R plays a key role in several pathways especially in the regulation and resolution of immune responses. The identification of novel compounds able to modulate IL-22/IL-22R complex could open the route to new therapeutic strategies in multiple human diseases.In this study, we designed and characterized IL-22 derived peptides at protein interface regions: several sequences revealed able to interfere with the protein complex with IC50 in the micromolar range as evaluated through Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments. Their conformational characterization was carried out through Circular Dichroism (CD) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, shedding new light into the features of IL-22 fragments and on structural determinants of IL-22/IL-22R1 recognition. Finally, several peptides were tested on human keratinocyte cultures for evaluating their ability to mimic the activation of molecular pathways downstream to IL-22R in response to IL-22 binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-10 3akeratinocytes 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 0aInterface protein regions 0aCircular dichroism 0aIL-22 signalling1 aScognamiglio, Pasqualina Liana1 aDi Natale, Concetta1 aLeone, Marilisa1 aMercurio, Flavia Anna1 aMalfitano, Anna Maria1 aCianfarani, Francesca1 aMadonna, Stefania1 aCaravella, Sergio1 aAlbanesi, Cristina1 aNovellino, Ettore1 aMarasco, Daniela0 tBiochimie.g2017 July, v. 138 p.106-115dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016000168300001600328500001900344520110700363592002801470650001401498650002401512650002301536650002201559650001501581650001501596650001201611650002301623650001501646650001501661650002901676650002101705653001401726653001901740700001701759700002101776700001701797700006201814773009901876856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60717943120221120115442.0201209e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071794312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.10.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yuansheng10aFilamentous microalgae as an advantageous co-substrate for enhanced methane production and digestate dewaterability in anaerobic co-digestion of pig manure  ap. 399-407.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed at exploring filamentous microalgae (Tribonema sp.) as an advantageous co-substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD) of pig manure. Its impacts on the AD performance were assessed in terms of methane yield, energy conversion efficiency, digestion kinetics, and digestate dewaterability. The microalgae substantially improved methane yield, AD kinetics, and digestate dewaterability of the AD process. The enhancement in methane yield ranged from 2 to 27.4%, with the maximum enhancement (corresponding to an energy conversion efficiency of 81%) occurring at a mixing ratio of 1:1 (VS basis). The AD kinetics was improved as indicated by the increased hydrolysis rate constants and diminished lag time. The specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of the digestate decreased significantly with the increasing proportion of the microalgae in the co-substrates, which would facilitate digestate processing and valorisation. Subsequently, the high biomass productivity of the microalgae (441 mg/L/d) in liquid digestate would enable sustainable bioenergy production through nutrient recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribonema 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass production 3aenergy conversion 3afiltration 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3amethane production 3amicroalgae 3apig manure 3arenewable energy sources 3awaste management 0aDigestate 0aDewaterability1 aKumar, Manoj1 aWang, Zhongzhong1 aZhan, Xinmin1 aStengel, Dagmar B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5871-95500 tWaste management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 119 p.399-407dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.10.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245016000180300001400340520174600354592002802100650001702128650000902145650001802154650001702172650001002189650001302199650001102212650003102223650000702254650001702261650001502278650002502293650002302318650002502341653002302366653001802389653001802407653002602425653001702451700002302468700006102491700002502552700002502577773011102602856009202713852000902805655001202814IND60567721420221119075842.0190412e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056772142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2017.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArendse, Ebrahiema10aDevelopment of calibration models for the evaluation of pomegranate aril quality by Fourier-transform near infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometrics  ap. 22-32.  aA Fourier transform NIR (FT-NIR) method was developed combining chemometrics for prediction of organoleptic and phytochemical parameters of pomegranate arils using two different FT-NIR acquisition methods; namely, an integrating sphere (IS) and an emission head (EH) used over a spectral region 800–2500 nm. Several pre-processing methods were investigated. Pre-processing methods that yielded higher coefficient of determination (R2) and residual predictive deviation (RPD), lower root mean square error estimation (RMSEE) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) values were used for model development. Model development using the EH gave the best prediction of total soluble solids (R2 = 87.55, RMSEP = 0.30%), pH (R2 = 85.18, RMSEP = 0.10), titratable acidity (R2 = 85.59, RMSEP = 0.10%), BrimA (R2 = 83.43, RMSEP = 0.43), aril hue (R2 = 88.59, RMSEP = 4.19), total phenolic concentration (R2 = 86.48, RMSEP = 0.11 g l−1), total anthocyanin concentration (R2 = 70.50, RMSEP = 0.13 g l−1) and vitamin C concentration (R2 = 84.86, RMSEP = 0.09 g l−1), while the IS provided the best results for TSS:TA (R2 = 82.20, RMSEP = 1.03), aril firmness (R2 = 68.40, RMSEP = 6.71 N), aril colour components (a* (R2 = 73.54, RMSEP = 1.67) and Chroma (R2 = 78.37, RMSEP = 2.31)). Good prediction was observed for both the models based on EH and IS data acquisition methods. However, better prediction performance was obtained with the model based on EH data acquisition method, resulting in accurate predictions of 8 quality parameters. This study demonstrated that FT-NIR and associated chemometric analysis can holistically evaluate the quality parameters of pomegranate arils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aaril 3aascorbic acid 3achemometrics 3acolor 3afirmness 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apH 3apomegranates 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 0aPunica granatum L. 0aFruit quality 0aNear infrared 0aPartial least squares 0aChemometrics1 aFawole, Olaniyi A.1 aMagwaza, Lembe S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9809-22541 aNieuwoudt, Helene H.1 aOpara, Umezuruike L.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2017 July, v. 159 p.22-32dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245009100160300002000251520149400271592002801765596010201793596010401895596005901999596007002058650001402128650001402142650001302156650001602169650001402185700005302199700001602252700001802268773015502286856008302441852000902524655001202533IND60730381520221118042753.0211029e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073038152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11627-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Wei10aEnvironmental noise and vibration characteristics of rubber-spring floating slab track  ap. 13671-13689.  aThe floating slab track is considered one of the most effective track structures to reduce the adverse effects of underground railway noise and vibration. This paper reports a new type of rubber-spring float track (RSFS), which adopts a well-designed rubber-spring vibration isolator and is conceptually designed as a float track structure. The dynamic performance of different track structures, namely RSFS track, fixed slab track, and transition section, were studied. Vibration response of the car body and the track structure was obtained. Internal noise from the train and external noise near the tracks were also recorded. The results show that the measured track structures can ensure the safety of train operation. Compared with the fixed plate track, the RSFS track has a good vibration isolation effect, and the RMS vibration reduction at the tunnel wall was 15.1 dB. However, it amplifies the vibration above the isolation layer and slightly increases the internal noise of the train. RSFS track structure should be evaluated comprehensively before implementation. In addition, the track stiffness has a significant impact on the vibration level of the track, thus affecting the vibration isolation effect. The noise distribution inside the train is not uniform and is not sensitive to the stiffness of the track structure.

However, it is unlikely that a single crisp number can capture a complex issue, such as the analysis of the sustainability of human progress both at the local and the global scale. This paper tackles this standard epistemological predicament in relation to a media-friendly model of man’s impact on Nature: the Ecological Footprint (EF). The claim made by the proponents of this analytical tool is that EF makes it possible to check “how much is taken” by the economic process versus “how much could be taken” according to ecological processes. In this paper we argue that the ecological footprint assessment – purportedly useful as an argument against the idea of perpetual growth – is fraught with internal contradictions. Our critical appraisal is based on the lack of correspondence between the semantics – the claim about what the EF accounting does – and the syntax – the EF protocol of accounting that should deliver the purported output. We critically examine the various assumptions used in the approach, showing that the EF is in contradiction with its stated purposes and would lead to paradoxes if its prescriptions were used for policy making. We also contend that the laboriousness of EF computation protocols contrasts with its ultimate fragility. In fact the estimate of carbon footprint due to energy production is what determines the assessment of the planet’s deficit of virtual land. We show that this estimate cannot be defended in light of the assumptions and simplifications used for its construction. Our conclusion is that the EF does not serve a meaningful discussion on the modeling of sustainability, and that the same media-friendly narrative about the Earth Overshot day is in the end reassuring and complacent when considering other aspects on man’s pressure on the planet and its ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amodels 0aEcological footprint 0aScience for governance 0aEcological economics 0aSustainability indicators 0aSustainable development 0aPost-Normal Science1 aSaltelli, Andrea0 tEcological indicators.g2014 Nov., v. 46 p.610-621dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010400170300001800274520100800292592002801300650001201328650001701340650003001357650002201387650001001409650001201419650001501431650001801446650001301464651001001477653001701487653001401504653001801518653001301536653001101549700002101560700002501581773013801606856008601744852000901830655001201839IND60753219520221120190054.0211012e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075321952DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2020.18615872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinghal, Vibha10aRole of religious beliefs of tribal communities from Jharkhand (India) in biodiversity conservation  ap. 2277-2299.  aJharkhand is one of the most biodiversity-enriched regions in India because of its origin and diverse physiographic and climatic conditions.

Traditional hemostatic materials such as bandages are not ideal for uncontrolled or incompressible bleeding. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a new medical biomaterial with excellent rapid hemostatic effect. Keratin is a natural, biocompatible and biodegradable protein which contains amino acid sequences that induce cell adhesion. As a potential biomedical material, keratin has been developed and paid attention in tissue engineering fields such as promoting wound healing and nerve repair. Herein, a keratin/chitosan (K/C) sponge was prepared to achieve rapid hemostasis. The characterizations of K/C sponge were investigated, including SEM, TGA, liquid absorption and porosity, showing that the high porosity up to 90.12 ± 2.17 % resulted in an excellent blood absorption. The cytotoxicity test and implantation experiment proved that the K/C sponge was biocompatible and biodegradable. Moreover, the prepared K/C sponge showed better hemostatic performance than chitosan sponge (CS) and the commercially available gelatin sponge in both rat tail amputation and liver trauma bleeding models. Further experiments showed that K/C sponge plays a hemostatic role through the endogenous coagulation pathway, thus shortening the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) effectively. Therefore, this study provided a K/C sponge which can be served as a promising biomedical hemostatic material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aamino acids 3aamputation 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3ablood 3acell adhesion 3achitosan 3acoagulation 3agelatin 3ahemostasis 3akeratin 3aliquids 3aliver 3amortality 3anerve tissue 3aporosity 3arats 3atail 3athromboplastin 3atoxicity testing 3atraffic 0aWool keratin 0aChitosan 0aK/C sponge 0aHemostatic biomaterial 0aBiocompatibility1 aXue, Dai1 aSu, Chang1 aXu, Yan1 aGong, Jin-Song1 aLiu, Yan-Ling1 aJiang, Min1 aGeng, Yan1 aLv, Guo-Zhong1 aXu, Zheng-Hong1 aShi, Jin-Song0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct., v. 218 p.112770-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1127703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245012400177300001600301520076500317592002801082650001401110650002501124650001201149650001801161650004201179650004001221650007501261650003801336700001501374700001601389700001801405700001401423700001401437700001501451700001301466700001401479700001501493700001301508773014201521852000901663856008201672655001201754IND4384725020221122145504.0200207e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438472502DNAL7 a166423322pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-006-0370-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, L.10aBioactive hydroxyphenylpyrrole-dicarboxylic acids from a new marine Halomonas sp.: production and structure elucidation  ap. 816-822.  aThe new marine Halomonas sp. strain GWS-BW-H8hM (DSM 17996) was found to produce 3-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-4-phenylpyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (HPPD-1) and 3,4-bis(4′-hydroxy- phenyl)pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (HPPD-2).

To obtain rapid separations, instruments are operated at high flow rates and high inlet pressure leading to uneven thermal effects across columns and additional time needed to restore thermal equilibrium between successive analyses. The purpose of this study is to investigate means to minimize thermal instability and obtain reliable results by measuring the reproducibility of the results of six replicate gradient separations of a nine component RPLC standard mixture under various experimental conditions with no post-run times. Gradient separations under different conditions were performed: constant flow rates, two sets of constant pressure operation, programmed flow constant pressure operation, and conditions which theoretically should yield a constant net heat loss at the column's wall. The results show that using constant flow rates, programmed flow constant pressures, and constant heat loss at the column's wall all provide reproducible separations. However, performing separations using a high constant pressure with programmed flow reduces the analysis time by 16% compared to constant flow rate methods. For the constant flow rate, programmed flow constant pressure, and constant wall heat experiments no equilibration time (post-run time) was required to obtain highly reproducible data  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aquantitative analysis 3athermal stability 0aConstant pressure liquid chromatography 0aReproducibility of peak areas 0aThermal equilibrium 0aProgrammed flow conditions1 aGritti, Fabrice1 aStevenson, Paul G.1 aBeaver, Lois A.1 aGuiochon, Georges0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 1325 p.99-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.11.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245015200206300001100358506007600369520154300445592002801988596007302016596009402089506003702183650001602220650001702236650001802253650002402271650001602295650003702311650001402348650000902362650001202371650002202383650002202405700001802427700001602445700001702461700001702478700001802495700002302513700005602536773009302592856008202685852000902767655001202776IND60645301920221207130810.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064530192DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-019-0297-72doi7 aPMC65365662pmcid7 a311343572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Myung Ki10aTwo Clade A Phosphatase 2Cs Expressed in Guard Cells Physically Interact With Abscisic Acid Signaling Components to Induce Stomatal Closure in Rice  ap. 37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The core ABA signaling components functioning in stomatal closure/opening, namely ABA receptors, phosphatases, SnRK2s and SLAC1, are well characterized in Arabidopsis, but their functions in guard cells of rice have not been extensively studied. RESULTS: In this study, we confirmed that OsSLAC1, the rice homolog of AtSLAC1, is specifically expressed in rice guard cells. Among the rice SAPKs, SAPK10 was specifically expressed in guard cells. In addition, SAPK10 phosphorylated OsSLAC1 in vitro and transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 or OsSLAC1 showed significantly less water loss than control. Thus, those might be major positive signaling components to close stomata in rice. We identified that only OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization. Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 showed significantly higher water loss than control. We also characterized the interaction networks between OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53, SAPK10 and OsSLAC1 and found two interaction pathways among those signaling components: a hierarchical interaction pathway that consisted of OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53, SAPK10 and OsSLAC1; and a branched interaction pathway wherein OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 interacted directly with OsSLAC1. CONCLUSION: OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C53 is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice. Those can regulate the OsSLAC1 directly or indirectly thorough SAPK10.  aPublisher supplied data  athe Agenda Program PJ01247602cRural Development Administration (KR)  athe Next Generation BioGreen 21 Program PJ01367601cRural Development Administration (KR)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aabscisic acid 3agene overexpression 3aguard cells 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3areceptors 3arice 3astomata 3astomatal movement 3atransgenic plants1 aChoi, Eun-Hye1 aKim, Jin-Ae1 aYoon, In Sun1 aHan, Seungsu1 aLee, Yeongmok1 aLee, S.q(Sangho),1 aKim, Beom-Gi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4887-17750 tRice.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.37-37dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-019-0297-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015300173300001600326520093700342592002801279650001201307650003201319650001301351650001201364650001201376650002301388650001401411650001001425650000901435650001801444650001101462650001401473650001501487700001901502700003401521773014001555856008101695852000901776655001201785IND60660664020221120073404.0190827e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066066402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-019-9042-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Samayita10aReduction of selenite to elemental Se(0) with simultaneous degradation of phenol by co-cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Delftia lacustris  ap. 738-747.  aThe simultaneous removal of phenol and selenite from synthetic wastewater was investigated by adopting two different co-culturing techniques using the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and the bacterium Delftia lacustris. Separately grown biomass of the fungus and the bacterium (suspended co-culture) was incubated with different concentrations of phenol (0–1,200 mg/L) and selenite (10 mg/L). The selenite ions were biologically reduced to extracellular Se(0) nanoparticles (3.58 nm diameter) with the simultaneous degradation of up to 800 mg/L of phenol. Upon growing the fungus and the bacterium together using an attached growth co-culture, the bacterium grew as a biofilm onto the fungus. The extracellularly produced Se(0) in the attached growth co-culture had a minimum diameter of 58.5 nm. This co-culture was able to degrade completely 50 mg/L phenol, but was completely inhibited at a phenol concentration of 200 mg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelftia 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3achemical reduction 3acoculture 3afungi 3aions 3ananoparticles 3aphenol 3aselenites 3awastewater1 aRene, Eldon R.1 aLens, P.

To fill the gap, this paper for the first time employs a hybrid method to evaluate the water footprint of gaming industry in water scarce Macao, based on the latest statistics and most exhaustive embodied water intensity databases. The results show that direct water use only accounts for extremely small fraction of the gaming industry's water footprint, indicating that the exchange of water embodied in product and service between different sectors is also a useful mean to satisfy individual sector's demand for water resources. As Macao's demand for water is growing, integrated plans including economic instruments and measures like reducing the scale of commission input and promoting efficiency would ease Macao's water pressure. Water footprint assessment in this study brings along new perspectives on gaming industry's water management and encourages wise use of goods, materials and services in a sustainable way.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aindustry 3astatistics 3avirtual water 3awater management 3awater resources 3aMacau 0aWater footprint 0aEconomic sector 0aGaming industry 0aMacao1 aChen, G.Q.0 tEcological indicators.g2014 Dec., v. 47 p.164-170dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04349naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002600178245014400204300001600348500001500364520166200379592002802041650000902069650002302078650002002101650002302121650001202144650001202156650001602168650002802184650004302212650002802255650001102283650001302294650002002307650000902327650005702336650002302393650003002416650007602446650002802522650007402550650001102624650002202635650003702657650001102694650001402705650002602719650000902745650001602754650002602770650003202796650002002828650001702848650002502865650003002890650001702920650002202937651001002959653001602969700002602985700002303011700002003034700001803054700002203072700002203094700002303116700002203139700002103161700002203182700001803204700001803222700002203240773009603262856009303358990002303451852000903474655001203483IND60088919420221116205643.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008891942DNAL7 a226955292pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizza, S.q(Stefano),10aAtherosclerosis severity but not undiagnosed diabetes predicts new cardiovascular events of subjects in secondary cardiovascular prevention  ap. 448-453.  a2019-12-06  aOBJECTIVE: Undiagnosed diabetes (DM2), especially in individuals that have experienced a major atherosclerotic vascular event, could increase the risk of a second major cardiovascular (CV) event. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of type 2 diabetes (DM2), diagnosed after a major cardiovascular event, on subsequent CV disease in high risk individuals. METHODS: 411 subjects without known DM2 and with a history of a prior major CV event were followed for a second major CV event (fatal and nonfatal MI, fatal and nonfatal stroke or any arterial revascularization procedure). At baseline, each individual underwent a physical, biochemical examination, an OGTT and dosed A1c. In addition, patients were classified as having monovascular or polyvascular disease. The average follow-up duration was 31 months. RESULTS: The incidence of second CV events was 10.70 per 100 person-years (114 events/1066 person-years). The diagnosis of occult DM2 was not associated with major CV events, either using A1c values ≥6.5%, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or 2 h post-load glucose ≥200 mg/dL. Polyvascular disease was the only significant predictor of a second major CV event (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.72–3.95) after adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: DM2 that was newly diagnosed after established vascular atherosclerotic disease did not increase the risk of new major CV events. In our population only the polyvascular disease was able to identify the subjects at high risk for a second major cardiovascular event.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aC-reactive protein 3aatherosclerosis 3aat-risk population 3aglucose 3afasting 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3asystolic blood pressure 3astroke 3apatients 3abody mass index 2aAged 2aAtherosclerosisxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aKaplan-Meier Estimate 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSecondary Prevention 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Failure 0aItaly 0arisk groups1 aCopetti, Massimiliano1 aCardellini, Marina1 aPorzio, Ottavia1 aLuzi, Alessio1 aPecchioli, Chiara1 aMartelli, Eugenio1 aValentini, Alessia1 aIppoliti, Arnaldo1 aRomeo, Francesco1 aPellegrini, Fabio1 aLauro, Davide1 aLauro, Renato1 aFederici, Massimo0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Aug., v. 223, no. 2 p.448-453dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.04.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245009900178300001400277520153200291592002801823650001301851650001401864650001001878650001201888650001101900650002201911650001501933650001201948650002101960650001501981650001901996650000902015650001202024650001902036651001402055653001402069653001402083653002502097653003802122700001902160700001702179773010502196856008402301852000902385655001202394IND60562979120221119061224.0180905e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056297912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaréchal, Jean-Philippe12aA simple, fast, and reliable method to predict Sargassum washing ashore in the Lesser Antilles  ap. 54-63.  aSince 2011, the Lesser Antilles have faced major events of the washing ashore of pelagic Sargassum. Windward, exposed island coasts receive tons of algae that alter the quality of coastal ecosystems and the environment. The events repeated in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016. A major concern for local governments is to predict arriving floating algae and assess the risk of washing ashore. Here, we present a method to use a Sargassum Watch System (SaWS), based on satellite imagery and numerically-modelled surface currents, for near-real-time tracking of floating algae in the central Atlantic. The analysis of satellite data and numerical HYCOM surface ocean currents was used to predict washing ashore events days before they occur. These online products are integrated and made available to users in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format and uploaded in Google Earth. Tracking of Sargassum slicks, combined with distance from coast and HYCOM current vectors’ direction and speed, can provide an effective prediction tool for possible washing-ashore in specific locations. Comparisons of events between the years 2011 and 2015 show some intensification of the presence of Sargassum in the western Atlantic and a significant increase in the risk of Sargassum washing ashore on the beaches of small islands. The demonstration using simple analyses of existing near real-time online products provides a template for governmental agencies and environmental groups to use, effectively, existing resources towards coastal management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aSargassum 3aalgae 3abeaches 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3aecosystems 3aislands 3alocal government 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3awashing 3awater currents 3aCaribbean 0aSargassum 0aCaribbean 0aEarly warning alerts 0aNear real-time satellite products1 aHellio, Claire1 aHu, Chuanmin0 tRemote sensing applications.g2017 Jan., v. 5 p.54-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245009600202300001100298500001100309520152800320592002801848596002201876650002401898650001901922650001401941650001501955650001301970650001501983650001501998650000902013650001502022700002002037700001802057700002702075700001802102700002002120773013302140856008202273852000902355655001202364IND60645302120221122050057.0200405e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064530212DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-019-0213-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunke, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1148-764610aDevelopments in society and implications for emerging pollutants in the aquatic environment  ap. 32.  aReview  aPollutant emissions in river basins may be subject to change. How can we succeed in predicting future pollutant emissions and risks? The approach presented here is based on the hypothesis that the existing scenarios on developments in society may provide useful indications on future pollutants. To begin with, the results of four societal scenario-based analyses showed that some developments are directly connected to consumption and the emission of specific substances. Second, it appeared that the effects of other development scenarios are more complex, such as those associated with climate change. Quantitative statements with regard to the implications of such scenarios on future pollutants can be particularly difficult. A third important group of changes are technological developments. Frequently observed changes in this respect are substitutions of problematic substances by substances with a similar structure. When the pollutant consequences of future development scenarios are taken together it will be possible to explore political, societal, or technical mitigation efforts which can be undertaken now or in the near future to counteract the effects of developments that are considered as extremely hazardous for man and the environment. Thereby, a careful monitoring of developments in society can help to develop appropriate strategies which should include preemptive emission and impact reduction efforts. Finally, we developed recommendations how to manage future emerging pollutants in river basins.  aPublisher supplied data  a603437cSOLUTIONS 3aaquatic environment 3aclimate change 3aemissions 3amonitoring 3apolitics 3apollutants 3aprediction 3arisk 3awatersheds1 aMoritz, Susanne1 aBrack, Werner1 aHerráez, David López1 aPosthuma, Leo1 aNuss, Margarita0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2019 Dec., v. 31, no. 1 p.32-32dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-019-0213-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245009700186300001600283520114900299592002801448650003101476650002101507650002501528650001701553650002101570650001201591650002201603650001301625650001301638650001101651650001801662650001701680650004601697650007601743650003101819650004201850650004501892650002501937650001101962650002401973650002901997700002302026700002302049700001902072700002002091773014202111852000902253856008202262655001202344IND60438634120221120115233.0200310e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043863412DNAL7 a173478202pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-007-0879-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimura, Taku10aAnaerobic growth of Corynebacterium glutamicum using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor  ap. 889-897.  aCorynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive soil bacterium, has been regarded as an aerobe because its growth by fermentative catabolism or by anaerobic respiration has, to this date, not been demonstrated. In this study, we report on the anaerobic growth of C. glutamicum in the presence of nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor. C. glutamicum strains R and ATCC13032 consumed nitrate and excreted nitrite during growth under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions. This was attributed to the presence of a narKGHJI gene cluster with high similarity to the Escherichia colinarK gene and narGHJI operon. The gene encodes a nitrate/nitrite transporter, whereas the operon encodes a respiratory nitrate reductase. Transposonal inactivation of C. glutamicumnarG or narH resulted in mutants with impaired anaerobic growth on nitrate because of their inability to convert nitrate to nitrite. Further analysis revealed that in C. glutamicum, narK and narGHJI are cotranscribed as a single narKGHJI operon, the expression of which is activated under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate. C. glutamicum is therefore a facultative anaerobe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aEscherichia coli 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanaerobiosis 3amultigene family 3amutants 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoperon 3asoil bacteria 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCorynebacterium glutamicumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aNitrate Reductasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aOperon 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics1 aVertès, Alain A.,1 aShinoda, Yoshifumi1 aInui, Masayuki1 aYukawa, Hideaki0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2007 June, v. 75, no. 4 p.889-897dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-007-0879-y3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02193naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167300001800308520107500326592002801401650002101429650002501450650001901475650001401494651001001508653001701518653001801535653003501553653002001588653001401608773013801622856008601760852000901846655001201855IND60753219820221120190101.0211012e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075321982DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2021.18725092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Rong10aCoordination, harmonization or prioritization in environmental policy integration: evidence from the case in Chongming eco-island, China  ap. 2365-2385.  aThis paper studies environmental policy integration (EPI) in eco-city/island, building an empirical model to quantify EPI levels based on decoupling analysis. EPI integration levels have been highlighted but have seldom been quantitatively probed in existing academia. It attempts to identify whether EPI, especially its prioritization, is approached in Chongming eco-city/island and identify the factors for it to be achieved. The four-quadrant decoupling model is applied and further operationalized temporally and spatially. Results show that Chongming had a strong prioritized EPI in four consecutive years in the examined years of 2012–2018 despite fluctuations in integration levels. Spatially in its 18 towns, 7 towns have prioritized EPI and one has strongly prioritized EPI, indicating optimistic empirical evidence for an eco-city/island. Contributing factors are discussed, such as EPI levels embodied in the distributed spatiality and time intervals, isolated bounded spatiality and functional symbiosis, and offsetting high costs with multi-level support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical models 3aenvironmental policy 3aprioritization 3asymbiosis 3aChina 0acoordination 0aharmonization 0aenvironment policy integration 0aeco-city/island 0aChongming0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 64, no. 13 p.2365-2385dRoutledgewJournal:12206x1360-05597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2021.18725093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015700163500001900320520125200339592002801591650002801619650000801647650001501655650002001670650003101690650001701721650002101738650001901759653002301778653005401801653001601855653001401871700001901885700001601904700001701920700001701937773011301954856008202067852000902149655001202158IND60721154820221119215019.0210212e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072115482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2020.1078902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hong10aPositively charged Ag@Au core-shell nanoparticles as highly stable and enhanced fluorescence quenching platform for one-step nuclease activity detection  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aS1 nuclease plays an important role in DNA transcription, recombination and repair. Here, we synthesized a positively charged Ag@Au core-shell nanoparticles ((+)Ag@Au CSNPs) and used as highly stable and enhanced fluorescence quenching platform for one-step S1 nuclease activity detection. In the sensor, fluorophore labeled DNA was used as signal probe and its fluorescence signal could be effectively quenched based on the electrostatic interaction of it with (+)Ag@Au CSNPs. In the presence of S1 nuclease, DNA probe was hydrolyzed into DNA fragments and cannot interact with (+)Ag@Au CSNPs, inducing an obvious fluorescence signal increase that was proportional with S1 nuclease concentration in the range of 2.5 × 10⁻⁴–3.0 × 10⁻² U/mL. The enhanced quenching efficiency of (+)Ag@Au CSNPs paved the way for sensitive S1 detection with a detection limit of 6.0 × 10⁻⁵ U/mL. Moreover, the high stability of such nanocomposite can achieve the one-step detection of S1 in complex solution containing salt, protein or other metal ions. In addition, the method also exhibited high selectivity for nuclease detection, making our sensing platform has a potential application value in bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus nuclease S1 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3adetection limit 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ananocomposites 0aFluorescent sensor 0aPositively charged Ag@Au core-shell nanoparticles 0aS1 nuclease 0aDNA probe1 aCheng, Chuance1 aDong, Nalin1 aJi, Xiaoming1 aHu, Jiandong0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2021 Mar., v. 167 p.107890-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.1078903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245010800197500002000305520173000325592002802055596008402083596005502167650001402222650001402236650001602250650001402266650001502280650002402295650001302319650001502332651002202347700005302369700005302422700002102475700005502496700001502551700005502566773013702621856007702758852000902835655001202844IND60789828620221120091543.0220822e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078982862DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0174752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStegner, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7882-493X10aCyclone‐Anticyclone Asymmetry of Eddy Detection on Gridded Altimetry Product in the Mediterranean Sea  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe perform an Observing System Simulation Experiment that simulates the satellite sampling and the mapping procedure on the sea surface of the high‐resolution model CROCO‐MED60v40, to investigate the reliability and the accuracy of the eddy detection. The main result of this study is a strong cyclone‐anticyclone asymmetry of the eddy detection on the altimetry products AVISO/CMEMS in the Mediterranean Sea. Large‐scale cyclones having a characteristic radius larger than the local deformation radius are much less reliable than large‐scale anticyclones. We estimate that less than 60% of these cyclones detected on gridded altimetry product are reliable, while more than 85% of mesoscale anticyclones are reliable. Besides, both the barycenter and the size of these mesoscale anticyclones are relatively accurate. This asymmetry comes from the difference of stability between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Large mesoscale cyclones often split into smaller sub‐mesoscale structures having a rapid dynamical evolution. The numerical model CROCO‐MED60v40 shows that this complex dynamic is too fast and too small to be accurately captured by the gridded altimetry products. The spatio‐temporal interpolation smoothes out this sub‐mesoscale dynamics and tends to generate an excessive number of unrealistic mesoscale cyclones in comparison with the reference field. On the other hand, large mesoscale anticyclones, which are more robust and which evolve more slowly, can be accurately tracked by standard altimetry products. We also confirm that the AVISO/CMEMS products induce a bias on the eddy intensity. The azimuthal geostrophic velocities are always underestimated for large mesoscale anticyclones.  aPublisher supplied data  aCP1801cFrench Ministry of Defense | Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA)  a2019650069004707501cAgency Innovation and Defense 3aaltimetry 3aasymmetry 3adeformation 3aevolution 3ageophysics 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3asatellites 3aMediterranean Sea1 aLe Vu, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3844-24211 aDumas, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2144-95041 aGhannami, M.

Fermentable sugars could only be produced through pretreatment and hydrolysis processes, but furan and phenolic derivatives occurring in the lignocellulosic hydrolysate would inhibit cells’ growth and final butanol production capability. Compared to reported solventogenic Clostridia, the newly isolated Clostridium sp. strain LJ4 possessed high tolerance towards furan derivatives. Genes of sdr4, sdr1, akr, fmn and ad2 in strain LJ4 may play key roles in the bioconversion of furan derivatives based on the transcriptional levels’ analysis. As the phenolic derivatives containing in the undetoxified corncob hydrolysate were higher than the limited tolerance of strain LJ4, an electrochemical detoxification method was accordingly adopted to reduce the toxicity of phenolic derivatives without the loss of reducing sugars and generation of by-products. After 24 h detoxification of acid treated corncob hydrolysate, the phenolic compounds were decreased by nearly 40%, and 4.7 g/L of butanol was finally produced by strain LJ4 with 1.6-fold improvement than that from the un-detoxified corncob hydrolysate. Electrochemical technique could become a promising approach for biofuels or biochemicals production from undetoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysate owing to its high removal efficiency of phenolic derivatives without sugar loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3abiofuels 3abiotransformation 3abutanol 3acorn cobs 3aelectrochemistry 3afeedstocks 3afurans 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCorncob hydrolysate 0aElectrochemical detoxification1 aXu, Bin1 aYan, Wei1 aLiu, Jie1 aDong, Weiliang1 aZhou, Jie1 aZhang, Wenming1 aXin, Fengxue1 aJiang, Min0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2021 Mar., v. 167 p.107891-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2020.1078913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011300173300001600286520133700302592002801639650002001667650001501687650002501702650002501727650001401752650002101766650001101787650001301798650001401811650001601825651001401841653001001855653000901865653000801874653001001882653000901892653000901901653003101910653004601941653002001987653002602007653002002033700006002053773010002113856008602213852000902299655001202308IND60537973220221116141152.0190412e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053797322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDizdaroglu, Didem12aA parcel-scale assessment tool to measure sustainability through urban ecosystem components: The MUSIX model  ap. 115-130.  aIn recent years a number of urban sustainability assessment frameworks are developed to better inform policy formulation and decision-making processes. This paper introduces one of these attempts in developing a comprehensive assessment tool—i.e., Micro-level Urban-ecosystem Sustainability IndeX (MUSIX). Being an indicator-based indexing model, MUSIX investigates the environmental impacts of land-uses on urban sustainability by measuring urban ecosystem components in local scale. The paper presents the methodology of MUSIX and demonstrates the performance of the model in a pilot test-bed—i.e., in Gold Coast, Australia. The model provides useful insights on the sustainability performance of the test-bed area. The parcel-scale findings of the indicators are used to identify local problems considering six main issues of urban development—i.e., hydrology; ecology; pollution; location; design, and; efficiency. The composite index score is used to propose betterment strategies to guide the development of local area plans in conjunction with the City's Planning Scheme. In overall, this study has shown that parcel-scale environmental data provides an overview of the local sustainability in urban areas as in the example of Gold Coast, which can also be used for setting environmental policy, objectives and targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental policy 3ahydrology 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aplanning 3apollution 3aurban areas 3aAustralia 0aDPSIR 0aFEEM 0aGCC 0aMUSIX 0aOECD 0aNDAI 0aUrban ecosystem components 0aIndicator-based sustainability assessment 0aComposite index 0aParcel-scale analysis 0aGold Coast City1 aYigitcanlar, Tan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7262-71180 tEcological indicators.g2014 June, v. 41 p.115-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005500092040001800147072000900165072000900174100001900183245016200202300001400364500002400378500002300402500001500425520136600440650002101806650001601827650001701843650001401860650001701874650002301891650002201914650002201936650001301958650001301971650002501984651001102009653003202020653001802052653002602070653001102096700001802107700001902125773013702144852000902281856010502290930003302395945002502428946001302453655001202466IND4401727320221120172907.0080221e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440172732DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2008)101[58:SATVOM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL0011 aJay-Robert, P.10aSpatial and Temporal Variation of Mountain Dung Beetle Assemblages and Their Relationships with Environmental Factors (Aphodiinae: Geotrupinae: Scarabaeinae)  ap. 58-69.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aThe analysis of a large census of dung beetles from the southern Alps (108 samples; 85,478 specimens belonging to 59 species) showed that 1) elevation and vegetation type (Mediterranean versus temperate) greatly influenced the assemblage composition, 2) spatial factors have a greater effect than monthly variability, and 3) exposure (north versus south) is a stronger determinant than vegetation structure (grassland-semi-open habitat-forest). Environmental heterogeneity results in different assemblages dominated by related species: Scarabaeinae dominate during spring and summer on south-facing nonwooded habitats; and Aphodiinae dominate from spring to autumn on north-facing slopes and in forests, but on south-facing slopes only in autumn. Scarabaeinae species have similar spatiotemporal distributions; thus, it can be assumed that this subfamily is restricted in space and time by thermal sensitivity. The colonization of high elevations by small tunnelers is due to a few species that have a broad tolerance of environmental conditions. In contrast, the temporal distribution of Aphodiinae is highly segregated, and these beetles occupy a variety of habitats because of their specialization. Analysis shows the distribution of species belonging to different subfamilies is most related to biological requirements rather than interspecific competition. 3avegetation types 3aGeotrupidae 3adung beetles 3amountains 3aScarabaeidae 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies diversity 3aspatial variation 3aaltitude 3ahabitats 3avegetation structure 3aFrance 0aenvironmental heterogeneity 0asouthern Alps 0aenvironmental factors 0aaspect1 aLumaret, J.P.1 aLebreton, J.D.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2008 Jan., v. 101, no. 1 p.58-69dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2008)101[58:SATVOM]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080505b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle02810naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013900171300001800310520103400328536027101362592002801633650001101661650001301672650001501685650002201700650001701722650002201739651001201761651002801773651001201801653002701813653003901840653002901879653002701908653001901935700001901954700002101973700001901994700002402013700002002037700001602057700002202073773013802095856008602233852000902319655001202328IND60753220120221120153712.0211012e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075322012DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2021.18748932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShkaruba, Anton10aDevelopment of sustainable urban drainage systems in Eastern Europe: an analytical overview of the constraints and enabling conditions  ap. 2435-2458.  aWe focused on the barriers to the implementation of enabling environments for sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Based on interviews and desktop research, we analyzed overall framework conditions in these countries as well as implementation practices in three cities. Our findings demonstrate that the main problem was the deficit of strategic foresight for urban development. SUDS are mostly promoted by NGOs and fueled by international donors, and this represents a major barrier to their implementation, as NGOs and ‘traditional’ epistemic communities are often not connected. Successful examples of SUDS are missing, often due to regulatory environments forcing SUDS development teams to take suboptimal decisions. In order to be taken seriously by key stakeholders SUDS need to appear in national policy documents. Furthermore, the overall successful implementation of SUDS needs robust governance frameworks while many structural issues are direct results of governance deficits.  aThe paper was prepared within the framework of a project co-financed by the Governments of Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia through International Visegrad Fund (grant No. 21730160), and Erasmus+ Jean Monnet project INENCY (587868-EPP-1-2017-1-UA-EPPJMO-MODULE).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3adrainage 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3astakeholders 3aurban development 3aBelarus 3aEastern European region 3aUkraine 0anature-based solutions 0asustainable urban drainage systems 0aenvironmental innovation 0aenvironmental planning 0aEastern Europe1 aSkryhan, Hanna1 aLikhacheva, Olga1 aKatona, Attila1 aMaryskevych, Oksana1 aKireyeu, Viktar1 aSepp, Kalev1 aShpakivska, Iryna0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 64, no. 13 p.2435-2458dRoutledgewJournal:12206x1360-05597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2021.18748933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007600165500002200241520167000263592002801933650001301961650001801974650001701992650002002009650001502029650001502044650001802059653001802077653002802095653001402123653002102137653001802158653002402176653000902200653000802209653000702217653000702224700001302231700001502244700005302259773031902312856008502631852000902716655001202725IND60788900120221121234133.0220906e20220803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078890012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Qiang10aVitamin D and heart failure: A two-sample mendelian randomization study  aPre-press version  aThe relationship between vitamin D and heart failure (HF) has attracted significant interest, but the association between the two in previous studies remains uncertain. Therefore, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate a causal association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and HF risk. This study utilized summary statistics from the most extensive genome-wide association studies for 25OHD and HF. To make the results more reliable, we used several methods based on three assumptions for MR analysis. We also used the multivariable MR adjusting for hypertension, BMI, diabetes, chronic kidney disease to further elucidate the association between 25OHD and HF. Considering the potential pleiotropy, we performed an MR analysis with conditionally independent genetic instruments at core genes to further determine the relationship between vitamin D and heart failure. We found that per 1 SD increase in standardized log-transformed 25OHD level, the relative risk of HF decreased by 16.5% (OR: 0.835, 95% Cl: 0.743–0.938, P = 0.002), and other MR methods also showed consistent results. The multivariable MR also reported that per 1 SD increase in standardized log-transformed 25OHD level, the relative risk of HF decreased. And the scatter plots showed a trend towards an inverse MR association between 25OHD levels, instrumented by the core 25OHD genes, and HF. In summary, we found a potential inverse association between elevated 25OHD levels and the risk of HF, which suggested that timely 25OHD supplementation or maintaining adequate 25OHD concentrations may be an essential measure for HF prevention in the general population.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3aheart failure 3ahypertension 3akidney diseases 3ametabolism 3apleiotropy 3arelative risk 0aHeart failure 0aMendelian randomization 0aVitamin D 0aCausal inference 0aHeart failure 0a25-hydroxyvitamin D 0aGWAS 0aIVW 0aMR 0aOR1 aYan, Wei1 aNie, Qiong1 aHan, Wang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1123-40860 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Aug. 03, dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010700155300002000262520121300282592002801495650003601523650002301559650001701582650001501599650001401614650002701628650001601655650002201671650001801693650002001711650002401731650002001755650002501775650001401800650001701814700001101831700001401842700001301856700001901869773012401888856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60642056120221118025632.0190506e20170707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064205612DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06457h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bing10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of novel neoflavonoid derivatives as potential antidiabetic agents  ap. 34448-34460.  aVarious substituted neoflavonoid derivatives were synthesized using sulfated montmorillonite K-10 as a catalyst. This method is environmental friendly, sustainable and economical, convenient in isolation and purification processes, with little byproducts, using earth-abundant catalysts and has relatively high yield. Those neoflavonoid derivatives were screened for antioxidant, a-glucosidase inhibitory, aldose reductase 2 (ALR2) inhibitory and advanced glycation end-product formation inhibitory effects. Most compounds exhibited significant antioxidant and advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation inhibitory activities. It was interesting to note that out of thirty compounds, 8k and 8l were found to have greater ALR2 inhibitory activity than the standard drug quercetin. The pharmacological studies suggested neoflavonoid with adjacent 7,8-dihydroxy groups were more effective in inhibiting ALR2. Antidiabetic activity studies had shown that compounds 8l and 8m were equipotent to the standard drug glibenclamide in vivo. In summary, the target compound 8l provided a potential drug design concept for the development of therapeutic or prophylactic agents of diabetes and diabetes complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aaldehyde reductase 3aantioxidants 3abyproducts 3acatalysts 3adiabetic complications 3adrug design 3aenzyme inhibition 3aglibenclamide 3aglycemic effect 3ahypoglycemic agents 3amontmorillonite 3apurification methods 3aquercetin 3atherapeutics1 aLi, Na1 aLiu, Teng1 aSun, Jie1 aWang, Xiaojing0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 07, v. 7, no. 55 p.34448-34460dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06457h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009900159520177100258592002802029650003102057650001202088650002102100650001702121650001502138700003402153700002502187700002702212700002702239700002002266700001702286700002002303773012002323856007302443852000902516655001202525IND60674591520221119121113.0191025e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067459152DNAL7 a10.3390/w111020972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Chetan 10aModified Approach to Reduce GCM Bias in Downscaled Precipitation: A Study in Ganga River Basin  aReanalysis data is widely used to develop predictor-predictand models, which are further used to downscale coarse gridded general circulation models (GCM) data at a local scale. However, large variability in the downscaled product using different GCMs is still a big challenge. The first objective of this study was to assess the performance of reanalysis data to downscale precipitation using different GCMs. High bias in downscaled precipitation was observed using different GCMs, so a different downscaling approach is proposed in which historical data of GCM was used to develop a predictor-predictand model. The earlier approach is termed &ldquo;Re-Obs&rdquo; and the proposed approach as &ldquo;GCM-Obs&rdquo;. Both models were assessed using mathematical derivation and generated synthetic series. The intermodal bias in different GCMs downscaled precipitation using Re-Obs and GCM-Obs model was also checked. Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project-5 (CMIP5) data of ten different GCMs was used to downscale precipitation in different urbanized, rural, and forest regions in the Ganga river basin. Different measures were used to represent the relative performances of one downscaling approach over other approach in terms of closeness of downscaled precipitation with observed precipitation and reduction of bias using different GCMs. The effect of GCM spatial resolution in downscaling was also checked. The model performance, convergence, and skill score were computed to assess the ability of GCM-Obs and Re-Obs models. The proposed GCM-Obs model was found better than Re-Obs model to statistically downscale GCM. It was observed that GCM-Obs model was able to reduce GCM-Observed and GCM-GCM bias in the downscaled precipitation in the Ganga river basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aforests 3amodel validation 3aurbanization 3awatersheds1 aOjha, Chandra  Shekhar Prasad1 aShukla, Anoop Kumar,1 aPhạm, Quó̂c Bảo,1 aLinh, Nguyen  Thi Thuy1 aFai, Chow  Ming1 aLoc, Ho  Huu1 aDung, Tran  Duc0 tWater.g2019 Oct. 08, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w111020973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04081naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009800168500002200266520297800288592002803266653002503294653000703319653002703326653003803353653001003391653006603401653001303467700001903480700001803499700005703517773007603574856008403650852000903734655001203743IND60562979620221119061219.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056297962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yclnex.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, Ibrahim10aAntisecretory Factor (AF) egg-yolk peptides reflects the intake of AF-activating feed in hens  aPre-press version  aThe aim of the present investigation was to determine the level of the active form of the endogenous protein Antisecretory Factor (actAF), and also the active form of AF immunoreactive molecules in the affinity purified egg yolk.Determination of AF in affinity purified egg yolk by means of in vivo and in vitro methods.Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Chalmers University of Technology, both units located in Gothenburg, Sweden.

The ligated loop is some 12-15 cm long and placed on the mid part of jejunum, and the cholera toxin induced secretion is registered after a 5 hours long challenge period.b/ The indirect ELISA method demonstrates the relative concentration of immunogenic AF peptides/AF-16 peptides and also related immunoreactive compounds by means of absorbance values, while the values of the competitive immunoassay represent the concentration of AF-16 peptides including similar immunoreactive peptides in ng/ml.c/ The MALDI-MS method provide information about the concentration of the AF-16 peptide down to nanogram per ml. levels after mass spectrometry analysis of the sample.All methods revealed similar results by demonstrating a continuous increase over time in the collected egg yolk samples. Thus, low AF activity was registered in egg yolk collected in the period of 1-10 weeks of AF-stimulated feeding, significantly higher AF values was registered in yolk collected between 10-15 weeks of feeding, while maximal AF concentration was determined after 15 weeks of feeding. Thus, in the period between 15-18 weeks of stimulated AF-feeding, no further increase of the endogenous AF activity could be registered despite continuous AF-stimulated feeding.During the period of AF-stimulated feeding of the egg laying hens the registration of AF concentration in the affinity purified egg yolk samples must be continuously registered over time The various methods used for determination of AF concentration in the affinity purified egg yolk might all serve as tools in order to achieve the optimal concentration of active AF. Together, these methods will provide information about the optimal AF concentration in the final product consisting of spray dried egg yolk (Salovum®) used for disease treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntisecretory Factor 0aAF 0aRat ligated loop assay 0aEnzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay 0aELISA 0aMatrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry 0aMALDI-MS1 aJohansson, Ewa1 aLange, Stefan1 aMalmberg, Per1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6487-78510 tClinical Nutrition Experimental.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx2352-93937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yclnex.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245006600179300001600245520128900261536036301550592002801913650003601941650001601977650002001993650002702013650003102040650001502071650001902086650001002105650001302115653002302128653002102151653002302172653002902195700001902224700003102243700003602274700002702310700003102337700002902368773013802397856008602535852000902621655001202630IND60753220220221120153636.0211105e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075322022DNAL7 a10.1080/09670874.2020.17507392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Ézio Marques10aSampling plan of Tetranychus mexicanus on passion fruit vines  ap. 269-278.  aSampling plans are essential components to establish decision-making systems for integrated pest management (IPM) programs. Thus, this study was aimed to develop a conventional sampling plan of Tetranychus mexicanus (McGregor) (Tetranychidae) on the yellow passion fruit Passiflora edulis. The work was conducted in nine passion fruit fields with plants at the reproductive stage. Our results indicated that the sample, ideal area, and the technique for the evaluation of the mites in passion fruit were the second and third most apical leaves on the branches, the leaf blade on the abaxial surface near the petiole, and the directly counting the mites using a hand lens with 10× magnification, respectively. The density of T. mexicanus was adjusted to a negative binomial frequency distribution, and they present a common aggregation parameter (Kcₒₘₘₒₙ = 0.5176), which made it possible to generate a sampling plan. The sampling plan consisted of 52 samples per field that took 39 minutes, and the cost of US $6.73 per sampling, respectively. Thus, the sampling plan developed in this study can be used by farmers in management programs for T. mexicanus in passion fruit crops by facilitating the accurate, representative and feasible sampling of this pest at the plant.  aWe acknowledge National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq), Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), Minas Gerais State Research Foundation (FAPEMIG), Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa e à Inovação Tecnológica (FAPITEC) and Banco do Nordeste do Brasil (BNB) for the scholarships and resources granted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPassiflora edulis f. flavicarpa 3aTetranychus 3adecision making 3afrequency distribution 3aintegrated pest management 3aleaf blade 3apassion fruits 3apests 3apetioles 0aPassion fruit mite 0aPassiflora eduli 0asampling technique 0astatistical distribution1 aBacci, Leandro1 aPicanço, Marcelo Coutinho1 aGonring, Alfredo Henrique Rocha1 aNeves, Leonarda Grillo1 ada Silva, Ricardo Siqueira1 aMartins, Júlio Cláudio0 tInternational journal of pest management.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 67, no. 4 p.269-278dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl50013x1366-58637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670874.2020.17507393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004200151245014100193300001600334520118300350592002801533650002101561650002501582650002101607650001101628650001701639650001801656650001801674650002001692650001401712650001501726650002301741650003201764650001901796650001201815650002201827650001401849650000701863650002601870650001601896650001001912650002201922650001601944650001201960653003901972653002202011653001302033653001402046653001002060653002602070700002402096700002002120700001802140773008502158856008502243852000902328655001202337IND60554107120221120072442.0161024e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055410712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalīḥābādī, Farruk̲h̲ Jamāl,12aA Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor from Butea monosperma seed and its influence on developmental physiology of Helicoverpa armigera  ap. 311-316.  aA protease inhibitor from the seeds of Butea monosperma (BmPI) was purified, characterized and studied for its influence on developmental physiology of Helicoverpa armigera. BmPI on two-dimensional separations indicated the presence of a 14kDa protein with an isoelectric point in the acidic region (pI 5.6). Multiple Sequence Analysis data suggested that the BmPI contains a sequence motif which is conserved in various trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors of Kunitz-type. The inhibitor exhibited trypsin inhibitory activity in a broad range of pH (4–10) and temperature (10–80°C). The enzyme kinetic studies revealed BmPI as a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 1.2×10−9M.In vitro studies with BmPI indicated measurable inhibitory activity on total gut proteolytic enzymes of H. armigera (IC50 2.0μg/ml) and bovine trypsin. BmPI supplemented artificial diet caused dose dependent mortality and reduction in growth and weight. The fertility and fecundity of H. armigera, declined whereas the larval–pupal duration of the insect life cycle extended. These detrimental effects on H. armigera suggest the usefulness of BmPI in insect pest management of food crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aButea monosperma 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aartificial diets 3acattle 3achymotrypsin 3adata analysis 3adose response 3aenzyme kinetics 3afecundity 3afood crops 3agrowth retardation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsect control 3ainsects 3aisoelectric point 3amortality 3apH 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteolysis 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atrypsin 0aHelicoverpa armigera gut proteases 0aTrypsin inhibitor 0aKinetics 0aStability 0aBLAST 0aKunitz-type inhibitor1 aPandey, Prabhash K.1 aSingh, Dushyant1 aAhmed, Wareed0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2015 Feb., v. 50 p.311-316dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008600162300001800248520133900266592002801605650002501633650001201658650002701670650004101697650002001738650001801758650001101776650001901787650001301806650002101819650004401840650001901884650001301903650001101916700001501927700002401942700001601966700002201982773012502004856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60663153420221118123019.0190909e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066315342DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc01314c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandt, Agnieszka10aStructural changes in lignins isolated using an acidic ionic liquid water mixture  ap. 5019-5034.  aRecently, acidic ionic liquid water mixtures based on the hydrogen sulfate anion have been shown to effectively extract lignin from lignocellulosic biomass. This study analyses Miscanthus giganteus lignin isolated after extraction with the protic ionic liquid 1-butylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([HC₄im][HSO₄]) followed by precipitation with the antisolvent water. Several analytical techniques were employed, such as quantitative ¹³C-NMR, ¹H–¹³C HSQC NMR, ³¹P-NMR, Py-GC-MS, GPC and elemental analysis. The analysis shows that the ionic liquid pretreatment breaks lignin-hemicellulose linkages and depolymerizes the lignin through the cleavage of glycosidic, ester and β-O-4 ether bonds. This is accompanied by solubilization of the newly generated lignin fragments. At longer pretreatment times, repolymerization of lignin fragments through condensation reactions occurs. The isolated lignins were carbohydrate-free, had low sulfur contents, low molecular weights. Early stage lignins were structurally similar to ball-milled lignin, while more treated lignins were enriched in p-hydroxyphenyl and guaiacyl units and had a high phenolic hydroxyl group content. We conclude that, depending on the treatment conditions, lignins with a variety of characteristics can be isolated using this type of ionic liquid solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3abiomass 3acondensation reactions 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolubilization 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aChen, Long1 avan Dongen, Bart E.1 aWelton, Tom1 aHallett, Jason P.0 tGreen chemistry.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 17, no. 11 p.5019-5034dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5gc01314c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165300001600314520178500330592002802115650002102143650001602164650001102180650001802191650001302209650003102222650004202253650001802295650001502313650001602328650001702344650001402361650001202375650001902387650001302406650001302419650002402432650001102456650001802467650001102485650001202496650002502508650002902533650001802562650001302580700001302593700001702606700001702623700001802640700001802658700001902676773013002695856008102825852000902906655001202915IND60645302720221122041714.0190528e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064530272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-019-0015-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, He-Xun10aCharacterization of Cucurbita maxima Fruit Metabolomic Profiling and Transcriptome to Reveal Fruit Quality and Ripening Gene Expression Patterns  ap. 203-216.  aPumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) fruit is the important dietary source of carotenoid and is known for the good flavour and texture due to the accumulation of sugar and starch. However, lack of transcriptional information hinders our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying fruit quality attributes and nutrition in C. maxima. To provide insight into transcriptional regulation of fruit quality formation of C. maxima, quality analysis and high-throughput RNA sequencing of fruits at different developing stages were characterized. The quality analyses consist of dry matter values, percent soluble solids, carotenoid contents, and starch and sugar contents in seven stages of fruit development. Fruit transcriptome of C. maxima at five stages throughout development was assembled to elucidate the molecular regulation of fruit development. Almost 18 billion nucleotide bases were sequenced in total, and 48,471 unigenes were detected. A total of 32,397 (66.8%) unigenes were identified to be differentially expressed. We found there was a correlation between ripening-associated transcripts and metabolites and the functions of regulating genes. KEGG analysis showed there are multiple transcripts enriched in starch, sugar, carotenoid, plant hormone signal transduction and pectin pathways and several pathways regulating quality formation were identified. Candidate genes involving in sugar, starch, pectin, fruit softening and carotenoid metabolism in fruit were firstly identified for the species of C. maxima. Combining the sugar, starch and carotenoid accumulating patterns during fruit development, a series of possible rate limiting genes were identified. These findings will provide valuable information for further studies regarding fruit quality and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita maxima 3acarotenoids 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3agene expression regulation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anutrition 3apectins 3aplant hormones 3apumpkins 3aripening 3asignal transduction 3astarch 3asugar content 3asugars 3atexture 3atotal soluble solids 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes1 aYu, Ting1 aLi, Jun-Xing1 aQu, Shu-Ping1 aWang, Man-Man1 aWu, Ting-Quan1 aZhong, Yu-Juan0 tJournal of plant biology.g2019 June, v. 62, no. 3 p.203-216dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-019-0015-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008600209300001600295520092400311592002801235650001701263650002201280650002101302650001201323650000901335650002001344650001101364650002501375650001701400651001101417700001501428700003401443773011301477856008201590852000901672655001201681IND60660664920221120073254.0190827e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066066492DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-019-00951-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0546-054610aCombining market structure and econometric methods for pricetransmission analysis  ap. 941-951.  aMuch attention has been devoted in the literature to the analysis of price transmission along food supply chains. Price transmission analysis has traditionally focused on applying econometric methods to assess price dynamics and interrelationships. However, the exclusive application of econometric methods without considering the market’s institutional context has limited potential to support evidence-based policy-making. In recent years, studies have thus attempted to combine the use of quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand the level of performance of food value chains. This study contributes to broadening these empirical toolkits by suggesting a structured analytical framework that benefits from the simultaneous application of econometric and market-structure methods in price transmission analysis. To illustrate the application of the framework, we analyzed the milk market of Panama.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3afood supply chain 3amarket structure 3amarkets 3amilk 3anutritive value 3aprices 3aqualitative analysis 3asupply chain 3aPanama1 aIhle, Rico1 aCramon-Taubadel, Stephan von,0 tFood security.g2019 Aug., v. 11, no. 4 p.941-951dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00951-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010700155300002000262520112600282592002801408650001601436650001001452650001801462650002501480650001901505650001801524650001901542650001301561700001401574700001401588700001401602700001501616773012501631856007401756852000901830655001201839IND60642056320221118025701.0190506e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064205632DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06462d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBu, Yuzhen10aEnhanced photocatalytic activity of BiOI under visible light irradiation by the modification of MoS₂  ap. 42398-42406.  a3D hierarchical BiOI nanostructures modified with MoS₂ were successfully fabricated through a simple solvent thermal process. The prepared heterostructured BiOI–MoS₂ nanocomposite exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance in the degradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of BiOI–MoS₂ increases with the increase of MoS₂ content first, then it decreases when MoS₂ content is over 0.5 wt%. The degradation efficiency of methyl orange could achieve 95% within 90 min in the presence of BiOI–0.5 wt% MoS₂, which is about two times higher than that of pristine BiOI nanostructures. The obviously improved photocatalytic performance of BiOI–MoS₂ could be mainly attributed to the significantly enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. However, too much MoS₂ loading on the surface of BiOI will prevent light from reaching surface of BiOI and limit the efficiency of charge separation. Based on active species trapping experiments, holes (h⁺) were proved to be the main reactive species in the prepared BiOI–MoS₂ system.  aPublisher supplied data 3airradiation 3alight 3amethyl orange 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aphotocatalysis 3asolvents1 aXu, Junli1 aLi, Yawen1 aLiu, Qian1 aZhang, Xia0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 7, no. 67 p.42398-42406dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06462d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04362naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002100178245011500199300001600314520168300330592002802013650002002041650001002061650002102071650002402092650001602116650002202132650003102154650004102185650001702226650001502243650001902258650004002277650001302317650001702330650001402347650001102361650001602372650000902388650002202397650003502419650005302454650002502507650005202532650002802584650001602612650002802628650001102656650001102667650002002678650000902698650001602707650002602723650007702749650003002826650001502856650002002871650001702891650003002908650003102938651002502969700002002994700002103014700001603035700002103051700002003072700001803092700002103110700002303131700002203154700001803176700002203194700002103216700002603237773009603263856009303359990002303452852000903475655001203484IND60088919920221116205736.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008891992DNAL7 a227663302pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraki, Yoshihiro10aPrevalence and risk factors for cerebral infarction and carotid artery stenosis in peripheral arterial disease  ap. 473-477.  aOBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors for cerebral infarction (CI) and carotid artery stenosis (CAS) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) compared with normal controls. METHOD: A cross-sectional analysis was performed in 857 subjects (PAD: 543, controls: 314). CI and lacunar infarction (LI) were evaluated using brain computed tomography. Intima-media thickening (IMT) and CAS were measured with ultrasound. RESULTS: The prevalences of CI and LI were higher in patients with PAD than in controls (15.0% vs. 9.8%, 41.0% vs. 13.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). In multiple logistic analysis, CI was associated with diabetes mellitus, low HDL cholesterol and CAS ≥ 70% (p < 0.05). LI was associated with age, PAD, diabetes mellitus, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (p < 0.05). The prevalences of CAS ≥ 70% and CAS ≥ 50% were higher in patients with PAD than in controls (5.2% vs. 0.6%, 17.6% vs. 3.8%, respectively, p < 0.01). Mean and max IMT differed significantly between the two groups (PAD vs. controls: 1.01 ± 0.45 vs. 0.90 ± 0.28, 2.67 ± 2.00 vs. 1.73 ± 1.05 mm, respectively, p < 0.001). CAS ≥ 70% correlated with high LDL cholesterol, and CAS ≥ 50% with age and PAD. IMT was positively correlated with PAD, high LDL cholesterol, age, and hypertension (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalences of CI and CAS were markedly higher in patients with PAD than in controls, indicating that PAD is a meaningful risk factor for CI, LI, and CAS. This suggests that screening for CI and CAS is important for managements in PAD, as with screening for PAD in patients with stroke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3abrain 3acarotid arteries 3acomputed tomography 3acorrelation 3adiabetes mellitus 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypertension 3ainfarction 3alogit analysis 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3apatients 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3astroke 3aultrasonics 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCarotid Intima-Media Thickness 2aCarotid Stenosisxepidemiologyxultrasonography. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCerebral Infarctionxepidemiologyxradiography. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aComorbidity 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPeripheral Arterial Diseasexepidemiologyxradiographyxultrasonography. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 0aJapanxepidemiology.1 aKumakura, Hisao1 aKanai, Hiroyoshi1 aKasama, Shu1 aSumino, Hiroyuki1 aIchikawa, Akiko1 aItō, Toshio,1 aIwasaki, Toshiya1 aTakayama, Yoshiaki1 aIchikawa, Shuichi1 aFujita, Kishu1 aNakashima, Kuniki1 aMinami, Kazutomo1 aKurabayashi, Masahiko0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Aug., v. 223, no. 2 p.473-477dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.05.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013300170300001400303520150000317592002801817650002001845650001701865650002401882650001301906650000901919650002301928650002601951650001901977650002301996650001302019650001202032653002302044653001802067653001702085653001602102653001602118700001602134700001802150700001702168773009802185856008602283852000902369655001202378IND60537973720221116141123.0190412e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053797372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Aiden10aBank erosion hazard index as an indicator of near-bank aquatic habitat and community structure in a southeastern Piedmont stream  ap. 19-28.  aStreams in the southeastern Piedmont region display varying degrees of bank erosion, which in turn can influence multiple physical and biological processes. In efforts to assess and predict bank erosion, the multi-metric tool Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) is often calculated. As designed, the BEHI takes into consideration many physical phenomena and scores stream banks categorically from very low to extreme bank erosion hazard; however the power of this index to directly predict in-stream biological conditions is unknown. The predictive ability of BEHI was evaluated on near-bank aquatic biota and organic matter (OM) retention in an AL Piedmont stream with a range of bank conditions. Fifteen banks were characterized using the BEHI and subsequently, macroinvertebrates, crayfishes, fishes and organic matter associated with each bank were quantified. Results suggest increased macroinvertebrate richness and OM retention with low BEHI score. Multivariate analyses suggest functional similarity in macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with low BEHI banks and greater variation in assemblages as BEHI increased. Crayfish were more abundant at banks with high BEHI, a pattern attributed to increases in a generalist species in more-degraded habitats. Fish response showed no discernible pattern in relationship to BEHI score. These results suggest that BEHI may have applications as an informative ecological evaluation tool integrating physical and biological conditions in streams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic habitat 3abank erosion 3acommunity structure 3acrayfish 3afish 3amacroinvertebrates 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic matter 3aphysical phenomena 3apiedmont 3astreams 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aSedimentation 0aBank erosion 0aRestoration 0aConvex hull1 aTurner, Ian1 aBrantley, Eve1 aHelms, Brian0 tEcological indicators.g2014 Aug., v. 43 p.19-28dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015500165300001600320520157200336592002801908650003501936650002001971650001701991650001802008650001002026650003402036650002302070650001202093650002602105650004302131650002802174650002502202650002202227650005202249650000902301650001502310650001202325700001702337700001902354700001702373700002102390700001802411773013002429856008102559852000902640655001202649IND60645302920221120202104.0190528e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064530292DNAL7 a10.1007/s12374-019-0006-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eui-Jung10aGenome-wide Analysis of Root Hair Preferred RBOH Genes Suggests that Three RBOH Genes are Associated with Auxin-mediated Root Hair Development in Rice  ap. 229-238.  aPlant homologs of mammalian NADPH oxidase, respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOH), mainly oxidize NADPH to NADP⁺ and transfer electrons to water. The membrane residing RBOHs thus produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which allows plants to withstand abiotic and biotic environmental stresses. To understand the spatial and temporal function of rice (Oryza sativa) RBOH genes, we performed expression analysis of nine RBOH genes using qRT-PCR and microarray data. The expression profiling data suggest that RBOH genes have diverse roles in various tissues and organs as well as responses to hormonal treatments. Among them, OsRBOH2, OsRBOH3, and OsRBOH5 are preferentially expressed in root hairs. Exogenous auxin upregulates the expression of OsRBOH1, OsRBOH2, OsRBOH3, OsRBOH4, and OsRBOH8 in root hairs, while the expression of OsRBOH7 and OsRBOH9 is downregulated. In roots, treatment with an RBOH inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), suppressed the accumulation of ROS in trichoblast cells which initiate root hairs, suggesting that RBOH-mediated ROS could play an important role in root hair initiation in the trichoblast cells of rice roots. Promoter analysis revealed that OsRBOH3 and OsRBOH5 contain many known cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) associated with root hair development such as the root hair cis-acting element, RHE. OsRBOH2 and OsRBOH3, which are upregulated after treatment with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) with significant expression in root hairs, might be key players in root hair elongation via an auxin-dependent pathway in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aOryza sativa 3abiotic stress 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3aindole acetic acid 3amammals 3amicroarray technology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3aregulatory sequences 3arespiratory burst 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aroot hairs 3atissues1 aKim, Yu-jin,1 aHong, Woo-Jong1 aLee, Chanhee1 aJeon, Jong-Seong1 aJung, Ki-Hong0 tJournal of plant biology.g2019 June, v. 62, no. 3 p.229-238dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000110x1226-92397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12374-019-0006-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010700173300001600280520213900296592002802435596009702463650001102560650001702571650001302588650002202601650000902623650001802632650001202650650001002662650001702672650002202689650001802711650001502729650001502744650001102759650001302770650001502783650000902798650002402807650002502831650001202856650001302868651001302881700002002894700001702914700002002931700002202951773011302973856008203086852000903168655001203177IND60660665120221122152417.0190827e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066066512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-019-00939-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebru, Kebede Manjur10aInclusive malt barley business and household food security in Lay Gayint district of northern Ethiopia  ap. 953-966.  aFood security has become a major problem in Ethiopia. To reverse the situation, inclusive businesses, such as malt barley production, are being promoted. However, the determinants of inclusion in the malt barley industry and the food security impacts of inclusion have not been studied systematically. Thus, the objectives of the present research were twofold, namely to investigate the reason for inclusion in, or exclusion from, the malt barley industry, and to examine the food security impacts of inclusion in three villages in Lay Gayint district, northern Ethiopia. The research used a mixed method approach. Survey data were collected from 140 non-included and 103 included farm households. In addition, focus group discussions were held with 18 included and 18 non-included households, as well as with six officials. Three multiple dimensions of food security were considered: food availability, measured by months per year during which households reported having an adequate food supply; food access, indicated by coping strategies employed by the households to secure sufficient food; and food utilisation, measured by food calorie intake, food variety and diet diversity scores, and three anthropometric measures for children under 5 years of age. Quantitative data were analysed using a two stage least square regression model, while qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results indicate that inclusion in the malt barley industry is determined by higher economic status. Older farmers and farmers living far from the main town of the district were excluded. We also show that inclusion in the malt barley industry results in higher incomes, better food access and higher diet diversity scores, but has less impact in terms of food availability, food variety score, per capita kilocalorie consumption and child growth. Based on these findings, we suggest that, in the context of inclusive business for those at the ‘bottom of the pyramid’, one needs to re-frame the targeting process of chain governance and integrate other actors who work on food and nutrition components of rural livelihoods.  aPublisher supplied data  aWS.220011.1cNetherlands Organisation for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development 3abarley 3achild growth 3achildren 3acoping strategies 3adiet 3aenergy intake 3afarmers 3afarms 3afocus groups 3afood availability 3afood security 3agovernance 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aindustry 3alivelihood 3amalt 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3asurveys 3avillages 3aEthiopia1 aRammelt, Crelis1 aLeung, Maggi1 aZoomers, E.

The current study analyzed the use of ponds by leaf-litter anurans in relation to distance to the forest edge and presence of aquatic predators in a forest fragment in Eastern Amazon. We selected three trails perpendicular to the forest edge, and in each trail we positioned nine plastic basins on the forest floor at different distances from the forest edge. From November 2011 to July 2012, each basin was surveyed monthly for presence of evidence of anuran breeding activity and aquatic predators. We recorded 112 instances of use of basins by four anuran species. While we did not observe any influence of distance to the forest edge on use of basins by Rhinella gr. margaritifera and Ameerega trivittata, there was differential use of basins by both species in relation to the presence of aquatic predators. In both cases, species used basins more often when aquatic predators were absent, suggesting that these species adopt strategies that reduce effects of predation and ensures the survival of some tadpoles, either by carrying tadpoles to ponds without predators or producing larger clutches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmeerega 3aRhinella 3abasins 3abreeding 3aedge effects 3aforest litter 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitat preferences 3aponds 3apredation 3apredators 3atadpoles 3aAmazonia 0aAmphibians 0aforest edge 0afrogs 0areproduction1 aRodrigues, Lenise Chagas0 tAnimal biology.g, v. 65, no. 1 p.33-43dBrillwJournal:2189x1570-75557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15707563-000024583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001600292520137800308592002801686650001501714650001401729650002001743650001401763650001001777650001901787700005401806700001601860773014101876856008202017852000902099655001202108IND60645303020221120192722.0190816e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064530302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-018-0911-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiaoping12aA Density-Based Clustering Method for the Segmentation of Individual Buildings from Filtered Airborne LiDAR Point Clouds  ap. 907-921.  aIndividual building segmentation is a prerequisite for building reconstruction. When building points or building regions are classified from raw LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds, the dataset usually contains numerous individual buildings as well as outliers. However, the applications to segment individual buildings from large datasets require the algorithms working with the minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, working well on datasets with outliers and having good efficiency on big data. To meet these requirements, this paper presents a new segmentation method relying on a density-based clustering technique that is designed to separate individual buildings in dense built-up areas and is robust to outliers. As implemented in a spatial database, the algorithm benefits from the spatial index and the parallel computation capability offered by the system. The experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly more effective in segmenting individual buildings than the well-known moving window algorithm and the new boundary identification and tracing algorithm, and processes large volumes of data with good efficiency. Compared with the moving window algorithm, the proposed method (parallelized) consumed only 17.8% time and the quality improved from 88.8 to 94.8% on the Vaihingen dataset.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abuildings 3adata collection 3adatabases 3alidar 3aremote sensing1 aCao, Rujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1333-87431 aCao, Yanyan0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2019 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.907-921dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-0911-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014900159300002000308520083400328592002801162650000801190650002201198650001401220650002301234650002801257650002701285650001401312650001301326700002001339700001901359700001901378700001601397773012401413856007401537852000901611655001201620IND60642056520221118025854.0190506e20170710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064205652DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06464k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Han-Sheng10aMono and double Mizoroki–Heck reaction of aryl halides with dialkyl vinylphosphonates using a reusable palladium catalyst under aqueous medium  ap. 34293-34299.  aOperationally-simple and reusable Pd-catalyzed mono and double Mizoroki–Heck reactions of aryl halides and dialkyl vinylphosphonates using ⁱPr₂NH as a base in aqueous medium under air were developed. For aryl iodides, the reaction could be conducted at 80 °C under a low catalyst loading (0.1–1 mol%). When aryl bromides were applied, however, a greater amount of catalyst (5 mol%) and a longer reaction time at 120 °C were required. Simply changing dialkyl vinylphosphonates as the limiting reagent led to the formation of 2,2-diaryl vinylphosphonates in good to high yields. After reaction, the residual aqueous solution could be reused for both mono and double Mizoroki–Heck reactions, making the reactions greener and reducing wastage of precious metals and use of harmful organic solvents as the reaction medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aorganobromine compounds 3aorganoiodine compounds 3apalladium 3asolvents1 aPai, Shao-Hsuan1 aLiao, Wei-Ting1 aYang, Xin-Jing1 aTsai, Fu-Yu0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 10, v. 7, no. 54 p.34293-34299dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06464k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010400206300001600310520131600326592002801642596015401670596003701824650002001861650001601881650001801897650001501915650001101930650001201941650001101953650002101964650001701985651001002002700001802012700002202030773011302052856008202165852000902247655001202256IND60660665220221122183549.0190827e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066066522DNAL7 a10.1007/s12571-019-00942-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozicka, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2323-368910aCash vs. in-kind transfers: the role of self-targeting in reforming the Indian food subsidy program  ap. 915-927.  aHistorically, India has relied on subsidizing staple food as a major instrument in improving food security. Recently, however, cash transfers have entered the debate as an alternative, as they are associated with lower market distortions, leakages and fiscal costs. This study contributes to this debate by analyzing India’s Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). Our main objective was to explain the under-purchase, or low take-up, from the TPDS, which is typically attributed to ‘leakage’, i.e. the diversion of food grains from eligible consumers. We provide an alternative solution based on self-targeting; while poorer households increase their consumption from the TPDS, wealthier households restrain from consuming subsidized commodities. Using a large household dataset, we estimated that such a voluntary opt-out system, based on income, would save a minimum of 6.5% of grains released through the TPDS. Besides these demand-driven aspects, our analysis indicates that poor regions perform better at lowering the diversion of grains and that large targeting errors exist among female-led households. Finally, we find substantial regional price differences that would benefit the poor and rural population under a uniform cash-transfer system that does not correct for regional price levels.  aPublisher supplied data  aresearch project “Commodity Price Volatility, Trade Policy and the Poor”cGerman Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ)  aFood SecurecEuropean Commission 3adata collection 3afood grains 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3amarkets 3aprices 3arural population 3astaple foods 3aIndia1 aWeber, Regine1 aKalkuhl, Matthias0 tFood security.g2019 Aug., v. 11, no. 4 p.915-927dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000074x1876-45177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12571-019-00942-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001900191245010300210506007600313506003100389520140500420592002801825596012001853596008301973506003702056650001502093650002002108650001702128650001002145650001902155650001402174650001002188650002602198650001802224650001002242650002202252650001502274650000902289653000802298653001102306653000802317653000802325653000802333653000702341653000702348653000802355653000802363653001102371653000702382653000802389653000802397653000702405653001202412653001502424653004802439653001902487653001302506700001702519700002202536700002302558700002002581700002402601700002002625700001902645773012102664856008502785961000902870852000902879655001202888IND60721155520221207094726.0210114e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072115552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1588702chorus7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1588702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhichao10aLinoleic acid-derived 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid is absorbed and incorporated into rat tissues  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aLinoleic acid (LNA)-derived 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) is a bioactive lipid mediator that regulates multiple signaling processes in vivo. 13-HODE is also produced when LNA is oxidized during food processing. However, the absorption and incorporation kinetics of dietary 13-HODE into tissues is not known. The present study measured unesterified d4-13-HODE plasma bioavailability and incorporation into rat liver, adipose, heart and brain following gavage or intravenous (IV) injection (n = 3 per group). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that d4-13-HODE was absorbed within 20 min of gavage, and continued to incorporate into plasma esterified lipid fractions throughout the 90 min monitoring period (incorporation half-life of 71 min). Following IV injection, unesterified d4-13-HODE was rapidly eliminated from plasma with a half-life of 1 min. Analysis of tracer incorporation kinetics into rat tissues following IV injection or gavage revealed that the esterified tracer preferentially incorporated into liver, adipose and heart compared to unesterified d4-13-HODE. No tracer was detected in the brain. This study demonstrates that dietary 13-HODE is absorbed, and incorporated into peripheral tissues from esterified plasma lipid pools. Understanding the chronic effects of dietary 13-HODE exposure on peripheral tissue physiology and metabolism merits future investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  cEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Developmentdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009633  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3ablood lipids 3abrain 3aesterification 3ahalf life 3aheart 3aintravenous injection 3alinoleic acid 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3arats 0aCOX 0aCYP450 0aARA 0aPGE 0aEPA 0aUE 0aES 0aLNA 0aLOX 0aOXLAMs 0aPG 0asEH 0aSPE 0aIV 0a13-HODE 0aUPLC-MS/MS 0aOxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs) 0aAdipose tissue 0aKinetics1 aEmami, Shiva1 aHennebelle, Marie1 aMorgan, Rhianna K.1 aLerno, Larry A.1 aSlupsky, Carolyn M.1 aLein, Pamela J.1 aTaha, Ameer Y.0 tBiochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Biol Lipids.g2021 Mar., v. 1866, no. 3dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1588703Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014500163300001600308520137500324592002801699650003101727650001201758650001501770650001201785650002201797650000701819650001801826650001301844650002201857653001201879653002701891653001801918653002401936653002401960700001601984700002102000700001502021700002002036700001602056700001902072700001702091773008502108856008502193852000902278655001202287IND60554107420221120072335.0161024e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055410742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aAcetone–butanol–ethanol production using pH control strategy and immobilized cells in an integrated fermentation–pervaporation process  ap. 614-622.  aThe effects of pH and cell immobilization on acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) production coupled with a pervaporation membrane have been investigated using Clostridium acetobutylicum XY16. The solvent productivity of 0.29g/L/h was obtained using a two-stage controlled-pH in the coupled process, which was 11% higher than a previous process without pH control, nevertheless, membrane was still fouled. Furthermore, butanol in the fermenter remained below the critical concentration using a larger membrane, solvent productivity achieved 0.38g/L/h. However, these methods could not prevent membrane fouling, the average permeation flux and butanol separation factor decreased by 41.6% and 31.3%. Then, sugarcane bagasse was used as a cell immobilization carrier and applied to the coupled process; many cells aggregated and adsorbed on sugarcane bagasse surface, the dry cell weight (DCW) in broth was maintained at 1.1g/L. Membrane fouling was relieved, the pervaporation maintained a steady state for more than 90h, the average permeation flux was 0.676kg/m2/h, which only decreased by 13.9% compared to that in the initial stage, and the butanol separation factor remained stable. A maximum solvent productivity of 0.62g/L/h was also obtained. Thus, the pH control and cell immobilization are efficient methods for high-intensity ABE production with in situ recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3abutanol 3afermenters 3afouling 3aimmobilized cells 3apH 3apervaporation 3asolvents 3asugarcane bagasse 0aButanol 0aFed-batch fermentation 0aPervaporation 0apH control strategy 0aCell immobilization1 aHe, Ai-yong1 aKong, Xiang-ping1 aJiang, Min1 aChen, Xiao-peng1 aZhu, Da-wei1 aLiu, Gong-ping1 aJin, Wan-qin0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2015 Apr., v. 50 p.614-622dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011600158300002000274520113500294592002801429650001701457650002801474650001401502650001301516650002101529650001101550650003201561650001901593650001801612650002101630650001401651700001601665700002101681700001301702700002001715773012401735856007401859852000901933655001201942IND60642056720221118210137.0190506e20170816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064205672DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06466g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xuan-Xuan10aSynthesis and evaluation of the antitumor activity of highly functionalised pyridin-2-ones and pyrimidin-4-ones  ap. 40067-40073.  aThe methods for the synthesis of two novel types of compounds, including pyridin-2-ones 3 and pyrimidin-4-ones 4 were developed. Pyridin-2-ones 3 were synthesised via the regioselective reaction of N,N′-disubstituted 1,1-ene diamines 1a–1w with mercaptals 2a–2c in acetonitrile promoted by Cs₂CO₃ under refluxing conditions. Fortunately, pyrimidin-4-ones 4 were obtained when the N-monosubstituted 1,1-ene diamines 1x–1b′, used as substrate, by accident, reacted with mercaptals 2 under similar conditions. As a result, two kinds of novel heterocycles were synthesised by this protocol. The reactions have some advantages, such as excellent yield, inexpensive raw materials and convenient final treatment. The antitumor bioactivity screening showed that certain compounds had potent antitumor activity. Especially, compounds 3r, which showed the most potent activity with IC₅₀ values lower than 12.3 μmol L⁻¹ against four human tumor cell lines, making it more active than cisplatin (DDP). In addition, a preliminary assessment of the structure–selectivity relationship of the compounds was also performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aantineoplastic activity 3acisplatin 3adiamines 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aneoplasm cells 3araw materials 3aregioselectivity 3ascreening1 aHuang, Rong1 aYang, Chang-Long1 aLin, Jun1 aYan, Sheng-Jiao0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 16, v. 7, no. 64 p.40067-40073dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06466g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520080900298592002801107650001201135650001101147650001001158650001801168650001801186650001101204650001701215650001201232650001001244651002101254653001901275653003201294653001501326653001001341700002001351700001701371773012201388856008501510852000901595655001201604IND60408468620221118060301.0161031e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040846862DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2015.10561822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDizman, Serdar10aDetermination of tritium concentrations in humans before the development of a nuclear power plant in Turkey  ap. 478-484.  aThe most widely used method to determine the level of tritium in humans is testing urine.

The therapy used for its treatment causes adverse effects in the patient. Propolis is a natural product that has been used for the treatments of different diseases around the world. Nevertheless, there is little information about the activity of propolis in gastric ulcers caused by treatment with NSAIDs. Therefore, this review evaluates and compares the gastroprotective potential of propolis and its function against NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, for which a systematic search was carried out in the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. The main criteria were articles that report the gastroprotective activity of propolis against the damage produced by NSAIDs in the gastric mucosa. Gastroprotection was related to the antioxidant, antisecretory, and cytoprotective effects, as well as the phenolic compounds present in the chemical composition of propolis. However, most of the studies used different doses of NSAIDs and propolis and evaluated different parameters. Propolis has proven to be a good alternative for the treatment of gastric ulcer disease. However, future studies should be carried out to identify the compounds responsible for these effects and to determine their potential use in people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3achemical composition 3agastric mucosa 3apatients 3apropolis 3apublic health 3astomach ulcers 3asystematic review 3atherapeutics1 aGarduño-Siciliano, Leticia 1 aDomínguez-Verano, Pilar 1 aBalderas-Cordero, Daniela 1 aGorgua-Jiménez, Gustavo 1 aCanales-Álvarez, Octavio 1 aCanales-Martínez, María Margarita1 aRodríguez-Monroy, Marco Aurelio0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 11, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130931693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245011500159500002000274520130700294592002801601596007501629596006601704596006601770596006601836596014301902596007502045596018702120596013102307650001702438650001502455650001502470650001102485650001302496650001602509650001102525650001302536650001502549651002002564700005302584700001202637700005702649700001402706773013702720856007702857852000902934655001202943IND60789829620221120142745.0220822e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078982962DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JC0172442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Bingxu10aBiological Response to the Interaction of a Mesoscale Eddy and the River Plume in the Northern South China Sea  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Pearl River delivers a large amount of freshwater, sediments and nutrients to the northern shelf of the South China Sea (SCS). In June 2015, an anomalously strong phytoplankton bloom was captured by satellite images in the slope region of the northern SCS, which was associated with the southeastward spreading of the river plume on the shelf and a southwestward‐moving eddy along the slope. In this study, the underlying dynamics triggering the bloom was investigated using a coupled physical‐biogeochemical model. Results show that the nutrients supporting the bloom were not directly sourced from the Pearl River, but were transported locally from subsurface. The eddy cross‐slope current advected low salinity water from the Pearl River plume, which interacted with eddy edge and enhanced frontal dynamics with vertical motions. The front‐induced upwelling injected nutrients from subsurface to surface layer and stimulated phytoplankton bloom in the upper layer. Overall, the phytoplankton bloom was attributable to the interaction of freshwater plume on top and the eddy edge induced anomaly in the subsurface. These findings suggest that the eddy‐entrained freshwater could have significant biological consequences through modifying local dynamics in the plume‐influenced region.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC1401604cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a41890805cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41806035cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41730536cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aGML2019ZD0305cKey Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou)  a2019A1515012108cGuangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation  aQNHX1928cOpen fund of State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics, Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China  aLTOZZ2101cState Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography, South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aalgal blooms 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3ariver plume 3arivers 3asalinity 3asatellites 3aSouth China Sea1 aXiu, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5328-84051 aLiu, Na1 aHe, Xianqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7474-67781 aChai, Fei0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Sept., v. 126, no. 9 p.e2021JC017244-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JC0172443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011100167300001400278520115200292592002801444650001901472650001201491650001601503650002401519650002901543650001301572650002201585650001201607650001401619650001001633651001201643653002801655653002201683653001501705653003501720700001301755700001601768700001301784773007601797856008301873852000901956655001201965IND60546164820221118131759.0160903e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054616482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuellette, A.10aAchieving emissions reduction through oil sands cogeneration in Alberta’s deregulated electricity market  ap. 13-21.  aThe province of Alberta faces the challenge of balancing its commitment to reduce CO2 emissions and the growth of its energy-intensive oil sands industry. Currently, these operations rely on the Alberta electricity system and on-site generation to satisfy their steam and electricity requirements. Most of the on-site generation units produce steam and electricity through the process of cogeneration. It is unclear to what extent new and existing operations will continue to develop cogeneration units or rely on electricity from the Alberta grid to meet their energy requirements in the near future. This study explores the potential for reductions in fuel usage and CO2 emissions by increasing the penetration of oil sands cogeneration in the provincial generation mixture. EnergyPLAN is used to perform scenario analyses on Alberta’s electricity system in 2030 with a focus on transmission conditions to the oil sands region. The results show that up to 15–24% of CO2 reductions prescribed by the 2008 Alberta Climate Strategy are possible. Furthermore, the policy implications of these scenarios within a deregulated market are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3aenergy requirements 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aoil sands 3asteam 3aAlberta 0aIndustrial cogeneration 0aAlberta oil sands 0aEnergyPLAN 0aDeregulated electricity market1 aRowe, A.1 aSopinka, A.1 aWild, P.0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Aug., v. 71 p.13-21dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245012000179300001800299520126500317592002801582650001501610650002801625650001101653650002001664650002501684650001101709650001501720650004301735650002201778650002401800650001901824650001201843650002501855650001601880650001701896700003201913773014301945856008302088852000902171655001202180IND60645303520221122030608.0190816e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064530352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-019-00966-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharīfī, ʻAlī Riz̤ā,14aThe Effect of Rapid Population Growth on Urban Expansion and Destruction of Green Space in Tehran from 1972 to 2017  ap. 1063-1071.  aTime series analysis of satellite data is a very powerful tool for change detection applications especially for monitoring urban expansion. Urban expansion results in an accelerating proportion of the population living in cities and caused considerable effects on green space structures and areas. Many methods and models have been tested to determine urban expansion. In this paper, after computing the Tehran area and its green space coverage, the relationship between the population with urban expansion and green space coverage is estimated by regression analysis. As a consequence of Tehran texture and dataset for processing, raster to vector conversion was the most effective method for computing urban area, and also green space coverage was determined with normalized difference vegetation index. Machine learning algorithms such as support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (nonparametric method) were utilized to estimate green space coverage and urban area, respectively. Although RF model improves the accuracy of estimated population (R² = 0.97, RMSE = 38.18, and MAE = 83.44), the use of SVR model considerably improves the estimation of green space coverage (R² = 0.93, RMSE = 47.12, and MAE = 100.18) as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acities 3adata collection 3agreen infrastructure 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apopulation growth 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3atexture 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas 3aurbanization1 aHosseingholizadeh, Mohammad0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2019 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.1063-1071dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-019-00966-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245004400157520084300201592002801044650001301072650001501085650001601100650001601116650001301132650002001145650003001165650001001195650001901205650001101224700002401235700002201259773012301281856007401404852000901478655001201487IND60751651820221121174838.0210925e20210911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075165182DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130931702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPohl, Keith 10aAlcohol’s Impact on the Gut and Liver  aAlcohol is inextricably linked with the digestive system. It is absorbed through the gut and metabolised by hepatocytes within the liver. Excessive alcohol use results in alterations to the gut microbiome and gut epithelial integrity. It contributes to important micronutrient deficiencies including short-chain fatty acids and trace elements that can influence immune function and lead to liver damage. In some people, long-term alcohol misuse results in liver disease progressing from fatty liver to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and results in over half of all deaths from chronic liver disease, over half a million globally per year. In this review, we will describe the effect of alcohol on the gut, the gut microbiome and liver function and structure, with a specific focus on micronutrients and areas for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aepithelium 3afatty liver 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3aliver function 3apeople1 aMoodley, Prebashan 1 aDhanda, Ashwin D.0 tNutrients.g2021 Sept. 11, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130931703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014800167520086900315592002801184650002101212650002801233650001901261650001801280650001801298650001701316650001801333650001401351651001001365653002301375653001901398653001801417653002801435653002101463653002401484700001501508700002601523773010701549856008501656852000901741655001201750IND60769470920221120075537.0220704e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076947092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.1093872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuzhang10aEffective cross-protection of a lyophilized live gE/gI/TK-deleted pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine against classical and variant PRV challenges  aClassical Bartha-K61 strains could not provide complete protection against the emerging highly virulent pseudorabies virus (PRV) variant strains, which has caused great economic losses to swine industry in China.

Due to a certain surface coverage by adsorbed species the bubble surface starts to become immobilized and the rising velocity is retarded. There is a large difference in the retardation effect in presence of the protein β-lactoglobulin (BLG) alone and its mixed solutions with surfactants. In presence of added surfactants BLG forms complexes, which adsorb and retard the bubble rising velocity according to their respective surface activity and adsorption kinetics. While the nonionic surfactant C12DMPO does not show significant increase in retardation effects as compared to BLG alone, the ionic surfactants SDS and DoTAB form highly surface active complexes and change the rising velocity much stronger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abubbles 3anonionic surfactants 0aDynamic adsorption layer 0aRising bubble velocity 0aBLG adsorption 0aMixed BLG/surfactant adsorption 0aSDS 0aDoTAB 0aNon-ionic surfactant 0aDiffusion controlled adsorption1 aKrzan, M.1 aLotfi, M.1 aDukhin, S.S.1 aKovalchuk, V.I.1 aJavadi, A.1 aGunes, D.Z.1 aGehin-Delval, C.1 aMalysa, K.1 aMiller, R.0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 460 p.361-368dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010400165520085400269592002801123650001301151650001401164650001501178650001501193650001601208700001901224700001801243700001701261700002001278700002001298700001701318773012201335856008001457852000901537655001201546IND60742424020221118220644.0210624e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074242402DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110611822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Se-woon 10aFluid Dynamic Approaches for Prediction of Spray Drift from Ground Pesticide Applications: A Review  aSpray drifts have been studied by mathematical models and computer simulations as an essential complement to lab and field tests, among which are fluid dynamic approaches that help to understand the transport of spray droplets in a turbulent atmosphere and their potential impacts to the environment. From earlier fluid mechanical models to highly computational models, scientific advancement has led to a more realistic prediction of spray drift, but the current literature lacks reviews showing the trends and limitations of the existing approaches. This paper is to review the literature on fluid-mechanical-based modelling of spray drift resulting from ground spray applications. Consequently, it provides comprehensive understanding of the transition and development of fluid dynamic approaches and the future directions in this research field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acomputers 3apesticides 3aprediction 3aspray drift1 aPark, Jinseon 1 aJeong, Hanna 1 aLee, Seyeon 1 aChoi, Lakyeong 1 aZhao, Lingying 1 aZhu, Heping 0 tAgronomy.g2021 June 10, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110611823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01101naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007800160300001800238520017600256592002800432650002300460650001200483650000900495700001900504700002400523700002000547700002200567773012900589856007200718852000900790655001200799IND60657447820221120154959.0190816e20040120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065744782DNAL7 a10.1039/b309148a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoiocchi, Massimo10aLight-emitting charge transfer species promoted by metal ion coordination  ap. 2906-2907.  aThe coordinative interaction between zinc(ii) and naphthalene-labeled diiminopyridine ligands induces the formation of light-emitting intracomplex charge transfer species.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aligands 3azinc1 aColucci, Guido1 aLicchelli, Maurizio1 aMonzani, Enrico1 aSacchi, Donatella0 tChemical communications.g2004 Jan. 20, , no. 23 p.2906-2907dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b309148a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014200172300001400314520079100328592002801119650001401147650001301161650002001174650001001194650001301204650001101217651001001228653002001238653001201258653002701270653001501297653003001312653001701342700002701359700002001386700002101406700002001427700002001447700001901467700002401486773011301510856008501623852000901708655001201717IND60543889420221118021128.0190412e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054388942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2015.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Grazia, Simona10aIdentification of a multi-reassortant G12P[9] rotavirus with novel VP1, VP2, VP3 and NSP2 genotypes in a child with acute gastroenteritis  ap. 34-37.  aThe G12 rotavirus genotype is globally emerging to cause severe gastroenteritis in children. Common G12 rotaviruses have either a Wa-like or DS-1-like genome constellation, while some G12 strains may have unusual genome composition. In this study, we determined the full-genome sequence of a G12P[9] strain (ME848/12) detected in a child hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Italy in 2012. Strain ME848/12 showed a complex genetic constellation (G12-P[9]-I17-R12-C12-M11-A12-N12-T7-E6-H2), likely derived from multiple reassortment events, with the VP1, VP2, VP3 and NSP2 genes being established as novel genotypes R12, C12, M11 and N12, respectively. Gathering sequence data on human and animal rotaviruses is important to trace the complex evolutionary history of atypical RVAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3achildren 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aItaly 0aHuman rotavirus 0aG12P[9] 0aFull genome sequencing 0aGenotyping 0aInterspecies transmission 0aReassortment1 aGiammanco, Giovanni M.1 aDóró, Renáta1 aBonura, Floriana1 aMarton, Szilvia1 aCascio, Antonio1 aMartella, Vito1 aBányai, Krisztián0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Oct., v. 35 p.34-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245013900160300001600299520032800315592002800643650001400671650002300685650001100708650001200719650001200731650001000743650001600753650000800769650001300777650001200790651001100802651001700813653001400830653001700844653001500861653001700876773011900893856007801012852000901090655001201099IND60124244220221120050315.0151025e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012424422DNAL7 a10.4001/003.020.02062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeeming, J.C.12aA New Species of Hydrellia Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Ephydridae) Developing in Lagarosiphon major (Hydrocharitaceae) in South Africa  ap. 217-221.  aHydrellia lagarosiphon sp. n. is described from adult male, female, ovum, third instar larva and puparium from cultured material originating from that reared from Lagarosiphon major in South Africa.

To assess the origins of the organic aerosols in the East China coastal atmosphere, PM2.5 samples were collected from the atmospheres of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and Changdao Island during the CAPTAIN (Campaign of Air PolluTion At INshore Areas of Eastern China) field campaign in the spring of 2011. The marine atmospheric aerosol samples that were collected were grouped based on the backward trajectories of their air masses. The organic carbon concentrations in the PM2.5 samples from the marine and Changdao Island atmospheres were 5.5 ± 3.1 μgC/m3 and 6.9 ± 2.4 μgC/m3, respectively, which is higher than in other coastal water atmospheres. The concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the marine atmospheric PM2.5 samples was 17.0 ± 20.2 ng/m3, indicating significant continental anthropogenic influences. The influences of fossil fuels and biomass burning on the composition of organic aerosols in the coastal atmosphere of East China were found to be highly dependent on the origins of the air masses. Diesel combustion had a strong impact on air masses from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and gasoline emissions had a more significant impact on the “North China” marine atmospheric samples. The “Northeast China” marine atmospheric samples were most impacted by biomass burning. Coal combustion contributed significantly to the compositions of all of the atmospheric samples. The proportions of secondary compounds increased as samples aged in the marine atmosphere indicating that photochemical oxidation occured during transport. Our results quantified ecosystem effects on marine atmospheric aerosols and highlighted the uncertainties that arise when modeling marine atmospheric PM2.5 without considering high spatial resolution source data and meteorological parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acoal 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3acombustion 3aemissions 3agasoline 3amarine ecosystems 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3ariver deltas 3aspring 3auncertainty 3aChina 3aEast China Sea 3aYangtze River 3aYellow Sea 0aParticulate organic matter 0aPAHs 0aBackward trajectory 0aCoastal atmosphere 0aAnthropogenic sources1 aHu, Min1 aGuo, Qingfeng1 aZou, Qi1 aZheng, Jing1 aGuo, Song0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 Oct., v. 229 p.350-361dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245009600212300001600308520174100324592002802065650001602093650001802109650001702127650001302144650001702157650001402174650001002188650001602198650002202214650001202236650001602248650002002264650001002284650001102294650001602305653002502321653001002346653001602356653001802372653001502390653001402405653002002419653002002439653001002459653001502469700002502484773012402509856008502633852000902718655001202727IND60634119020221118013537.0191214e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063411902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonova, Elena V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8042-804710aRadiosensitivity and mutability of wheat seed progeny cultivated under adverse environments  ap. 162-168.  aThis research analysed the growth process dynamics of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeds cultivated in contrasting microclimatic conditions. We used acute gamma irradiation (5–50 Gy) as a provocative factor to detect hidden differences in the adaptive potential of seeds cultivated under adverse conditions (wet and cool field season) in comparison to seeds obtained under controlled conditions (hydroponic greenhouse). Seeds harvested from wheat plants cultivated in challenging field conditions demonstrated lower weight; moreover, their offspring also had a lower weight and seedling survival rate, as well as a delay in the formation of the fourth – sixth roots. The discrepancy in growth characteristics increased from the beginning to the end of the experiments and was particularly pronounced in offspring cultivated under adverse conditions throughout the entire experiment. The offspring of control seeds were more radioresistant than their field seed counterparts. At the same time, the “field” seeds were characterised by stimulation of growth and development of seedlings in their responses to irradiation. Few seedlings grown from “greenhouse” seeds exhibited evidence of root necrosis and twisted roots. Among the field plants, unusual developmental anomalies for ‘greenhouse’ seeds were encountered, including the disruption of gravitropism, thickening of roots, changes in the form of coleoptiles and leaves, and necrotic coleoptiles. Gamma irradiation stimulated an increase in the number of seedlings with various developmental disorders. In the case of seed progeny grown under adverse conditions, developmental anomalies were more frequent following irradiation relative to optimal conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoleoptiles 3asurvival rate 3agravitropism 3anecrosis 3amicroclimate 3aseedlings 3awheat 3ahydroponics 3aTriticum aestivum 3aprogeny 3airradiation 3agamma radiation 3aroots 3aleaves 3agreenhouses 0aTriticum aestivum L. 0aField 0aTemperature 0aPrecipitation 0aGreenhouse 0aViability 0aRadioresistance 0aRoot morphology 0aShoot 0aMutability1 aKhlestkina, Elena K.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 Apr., v. 137 p.162-168dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009300172300001200265500001400277520130200291592002801593650001501621650001601636650001501652650000901667650002601676650001101702650001601713653001501729653003501744653002601779653001101805653000801816700001801824700002201842700004001864700002301904700001901927700002801946700002901974700001902003700002902022700003302051700001902084700001602103700001702119700002902136700002002165700002402185700001902209700001902228700002502247700001802272700002402290710005002314773008602364856009002450852000902540655001202549IND60685235920221118102846.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068523592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Hye-Na14aThe regulatory landscape of biosimilars: WHO efforts and progress made from 2009 to 2019  ap. 1-9.  aNAL-light  aThe World Health Assembly in 2014 adopted a resolution that mandates both Member States and the WHO Secretariat to facilitate access to biotherapeutic products in a way that ensures their quality, safety and efficacy. The availability of biosimilars is expected to increase access to biotherapeutic products by providing more treatment options triggering competition which would lead to a consistent reduction in the average price of treatment. Since the WHO guidelines for regulatory evaluation of biosimilars were issued in 2009, WHO has provided immense effort towards harmonizing the terminology and the regulatory framework for biosimilars globally. This article describes the progress made and the regulatory landscape changes for biosimilars in 21 countries during the past ten years. Based on the information from regulators and from publicly available data, the following has been identified: 1) WHO guidelines have contributed to setting the regulatory framework for biosimilars in countries and increasing regulatory convergence at global level; 2) terminology used for biosimilars is more consistent than in the past; 3) biosimilars are now approved in all participating countries; and 4) the dominant product class for candidate biosimilars under development is monoclonal antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aguidelines 3ainformation 3alandscapes 3alead 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aprices 3aterminology 0aBiosimilar 0aSimilar biotherapeutic product 0aRegulatory guidelines 0aSurvey 0aWHO1 aThorpe, Robin1 aKneževic, Ivana,1 aBlades, Carolina Damas Rocha Zarate1 aCasas Levano, Mary1 aChew, Jing Yin1 aChilufya, Mumbi Bernice1 aChirachanakul, Parichard1 aChua, Hui Ming1 aFarahani, Ali Vasheghani1 aGhobrial, Mariam Raouf Wefky1 aHabahbeh, Suna1 aHamel, Hugo1 aKim, Gi Hyun1 aPerez Rodriguez, Violeta1 aPutri, Desi Eka1 aRodgers, Jacqueline1 aSavkina, Maria1 aSemeniuk, Oleh1 aSrivastava, Shraddha1 aWadhwa, Meenu1 aYamaguchi, Teruhide2 aSurvey participants from 19 countrieseauthor0 tBiologicals.g2020 May, v. 65 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2020.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245014200162300001600304520039900320592002800719650001400747650001400761650001600775651001500791653001600806653001500822653001400837653001500851653001400866653001500880700001400895700002200909773011900931856007801050852000901128655001201137IND60124244420221120050417.0151025e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012424442DNAL7 a10.4001/003.020.02082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrer-Suay, M.10aFirst Record of Alloxysta Förster from Madagascar, with Descriptions of Two New Species (Hymenoptera: Cynipoidea: Figitidae: Charipinae)  ap. 222-228.  aThe genus Alloxysta is recorded for the first time from Madagascar, with the description of two new species: Alloxysta antananarivoi Ferrer-Suay & Pujade-Villar sp. n. and Alloxysta antsirananae Ferrer-Suay & Pujade-Villar sp. n.

We report the synthesis of three highly photostable polymers (PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF₂) and their suitability for use in high-performance OPV cells. Under 1 sunlight of illumination in air for 10 h, these polymer films demonstrated remarkably high photostability compared to that of PTB7, a representative polymer in the OPV field. While the PDTBDT-BZ, PDTBDT-BZF, and PDTBDT-BZF₂ polymer films maintained 97, 90, and 96% photostability, respectively, a PTB7 film exhibited only 38% photostability under the same conditions. We ascribed the high photostability of the polymers to both the intrinsically photostable chemical moieties and the dense packing of alkyl side chains and planar backbone polymer chains, which prevents oxygen diffusion into the PDTBDT-BZ films. This work demonstrates the high photostability of planar PDTBDT-BZ series polymers composed of photostable DTBDT and BZ moieties and suggests a design rule to synthesize highly photostable photovoltaic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afilms (materials) 3alighting 3amoieties 3aoxygen 3aphotostability 3apolymers 3asolar radiation1 aSong, Hyeng Gun1 aJung, Hyeseung1 aKim, Myung

A higher occurrence of PBDEs was found in all the analyzed samples, while MeO-PBDEs were only detected in a few ones and the levels of emerging pollutants were relatively low. In contrast, hexabromobenzene was found in almost all samples at concentrations ranging between non detected and 0.2 ng g−1 wet weight (w.w.). Salmon, sole, hake, cod and tuna showed the highest concentrations of ΣPBDEs (>0.8 ng g−1 w.w.), while mussel was the species with the highest level of MeO-PBDEs (1.5 ng g−1 w.w.). The dietary exposure of BFRs through consumption of these 10 species of fish and shellfish by the population of Tarragona County was estimated for different subpopulations, classified according to age and gender. Furthermore, calculations were performed in upper-, middle- and lower-bound risk scenarios. According to our data, the current concentrations of BFRs in fish and shellfish suggest no significant health risks for the consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary exposure 3afish consumption 3aflame retardants 3agas chromatography 3agender 3ahake 3ahumans 3amussels 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3arisk 3ashellfish 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicology 3atuna 3aSpain 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aFish and shellfish 0aGC-MS 0aPLE 0aDietary intake1 aVilavert, Lolita1 aDomingo, José L.1 aPocurull, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5123-995X1 aBorrull, Francesc1 aNadal, Martí,0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 June, v. 104 p.48-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165300002000284520107200304592002801376596008401404596011001488596010901598596008801707596008901795596008301884650001601967650001301983650000901996650001702005650002102022650001502043650001802058650001702076650001302093700005402106700001502160700001802175700001502193700001802208773015502226856008302381852000902464655001202473IND60730378320221118042529.0211029e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073037832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11334-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Danhong10aCFD investigation on gas–solid two-phase flow of dust removal characteristics for cartridge filter: a case study  ap. 13243-13263.  aThe filter cartridge dust collector has been widely used in industry, but the influence of its internal structure on its operation effects is rarely studied. FLUENT software was used to simulate the influence of different air volume and permeability values on the gas–solid two-phase flow of dust removal characteristics for a filter cartridge. The results show that when the air volume of the fan was greater than 1600 m³/h, the increase in the dust reduction rate was not obvious, and the high-velocity airflow filled the entire dust removal chamber, which was conducive to the filter using the largest effective filtration area to remove dust; the optimal air volume was 1600 m³/h. Furthermore, the dust removal effect gradually became worse when the porosity was higher than 0.65, but the fluidity of the internal air was poor when it was lower than 0.65. The optimum porosity was 0.65. A simulated validation analysis was conducted using the above optimal parameters. As the proportion of particles below 2 μm increased, the dust removal effect worsened.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant no. 51774198, 51904171cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aGrant no.

First, the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the excimer over that of the monomer, namely the IE/IM ratio, was obtained from the fluorescence spectra. Second, the product ⟨kbₗₒb × Nbₗₒb⟩ was obtained from the fluorescence blob model (FBM) analysis of the fluorescence decays. Both IE/IM and ⟨kbₗₒb × Nbₗₒb⟩ yielded similar values when expressed in terms of moles of pyrene per backbone atom for Py-Amylose and Py-PMA. Since IE/IM and ⟨kbₗₒb × Nbₗₒb⟩ reflect the efficiency of pyrene excimer formation, the similar behavior observed for both parameters obtained for rigid amylose and flexible PMA could only be rationalized by postulating that amylose adopted a compact helical conformation in DMSO. To confirm whether this was possible, molecular mechanics optimizations were conducted with the HyperChem program on Py-Amylose assuming a helical conformation for amylose in DMSO. Two pyrene labels were found to overlap properly, and thus form excimer efficiently, if they were separated by no more than five anhydroglucose units up and down the amylose helix around the anhydroglucose unit bearing the reference pyrene label. This result suggested that excimer formation would not occur if two pyrene labels were separated by more than 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 anhydroglucose units, in perfect agreement with our findings that ⟨Nbₗₒb⟩ obtained from the FBM analysis of the fluorescence decays acquired with the Py-Amylose solutions in DMSO equaled 11 ± 2. The good agreement between simulations and experiments led to the conclusion that amylose must adopt a helical conformation in DMSO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amechanics 3amodels1 aDuhamel, Jean0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Oct. 25, v. 49, no. 20 p.7965-7974dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b016143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245010400160520166000264592002801924650003001952650001801982650002202000650001102022650000902033650002802042650001602070650002102086651001502107651001502122653003902137653001702176653001102193653002602204653001602230653002902246700001302275700001602288700001602304700001402320700001302334700001502347773011502362856008402477852000902561655001202570IND60769471620221120064858.0220523e20220531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076947162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1075492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Y.10aPlanning water-food-ecology nexus system under uncertainty: Tradeoffs and synergies in Central Asia  aVicious competition for limited water resources hinders the synergetic and sustainable development of Central Asian countries, which further threatens food security and exacerbates ecological degradation. In this study, a copula-based bi-level decentralized programming (CBDP) method is developed and applied to planning water-food-ecology (WFE) nexus system. CBDP has advantages in balancing tradeoffs between different decision levels, analyzing synergies among multiple managers and reflecting joint risks of interrelated uncertain parameters. Then, a CBDP-WFE model is formulated for Central Asia, where the upper-level model aims to maximize system benefit for the region (i.e. regional-scale), and the lower-level model involves five objectives to maximize five countries’ benefits (i.e. national-scale) respectively. Totally 108 scenarios are designed to analyze the impacts of joint constraint-violation risk, agricultural irrigation efficiency, and ecological water demand. Results reveal that (i) improving agricultural irrigation efficiency can optimize the water allocation pattern as well as increase the system benefit; (ii) in order to restore the regional eco-environment, the proportion of ecological water allocation should increase from 7% (of the current level) to 14.9–23.8% (by 2050); (iii) water allocations to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan should be properly controlled especially when available water is scarce. The results are helpful for managers in not only making decisions of water allocation among multiple users and countries but also gaining insight into synergetic management of WFE nexus under various system conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental degradation 3afood security 3airrigated farming 3amodels 3arisk 3asustainable development 3auncertainty 3awater allocation 3aTajikistan 3aUzbekistan 0aBi-level decentralized programming 0aCentral Asia 0aCopula 0aSynergetic management 0aUncertainty 0aWater-food-ecology nexus1 aLi, Y.P.1 aHuang, G.H.1 aZhang, Y.F.1 aLiu, Y.R.1 aWang, H.1 aDing, Y.K.0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 May 31, v. 266 p.107549-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1075493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245020100176300002000377520175600397592002802153650001102181650001902192650002502211650002502236650001102261650002602272650001702298650001802315650001102333650002202344650001102366650001402377650002902391650001302420650001002433651001702443700002002460700005902480700002402539700001902563773015502582856008202737852000902819655001202828IND60730378620221118042646.0211029e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073037862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11370-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIorember, Paul Terhemba14aThe influence of renewable energy use, human capital, and trade on environmental quality in South Africa: multiple structural breaks cointegration approach [Erratum: March 2021, v.28(11), p.13175]  ap. 13162-13174.  aRecent economic and environmental literature suggests that the current state of energy use in South Africa amidst rapid growing population is unsustainable. Researchers in this area mostly focus on the effect of fossil energy use on carbon (CO₂) emission, which represents only an aspect of environmental quality. In contrast, the current study evaluates the influence of renewable energy use, human capital, and trade on ecological footprint––a more comprehensive measure of environmental quality. To this end, the study employs multiple structural breaks cointegration tests (Maki cointegration tests), dynamic unrestricted error correction model through Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, and VECM Granger causality tests. The results of the Maki cointegration tests reveal the existence of a cointegration between the variables in all the models with evidence of multiple structural breaks. Further, the ARDL results divulge that an increase in renewable energy use, human capital, and trade improves environmental quality through a decrease in ecological footprint, while an increase in income stimulates ecological footprint. Moreover, causal relationship is found, running from all the variables to renewable energy and trade flow in the long run, while in the short run, economic growth causes ecological footprint. Trade is found to Granger-cause human capital, while human capital causes renewable energy. Additionally, human capital, renewable energy, and economic growth are predictors of trade. The study therefore recommends South African policymakers to consider the importance of renewable energy, human capital development, and trade as a policy option to reduce ecological footprint and improve environmental quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aenvironmental quality 3afossil fuels 3ahuman capital 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3aresearch 3atrade 3aSouth Africa1 aJelilov, Gylych1 aUsman, Ojonugwa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6459-98981 aIşık, Abdurrahman1 aÇelik, Bilal,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Mar., v. 28, no. 11 p.13162-13174dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11370-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010800175300001200283520137100295592002801666650001701694650002501711650001701736650002501753650001301778650001501791650002001806650001201826650001501838650001301853650002201866650001401888650001501902650001401917650002501931650001201956653001101968653001701979653002701996653001202023653001402035653001102049653000802060653000802068653000802076653000802084653000802092653000702100653000702107653000702114653000702121653000702128653000702135653000702142653000702149700014702156700002602303700001902329700013402348773011902482856008502601852000902686655001202695IND60634119520221118013524.0191118e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063411952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiles, Francisco A.10aRelationship between ureidic/amidic metabolism and antioxidant enzymatic activities in legume seedlings  ap. 1-8.  aUreides are nitrogenous compounds with a special function in some legume under nitrogen fixing conditions, the ureidic legumes. In this group, ureides are the predominant nitrogen transport molecule from nodules to the upper part, whereas amidic legumes use amides as nitrogen transport compounds. In this study, the ureide levels have been analysed in seedlings from four ureidic and four amidic legume plants. It has been found that the differentiation among ureide and amide plants already exists in seedlings during early seedling development, with high levels of ureide and allantoinase activity in cotyledons and embryonic axes from ureide plants. Since ureides have been implicated in the response of plant to several stress, total hydrosoluble antioxidant capacity and the levels of several antioxidant activities have been determined and compared among these two legume groups. The total antioxidant capacity did not follow any differential pattern in cotyledons or embryonic axes for the analysed plants. The levels of superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase in both embryonic axes and cotyledons are statistical different between amide and ureide seedlings, whereas the catalase activity was similar among these groups of plants. We discuss than amides and ureides could follow different strategies to protect against oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallantoinase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acotyledons 3aenzyme activity 3alegumes 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aureides 0aUreide 0aAllantoinase 0aAntioxidant activities 0aLegumes 0aSeedlings 0aALNase 0aAPX 0aDAI 0aGPX 0aSOD 0aROS 0aPv 0aVr 0aGM 0aVu 0aLc 0aPs 0aCa 0aLs1 aGalvez-Valdivieso, Gregorio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4886-8952 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4886-8952 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4886-89521 aGuerrero-Casado, Jose1 aPineda, Manuel1 aPiedras, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-0546 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-0546 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2955-05460 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2019 May, v. 138 p.1-8dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008200161300001600243520183200259592002802091650001202119650002502131650001602156650001002172650001302182650001202195650001302207650001602220651001002236651001202246653001502258653001602273653001002289653001402299653001502313700001902328700001902347773011902366856007802485852000902563655001202572IND60124245220221120050441.0151025e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012424522DNAL7 a10.4001/003.020.02192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsipitan, A.A.10aStimulation of Queen Bee Rearing in a Queenless Colony in Kenya Top-Bar Hives  ap. 300-307.  aThe study evaluates the Sommerford method to stimulate queen bee rearing in a queenless bee colony between August 2008 and March 2009 and repeated between August 2009 and March 2010. The study was conducted in Kenya top-bar hives placed at two locations in Ogun State, Nigeria. The first location was at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, and the second was Olupakun village, Ogun State. There were two treatments; the first was the parent hives from where four top-bars with queen bee, brood cells, some worker bees, and drones were removed and replaced with four empty top bars. The second treatment was uncolonized hives (nuclei) that received the top bars with queen bee, brood cells, some worker bees and drones. The control was colonized and undisturbed Kenya top-bar hives. The treatment and control hives were replicated four times and arranged using completely randomized design, with each hive placed at a distance of 50 m apart. Data collected were subjected to analysis of variance and significant means were separated using least significant difference. The honey yield, weight of dried pressed comb, number of combs with brood cells and total number of combs were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 2010. Likewise, the honey yield, weight of dried pressed comb, number of ripe harvested honey combs, number of combs with brood cells and total number of combs were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in Olupakun village. Bee colonies were established in the parent and nuclei hives. A significantly (P < 0.05) higher honey yield, propolis yield, weight of dried pressed comb, number of ripe harvested combs and number of combs with brood cells was obtained in the control hives. The study shows that the Sommerford method could be used to stimulate worker bees in a queenless colony to rear a queen bee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aanalysis of variance 3abrood cells 3ahoney 3apropolis 3arearing 3avillages 3aworker bees 3aKenya 3aNigeria 0abee colony 0abrood cells 0acombs 0aqueen bee 0aSommerford1 aFagbenro, A.M.1 aMohammed, I.G.0 tAfrican entomology.g2012 Sept., v. 20, no. 2 p.300-307dEntomological Society of Southern Africax1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001%2F003.020.02193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245018300158300001600341520163900357592002801996650001102024650002402035650001702059650001402076650003102090650003302121650001602154650001202170700001402182700001402196700001502210700001602225700001602241700001802257700001402275773010202289856007502391852000902466655001202475IND60534231020221119175605.0160802e20150219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053423102DNAL7 a10.1021/ef502452r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zongxian10aCorrelation of Temperature-Programmed Oxidation with Microscopy for Quantitative Morphological Characterization of Thermal Cokes Produced from Pilot and Commercial Delayed Cokers  ap. 659-665.  aA wide series of thermal cokes obtained from commercial delayed cokers and a pilot coking plant have been investigated by polarized light microscopy observation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) technology. For discrimination of the characterization of the coke samples, the anisotropy degrees of the cokes are found to be considerably different. According to the series of runs in the pilot plant, the restricted mesophase development in thermal cokes could be ascribed to the increasing severity of coking conditions. A previous proposed signal analysis procedure was then applied to the TPO profiles of the cokes to quantitatively acquire parameters for further correlation. A fairly good linear dependency of optical texture index (OTI) upon the proportion of anisotropic carbon species from TPO (correlation coefficient of 0.984) was observed. All of the results obtained in this and our previous (Chen, K.; Xue, Z.; Liu, H.; Guo, A.; Wang, Z. A temperature-programmed oxidation method for quantitative characterization of the thermal cokes morphology. Fuel 2013, 113, 274−279) studies fall within a 95% confidence interval when the dependence of OTI upon the proportion from TPO is considered, therefore clearly demonstrating the validity and adaptability on the convenient determination of the proportion of anisotropic carbon species from TPO for the coke samples ranging from laboratory sources to pilot and even commercial origins. The distribution map of cokes established in this study could be used for quantitatively characterizing the morphology of various thermal cokes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aconfidence interval 3afossil fuels 3aoxidation 3apolarized light microscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atexture1 aXue, Peng1 aChen, Kun1 aGuo, Aijun1 aLin, Cunhui1 aKong, Dehui1 aSong, Zhengda1 aBo, Yawen0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Feb. 19, v. 29, no. 2 p.659-665dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef502452r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245009900179520191300278592002802191650001902219650001502238650001702253650001202270650002402282650002102306650002102327653003802348653001902386653002202405653001702427653002402444653002302468700001802491700001802509773011502527856008402642852000902726655001202735IND60769471920221120064922.0220523e20220531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076947192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1075792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarzi-Naftchali, Abdullah14aThe life cycle assessment of subsurface drainage performance under rice-canola cropping system  aThe life cycle assessment (LCA) concept is a widely used tool to assess the environmental aspects of any activity throughout its life cycle. This study is the first application of LCA for assessing the agro-environmental sustainability of subsurface drainage systems under rice-canola cropping rotation. The systems included D0.65L15, D0.65L30, and D0.9L30, consisting of two depths (D=0.65 and 0.9 m) and two spacing (L= 15 and 30 m) and a bi-level drainage system with alternate depths of 0.9 and 0.65 m with 15 m spacing (Bilevel). A paddy plot with conventional surface drainage and similar cropping system was considered as control (Control). Two water management strategies, including mid-season drainage (MSD) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD), were practiced during rice-growing period. Free drainage (FD) was adopted during canola-growing period. Required field data were collected during 2011–2016, including four rice-canola-growing cycles (two MSD-FD cycles and two AWD-FD cycles). Using the LCA concept, the effectiveness of different drainage systems were assessed under the cycles of MSD-FD and AWD-FD. The AWD-FD system showed 7% less environmental impacts than MSD-FD. Also, AWD-FD reduced human health, climate change, and resource depletion indicators by 7.7%, 9.9%, and 8.4%, respectively, compared with MSD-FD, which improved the ecosystem quality index by 7.2%. The Bilevel, D0.9L30, D0.65L30, and D0.65L15 drainage systems, respectively, reduced the environmental impacts by 11.8%, 11.1%, 2.6%, and 5.9% under AWD-FD and 25.4%, 17.6%, 25.1%, and 14.1% under MSD-FD compared with Control. On average, Bilevel reduced the environmental impacts by 18.6% compared with the conventional surface drainage system. Based on the results, the LCA concept can be used as a suitable tool to evaluate the performance of subsurface drainage systems before implementation on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3ahuman health 3apaddies 3asubsurface drainage 3asurface drainage 3awater management 0aAgro-environmental sustainability 0aClimate change 0aEcosystem quality 0aHuman health 0aDrainage management 0aResource depletion1 aMotevali, Ali1 aKeikha, Mahdi0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 May 31, v. 266 p.107579-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.1075793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011400168300001400282520128100296592002801577650002501605650001301630650002501643650001801668650001501686650001001701650001401711650002501725650001401750650001801764650001901782650001701801650001001818650002201828650001001850700002101860700002601881700002301907700002201930773010501952856008302057852000902140655001202149IND60084727820221122183302.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2010.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenters, Nikki10aIsolation of previously uncultured rumen bacteria by dilution to extinction using a new liquid culture medium  ap. 52-60.  aA new anaerobic medium that mimics the salts composition of rumen fluid was used in conjunction with a dilution method of liquid culture to isolate fermentative bacteria from the rumen of a grass-fed sheep. The aim was to inoculate a large number of culture tubes each with a mean of <1 culturable cell, which should maximize the number of cultures that develop from a single bacterium. This minimizes the effort that has to be put into purifying the resultant cultures. Of 1000 tubes, 139 were growth positive. Of the 93 that were able to be subcultured, 54 (58%) appeared to be pure cultures. The phylogenetic placements of these 54 cultures, together with another 6 cultures obtained from a preliminary study, were determined. Using a criterion of <93% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to a previously named bacterium as a proxy for defining a new genus, 27 (45%) of the 60 cultures belonged to 14 potentially novel genera. Many of these had 16S rRNA genes that shared >97% sequence identity to genes of uncultured bacteria detected in various gastrointestinal environments. This strategy has therefore allowed us to cultivate many novel rumen bacteria, opening the way to overcoming the lack of cultures of many of the groups detected using cultivation-independent methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3achemical composition 3aculture media 3aextinction 3agenes 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fluids 3asalts 3asequence analysis 3asheep1 aHenderson, Gemma1 aJeyanathan, Jeyamalar1 aKittelmann, Sandra1 aJanssen, Peter H.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2011 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.52-60dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2010.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012300164300001400287520169800301592002801999650001502027650002002042650001802062650001202080650001102092650001402103650001102117650000902128650001302137651001002150653001102160653003502171653002402206653002602230653002402256700001602280700001302296700001702309700001502326773012102341856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60763117020221122001947.0220421e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076311702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2021.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Qingqing10aPhenol degradation in waters with high iodide level by layered double hydroxide-peroxodisulfate: Pathways and products  ap. 14-24.  aRecently, layered double hydroxide-peroxodisulfate (LDH-PDS) as an advanced oxidation system can effectively remove organics by the pathway of free radical. However, little has been known if there is a potential risk regarding the formation of high toxic iodine byproducts through another pathway when LDH-PDS is used in high iodide waters at coastal areas. Therefore, this study investigated phenol degradation pathways and transformation products to evaluate both removal mechanism and potential risk by LDH-PDS in high iodide waters. The results showed that in LDH-PDS system, with the degradation of PDS, phenol degraded till below detection limit in 1 hr in the presence of iodide, while PDS and phenol were hardly degraded in the absence of iodide, indicating iodide accelerated the transformation of PDS and the degradation of phenol. What is more, it reached the highest phenol removal efficiency under the condition of 100 mg/L LDH, 0.1 mmol/L PDS and 1.0 mmol/L iodide. In LDH-PDS system, iodide was rapidly oxidized by the highly active interlayer PDS, resulting in the formation of reactive iodine including hypoiodic acid, iodine and triiodide instead of free radicals, which contributed rapid degradation of phenol. However, unfortunately toxic iodophenols were detected. Specifically, 2-iodophenol and 4-iodophenol were formed firstly, afterwards 2,4-diiodophenol and 2,6-diiodophenol were produced, and finally iodophenols and diiodophenols gradually decreased and 2,4,6-Triiodophenol were produced. These results indicated that LDH-PDS should avoid to use in high iodide waters to prevent toxic iodine byproduct formation although iodide can accelerate phenol degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3adetection limit 3afree radicals 3aiodides 3aiodine 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3arisk 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aIodide 0aLayered double hydroxide (LDH) 0aNon-radical pathway 0aPeroxodisulfate (PDS) 0aSynergic activation1 aGao, Peiyue1 aLi, Ning1 aWang, Feifei1 aHuang, Xin0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 June, v. 116 p.14-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245012800162300001600290520142300306592002801729650001601757650001001773650001201783650002001795650001901815651001701834651001301851653002001864653002701884653002401911773011901935856007802054852000902132655001202141IND60124245420221120050345.0151025e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012424542DNAL7 a10.4001/003.020.02232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesołowska, W.10aRedescriptions of Some Salticid Species (Araneae: Salticidae) from South Africa and Zimbabwe Described by G. and E.

A comparison between observations and model predictions  ap. 179-189.  a2019-12-06  aPeas were grown in the glasshouse for 29 d in duplicate 1 m tall containers packed with soil at field capacity (a matric potential of â0Â·005 MPa) to a bulk density of 1Â·30 Mg mâ3 and with an initial penetration resistance (PR) of 0Â·35 MPa. Counts of new root contacts on the sides of the containers and matric potential (Î¨m) measurements at 0Â·1 m depth increments were made every two days. Although the plants were not watered, matric potential was never less than â0Â·041 MPa and was unlikely to have directly limited root growth, but it was used as a predictor of PR and hence of the effect of PR on root growth rate. The effect of PR on root growth was predicted using experimentally determined relationships between root growth rate and PR, and PR and Î¨m. These results were used with the ROOTMAP root growth model to give two different model scenarios: (1) variable resistance (VR), allowing mechanical impedance to vary with time and depth in line with the observed values of Î¨m and (2) constant resistance (CR), maintaining mechanical impedance at its value at the start of the experiment. CR predictions gave a gross overestimate of the rate at which new root contacts were made on the container walls, whereas VR predictions agreed with experimental observations to within the limits of accuracy of the model and the observations. The comparison between CR and VR predictions gives a clear demonstration of bow the increase in soil strength caused by roots drying the profile can result in a reduction in the size and extent of the whole root system.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeas 3aresistance to penetration 3asoil strength 3amodels 3abulk density 3aroot growth 3afield capacity 3aPisum sativum 3acontainers 3aroots 3agreenhouses 0aimpedance1 aMULLINS, C.

Three similar pheretimoid earthworms (genera of Amynthas, Metaphire) are important invasive species in North American forests. They often lack the diagnostic morphological characters and their hatchlings, juveniles, and cocoons are impossible to identify to species. We present a multiplex PCR protocol that accurately scores the three species and is inexpensive compared to other molecular methods. Multiplex PCR identification was as accurate as mitochondrial COI barcoding and better than morphological scoring. The method uses unique PCR fragments of different lengths for each species from the COI gene. The multiplex PCR correctly identified embryos within cocoons, juveniles, and adults of Amynthas agrestis, Amynthas tokioensis and Metaphire hilgendorfi, with 100% accuracy. Comparisons of COI sequences (GenBank) with other populations of the same species (including specimens from their native range in Japan), and many other species of earthworms showed the primers always amplify only the three target species. The multiplex PCR method is rapid and costs a fraction of standard COI barcoding. Also, tiny scratches of cells from living specimens can be entered directly into the PCR for easy identification, reducing costs even further by avoiding DNA extraction, and allows the earthworms to be conserved for ecological experiments. To show the utility of the method we present the hatching phenology of the three species which could not be done by morphology. The three species begin hatching at the same time with A. tokioensis producing the most abundant juveniles early in the season. The method facilitates studies on biogeography, phenology, life histories, and resource partitioning among the three co-occurring earthworm species.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Marketing Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005826  cEppley Foundation for Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008887  cUniversity of Vermontdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000109410 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmynthas agrestis 3aDNA 3aJapan 3abiogeography 3aearthworms 3agenes 3ainvasive species 3amitochondria 3aphenology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil ecology 0aPheretimoid 0aMultiplex PCR method 0aAmynthas ecology 0aMorphological vs molecular identification1 aSchall, Jos J.1 aKeough, Cheryl A.1 aWen, Yiyi1 aGörres, Josef H.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2021 May, v. 161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.1038223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013600166520155200302592002801854650002201882650002001904650001001924650003301934650001001967650001801977650002201995650001202017650004302029650001702072650002702089653002902116653001902145653002802164653001702192653002502209653002502234700001702259700001402276700001402290700001902304700001902323700001702342700001502359773012502374856008302499852000902582655001202591IND60685236820221118102654.0210401e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068523682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2020.1104292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing'an10aGH and GHR gene cloning, expression and their associations with growth-related traits of the barbel chub (Squaliobarbus curriculus)  aGrowth hormone (ScGH) and growth hormone receptor (ScGHR) genes from the barbel chub (Squaliobarbus curriculus), in addition to their cDNAs, were cloned. The associations between their mRNA expression levels and growth-related traits were analysed, and the differences in the levels of expression of growth regulation-related genes between the largest and smallest individuals were compared. The full-length 1182-bp cDNA of ScGH contained a 633-bp open reading frame (ORF), and the length of the gene had 2492 bp. The full-length 2825-bp cDNA of ScGHRa contained a 1818-bp ORF, and the gene had 6970 bp. The full-length 2822-bp cDNA of ScGHRb contained a 1737-bp ORF, and the gene had 8149 bp. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that ScGH was only expressed in the pituitary. ScGHRa was expressed predominantly in muscle, and the expression level of ScGHRb was the highest in the liver. The ScGHRa mRNA levels in the muscle were significantly negatively correlated with the caudal peduncle length. However, no correlation between growth-related traits and ScGH and ScGHRb expression levels were found. Pituitary ScGH, liver GHRb and liver insulin-like growth factor I (igf-1) expression levels were significantly higher in the largest individuals than those in the smallest S. curriculus individuals. Contrarily, the largest individuals had significantly lower expression levels of muscle igf-1 and liver myog than the smallest individuals. Overall, our results provide novel molecular information for growth-regulation study of S. curriculus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3amuscles 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asomatotropin 3asomatotropin receptors 0aSqualiobarbus curriculus 0aGrowth hormone 0aGrowth hormone receptor 0aGene cloning 0aGrowth-related trait 0aCorrelation analysis1 aLi, Dongfang1 aZhao, Xin1 aSun, Tong1 aJin, Shengzhen1 aWang, Hongquan1 aXiao, Tiaoyi1 aLi, Yaoguo0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 June, v. 243-244 p.110429-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2020.1104293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012300170300001800293520138000311592002801691650002701719650001301746650001901759650001101778650003601789650006601825650001301891650001601904700002301920700001901943773010501962856008602067852000902153655001202162IND60578243820221117025850.0170812e20161025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057824382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b017222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalivene, Laura10aMechanistic Insights into the Organopolymerization of N-Methyl N-Carboxyanhydrides Mediated by N-Heterocyclic Carbenes  ap. 7777-7784.  aWe report on a DFT investigation of initiation, propagation, and termination in the organopolymerization of N-methyl N-carboxyanhydrides toward cyclic poly(N-substituted glycine)s, promoted by N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC). Calculations support the experimentally based hypothesis of two competing initiation pathways. The first leading to formation of a zwitterionic adduct by nucleophilic addition of the NHC to one of the carbonyl groups of monomer. The second via acid–base reactivity, starting with the NHC promoted abstraction of a proton from the methylene group of the monomer, leading to an ion-pair-type adduct, followed by nucleophilic attack of the adduct to a new monomer molecule. Chain elongation can proceed from both the initiation adducts via nucleophilic attack of the carbamate chain-end to a new monomer molecule via concerted elimination of CO₂ from the carbamate chain-end. Energy barriers along all the considered termination pathways are remarkably higher that the energy barrier along the chain elongation pathways, consistent with the quasi-living experimental behavior. Analysis of the competing termination pathways suggests that the cyclic species determined via MALDI-TOF MS experiments consists of a zwitterionic species deriving from nucleophilic attack of the N atom of the carbamate chain-end to the CO group bound to the NHC moiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-substituted glycines 3acarbenes 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amoieties 3azwitterions1 aAl Ghamdi, Miasser1 aCavallo, Luigi0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Oct. 25, v. 49, no. 20 p.7777-7784dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b017223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015300168300001600321520132400337592002801661650001801689650001801707650001901725650001501744650001301759650001901772650001201791650000901803650000901812650002001821650001101841650002701852650001501879653001501894653001901909653001101928653000801939653001101947653001301958700001901971700002201990700002002012700002202032773011202054856008202166852000902248655001202257IND60568597420221121112451.0190401e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056859742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIezzi, Sebastian10aRelationship between ivermectin concentrations at the injection site, muscle and fat of steers treated with traditional and long-acting preparations  ap. 319-321.  aIvermectin (IVM) is broad-spectrum compound active against endo and ecto-parasites of clinical relevance in veterinary and human medicine. It is commercially available to use in livestock animals as injectable formulations containing 1% IVM and also as a concentrated (3.15%) long-acting (LA) preparation. The potential risk of the presence of high concentrations of drug residues in muscle tissue at the injection site is therefore a concern. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the IVM residual concentrations at the injection site, in comparison to the untreated contralateral neck (control muscle) and in fat from cattle treated with different preparations. Healthy steers received one of the following subcutaneous treatments in the neck area: Group A: IVM-LA 3.15% preparation and Group B: IVM 1%. After a withdrawal period for each formulation the animals were sent to the slaughterhouse. IVM concentrations at the injection site were detected among animals treated with the LA formulation, with high residual concentrations of IVM (between 15 and 141 μg/kg) in the injection site of two steers. However, the residual concentrations of IVM at the injection site obtained after the subcutaneous administration of the LA preparation do not represent a toxicological risk to consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug residues 3aectoparasites 3ainjection site 3aivermectin 3amedicine 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3aneck 3arisk 3aslaughterhouses 3asteers 3asubcutaneous injection 3atoxicology 0aIvermectin 0aInjection site 0aMuscle 0aFat 0aCattle 0aResidues1 aPurslow, Peter1 aSara, Christensen1 aLanusse, Carlos1 aLifschitz, Adrian0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 July, v. 105 p.319-321dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245007400162300001400236520079400250592002801044650001601072650002001088650001601108650001201124650001101136650001501147650002401162650001301186650002801199650002201227700001401249773010501263856008301368852000901451655001201460IND60084728020221120220943.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008472802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2010.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hao10aPrediction of thermophilic proteins using feature selection technique  ap. 67-70.  aThe thermostability of proteins is particularly relevant for enzyme engineering. Developing a computational method to identify mesophilic proteins would be helpful for protein engineering and design. In this work, we developed support vector machine based method to predict thermophilic proteins using the information of amino acid distribution and selected amino acid pairs. A reliable benchmark dataset including 915 thermophilic proteins and 793 non-thermophilic proteins was constructed for training and testing the proposed models. Results showed that 93.8% thermophilic proteins and 92.7% non-thermophilic proteins could be correctly predicted by using jackknife cross-validation. High predictive successful rate exhibits that this model can be applied for designing stable proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3adata collection 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprotein engineering 3aproteins 3asupport vector machines 3athermal stability1 aChen, Wei0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2011 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.67-70dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2010.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100005800180245010600238300001800344500002000362506007600382520173100458592002802189596004502217596001502262596002102277596003102298506003702329650001302366650001702379650001402396650002402410650001002434650002402444650000902468650001102477650000902488650001302497650001102510650001202521650001102533650001602544650004302560651001502603700001602618700001602634700001602650700002302666700001102689700001202700773013002712856007302842852000902915655001202924IND60615832820221207093914.0181012e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061583282DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.132652doi7 aPMC65016122pmcid7 a310732602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabir, Farzana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0518-067210aImpact of aerosols on reservoir inflow: A case study for Big Creek Hydroelectric System in California  ap. 3365-3390.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAccurate and reliable reservoir inflow forecast is instrumental to the efficient operation of the hydroelectric power systems. It has been discovered that natural and anthropogenic aerosols have a great influence on meteorological variables such as temperature, snow water equivalent, and precipitation, which in turn impact the reservoir inflow. Therefore, it is imperative for us to quantify the impact of aerosols on reservoir inflow and to incorporate the aerosol models into future reservoir inflow forecasting models. In this paper, a comprehensive framework was developed to quantify the impact of aerosols on reservoir inflow by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) and a dynamic regression model. The statistical dynamic regression model produces forecasts for reservoir inflow based on the meteorological output variables from the WRF‐Chem model. The case study was performed on the Florence Lake and Lake Thomas Alva Edison of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project in the San Joaquin Region. The simulation results show that the presence of aerosols results in a significant reduction of annual reservoir inflow by 4–14%. In the summer, aerosols reduce precipitation, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt that leads to a reduction in inflow by 11–26%. In the spring, aerosols increase temperature and snowmelt which leads to an increase in inflow by 0.6–2%. Aerosols significantly reduce the amount of inflow in the summer when the marginal value of water is extremely high and slightly increase the inflow in the spring when the run‐off risk is high. In summary, the presence of aerosols is detrimental to the optimal utilization of hydroelectric power systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aEPC-14-064cCalifornia Energy Commission  cNASA ACMAP  aAGS-1701526cNSF  a80NSSC18K0985cNASA TASNPP0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaerosols 3acase studies 3achemistry 3ahydroelectric power 3alakes 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3aspring 3astreams 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweather research and forecasting model 3aCalifornia1 aYu, Nanpeng1 aYao, Weixin1 aWu, Longtao1 aJiang, Jonathan H.1 aGu, Yu1 aSu, Hui0 tHydrological processes.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 32, no. 22 p.3365-3390dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938466x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.132653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003100155245029600186300001400482520209300496592002802589650002402617650001202641650001102653650001302664650001502677650001802692650001002710650000902720650001402729650001902743650001302762650001302775650001402788650002002802650001302822650001802835650001702853650001102870653002702881653001402908653002202922653001402944653001702958653001802975653001802993653004003011700002303051700002603074700002503100700002603125700002303151773009703174856009003271852000903361655001203370IND60629042320221118153453.0190916e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062904232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShomorin, George Oluwaseun10aEvaluation of wedge wire screen as a new tool for faeces collection in digestibility assessment in fish: The impact of nutrient leaching on apparent digestibility of nitrogen, carbon and sulphur from fishmeal, soybean meal and rapeseed meal-based diets in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 81-87.  aThe study was carried out to evaluate wedge wire screen as a potential tool for collecting fish faeces from the tank outlet water. Apparent digestibility (AD) estimates of carbon (ADC), nitrogen (ADN), sulphur (ADS), organic material (ADORG) and individual amino acids obtained by the wire screen were compared with stripping. Three diets, with fishmeal, soybean meal (SBM) or rapeseed meal (RSM) as main protein source were extruded and fed to triplicate groups of 120-g rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Faeces were obtained by gentle stripping from the distal abdomen, and by collection from a wedge wire screen 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min post feeding. ADORG, ADN and ADS obtained by collection on the screen were significantly (P < .05) higher than those obtained by stripping, except for some values for ADC. Differences in AD between stripping and faeces collected with the wire screen were lower than reported for other methods of collection from water media. Most of the increase in AD of nutrients for wedge wire screen occurred during the first 15 min after defecation. The ADORG, ADC, ADN and ADS were lowest in the RSM diet. The AD of amino acids followed the same pattern as ADN. ADS in the rapeseed diet was particularly low (54.7%), compared to the fishmeal (72.4%) and SBM diet (70.1%). In addition to AD of cysteine, low digestibility of glucosinolates, its degradation products and other sulfonated components are likely reasons for the low ADS. Faeces from the RSM based diet had higher dry matter (DM) concentration than the SBM based diet. Faecal DM recovery for SBM was lowest among the diets for both collection methods. The low DM recovery for the SBM faeces did not affect AD estimates of faeces at the different time intervals, possibly due to simultaneous leakage of nutrients and indigestible marker. In conclusion, the use of wedge wire screen for collection of faeces represents an interesting supplement to stripping. The AD estimates had low random variation and nutrient leaching during faeces collection were dependent on dietary composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aabdomen 3acarbon 3acysteine 3adefecation 3adigestibility 3afeces 3afish 3afish meal 3aglucosinolates 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aprotein sources 3arapeseed 3arapeseed meal 3asoybean meal 3asulfur 0aApparent digestibility 0aStripping 0aWedge wire screen 0aFish meal 0aSoybean meal 0aRapeseed meal 0aAntinutrients 0aRainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)1 aStorebakken, Trond1 aKraugerud, Olav Fjeld1 aØverland, Margareth1 aHansen, Bjørn Reidar1 aHansen, Jon Øvrum0 tAquaculture.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 504 p.81-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015800159300002000317520121600337592002801553650004401581650002201625650003701647650001501684650001501699650001401714650001401728650002301742650001301765650001301778650001401791650001301805650001201818650003301830650001901863650003701882700001801919700001501937700001601952700002001968773012401988856007402112852000902186655001202195IND60642053420221118025656.0190506e20170811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064205342DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06404g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Lijiang10aNovel poly(aniline-co-3-amino-4-methoxybenzoic acid) copolymer for the separation and recovery of Pd(ii) from the leaching liquor of automotive catalysts  ap. 39244-39257.  aIn this study, novel polyaniline-3-amino-4-methoxybenzoic acid (PANI–AMB) copolymers were prepared and used as adsorbents for the separation and recovery of Pd(ii) from a mixed solution containing Pt, Pd, and Rh. Batch sorption studies were carried out, and the main adsorption parameters were systematically investigated. Furthermore, the relevant thermodynamic parameters, isotherms, and kinetic models were also evaluated. Results revealed a high adsorption capacity of 278.5 mg g⁻¹ for Pd(ii). Separation factors βPd/Pₜ and βPd/Rₕ were 4.3 × 10³ and 5.3 × 10³, respectively. Results obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicated that the sorption of Pd(ii) occurs mainly by chelation between Pd(ii) and –NH–/–N/–COOH/–OCH₃ and is accompanied by a redox mechanism involving the reduction of Pd(ii) to Pd(0). The new PANI–AMB adsorbent showed efficient adsorption and separation of palladium from the leaching liquor of spent automotive catalysts, as well as good stability and reusability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3achelation 3acomposite polymers 3akinetics 3aleaching 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3arhodium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermodynamics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aZhang, Jinyan1 aZhang, Qin1 aChen, Muhan1 aHuang, Zhangjie0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 11, v. 7, no. 62 p.39244-39257dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06404g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015100171300001600322520159600338592002801934650001401962650002501976650001102001650002602012650002002038650001102058650001402069650001502083650001902098650001602117650001702133650002802150650001002178650001902188650002102207650002102228651001202249651001302261653001402274653001002288653001902298653002802317653003002345700001902375700001802394773009902412856008602511852000902597655001202606IND60537970820221116210438.0190412e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053797082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCloutier, Scott14aThe Sustainable Neighborhoods for Happiness Index (SNHI): A metric for assessing a community's sustainability and potential influence on happiness  ap. 147-152.  aThis paper describes the development of the Sustainable Neighborhoods for Happiness Index (SNHI): a tool to assess and compare how well individual cities, towns, neighborhoods and communities embrace sustainable practices and how these practices translate to opportunities for residents to pursue happiness. The SNHI is grounded in findings from primary literature and previous research suggesting associations between aspects of sustainable development and higher levels of self-reported happiness. Nine subsystems of community development were selected for the generation of the SNHI: water management, energy management, urban design, food management, business & economic development, waste management, buildings & infrastructure, transportation and community governance. SNHI scores were generated for sixteen US cities with data compiled from the Green City Index (2011) and the SustainLane US City Rankings (2007). A method was then developed to generate the Sustainable Neighborhoods for Happiness Distribution (SNHD) to plot future SNHI scores for comparison. The SNHI scoring methodology was then applied by collecting data for Athens, Georgia and Ithaca, New York. Our results suggest that San Francisco has the highest SNHI, while Detroit has the lowest and that Athens is just below and Ithaca just above the mean SNHI on the SNHD. The SNHI can serve as a unique tool for decision makers, community stakeholders, engineers, developers, architects, planners and researchers to assess the relative status of any neighborhood or community, with respect to development and happiness.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3acommunity development 3adata collection 3aenergy 3aengineers 3agovernance 3ainfrastructure 3aresearchers 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3atowns 3atransportation 3awaste management 3awater management 3aGeorgia 3aNew York 0aHappiness 0aIndex 0aSustainability 0aSustainable development 0aSustainable Neighborhoods1 aJambeck, Jenna1 aScott, Norman0 tEcological indicators.g2014 May, v. 40 p.147-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162300001600247520143300263592002801696596008801724596005801812650001501870650001501885650001401900650002001914650001901934650002401953650002301977650001502000650001102015650001402026650001002040650002302050650002102073650001102094650001302105650001902118650001102137700001802148700005902166773010902225856008102334852000902415655001202424IND60645299820221118000313.0190528e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064529982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-019-9962-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosen, Yan10aShort Ozonation of Lignocellulosic Waste as Energetically Favorable Pretreatment  ap. 292-301.  aLignocellulosic waste (here municipal trimmings) is a promising sustainable feedstock for ethanol production, but requires costly and polluting pretreatment, often resulting in toxic by-products. Ozonation, nonpolluting, effective pretreatment method, is not used commercially due to high energy requirements of ozone production at high ozone doses needed. Our results, however, demonstrated that low-dose ozonation (15 min, accumulated TOD = 318 mg L⁻¹) of water-submerged waste resulted in improved enzymatic saccharification efficiency (31% of cellulose) compared to a non-ozonated sample (12%) although only 20% of the lignin was removed. Ozonation up to 90 min resulted in better conversion however exceptionally long ozonation (6 h and beyond) resulted in reduced conversion. These results suggest that contrary to common hypothesis, short ozonation could offer an effective and feasible pretreatment method for high sugar release without the need for delignification. In addition, the ozonation process was accompanied by changes in absorbance, mainly at 280 nm, making it a useful tool for process monitoring. Net calculated energy balance was positive for all ozonation regimes, with increased process efficiency at lower ozone doses. Furthermore, ozonation can be generated on-site and on demand, enabling decentralized pretreatment operated near the feed source, thus overcoming transportation costs.  aPublisher supplied data  a214-11-006cIsraeli Ministry of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources  a132-3-4cIsraeli Ministry of Environmental Protection 3aabsorbance 3abyproducts 3acellulose 3adelignification 3aenergy balance 3aenergy requirements 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3alignin 3aozonation 3aozone 3aprocess monitoring 3asaccharification 3asugars 3atoxicity 3atransportation 3awastes1 aMamane, Hadas1 aGerchman, Yoram1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8637-95890 tBioEnergy research.g2019 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.292-301dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-019-9962-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012200168300001600290520118000306592002801486650002801514650003201542650002701574650001301601650002001614650001401634650001501648650002001663650001901683650003101702650003301733650002101766650001201787650001401799653002601813653002601839653002101865653002001886653001901906653002601925700001701951700001501968700001601983700002001999700002102019773008502040856008502125852000902210655001202219IND60554104620221120082847.0161024e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055410462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2014.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Lanlan10aPhysicochemical properties and film-forming ability of fish skin collagen extracted from different freshwater species  ap. 148-155.  aAcid soluble collagens (ASCs) were extracted from tilapia, grass carp and silver carp skins, and the physicochemical properties and film-forming ability of ASCs were examined. Similar amino acid composition and electrophoretic patterns were observed in the obtained skin ASCs, but differences were found in the peptide maps of collagen digested by V8 protease, trypsin and lysyl endopeptidase. The reduced viscosity value of tilapia skin ASC was higher than that of grass carp and silver carp skin ASCs at 25°C. Furthermore, the tensile strength of films based tilapia skin collagen was 51.24MPa, and much higher than that of films based grass carp or silver carp skin collagen. On the other hand, the nucleation time of fibril formation of skin collagen from tilapia, grass carp and silver carp was about 2min, 6min and 3min, respectively. The obvious coarser microstructure was found on the upper surface of films prepared from grass carp skin collagen by scanning electron microscopy. It is concluded that difference in the film-forming ability of collagen from freshwater fish skins could be correlated with the primary structures and conformation of collagen molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aamino acid composition 3acollagen 3aelectrophoresis 3afish skin 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3amicrostructure 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3atrypsin 3aviscosity 0aFreshwater fish skins 0aAcid soluble collagen 0aFibril formation 0aPeptide mapping 0aCollagen films 0aMechanical properties1 aChen, Shulin1 aSu, Wenjin1 aWeng, Wuyin1 aOsako, Kazufumi1 aTanaka, Munehiko0 tProcess Biochemistry.g2015 Jan., v. 50 p.148-155dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2014.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011700177300001600294520118600310592002801496596005901524650002501583650003001608650002401638650002601662650002101688650002401709650001201733650001601745650001801761650001101779650003201790650001301822650001901835650001201854650002301866650001801889650002101907700002401928700002901952700006201981773010902043856008102152852000902233655001202242IND60645299920221118000250.0190528e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064529992DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-018-9957-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Hélène Laurence10aMethane Production Variability According to Miscanthus Genotype and Alkaline Pretreatments at High Solid Content  ap. 325-337.  aIn the context of increasing needs of lignocellulosic biomass for emerging biorefinery, miscanthus is expected to represent a resource for energy production. Regarding biogas production, its potential may be improved either by genotype selection or pretreatment. Eight different miscanthus genotypes belonging to Miscanthus × giganteus (FLO, GID and H8), M. sacchariflorus (GOL, MAL, AUG, H6) and M. sinensis (H5) species were first compared for biomass composition and potential methane. In a second time, alkali pretreatments (NaOH 10 g 100 gTS⁻¹, CaO 10 g 100 gTS⁻¹) were applied at ambient temperature and high solid content, in different conditions of duration and particle size on the genotype FLO presenting the lowest methane potential. The methane potential varied between miscanthus genotypes with values ranging from 166 ± 10 to 202 ± 7 NmLCH₄ gVS⁻¹. All of the studied pretreatments increased the methane production up to 55% and reduced Klason lignin and holocellulose contents up to 37%. From this study, NaOH was more efficient than CaO with an increase of the methane production between 24 and 55% and between 19 and 30%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-11-BTBR-0006-BFFcAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3aMiscanthus sacchariflorus 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3aacid insoluble lignin 3aalkali treatment 3aambient temperature 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acalcium oxide 3aenergy 3agas production (biological) 3agenotype 3alignocellulose 3amethane 3amethane production 3aparticle size 3asodium hydroxide1 aArnoult, Stéphanie1 aBrancourt-Hulmel, Maryse1 aCarrère, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-96640 tBioEnergy research.g2019 June, v. 12, no. 2 p.325-337dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-018-9957-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012100167300001500288520107200303592002801375650001101403650001801414650002601432650001201458650001601470651001101486653004101497653002301538653002601561700001701587773007801604856008301682852000901765655001201774IND60546162120221118131537.0160903e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054616212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcelík, Petr14aThe framing of unconventional natural gas resources in the foreign energy policy discourse of the Russian Federation  ap. 97-109.  aThe advent of unconventional resources of natural gas has altered the order on global as well as continental gas markets. With rising liquidity, the position of established dominant suppliers is eroding. We focus on the initial response of Russia, the leading supplier of natural gas to Europe, to the new situation, building the research on unit-level constructivism and discourse analysis. We use frame analysis to reveal what image of unconventional resources was constructed in Russian foreign energy policy discourse (FEPD) in the period between 2009 and 2011, when the “unconventional revolution” did not yet have any sharp contours. We conclude that in Russian FEPD the unconventionals are considered as a distinctive and inferior source of energy compared to conventional natural gas. Emphasis is put on their economic irrationality and environmental hazards. The bottom line of the discourse is the idea that there is a choice between conventional and unconventional sources, with this choice being framed as one between good and bad, or right and wrong.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental hazards 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aRussia 0aUnconventional natural gas resources 0aRussian Federation 0aForeign energy policy1 aOsička, Jan0 tEnergy Policy.g2014 Sept., v. 72 p.97-109dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2014.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245006900197500002000266520185600286592002802142596002302170650001102193650001502204650001302219650000902232700005702241700005702298700005602355700006002411700005302471700005902524773013602583856007702719852000902796655001202805IND60789826320221120050941.0220822e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078982632DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JC0170532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, E.

Quantification of inputs and outflows via headland bypassing is necessary for evaluating long‐term coastal change. Bypassing rates are predictable for idealized headland morphologies; however, it remains to test the predictability for realistic morphologies, and to quantify the influence of variable morphology, sediment availability, tides and waves‐tide interactions. Here we show that headland bypassing rates can be predicted for wave‐dominated conditions, and depend upon headland cross‐shore length normalised by surf zone width, headland toe depth and spatial sediment coverage. Numerically modeled bypassing rates are quantified for 29 headlands under variable wave, tide and sediment conditions along 75 km of macrotidal, embayed coast. Bypassing is predominantly wave‐driven and nearly ubiquitous under energetic waves. Tidal elevations modulate bypassing rates, with greatest impact at lower wave energies. Tidal currents mainly influence bypassing through wave‐current interactions, which can dominate bypassing in median wave conditions. Limited sand availability off the headland apex can reduce bypassing by an order of magnitude. Bypassing rates are minimal when cross‐shore length >5 surf zone widths. Headland toe depth is an important secondary control, moderating wave impacts off the headland apex. Parameterisations were tested against modeled bypassing rates, and new terms are proposed to include headland toe depth and sand coverage. Wave‐forced bypassing rates are predicted with mean absolute error of a factor 4.6. This work demonstrates wave‐dominated headland bypassing is amenable to parameterization and highlights the extent to which headland bypassing occurs with implications for embayed coasts worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  aNE/N015525/1cNERC 3acoasts 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asand1 aConley, D.

First, 242 gully locations we determined in field surveys and mapped in ArcGIS software. Then, twelve gully-related conditioning factors were selected. Our results showed that, for both the RF and KNN models, altitude, distance to roads, and distance from the river had the highest influence upon gully erosion sensitivity. We assessed the gully erosion susceptibility maps using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Validation results showed that the RF and KNN models had Area Under the Curve (AUC) 87.4 and 80.9%, respectively. As a result, the RF method has better performance compared with the KNN method for mapping gully erosion susceptibility. Rainfall, altitude, and distance from a river were identified as the most important factors affecting gully erosion in this area. The methodology used in this research is transferable to other regions to determine which areas are prone to gully erosion and to explicitly delineate high-risk zones within these areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acomputer software 3ageographic information systems 3agully erosion 3amodels 3arain 3arivers 3aroads 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aJanizadeh, Saeid 1 aNaghibi, Seyed  Amir1 aPourghasemi, Hamid Reza,1 aKhosrobeigi Bozchaloei, Saeid 1 aBlaschke, Thomas 0 tWater.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w111020763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245009800166520135400264592002801618650001201646650002001658650002301678650001501701650002401716650002001740650002001760650001201780650003001792650001901822650001401841650001201855650001201867650002001879651001101899700003301910700002401943773012001967856007302087852000902160655001202169IND60674589420200305000000.0191025e20191005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067458942DNAL7 a10.3390/w111020782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorja-Vega, Christian 10aIncidence of Subsidies in Residential Public Services in Mexico: The Case of the Water Sector  aAccess to safe water has tremendous direct and indirect impacts on poverty-related outcomes. In Mexico, economies of scale in water provision justify bulk provision of water, such that it is collectively rational to invest heavily in capital for infrastructure development. This is compounded by the fact that water utilities are highly capital-intensive. We analyze two distinct types of subsidies prevalent in the residential water sector. We exploit a household socio-economic module with detailed water services information from the 2014 National Income and Expenditure Survey in Mexico. We combined this data with a unique dataset from water operators in Mexico (PIGOO). We estimate economic (considering operating costs) and direct (considering household&rsquo;s water payments) subsidies targeted to residential water tariff subsidies. Large heterogeneity in the direct subsidy incidence is found, which partly explains the distortions and wide differences in tariffs and total amount paid for water among different segments of the income distribution. The Omega Indicators (Ω), defined as the proportion of the subsidies received by the poor divided by the proportion of households in the total population in poverty, is less than one, implying that wealthy populations benefit more from water subsidies (economic and direct) than the poor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3adata collection 3aeconomies of scale 3ahouseholds 3aincome distribution 3anational income 3aoperating costs 3apoverty 3apublic services and goods 3asocioeconomics 3asubsidies 3asurveys 3atariffs 3awater utilities 3aMexico1 aGarcia Morales, Emmanuel  E.1 aGonzalez, Julio  A.0 tWater.g2019 Oct. 05, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w111020783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012100175300001600296520096300312592002801275650002201303650001501325650001101340650001701351650001301368650002201381650002401403650001601427650001401443650001701457650003301474650001701507650002101524650003701545650001501582700001801597700001501615773008601630856008401716852000901800655001201809IND60599029820221120204106.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059902982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSridhar, Vadahanambi10a3D functional hetero-nanostructures of vertically anchored metal oxide nanowire arrays on porous graphene substrates  ap. 330-336.  aMesoporous three dimensional hierarchical structure of copper oxide nanowires vertically anchored on graphene substrate was synthesized by a facile and green ‘alkali mediated synthesis’ under microwave irradiation. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer−Emmett−Teller surface area tests showed highly crystalline nanowires vertically anchored on porous graphene to give a unique mesoporous, hierarchical nanostructures. When applied as anode in lithium ion batteries, our materials exhibit capacity of 770mAhg⁻¹ even after 100 cycles with a Columbic efficiency in excess of 97%, reflecting the ability of the hierarchical network to accommodate the extreme volume changes of metal anodes that occur during the lithiation/delithiation reactions.

The adsorbents were characterized by scanning electron micrographs (SEM), electro diffraction spectra (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Parameter optimization of both adsorbents was done and performance efficiencies in the removal of Cr(VI) were compared. Although pH and temperature seemed to have no significant role in the removal efficiency of FEMCB, sorption by FRMCB was found to be depending on both. The optimum pH and temperature was found to be 5 ± 0.2, and 30°C, respectively. At optimum conditions, both adsorbents demonstrated removal efficiencies of >99% for a concentration of 5 mg L⁻¹. Sorption of Cr(VI) by FEMCB followed Freundlich isotherm model, while that of FRMCB fitted well with Langmuir isotherm model. The isotherm parameters were optimized by minimizing the error functions. The kinetics of sorption by FEMCB followed a pseudo-second-order model confirming chemisorptive mechanism, while FRMCB followed pseudo-first-order. Thermodynamic study revealed that sorption process was spontaneous and that the rate limiting step was governed by film diffusion. Both the adsorbents showed removal efficiencies of >99% in removing Cr(VI) from real sample of mine drainage water of concentration 1.86 mg L⁻¹ at optimum conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3achromium 3adrainage water 3amodels 3apH 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 2aAdsorption 2aChromiumxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aThermodynamics 2aX-Ray Diffraction 0aAdsorption 0acalcined bauxite 0ahexavalent chromium 0aisotherm 0akinetics 0athermodynamics1 aSasidharan Pillai, Indu M.1 aGupta, Ashok K.1 aSulaiman, Ayoob0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.67-78dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.707847  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001900167245006500186300001600251520120200267592002801469650002401497650003001521650002201551650001201573650004301585650001601628650000901644650001601653650001101669650001301680650001201693650007801705650002301783650002501806650003701831650007801868650009601946650004802042650000902090650000902099650002102108650003302129650002302162650004002185650002502225650003102250700001402281700003502295700001902330700001802349700001302367700002002380773008402400856008402484852000902568655001202577IND4476892620221123043029.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447689262DNAL7 a221786822pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2011.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jun-Ming10aAntitumor activity of Dioscorea bulbifera L. rhizome in vivo  ap. 388-394.  aAntitumor activities of water extract (fraction A), ethanol extract (fraction B), ethyl acetate extract (fraction C), non-ethyl acetate extract (fraction D) and compound diosbulbin B isolated from Dioscorea bulbifera L.

The results showed that fractions B and C both decreased tumor weight in S180 and H22 tumor cells bearing mice, while fractions A and D had no such effect. Furthermore, fraction C altered the weight of spleen and thymus, and the amounts of total leukocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils in tumor-bearing mice. Further results showed that compound diosbulbin B demonstrated anti-tumor effects in the dose-dependent manner at the dosage of 2 to 16mg/kg without significant toxicity in vivo. Furthermore, on the basis of chemical analysis of the above extracts by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a diode array detector (DAD), diosbulbin B was found to be the major antitumor bioactive component of DB. These results suggest that DB has potential anti-tumor effects which may be related to influencing the immune system for the first time, and the compound diosbulbin B is the major antitumor component of DB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea bulbifera 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3achemical analysis 3aethanol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alymphocytes 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aspleen 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aDioscoreaxchemistry 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHeterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Ringsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aLiver Neoplasms, Experimentalxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aRhizomexchemistry 2aSarcoma, Experimentalxdiet therapy 2aSpleenxdrug effects 2aThymus Glandxdrug effects1 aJi, Li-Li1 aBranford-White, Christopher J.1 aWang, Zai-Yong1 aShen, Kai-Kai1 aLiu, Hai1 aWang, Zheng-Tao0 tFitoterapia.g2012 Mar., v. 83, no. 2 p.388-394dElsevier B.V.x0367-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2011.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245014300199520169600342592002802038650003002066650001202096650001702108650002202125650001802147650002102165650001202186650000902198650001702207650001902224650002302243650001502266651001302281700006702294700005902361700006402420773011202484856007702596852000902673655001202682IND60778640720221120063039.0220530e20220521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077864072DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/69109012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBojago, Elias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7235-876010aAssessment of the Effectiveness of Biophysical Soil and Water Conservation Structures: A Case Study of Offa Woreda, Wolaita Zone, Ethiopia  aSoil erosion is a serious environmental and natural resource issue in Ethiopia, posing a significant threat to agricultural productivity and being one of the principal drivers of land degradation and soil fertility reduction. Evaluating the biophysical soil and water conservation structures’ effectiveness in Offa Woreda, Wolaita Zone, was the focus of the study. Purposive sampling was used to select the three kebeles that make up this watershed. W/Dekeya, Wareza, and Yakima are the three watersheds chosen for the selected study area. To meet the objective of this study, 504, 325, and 442 family heads were sampled. They comprised the overall 17% (227) of the study participants that were selected. Those who knew how to conserve soil and water, causes of degradation, and sensitive areas of their own plots of land in the study area received preference. The lack of capital, a short stretch of land, and various socioeconomic and physical conditions impeded the use of soil and water conservation systems. As a result, farmers have a reasonable position of the current biophysical soil and water conservation systems. Farmers in the study communities are aware of some traditional soil and water conservation practices as a measure to protect and restore the fertility and productivity of their farmlands. Community participation in encouraging farmers to participate in soil and water conservation practices is critical to resolving the issue of cutting-edge poverty, food insecurity, and environmental deterioration. From the study, we recommend that the government implements specific coverage and techniques as well as corrective intervention from nongovernmental organizations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3acapital 3acase studies 3acommunity service 3afood security 3aland degradation 3apoverty 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil fertility 3awater conservation 3awatersheds 3aEthiopia1 aSenapathy, Marisennayya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8371-30351 aNgare, Innocent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1457-35311 aDado, Tsegeye Bojago1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6086-10780 tApplied and environmental soil science.g2022 May 21, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:jnl4582843x1687-76757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/69109013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012700166300001600293520131400309592002801623650001101651650002101662650001301683650001501696650002201711650001601733650001101749650000901760650002101769650001301790650003201803650001601835650002101851700001701872700002001889700001801909700002001927773008601947856008402033852000902117655001202126IND60599029920221120204214.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059902992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jiyong10aFlexible photoanodes of TiO2 particles and metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes for flexible dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 337-345.  aRecent advance in flexible electronics demands development of flexible energy sources. Of particular interests are flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). However, a brittle nature of TiO2 materials is one of hurdles to realize flexible DSCs. Here we synthesized flexible photoanodes of TiO2 particles and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Metallic SWNTs provided a greater photovoltaic conversion efficiency than semiconducting SWNTs due to the more efficient electron transport. The metallic SWNTs also constructed effective mechanical network among TiO2 particles providing flexibility and durability. The photoanode was transferred on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate film and characterized for front-illuminated DSCs under the AM 1.5 simulated sunlight. There was only a small decrease in photovoltaic conversion efficiency with bending which was primarily caused by cracking of the ITO layer. Due to this limitation, the TiO2–metallic SWNT photoanode was transferred on a Ti foil and went through up to 1000 bending cycles. The cycled photoanode was assembled for back-illuminated DSCs due to the non-transparent Ti foil. There was no decrease in photovoltaic conversion efficiency even after 1000 bending cycles demonstrating excellent flexibility and durability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acracking 3adurability 3aelectron transfer 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3afoil 3aindium tin oxide 3alighting 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aKang, Hosung1 aHwang, Jae-Yeol1 aKim, Sung Wng1 aBaik, Seunghyun0 tCarbon.g2014 Nov., v. 79 p.337-345dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245006800210300001800278520142300296592002801719650001801747650001801765650001201783650001901795650001501814650001701829650001601846650001201862650002601874650001601900650002601916650001601942650001401958650002301972650001901995650001902014650001202033650002102045650002102066650003002087653002102117653002602138653002202164700001802186700001902204773012102223856008802344852000902432655001202441IND60601832720221121014557.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060183272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chu-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1059-077510aAnaerobic degradation of sulfamethoxazole in mangrove sediments  ap. 1446-1455.  aThe effects of sucrose and electron acceptors on the anaerobic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in mangrove sediments were investigated in this study. Among three sulfonamides, sulfamethoxazole, sulfadimethoxine and sulfamethazine, only SMX could be completely degraded in mangrove sediments. Degradation of SMX was enhanced by the addition of sucrose to the sediments. The degradation rates of SMX were increased in bioreactor experiments with sucrose. The addition of electron acceptors (sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium sulfate, and sodium nitrate) could further enhance SMX degradation. The order of anaerobic SMX degradation rates under three different conditions was as follows: sulfate-reducing conditions > methanogenic conditions > nitrate-reducing conditions. Methanolobus, Desulfuromonas, and Thauera were found in the highest proportions among methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria, respectively. Achromobacter, Brevundimonas, Delftia, Idiomarina, Pseudomonas, and Rhodopirellula were the major bacterial communities responsible for SMX degradation in the sediment. Overall, 16 bacterial and archaeal genera were identified as the core microbial community facilitating anaerobic SMX degradation for all methanogenic, sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing conditions. The results of this study provide feasible methods for the removal of SMX from mangrove sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3aBrevundimonas 3aDelftia 3aDesulfuromonas 3aIdiomarina 3aMethanolobus 3aPseudomonas 3aThauera 3abacterial communities 3abioreactors 3adenitrifying bacteria 3amethanogens 3asediments 3asodium bicarbonate 3asodium nitrate 3asodium sulfate 3asucrose 3asulfadimethoxine 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 0aSulfamethoxazole 0aAnaerobic degradation 0aMangrove sediment1 aTsai, Li-Ling1 aChang, Bea-Ven0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.1446-1455dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245009100157300001600248520155200264592002801816596001301844596001301857650002401870650004401894650002501938650001201963650001601975650003701991650001502028650002102043650001702064650001502081650001902096650001202115650002602127650002302153650004402176650001502220650002502235650001302260653003202273653002202305653002402327653002602351700005102377700002002428700001602448700001702464773010002481856007702581852000902658655001202667IND60786804920221120030359.0220806e20220826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078680492DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2022-00352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Zhenju10aLaccase-catalyzed grafting of vanillin on wood and its effect on wood decay resistance  ap. 732-743.  aThe improvement of wood decay resistance is more inclined to eco-friendly methods such as the application of natural products, but the low durability of some natural products as wood preservatives limits their applications. In this study, vanillin catalyzed by laccase was grafted into poplar wood to increase wood decay resistance and can remain in wood for longer period. The reaction system of vanillin, ABTS, laccase and phosphate buffer solution was impregnated into poplar wood using vacuum-pressure method, and reacted at 40 °C for 6 h. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to confirm the grafting reaction actually occurring during the process. The decay resistance, leaching resistance and mechanical strength of grafted wood were evaluated. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping was used to characterize the vanillin distribution. The results indicated that vanillin grafted poplar wood had good decay resistance, leaching resistance and higher strength. The mass loss of grafted poplar wood exposed to white-rot fungi [Trametes versicolor (L. ex Fr.) Quél.] and brown-rot fungi [Gloeophyllum trabeum (Pers.: Fr.) Murr.] decreased from original 46 and 13% to 9 and 4%, respectively, even after leaching. The modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the grafted poplar were 11 and 26% stronger than original poplar wood. Vanillin was found in wood cell wall. It was actually esterified onto wood catalyzed by the laccase.  aPublisher supplied data  a31971590  a31971590 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGloeophyllum trabeum 3aPopulus 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acell walls 3adecay resistance 3adecayed wood 3adurability 3aesterification 3alaccase 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3astrength (mechanics) 3avanillin 0agrafting reaction mechanism 0alaccase catalysis 0aleaching resistance 0awood decay resistance1 aYan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9686-89761 aChen, Zhangjing1 aLei, Yafang1 aLi, Guangbin0 tHolzforschung.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 76, no. 8 p.732-743dDe GruyterwJournal:1940x1437-434X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2022-00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016100171300001600332520193800348592002802286650004402314650003702358650002802395650002502423650002302448650001402471650001802485650001402503650002502517650001902542650002902561650001802590650002202608650001502630650001902645650003302664650002202697650001602719650002002735650003402755653001802789653002002807653002702827653003102854653002102885700001702906700002102923700001902944700002002963700002002983700001803003773011203021856008403133852000903217655001203226IND60601478520221122015520.0180706e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060147852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shu-Hsien10aStudy on characterization and pervaporation performance of interfacially polymerized polyamide thin-film composite membranes for dehydrating tetrahydrofuran  ap. 411-420.  aLow permeation fluxes with high separation factors were obtained when hydrophilic dense membranes were used for the dehydration of tetrahydrofuran (THF) by pervaporation. To improve the pervaporation performance of a membrane, the polyamide thin-film composite (TFC) membranes were prepared through interfacial polymerization by reacting 1,3-diaminopropane (DAPE), 1,3-cyclohexanediamine (CHDA), or m-phenylenediamine (MPDA) with trimesoyl chloride (TMC) on the surface of a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane (DAPE–TMC/PAN, CHDA–TMC/PAN, and MPDA–TMC/PAN). Pervaporation separation of an aqueous THF solution with polyamide TFC membranes was investigated as functions of diamine structure and operating conditions. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), and water contact angle measurements were applied to analyze the chemical structure, surface chemical composition, morphology, surface roughness, free volume, and hydrophilicity of the active polyamide layer of TFC membrane. Varying the diamine structure did affect the physicochemical properties and pervaporation performance of the polyamide TFC membranes. Compared with the CHDA–TMC/PAN and MPDA–TMC/PAN membranes, the DAPE–TMC/PAN membrane showed a lower permeation flux and a higher water concentration in permeate. This was in good agreement with the result of characterization. With an increase in the operating temperature of pervaporation, an increase in the permeation flux and a high water concentration in permeate (>99wt%) were obtained for the DAPE–TMC/PAN membrane. It was also found that the DAPE–TMC/PAN membrane exhibited a superior performance compared with the several hydrophilic polymers and commercial inorganic membranes discussed in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3achlorides 3acontact angle 3aelectrons 3ahydrophilic polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apervaporation 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atetrahydrofuran 3athin film composite membranes 0aPervaporation 0aTHF dehydration 0aPolyamide TFC membrane 0aInterfacial polymerization 0aCharacterization1 aLiu, Yuying,1 aHuang, Yun-Hsuan1 aLiao, Kuo-Sung1 aHu, Chien-Chieh1 aLee, Kueir-Rarn1 aLai, Juin-Yih0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 470 p.411-420dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245010500204300001600309500002000325520231300345592002802658596002102686596002202707650001002729650001302739650002002752650002502772650002302797650001602820650001102836650001402847650002602861650002202887650001302909650001302922650001302935650001802948650002202966650001302988650000903001650001003010651001103020700002003031700001903051773012303070856008003193852000903273655001203282IND60788583720221120105555.0220815e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078858372DNAL7 a10.1111/1440-1703.120832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoyama, Lina A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9201-837610aNitrate reductase activities in plants from different ecological and taxonomic groups grown in Japan  ap. 708-712.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlants generally use soil inorganic nitrogen, ammonium (NH₄⁺–N), and nitrate (NO₃⁻–N) as sources of nitrogen, an essential nutrient. The assimilation processes after uptake differ considerably from ammonium to nitrate. Nitrate must be reduced to ammonium in plant tissue before it is synthesized to amino acids, while ammonium is directly and immediately synthesized to amino acids after its uptake. Nitrate reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate‐limiting step of nitrate assimilation, reducing nitrate to nitrite. It is a substrate‐inducible enzyme, and the capacity to induce nitrate reductase varies greatly among plant species. In vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA) is generally measured as a nitrite production rate during incubation using fine cut pieces of plant tissue, and it is applicable as an indicator on plant nitrate use. Here we present in vivo NRA of leaves from a total of 108 species including arboreal trees, small trees, shrubs, herbs, a vine and a moss. For 75 of the species, NRA in fine roots was also determined. At least 20 species in sampled plants were imported and planted for scientific or industrial purposes, but most sampled species were native to Japan. Several inventory studies of plant NRA have been conducted, mainly in Europe, and they provided information on the species‐specific capacity of nitrate use by plants in Europe. However, to our best knowledge, there has been hitherto no published inventory of the NRA of plants in Japan where many endemic species are distributed. Our dataset contains plant NRA with species, family name, life form, leaf lifespan (evergreen or deciduous), growth stage, the season of sample collection, growth conditions (natural or cultivated) and other treatments/conditions when applicable. The data provided by this study may contribute to future works that require information regarding the plant species characteristics for nitrate use capacity or nitrate preference.

A collection of 123 isolates from eight counties in Florida were evaluated for sensitivity to azoxystrobin and fenamidone based on mycelial growth inhibition (MGI), spore germination (SG), detached leaflet assays (DLAs), and sequence-based analysis of the cytochrome b gene (cytb). Cleavage of cytb by restriction enzyme (Fnu4HI) revealed the presence of a mutation conferring a glycine (G) to alanine (A) mutation at amino acid position 143 (G143A) in approximately 90% of the population, correlating with quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resistance based on MGI (<40% at 5 μg/ml), SG (<50% at 1 and 10 μg/ml), and DLA (<10% severity reduction). The mutation conferring a phenylalanine (F) to leucine (L) substitution at position 129 (F129L) was confirmed in moderately resistant isolates (#9, #19, and #74) based on MGI (40 to 50% at 5 μg/ml), SG (<50% at 1 μg/ml and >50% at 10 μg/ml), and DLA (>10% and <43% severity reduction) for both QoI fungicides, whereas sensitive isolates (#1, #4, #7, #28, #29, #46, #61, #74, #75, #76, #91, #95, and #118) based on MGI (>50% at 5 μg/ml), SG (>50% at 1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml), and DLA (>50% severity reduction) correlated to non-mutation-containing isolates or those with a silent mutation. This study indicates that QoI resistance among C. cassiicola isolates from tomato is widespread in Florida and validates rapid screening methods using MGI or molecular assays to identify resistant isolates in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data  a22983cSpecialty Crop Block Grant Program  cFlorida Fruit and Vegetable Association  cFlorida Tomato Committee 3aCorynespora cassiicola 3aalanine 3aazoxystrobin 3acytochrome b 3afenamidone 3afungicide resistance 3agenes 3aglycine (amino acid) 3agrowth retardation 3aleucine 3amutation 3amycelium 3aphenylalanine 3aquinones 3arapid methods 3arestriction endonucleases 3aspore germination 3atomatoes 3aFlorida 0achemical 0adisease management 0aquinone outside inhibitor 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0avegetables1 aXavier, Katia V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2856-10751 aWen, Aimin1 aTimilsina, Sujan1 aAdkison, Heather M.1 aDufault, Nicholas S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6173-25931 aVallad, Gary E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9778-59100 tPlant disease.g2020 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.893-903dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-19-0460-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012900179300001800308520128000326592002801606650003301634650001701667650001101684650001601695650001601711650001501727650002501742650001801767650002201785650001801807650008501825650001701910650002601927650002901953650002701982650001502009650002902024650003402053650002002087650001602107700001602123700001302139700002002152773012802172856004802300852000902348655001202357IND4479677820221120173942.0121003e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447967782DNAL7 a225559372pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-012-1132-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Junyao10aTsukamurella sp. E105 as a new biocatalyst for highly enantioselective hydrolysis of ethyl 2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) butyrate  ap. 1261-1268.  aA new bacterial strain, E105, has been introduced as a biocatalyst for the enantioselective hydrolysis of ethyl (R,S)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) butyrate, (R,S)-1, to (S)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) butyric acid, (S)-2. This strain was isolated from 60 soil samples using (R,S)-1 as the sole carbon source. The isolate was identified as Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens E105, based on its morphological characteristics, physiological tests, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The process of cell growth and hydrolase production for this strain was then investigated. The hydrolase activity reached its maximum after cultivation at 200 rpm and 30 °C for 36 h. Furthermore, the performance of the enantioselective hydrolysis of (R,S)-1 was studied. The optimal reaction temperature, initial pH, substrate concentration, and concentration of suspended cells were 30 °C, 6.8, 10 and 30 g/l (DCW), respectively. Under these conditions, a high conversion (>45 %) of the product (S)-2 with an excellent enantiomeric excess (ee) (>99 %), and a satisfied enantiomeric ratio (E) (>600) as well were obtained. This study showed that the bacterial isolate T. tyrosinosolvens E105 displayed a high enantioselectivity towards the hydrolysis of racemic ethyl 2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) butyrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTsukamurella tyrosinosolvens 3abutyric acid 3acarbon 3acell growth 3aenantiomers 3ahydrolysis 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil sampling 2aActinomycetalesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiocatalysis 2aButyratesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aHydrolasesxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aPyrrolidinesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aStereoisomerism 2aTemperature1 aYuan, Shuai1 aWang, Pu1 aWang, Nengqiang0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Sept., v. 39, no. 9 p.1261-1268dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-012-1132-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245011200212300001600324500002000340520123300360592002801593596008401621650001501705650001201720650002101732650002501753650001001778650002001788650001501808650001901823650001301842650001301855650001801868700002501886773012301911856008002034852000902114655001202123IND60788583820221120105432.0220815e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078858382DNAL7 a10.1111/1440-1703.121632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Mohammad Zabed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2771-094810aRelative importance of soil microbes and litter quality on decomposition and nitrogen cycling in grasslands  ap. 912-924.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicrobial decomposers absorb nitrogen (N) to sustain growth during litter decomposition releasing surplus N into the soil. The balance between N release (mineralization) and absorption (immobilization) can alter nutrient cycling based mostly on the functional diversity in microbial communities. We examined the effects of soil microbes and litter quality on N cycling in an artificial grassland and two seminatural grasslands through a microcosm study. The artificial grassland soil had a higher respiration rate and a lower N mineralization rate, irrespective of the litter identity during incubation, when compared with the seminatural grassland soil. The release of mineralized nitrogen from litter was small for the artificial grassland because the soil microbes absorbed most of the mineralized N during decomposition. The artificial grassland soil had a low fungi:bacteria ratio (i.e., a high abundance of bacteria) and showed a clear separation of bacterial and fungal communities from the seminatural grassland soil. Our results suggested that stoichiometric constraint, not the biomass turnover rate, of microbial decomposers plays a key role in N cycling between aboveground and belowground communities in grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data  a15380181cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3acell respiration 3afunctional diversity 3afungi 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3astoichiometry1 aSugiyama, Shu‐ichi0 tEcological research.g2020 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.912-924dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.121633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245013100176300001600307500002000323520075300343592002801096596001801124596004901142650002601191650001501217650001901232650002301251700002401274773014301298852000901441856008901450655001201539IND4365541320221120173856.0200107e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436554132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0002-9092.2004.00647.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwallow, Stephen K.10aAssessing Public Priorities for Experiment Station Research: Contingent Value and Public Preferences for Agricultural Research  ap. 975-989.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLaws concerning government accountability mandate that agencies weigh constituent interests in setting priorities.

From December 2020 to April 2022, we conducted genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the Southern Province of Zambia, a region that shares international borders with Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe and is a major tourist destination. Genetic analysis of 40 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes revealed the circulation of Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (AY.116), and multiple Omicron subvariants with the BA.1 subvariant being predominant. Whereas Beta, Delta, and Omicron variants were associated with the second, third, and fourth pandemic waves, respectively, the Alpha variant was not associated with any wave in the country. Phylogenetic analysis showed evidence of local transmission and possible multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in Zambia from different European and African countries. Across the 40 genomes analysed, a total of 292 mutations were observed, including 182 missense mutations, 66 synonymous mutations, 23 deletions, 9 insertions, 1 stop codon, and 11 mutations in the non-coding region. This study stresses the need for the continued monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in Zambia, particularly in strategically positioned regions such as the Southern Province which could be at increased risk of introduction of novel VOCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3agenetic analysis 3agenomics 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3aphylogeny 3arisk 3astop codon 3atourists 3aBotswana 3aNamibia 3aZambia 3aZimbabwe1 aKalonda, Annie 1 aMubemba, Benjamin 1 aMatoba, Japhet 1 aShempela, Doreen Mainza1 aSikalima, Jay 1 aKabungo, Boniface 1 aChangula, Katendi 1 aChitanga, Simbarashe 1 aKasonde, Mpanga 1 aKapona, Otridah 1 aKapata, Nathan 1 aMusonda, Kunda 1 aMonze, Mwaka 1 aTembo, John 1 aBates, Matthew 1 aZumla, Alimuddin 1 aSutcliffe, Catherine G.1 aKajihara, Masahiro 1 aYamagishi, Junya 1 aTakada, Ayato 1 aSawa, Hirofumi 1 aChilengi, Roma 1 aMukonka, Victor 1 aMuleya, Walter 1 aSimulundu, Edgar 0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 24, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140918653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094024004200112040001800154100002400172245011100196300001800307520139100325592002801716650002901744650001201773650001401785650002001799650002601819650002201845650001101867650001301878650001501891650002701906650001501933650001101948650001301959650001901972650001201991650001202003650001802015650002002033650002602053650001402079650001102093650002202104650002502126650000902151650002702160650003002187651001302217651001302230700002602243700002202269700002002291773010002311856005502411852000902466655001202475IND50068170920221119030613.0130727e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006817092DNAL7 a98591992pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-294x.1998.00493.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPIERTNEY, STUART B.10aLocal genetic structure in red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus): evidence from microsatellite DNA markers  ap. 1645-1654.  aAllelic variation at seven hypervariable tri‐ and tetranucleotide microsatellite loci was used to determine levels of population differentiation between 14 populations of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) in northeast Scotland, UK. Despite the potential for long‐distance dispersal in grouse, and a semicontinuous habitat, significant population divergence was observed (mean RST = 0.153; P < 0.01) and an isolation‐by‐distance effect detected (Mantel test: P < 0.001). Examination of the spatial trend in principal component scores derived from allele frequencies among populations highlighted a barrier to gene flow that was confounding a simple isolation‐by‐distance effect. This barrier corresponded to an area of unsuitable habitat for grouse associated with a river system that bisected the study area. Mean genetic relatedness was higher for males than for females in all but one of the study populations, suggesting that the territorial behaviour and natal philopatry displayed by cocks have a manifold effect in generating the observed spatial genetic structure. Lower female relatedness values suggest a higher level of female‐mediated gene flow, which is sufficient to prevent the loss of genetic variation from within populations and the onset of inbreeding effects. The potential consequences of local subdivision for red grouse populations are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagopus lagopus scoticus 3afemales 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agrouse 3ahabitats 3ainbreeding 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphilopatry 3arivers 3aroosters 3aterritoriality 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBirdsxgenetics 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aEcosystem 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 3aScotland 0aScotland1 aMACCOLL, ANDREW D.

A dual E-Sampler which combines the light scatter and the gravimetric filter methods was used. Sampling occurred between August and December 2009. Scanning Electron Microscope – Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (SEM-EDS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma 6000 were used for elemental and physical characterization. The highest daily average mass concentration measured was 0.03543 mg/m³ and was below the international and national daily limit of 0.150 mg/m³, as well as the strict Vaal Triangle regional standard of 0.075 μg/m³. Relatively high daily average mass concentrations were obtained during the winter period. Concentrations of evaluated heavy metals decreased in the following order: iron (Fe) > manganese (Mn) > zinc (Zn) > copper (Cu) > vanadium (V) > titanium (Ti) > nickel (Ni) > lead (Pb). Positive correlations were established between Zn and Pb (r = 0.916); Zn and Mn (r = 0.883); Zn and V (0.984); Zn and Ni (r = 0.877); Zn and Fe (r = 0.914), which suggests common sources. However, Zn and Ti (r = 0.522); Zn and Cu (0.781) were poorly correlated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3aparticulates 3aphysical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium 3avanadium 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa 0aPM10 0aheavy metals 0ainductively coupled plasma 0ascanning electron microscope – energy dispersive spectrometry 0aVanderbijlpark 0aSouth Africa1 aMnisi, Jeremiah S.1 aNindi, Mathews M.1 aOkonkwo, Jonathan O.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.99-107dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2012.707859  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245012600201520182300327592002802150596003302178650002002211650001102231650001102242650000902253650001802262650002002280650002602300650002102326650000902347650001602356650000902372650001302381650002102394650001502415650002402430650001802454650001702472650001902489650001302508651001402521700005902535700005602594773011202650856007702762852000902839655001202848IND60778641320221120063016.0220530e20220517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077864132DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/91184612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArisanty, Deasy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5937-230910aSoil Physical Characteristics and Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity in the Landform of Barito Delta, Kalimantan, Indonesia  aWe explore the soil physical characteristics in wetland of Barito Delta from primary data of soil sample and electrical resistivity measurement with the support from some secondary data. We also estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ) in Barito Delta from soil physical characteristics applying Saxton and Rawls (1986) and Weynants et al. (2009). Soil texture profile is determined from interpolation of soil fraction in each layer applying Bayesian statistics to analyze soil physical characteristics in the landforms of Delta. Clay is the dominant soil fraction in the soil of Barito Delta. Clay fraction percentage decrease along the depth of soil profile as it reaches fine sand particles deriving from ancient sedimentation from the past. It is an opposite with soil organic matter content that has contrast value from 1ˢᵗ to 2ⁿᵈ soil depth, but a few discrepancy from 3ʳᵈ depth to downward direction. The content of clay in the soil depends on the sedimentation activity in the landform. Clay is dominant soil particle in the Delta; in case, it is in flat area and there is no intensive of sea water sedimentation such as in Basin of Peat Anticline and Natural Levee. In more than 2 m depth of soil, loamy sand and silty clay textures are mostly in the landform that is influenced by sea water activity, while by river water is clay loam. Kₛ values from Saxton and Rawls (1986) are close to Kₛ values from the measurement of previous studies. Kₛ values are generally small in Barito Delta that is mostly ranging from 1.10⁻⁷ to 2 m s⁻¹. Kₛ values are larger following the depth of soil profile. The values of Kₛ are smaller in Basin of Peat Anticline and Natural Levee than in Tidal Flat and Beach Ridge. It is because both landforms have clay as dominant soil particles.  aPublisher supplied data  cLambung Mangkurat University 3aBayesian theory 3aBorneo 3abasins 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3aclay loam soils 3aelectrical resistance 3aloamy sand soils 3apeat 3ariver water 3asand 3aseawater 3asilty clay soils 3asoil depth 3asoil organic matter 3asoil profiles 3asoil texture 3awater activity 3awetlands 3aIndonesia1 aRahmawati, Novi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2294-45071 aRosadi, Dedi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2689-253X0 tApplied and environmental soil science.g2022 May 17, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:jnl4582843x1687-76757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/91184613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03808naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013800165300001600303520169100319592002802010650001802038650000902056650001102065650001502076650002002091650001802111650001702129650002202146650002302168650001402191650001502205650002402220650002402244650001402268650002502282650002102307650001502328650001802343650001802361650001802379650002302397650002302420650002502443650002002468650001302488650002002501650001402521650001302535650001002548650001302558650002302571650002302594650001502617650001202632650001502644650001202659650001002671650001302681651001102694653001302705653002202718653002402740653001502764653001402779653001302793653002502806773011902831856007902950852000903029655001203038IND60555873320221120190343.0161030e20160923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055587332DNAL7 a10.1515/cszma-2016-00222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopij, Grzegorz10aBreeding avifauna of Niemodlin countryside (SW Poland) during the years 2002-2007, and its changes over the last 56 years (1962-2007)  ap. 179-192.  aNiemodlin countryside (c. 300 km²) is situated in the south-western part of Opole Silesia, SW Poland. Forests occupy c. 40%, arable grounds – 1/3, and meadows and pastures – 7%. There are 31 fish-ponds with a total diked surface of 663 ha. The paper presents results of field investigations carried out during the years 2002-2007 and an analysis of changes in the breeding avifauna over the last 56 years. During the years 2002-2007, 123 breeding and 11 probably breeding bird species were recorded in this area. During the years 1962-2007 151 species were recorded as breeding residents; and additional five species – as probably breeding resident. The following species were recorded as breeding for the first time in 1962-2007: Haliaeetus albicilla, Larus canus, Motacilla cinerea, Saxicola torquata, Locustella luscinioides, Ficedula albicollis, Corvus corax and Carpodacus erythrinus. In the same period the following species became extinct: Podiceps nigricollis, Anas clypeata, Milvus milvus, and Tringa glareola. The following species increaed in numbers in 1962-2007: Coturnix coturnix, Grus grus, Columba oenas, Apus apus, Dryocopus martius, Dendrocopos medius, Motacilla cinerea, Saxicola torquata and Corvus corax. In the same period, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Podiceps cristatus, Podiceps grisegena, Ciconia ciconia, Aythya nyroca, Perdix perdix, Gallinago gallinago, Larus ridibundus, Tyto alba, Alcedo atthis, Picus viridis, Riparia riparia and Corvus cornix decreased in numbers. The areas with the highest concentration of rare and endangered species are postulated to be protected as nature reserves, landscape parks and other spatial forms of nature conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas clypeata 3aApus 3aAythya 3aCarpodacus 3aCiconia ciconia 3aColumba oenas 3aCorvus corax 3aCoturnix coturnix 3aDendrocopos medius 3aDryocopus 3aErythrinus 3aFicedula albicollis 3aGallinago gallinago 3aGrus grus 3aHaliaeetus albicilla 3aLarus ridibundus 3aLocustella 3aMilvus milvus 3aPerdix perdix 3aPicus viridis 3aPodiceps cristatus 3aPodiceps grisegena 3aPodiceps nigricollis 3aRiparia riparia 3aSaxicola 3aTringa glareola 3aTyto alba 3aavifauna 3abirds 3abreeding 3aconservation areas 3aendangered species 3afish ponds 3aforests 3alandscapes 3ameadows 3aparks 3apastures 3aPoland 0acensuses 0apopulation trends 0anature conservation 0afish-ponds 0afarmlands 0avillages 0aforest fragmentation0 tActa Musei Silesiae, Scientiae Naturales.g2016 Sept. 23, v. 65, no. 2 p.179-192dDe Gruyter Openx2336-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cszma-2016-00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012200207300001600329520110800345592002801453650001501481650001501496650001101511650002101522650001601543650001301559650001901572650002201591650001401613650001701627650001501644650003301659650001701692650002101709650003701730700001501767700001501782700001601797773008601813856008401899852000901983655001201992IND60599030320221117213750.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059903032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jincheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4903-680010aThree dimensional carbogenic dots/TiO2 nanoheterojunctions with enhanced visible light-driven photocatalytic activity  ap. 369-379.  aFunctional carbogenic quantum dots (C-dots) were synthesized by a pyrolysis approach with strong visible light absorption and high photoluminescence. The novel three dimensional (3D) hierarchical C-dots-TiO2 (C-TiO2) heterojunctions were obtained by assembling the C-dots with end carboxylic acid groups on the surface of 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres, and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses. The prepared C-dots show strong adsorption of rhodamine B (RhB) and very low activity in the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. The prepared 3D C-TiO2 composites show enhanced visible light absorption and higher surface area with the increase of C-dot ratios. The highest photocatalytic activity is obtained at the carbon weight percent of 3.6%, and the corresponding apparent first-order rate constant of 0.00616min⁻¹ which is 1.8 times of that by the pure 3D TiO2 sphere. The mechanism shows that C-dots play an important role in the donation of excited electron to the conduction band of TiO2 under visible light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarboxylic acids 3airradiation 3ananorods 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3apyrolysis 3aquantum dots 3arhodamines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhu, Wenyu1 aYu, Shuyan1 aYan, Xiaoli0 tCarbon.g2014 Nov., v. 79 p.369-379dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007600173300001800249520130700267592002801574650001101602650001901613650002301632650001001655650002101665650001901686650000901705650002201714650001401736650001501750650001601765650001701781650001701798650001101815650001101826650001601837650001701853653001001870653001501880653001501895653001301910653002201923653002301945653001801968700001801986700006002004773012102064856008802185852000902273655001202282IND60601833220221117163619.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060183322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Anamika10aMultidimensional relationships of herbicides with insect-crop food webs  ap. 1522-1532.  aControlling weeds is critical for improving the yield and quality of crops.

Interaction of herbicides with insect pest and beneficial insects is mainly indirect and absence of weeds either can reduce the insect population or causes switching of host plant and hence can also increase the population. The direct effect of herbicides depends on carrier or surfactant used. Presence of herbicides also provides surfactant to insecticides and increases impact of insecticides. At present, most reports on impact of herbicides indicate alterations in insect survival or egg production due to increase or decrease in host plant population as an indirect affect, only a handful studies reported a direct topical effect of these herbicides on egg, larvae/nymphs and adults of various insects. Further exploration of this interaction seems intriguing. Use of bio-herbicides, cultural control methods, and judicious use of herbicides could offer ecologically sustainable approaches to reduce impact of herbicides on insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aagroecosystems 3abeneficial insects 3acrops 3acultural control 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afood availability 3afood webs 3aherbicides 3ahost plants 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3anymphs 3asurfactants 3aweed control 0a2,4-D 0aGlyphosate 0aResistance 0aToxicity 0aInsect herbivores 0aBeneficial insects 0aSurvival rate1 aJha, Prashant1 aReddy, Gadi V.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6377-07210 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.1522-1532dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.3123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012300163300001300286520092600299592002801225650002501253650002501278650001701303650000901320650002601329650001101355650001901366650003701385650002401422650001901446650000901465653003701474653001701511653002301528653002501551653004301576700002101619700002801640773011101668856007701779852000901856655001201865IND60560098620221119124202.0161220e20161213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056009862DNAL7 a10.1515/aep-2016-00412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkowicz, Anna10aActivity and functional diversity of microbial communities in long-term hydrocarbon and heavy metal contaminated soils  ap. 3-11.  aThe impacts of long-term polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metal pollution on soil microbial communities functioning were studied in soils taken from an old coke plant. The concentrations of PAHs in the tested soils ranged from 171 to 2137 mg kg⁻¹. From the group of tested heavy metals, concentrations of lead were found to be the highest, ranging from 57 to 3478 mg kg⁻¹, while zinc concentrations varied from 247 to 704 mg kg⁻¹ and nickel from 10 to 666 mg kg⁻¹. High dehydrogenase, acid and alkaline phosphatase activities were observed in the most contaminated soil. This may indicate bacterial adaptation to long-term heavy metal and hydrocarbon contamination. However, the Community Level Physiological Profiles (CLPPs) analysis showed that the microbial functional diversity was reduced and influenced to a higher extent by some metals (Pb, Ni), moisture and conductivity than by PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3afunctional diversity 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amicrobial communities 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pollution 3azinc 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aheavy metals 0amicrobial activity 0afunctional diversity 0aCommunity Level Physiological Profiles1 aPłaza, Grażyna1 aPiotrowska-Seget, Zofia0 tArchives of environmental protection.g2016 Dec. 13, v. 42, no. 4 p.3-11dDe Gruyter Openx2083-48107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aep-2016-00413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245008500203520228900288592002802577650002302605650001402628650002402642650001702666650000902683650001202692650001002704651001202714700006202726773009702788856007702885852000902962655001202971IND60778641420221120222959.0220530e20220516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077864142DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/92858932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAboujaoude, Samia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9791-802610aPresentations of Routine Dental Interventions in Children over a Six-Year Period  aAim. To evaluate over a six-year period, the prevalence of the dental procedures in primary and mixed dentitions, in males and females. Materials and Methods. A retrospective descriptive study on dental treatments in primary and mixed dentitions was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at the Faculty of Dental Medicine, Lebanese University, from 2015 to 2020. The total number of children was 1291. Data were classified and reviewed according to the dentition type, gender, and type of dental treatment. Results. The number of children decreased from 741 for the period 2015–2017 to 550 during the period 2018–2020 (279 males and 271 females). No significant association was found between the admission periods and the genders. A significant relationship was found between the number of treatments performed in both genders and the dentition types (p value = 0,015). Males were slightly more likely than females to present for the treatment in mixed dentition (54.58% versus 45.2%, respectively). Results portrayed a significant relationship between surgical treatment and gender (p value = 0.049). However, no significant relationship between gender and other treatment types was noted. The comparison between the 2 time frames and the types of treatments showed a significant association in composite fillings (p value = 0.043), extractions (p value < 0.0001), sealants (p value = 0.039), preventive resin restoration (p=0.011), pulp therapies (p value < 0.0001), pediatric crowns (p value < 0.0001), and surgical interventions (p value = 0.013). A nonsignificant relationship was recorded for the appliances and composite crowns (p value = 0.45 and 0.14, respectively). Conclusion. The present study points out the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak and Lebanon’s economic collapse on children’s dental status, with the number of children receiving dental care dropping remarkably. A decrease in all types of dental procedures was noted in mixed dentition, whereas an increase in dental treatments related to aggravated carious lesions was reported in primary dentition. More medical and financial aids are required to encourage and support parents’ attitude towards children dental care during unprecedented crises.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adentistry 3adescriptive studies 3aoral hygiene 3apulp 3asurgery 3ateeth 3aLebanon1 aEl Noueiri, Balsam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2735-22790 tThe scientific world journal.g2022 May 16, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:27586x1537-744X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/92858933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245017200171520167600343592002802019650001802047650001502065650001202080650001302092650002002105650001602125650001902141650001202160650001402172650001402186650001802200650001002218650001602228650001302244653001202257653001402269653001802283653001302301653003302314700001302347700001502360700001602375700001302391700001502404700001202419700001402431700001302445700002002458700001702478700001502495700001502510700002002525773011902545856008802664852000902752655001202761IND60754529620221122084411.0220404e20220210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075452962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1510592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xuerong10aActivation of persulfate by swine bone derived biochar: Insight into the specific role of different active sites and the toxicity of acetaminophen degradation pathways  aRecently, persulfate (PS) activation system has grown up as a primary branch of advanced oxidation processes, and biochar has been recognized as a potential nonmetal material in this field. However, few studies have focused on the corresponding relationship between actives sites on biochar and active species in AOPs. To pave this way, similar biochar (obtained from different pyrolysis temperature) with different functional structures were involved. In this study, biochar derived from swine bone (BBC) was applied in PS activation system to degrade acetaminophen (ACT). The results showed that both radical and non-radical pathway worked in the PS/BBCs systems, and the degradation rate (from 0.1042 to 0.4364 min⁻¹) climbed with the increase of pyrolysis temperature (from 700 to 900 °C). To probe into the corresponding relationship between functional structure and active species, the effect of pyrolysis temperature on functional structure was analyzed. It came out that 1) defects could act as active sites for various active species; 2) persistent free radicals could do favor to the generation of ¹O₂ and O₂⁻; 3) hydroxyapatite in swine bone only served as hard templet for the porous structure. ACT degradation process was measured by Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer, and Scendesmus obliquus was applied to investigate the toxicity of PS/BBCs system. It illustrated that the existence of SO₄⁻ mainly contributed to the generation of high toxic intermediates (such as biphenyl and diphenyl ether) in the PS/BBCs system. Furthermore, the enhancement of adsorption capacity would mitigate the toxicity of PS/BBCs systems to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiphenyl 3adiphenyl ethers 3aenvironment 3ahydroxyapatite 3aliquids 3aoxidation 3apyrolysis 3aspectrometers 3aswine 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aBiochar 0aCatalysis 0aIntermediates 0aToxicity 0aPersulfate activation system1 aLai, Cui1 aLiu, Shiyu1 aLi, Bisheng1 aQin, Lei1 aLiu, Xigui1 aI-Huan,1 aFu, Yukui1 aLi, Ling1 aZhang, Mingming1 aYan, Huchuan1 aWang, Jing1 aChen, Ming1 aZeng, Guangming0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 807 p.151059-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1510593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245012200203300001600325520105400341592002801395596001201423650002501435650001701460650001701477650002601494650001801520650001501538650001101553650001601564650001601580650001801596650001101614650001801625653002601643653002101669653002301690653002801713700002001741700002801761700002301789700002101812700002401833700001801857773012801875856007902003852000902082655001202091IND60786805620221122142749.0220806e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078680562DNAL7 a10.1515/ijfe-2022-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXavier, Lúcia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9136-659810aExtraction of phenolic compounds from apple pomace, process modeling and antioxidant potential evaluation of extracts  ap. 547-558.  aApple pomace, a byproduct of juice and cider production, is rich in phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity. This work studies the kinetics of solid–liquid extraction of phenolic compounds from apple pomace. Extraction kinetics were determined using a 50% water–ethanol solution and fitted to a phenomenological model. Equilibrium isotherms were also modeled. Effective diffusion coefficient values between 1.85x10⁻¹¹ and 7.37x10⁻¹¹ m²/s were found. External mass transfer resistance showed negligible results. The best yields (43.94%) were obtained at 60 °C with a solid–liquid ratio of 1:10 g/mL. Those conditions resulted in a total phenolic content of 9.95 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g apple pomace d.b., antioxidant FRAP activity of 5.07 mmol ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE)/100 g apple pomace d.b. and 3.74 mmol trolox equivalents (TRE)/100 g apple pomace d.b. based on a DPPH assay.

Cortisol can be analyzed from different media, most notably from the blood, saliva, and feces; however, the collection of cortisol from some of these media requires invasive procedures or excessive handling of the animals. Furthermore, it is not possible to capture long-term increases in circulating concentrations of cortisol from the blood, saliva, or feces. Hair cortisol has been found to be a reliable alternative for measuring chronic stress. With this emerging measure, appropriate sampling methodology must be developed and validated. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hair color, sampling location, and processing method on cortisol concentrations in hair from lactating black and white Holstein cows (n=18). Furthermore, we aimed to measure the hair growth rates at different body locations (n=12) and test hair cortisol levels when resampled over short intervals (n=37). Both black- and white-colored hair was collected from the shoulder, top line, hip, and tail switch of Holsteins; due to breed characteristics only white hair was harvested from the tail switch. All samples were cleaned with water and isopropanol, and then ground in a ball mill or finely cut with scissors once dry. Cortisol was extracted with methanol before being measured using a commercially available ELISA kit. Concentrations of cortisol were greater in white than in black hair (7.8±1.1 vs. 3.8±1.1pg/mg). When only white samples were analyzed, hair from the tail switch had more cortisol than hair from the shoulder (11.0±1.2 vs. 6.2±1.2pg/mg), whereas no difference was found when compared with the hip and top line. Samples ground with a ball mill had greater concentrations of cortisol extracted than those minced with scissors (10.4±1.2 vs. 4.7±1.2pg/mg). The growth rate of hair was significantly greater at the tail switch compared with the hip and shoulder (0.51±0.05 vs. 0.04±0.05 vs. 0.03±0.05mm/d). When hair was collected every 3 wk after calving, a tendency was detected for multiparous cows to have greater concentrations of hair cortisol and significantly greater concentrations of cortisol on d 0 and 21 after calving compared with d 42, 84, and 126. In Holsteins, the hair on the tail switch is always white, grows more rapidly than other sites, and is sensitive enough to capture changes in cortisol over intervals as short as 3 wk, making it the ideal location for measuring hair cortisol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal handling 3ablood 3acalving 3acleaning 3acolor 3acortisol 3adairy cows 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3ahips 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3asaliva 3astress response 3atail 0ahair cortisol 0aHolstein cow 0astress1 aMadureira, Augusto M.L.1 aSilper, Bruna F.1 aNadalin, Audrey1 aTahmasbi, Abdolmansour1 aVeira, Douglas M.1 aCerri, Ronaldo L.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2014 Dec., v. 97, no. 12 p.7685-7690dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-84443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010000170300001600270520138200286592002801668650001101696650001301707650001601720650002801736650002501764650002201789700002101811700002001832700002001852700002001872773008601892856008401978852000902062655001202071IND60599030620221117213539.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059903062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazdani, Hessam10aStrain-sensitive conductivity of carbon black-filled PVC composites subjected to cyclic loading  ap. 393-405.  aThis paper reports a study on the strain sensitivity response of polyvinylchloride/carbon black (PVC/CB) composites’ electrical conductivity (tensoresistivity) subjected to cyclic tensile loading. This study is part of a research program to develop sensor-enabled geogrids for performance-monitoring of reinforced earth structures. A medium-structure and a high-structure black were used as conductive fillers for a PVC coating which is commonly used for woven geogrids. Five different cyclic loading régimes were used to investigate influences of factors such as the strain amplitude, strain rate and pre-straining on the strain sensitivity performance of the coating composite electrical conductivity. Results showed that the conductive network in the coating specimens filled with the higher-structure CB experienced less damage upon cyclic deformation and showed a greater degree of recoverability in their tensoresistivity response. Also, pre-straining of coating specimens had a positive influence on the recoverability of their strain sensitivity. The degree of pre-straining induced in the specimens was characterized by the ratio of initial peak strain to the subsequent operating peak strain introduced here as the over-elongation ratio (OER). A greater OER value resulted in a more stable and consistent recoverability of tensoresistivity in the filled composite.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoatings 3adeformation 3aelectrical conductivity 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aresearch programs1 aHatami, Kianoosh1 aKhosravi, Elahe1 aHarper, Kendall1 aGrady, Brian P.0 tCarbon.g2014 Nov., v. 79 p.393-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007000163520125900233592002801492650003101520650001401551650002501565650002801590650001601618650001101634650001101645650002301656650001501679650001901694650001001713650001701723651001101740651000901751651001101760700002001771700003101791700002201822700002301844773012101867856007401988852000902062655001202071IND60794376820221119081233.0220922e20220825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079437682DNAL7 a10.3390/v140918682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansfield, Karen L.10aBatai Orthobunyavirus: An Emerging Mosquito-Borne Virus in Europe  aBatai virus (BATV) is a zoonotic orthobunyavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquito vectors. The virus is distributed throughout Asia and parts of Africa and has been sporadically detected in several European countries. There is increasing evidence that BATV is emerging in Europe as a potential threat to both animal and human health, having been detected in mosquitoes, mammals, birds and humans. In recent years, serological surveillance in cattle, sheep and goats has suggested an antibody prevalence of up to 46% in European livestock, although human serological prevalence remains generally low. However, the recent and continued spread of invasive mosquito species into Europe may facilitate the establishment of competent populations of mosquitoes leading to increased BATV transmission. Migratory birds may also potentially facilitate the emergence of BATV in geographical locations where it was previously undetected. Although BATV has the potential to cause disease in humans and livestock, our understanding of the impact in wild animal populations is extremely limited. Therefore, there is a need for increased surveillance for BATV in mosquitoes, livestock, wild mammals and birds in Europe to understand the true impact of this virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBunyamwera orthobunyavirus 3aCulicidae 3aFalcataria moluccana 3aanimal and human health 3aarboviruses 3acattle 3ahumans 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3awild animals 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEurope1 aFolly, Arran J.1 aHernández-Triana, Luis M.1 aSewgobind, Sanam 1 aJohnson, Nicholas 0 tViruses.g2022 Aug. 25, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140918683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245014400191300001600335520122300351592002801574650002401602650001801626650002301644650001701667650001401684650002201698650002301720650001901743650002201762650003401784650001801818650001301836650001101849650003001860650003801890650001501928650005001943650004801993650003102041650001202072650001002084650005502094650005602149650005202205653002402257653002802281653001602309653001402325653001002339653001902349700002502368700002102393700001902414700002502433700002002458700001802478773012702496856005102623852000902674655001202683IND50076436820221120023042.0140410e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007643682DNAL7 a230433352pmid7 a10.1080/03601234.2012.7167392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamorro, Soledad10aAnalysis of aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in kraft mill effluents by a combination of yeast bioassays and CG-MS chemical determinations  ap. 145-151.  aAryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) ligands also known as dioxin-like compounds, constitute a substantial part of the total toxicity from many pollution sources, including pulp mill effluents. The aim of this article was to evaluate dioxin-like activity in different kraft mill effluents by a combination of yeast bioassays and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) chemical analysis. The study includes kraft mill effluents from three sources of raw material: Pinus radiata, Eucalyptus globulus and a combination of both (50% each). The Recombinant Yeast Assay (RYA) showed an effective concentration of AhR ligands more than 30-fold higher in Eucalyptus globulus than in Pinus radiata effluents. Our results suggest that specific ligands, rather than the total amount of extractive material, determined the observed activity. Analysis of extract composition by GC-MS indicated that moderately hydrophobic aromatic compounds were likely responsible for the observed dioxin-like activity. In particular, benzaldehyde derivatives appeared as candidates for eliciting the observed dioxin-like activity in pulp mill effluents, giving their structural properties and their high concentration in AhR ligand-rich samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aPinus radiata 3aaromatic compounds 3abenzaldehyde 3abioassays 3achemical analysis 3agas chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3araw materials 3atoxicity 3ayeasts 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEucalyptus 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aHydrocarbons, Aromaticxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aLigands 2aPinus 2aReceptors, Aryl Hydrocarbonxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 0aPulp mill effluents 0arecombinant yeast assay 0adioxin-like 0acompounds 0aGC-MS 0aECF kraft pulp1 aMonsalvez, Elizabeth1 aPiña, Benjamín1 aOlivares, Alba1 aHernández, Víctor,1 aBecerra, José,1 aVidal, Gladys0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.145-151dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.716739  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245019300172300001600365520144400381592002801825650002101853650001301874650001501887650001101902650004301913700001701956700001501973700001601988700001702004700001702021700001602038773010602054856008602160852000902246655001202255IND60087961120221120163632.0141102e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008796112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicalessi, M.I.10aComparison of SPF10 real-time PCR and conventional PCR in combination with the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra assay for the detection and typing of human papillomavirus in cervical samples  ap. 113-117.  aThe novel SPF10 real-time PCR assay allows the simultaneous amplification and detection of the HPV target. That way, LiPA analysis of the HPV-negative samples can be avoided, reducing workload and cost. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the SPF10 real-time PCR in combination with the LiPA assay for HPV detection and typing in cervical samples. Thirty-nine cervical samples were subjected to the SPF10 conventional PCR in combination with the LiPA assay. Subsequently, the SPF10 real-time PCR was performed to enable the comparison between the SPF10 conventional and the real-time PCR results. In case of discrepancy, the samples were subjected to the CLART® HPV2 assay. As a result, 27 out of 39 samples were identified as HPV-positive by the SPF10 real-time PCR and were genotyped further by the LiPA assay. Twenty samples (74.1%) showed an absolute agreement between the conventional and real-time SPF10 PCR (concordant), three (11.1%) displayed additional or fewer types (compatible), two (7.4%) did not show any similarity between both assays (discordant) and the remaining two (7.4%) were LiPA-negative. The two assays showed an excellent strength of agreement for individual (κ=0.932) and multiple genotype detection (κ=0.834). In conclusion, the two SPF10 PCR methods are comparable. Therefore, the SPF10 real-time PCR with subsequent LiPA could be used for the detection and genotyping of HPV in cervical samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aBoulet, G.A.1 aPillet, S.1 aJacquet, J.1 aPozzetto, B.1 aBogers, J.J.1 aBourlet, T.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2013 Dec., v. 194, no. 1-2 p.113-117dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245012300200506007600323520148300399592002801882506003701910650001801947650001201965650002701977650002002004650001002024650002002034650001002054650001802064650001602082650001302098650001202111650002102123650004302144650001002187650001202197650002902209650002602238700001802264700001202282700001602294700001602310700001702326700001702343700001602360700001702376700001502393700001402408700001802422773012002440856007402560852000902634655001202643IND60647281920221207101411.0190618e20181107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064728192DNAL7 a10.3390/ani81102002doi7 aPMC62624882pmcid7 a304050072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zhangyuan12aA 5-Methylcytosine Site of Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF9) Gene Affects Its Tissue-Specific Expression in Sheep  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrowth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) plays an important role in the early folliculogenesis of sheep. This study investigated the mRNA expression of ovine GDF9 in different tissues by real-time PCR. GDF9 exhibits significantly higher levels of expression (p < 0.01) in the ovary, relative to other tissues, indicating that its expression is tissue specific. To explore the regulatory mechanism of this tissue-specific expression, the methylation level of one CpG island (&minus;1453 to &minus;1854) of GDF9 promoter in ovary and heart was determined. In this region (&minus;1987 to &minus;1750), only the mC-4 site was present in the Sp4 binding site showed differential methylation between the heart and ovary; with increased (p < 0.01) methylation being observed in the heart. Additionally, the methylation level was negatively correlated with GDF9 mRNA expression (R = &minus;0.75, p = 0.012), indicating that the methylation of this site plays an important role in transcriptional regulation of GDF9. The methylation effect of the mC-4 site was confirmed by using dual-luciferase. Site-directed mutation (methylation) of mC-4 site significantly reduced (p < 0.05) basal transcriptional activity of GDF9 promoter in oocytes. These results imply that methylation of GDF9 promoter CpG island mC-4 site may affect the binding of the Sp4 transcription factor to the GDF9 promoter region in sheep, thereby regulating GDF9 expression and resulting in a tissue-specific expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3aenzymes 3afollicular development 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenomic islands 3aheart 3amessenger RNA 3amethylation 3amutation 3aoocytes 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aWang, Xiangyu1 aDi, Ran1 aLiu, Qiuyue1 aHu, Wenping1 aCao, Xiaohan1 aGuo, Xiaofei1 aHe, Xiaoyun1 aLv, Shengjin1 aLi, Fukuan1 aWang, Hui1 aChu, Mingxing0 tAnimals.g2018 Nov. 07, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani81102003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014500181300001600326520189600342592002802238650001302266650001702279650002102296650001102317650002502328650002902353650001302382650000902395650001302404650001902417650001802436650002002454650002802474650002002502650001102522653003002533653002802563653002602591653002802617653002502645653004302670700001702713773011302730856008602843852000902929655001202938IND60581835520221119152412.0190321e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058183552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.2472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdouei, Mohammad Hossein10aNew composite sustainability indices for Cradle-to-Cradle process design: Case study on thinner recovery from waste paint in auto industries  ap. 253-262.  aIn a conventional chemical process design, the main focus is on the process economy resulting in the generation of huge amounts of waste materials within the process. Such design approach demands end-of-pipe treatment, which is neither profitable due to the hefty costs of the installation and operation of large scale waste treatment facilities, nor environmentally conscious due to the potential impacts of the generated wastes within the process on the environment. The recent approach to sustainable process design has surmounted this challenge. This paper presents a new application of an already introduced composite sustainability index (CSI) that requires minimum amount of data to monitor the sustainability performance of a chemical process and troubleshoot, if necessary. Then, the CSI is applied to an existing process for the purpose of Cradle-to-Cradle design by significant reduction of the environmental impacts of the process, and the escalation of the plant profitability due to sustainable retrofitting of the plant. The CSI methodology can be applied to chemical, refinery, petrochemical, oil & energy, fuel and biofuel processes. The three main advocates have been considered in the CSI, which are the impacts of “energy” and “material” on the environment as well as “risk assessment”. The CSI is technically imperative at all engineering stages of above process plants with the aim of source reduction and environmental protection. The CSI gives process and safety engineers a competitive edge, making their designed process stand out amongst other design array. The current study proves that the CSI methodology is a powerful tool for process and safety designers, and that the process sustainability and profitability are strongly linked. So, it is specifically decisive at managerial level pursuant to strategic planning towards company's sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acase studies 3acradle-to-cradle 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental protection 3aindustry 3aoils 3aplanning 3aprocess design 3aprofitability 3arisk assessment 3asustainable development 3awaste treatment 3awastes 0aSustainability indicators 0aCradle-to-Cradle design 0aAuto industry economy 0aInherently safer design 0aEnergy impacts index 0aMaterial impacts index (WAR algorithm)1 aElkamel, Ali0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.253-262dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.2473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013000177300001800307520150500325592002801830650003001858650002401888650001401912650001101926650001401937650001001951650001301961650001401974650002501988653002402013653001902037653001102056653001302067653001502080700001902095700002902114700002402143700002602167773012702193856008402320852000902404655001202413IND50075537320150325000000.0150325e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007553732DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2013.7749942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAskarianzadeh, Alireza10aScreening of oilseed rape cultivars relation to diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lep.: Plutellidae) in fields of Tehran  ap. 1740-1746.  aThe diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lep., Plutellidae), is one of the most important pests of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., in the world. In this study, resistance of oilseed rape cultivars to DBM was evaluated in fields of Tehran based on injury rate of the cultivars. To evaluate cultivar resistance, 19 cultivars of oilseed rape were planted in randomised complete-block design with three replications. Total experiments were conducted in experimental field of Shahed University. Results showed that DBM had activity on the plants during season and peak of the injury occurred on 27 May. Results indicated that the total of oilseed rape cultivar was spotty. Statistical analysis showed that there was significant difference among determined characteristics in all cultivars. The highest and lowest numbers of holes in the leaf were observed in Midas, Karaj3, Zarfam and Hyola420, Hyola308 cultivars, respectively, in sampling of the end growth. Opera and Midas cultivars have the highest percentage of leaf infestation and the lowest percentage of leaf infestation was observed in Hyola420 and Hyola308. Also, Karaj3 and Zarfam cultivars have the highest percentage of meristem infestation and the lowest percentage of meristem infestation was observed in Licard and Hyola420 cultivars. Based on peak of the injury rate and importance of meristem injury, Hyola420 and Hyola308 cultivars were relatively resistant to DBM, and Karaj3 and Zarfam were relatively sensitive to DBM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aPlutella xylostella 3acultivars 3aleaves 3ameristems 3apests 3aplanting 3ascreening 3astatistical analysis 0aPlutella xylostella 0aBrassica napus 0ainjury 0acultivar 0aresistance1 aJahan, Fatemeh1 aHasanshahi, Gholamhosein1 aNaji, Amir Mohammad1 aSalehitabar, Mohammad0 tArchiv für Phytopathologie und Pflanzenschutz.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 46, no. 14 p.1740-1746dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2013.7749943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007200165300001800237520102200255650001001277650001101287650001801298650001401316650002401330650001901354650001801373650001401391650001401405650002101419650001401440650002501454650001601479650001401495650002301509650001801532700002201550700002001572700002301592700002001615700002801635700002001663700002001683773016201703856004701865852000901912655001201921IND60516133820221122140914.0160325e20150318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051613382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b002912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarneti, Brian10aIs There Room for Improving the Nutraceutical Composition of Apple?  ap. 2750-2759.  aIn this study, we assessed the main bioactive compounds of a broad apple germplasm collection, composed by 247 accessions of wild (97) and domesticated (150) species. Among the stilbenes, trans- and cis-piceid were found to be ubiquitary components of both wild and cultivated apples. Apple was suggested to be the second dietary source of resveratrols. Results confirmed that the selection pressure of breeding and domestication did not uniformly affect all the phytochemicals contained in apples. For instance, organic acids (malic and ascorbic acid) and some phenolics (stilbenes, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) were significantly influenced by selection, while some relevant flavonoids (flavonols and flavan-3-ols) and triterpenoids (ursolic, oleanolic, and betulinic acids) were not. This comprehensive screening will assist in the selection of Malus accessions with specific nutraceutical traits suitable to establish innovative breeding strategies or to patent new functional foods and beverages. 3aMalus 3aapples 3aascorbic acid 3abeverages 3abioactive compounds 3acoumaric acids 3adomestication 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afunctional foods 3agermplasm 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aresveratrol 3ascreening 3aselection pressure 3atriterpenoids1 aMasuero, Domenico1 aCosta, Fabrizio1 aMagnago, Pierluigi1 aMalnoy, Mickael1 aCosta, G.q(Guglielmo),1 aVrhovsek, Urska1 aMattivi, Fulvio0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 63, no. 10 p.2750-2759dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00291  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245005500156300001600211500000900227520071200236592002800948650001900976650001900995650001101014773011801025856007301143852000901216655001201225IND60660587620221120171649.0190823e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066058762DNAL7 a10.1111/nbu.123982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlint, S.

Instances of discrimination impinge on peoples’ human rights and societal values of equality, raising important questions for policymakers and legislators. The ingrained nature of weight stigma and discrimination throughout society means the systemic change that is warranted will not be easy or rapid. Within this article, several actions are suggested to reduce weight stigma and discrimination and in doing so, address this social justice issue. The article represents a long overdue call to end weight stigma and discrimination for the betterment of society.  aPublisher supplied data 3asocial benefit 3asocial justice 3astigma0 tNutrition bulletin.g2019 Sept., v. 44, no. 3 p.249-253dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl6406x1471-98277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nbu.123983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245018000159300002000339520152100359592002801880650001301908650002001921650001701941650002001958650001601978700001801994700001702012700001902029700001802048700001402066773012602080856007502206852000902281655001202290IND60753461120221120063447.0211015e20210908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075346112DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06258a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zhaoliang10aControllable crystal form transformation and luminescence properties of up-conversion luminescent material K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆: Er³⁺, Yb³⁺ with cryolite structure  ap. 30006-30019.  aIn this paper, a novel cryolite-type up-conversion luminescent material K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆: Er³⁺, Yb³⁺ with controllable crystal form was synthesized by a high temperature solid state method. K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆: Er³⁺, Yb³⁺ can crystallize in monoclinic or cubic form at different temperatures. The composition, structure and up-conversion luminescence (UCL) properties of K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆: Er³⁺, Yb³⁺ samples with different crystal form were investigated in detail. It is impressive that both monoclinic and cubic forms of K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆: Er³⁺, Yb³⁺ show green emission (²H₁₁/₂/⁴S₃/₂→⁴I₁₅/₂). The luminescence intensity of cubic K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆ is much higher than that of the monoclinic form, and the reasons are also discussed in detail. The results show that the luminescence intensity of up-conversion materials can be effectively tuned by controlling the crystal form. According to the power dependent UCL intensity, the UCL mechanism and electronic transition process were discussed. In addition, the fluorescence decay curves were characterized and the thermal coupling levels (TCLs) of Er³⁺ (²H₁₁/₂/⁴S₃/₂ → ⁴I₁₅/₂) in the range of 304–574 k were used to study the optical temperature sensing characteristics. All the results show that K₃Sc₀.₅Lu₀.₅F₆: Er³⁺, Yb³⁺ can be used in electronic components and have potential application value in temperature sensing fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acryolite 3acrystallization 3afluorescence 3alight intensity 3atemperature1 aGuo, Qingfeng1 aLiao, Libing1 aShuai, Pengfei1 aHuang, Feifei1 aMei, Lefu0 tRSC advances.g2021 Sept. 08, v. 11, no. 48 p.30006-30019dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06258a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006400167300001600231520085300247592002801100650001301128650000901141650001901150650001101169650001501180650002001195650001101215653002301226653002301249653003701272653003301309700001801342700001601360700001701376700001501393700002101408773011301429856008601542852000901628655001201637IND60581835720221119152406.0190321e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058183572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Zhiyue10aNew-type gel dry-water extinguishants and its effectiveness  ap. 590-600.  aThis work sets focus on producing hydrophobic silica and fire-extinguishing-composition solution into dry water extinguishant powder by high-speed shearing.

According to the results, the phosphoric acid gel dry water extinguishant works best to put out Type-A fire. The ADP dry water extinguishant excels in putting out Type-B fire, equivalent to superfine ABC dry powder extinguishant in terms of effectiveness but with a low cost.

This research has undoubtedly extended the body of knowledge, yet the numerous definitions of SM in prior art still indicate a lack of consensus on the true meaning of the concept. It is thus to be expected that these discrepancies will constrain further development and use of the SM concept in industrial practice.The goal of this paper is to analyze the different definitions of SM and identify the current understanding of what researchers mean by the concept. We use an inductive content analysis of definitions published from 1990 to 2016 in a variety of academic journals. A total of 189 articles including a manifest definition of SM and 89 original definitions were identified. Our analysis revealed that the most commonly used definition is the one proposed by U.S. Department of Commerce in 2008; 63% of the analyzed articles cite or slightly rephrase this definition, while 86% of the identified definitions are used in less than three articles. Although the majority of researchers seems to agree upon eleven sub-categories of SM, a wide range of issues (67 sub-categories) associated with SM indicates inconsistency in the general understanding of the concept. It is proposed that the findings in this study can serve as a foundation for the development of a common language for SM in both research field and industrial practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Department of Commerce 3amanufacturing 3aresearchers 3asustainable manufacturing 3aUnited States 0aSustainable manufacturing definitions 0aContent analysis 0aLiterature review 0aSustainability 0aManufacturing1 aWelo, Torgeir0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.744-755dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014700179520089700326592002801223650001501251650001301266650001901279650001301298650002301311650001501334653002001349653006101369653000901430653002301439653002901462653002701491700002401518700006001542700003101602700002801633700003101661700001701692773009401709856008601803852000901889655001201898IND60758932920221120025708.0220207e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075893292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e085282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatriansyah, Jaka Fajar10aSimple molecular dynamics simulation of hydrogen adsorption on ZSM 5, graphite nanofiber, graphene oxide framework, and reduced graphene oxide  aThe search for the most efficient materials that can store hydrogen has been challenged by various impediments in experimental studies, such as cost and complexity. Simulation study offers an easy method to overcome this challenge, but primarily requires powerful computing resources. In this paper, a simple MD simulation using a Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) was developed to calculate the hydrogen uptake in ZSM5, Graphite Nanofiber, Graphene Oxide Framework, and reduced Graphene Oxide. The method offered a more affordable computational method and relatively straightforward approaches while maintaining a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. The comparisons between simulation and experimental results were also presented.

To construct an expression vector the DNA fragment with a sequence identical to immunodominant regions of HSV-2 gG2 was cloned into modified vector pET28a containing of the glutation-S-transferase sequence (pET28-GST). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) were transformed with the recombinant plasmid. The target protein was expressed mainly in soluble form. Chromatographic purification of soluble GST-gG2 protein was performed taking into account the features of its primary structure that are 6His-tag and GST-tag. To determine the affinity constant of the specific IgG to GST-gG2 we used the method proposed by Friguet et al. (1985). The affinity constants were within the range of 10⁷–10⁸M⁻¹ proving their high-affinity. The purified recombinant HSV-2 antigen was used to design a diagnostic ELISA kit, which was evaluated with referent controls and standard panels of sera containing and/or not containing anti-HSV-2 IgG. Comparative evaluation of this kit and the commercially available “HSV-Type 2 IgG-ELISA” (NovaTec, Dietzenbach, Germany) kit was performed. There was no significant difference (P>0.05). It allows to use developed ELISA kit for clinical diagnosis of HSV-2 infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ablood serum 3aDNA fragmentation 3ahumans 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 2 3achromatography 3aplasmids 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunodominant epitopes 3aglycoproteins 3aEscherichia coli 3aGermany 0aHuman herpesvirus 21 aVudmaska, Mariya1 aMoysa, Larissa1 aKovtonjuk, Galina1 aMikhalap, Svetlana1 aGanova, Larissa1 aSpivak, Nikolay0 tJournal of virological methods.g2013 Dec., v. 194, no. 1-2 p.67-73dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.07.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245009000178300001800268520145000286592002801736650001901764650001501783650001401798650002501812650002401837650002001861650001201881650002001893650001501913650001701928650001101945650001301956650001201969650001601981650001401997650001402011700001702025700002202042700002002064773010902084856009002193852000902283655001202292IND60082486120221122225230.0141025e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008248612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb07077.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKammerer, Dietmar12aA Novel Process for the Recovery of Polyphenols from Grape (Vitis vinifera L.) Pomace  ap. C157-C163.  aA novel process for enzyme‐assisted extraction of polyphenols from winery by‐products was established on a pilot‐plant scale. Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of grape skins, that is, selection of pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzymes, enzyme‐substrate ratio, and time‐temperature regime of enzymatic treatment, was conducted on a laboratory scale. Enzyme activities were monitored by viscosity measurement of resuspended grape pomace and by quantification of oligomeric pectin and cellulose degradation products released from cell wall material. Optimal conditions were obtained with 5000 ppm (based on dry matter) of a pectinolytic and 2500 ppm of a cellulolytic enzyme preparation, respectively, at 50°C, which were also applied in pilot‐plant scale experiments. Concomitant determination of individual polyphenolics demonstrated a significantly improved yield for most compounds when compared with experiments without enzyme addition. Recovery rates were comparable to those obtained when grape pomace was extracted using sulfite. Pre‐extraction of the pomace with hot water followed by treatment with cell wall degrading enzymes even increased yields of phenolic compounds. Only some quercetin glycosides and malvidin coumaroylglucoside were partly hydrolyzed due to enzyme side activities. This new process may provide a valuable alternative to the application of sulfite, which is considered crucial in food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3afood processing 3aglycosides 3agrape pomace 3agrapes 3amalvidin 3apectins 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3aviscosity1 aClaus, Achim1 aSchieber, Andreas1 aCarle, Reinhold0 tJournal of food science.g2005 Mar., v. 70, no. 2 p.C157-C163dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb07077.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245009300153300001800246520097800264650002201242650001601264650001101280650001301291650001501304650002101319650001101340650001301351650001001364650000801374650001601382650002201398650001601420700001901436700001301455700001701468700002001485700001401505773016201519856004001681852000901721655001201730IND60516134220221119160937.0160325e20150318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051613422DNAL7 a10.1021/jf505898d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Wei10aFormulation of Intumescent Flame Retardant Coatings Containing Natural-Based Tea Saponin  ap. 2782-2788.  aNatural product tea saponin (TS), extracted from the nutshell of camellia (Camellia oleifera Abel, Theaceae), was introduced into intumescent flame retardant formulations as blowing agent and carbon source. The formulations of the flame retardant system were optimized to get the optimum proportion of TS, and intumescent flame retardant coatings containing tea saponin (TS-IFRCs) were then prepared. It was found that TS can significantly affect the combustion behavior and the thermal stability of TS-IFRCs evaluated by cone calorimetry and simultaneous thermal analyzer, respectively. It was shown that TS, degraded to water vapor and carbon at high temperatures, can combine with other components to form a well-developed char layer. The char layer was supposed to inhibit erosion upon exposure to heat and oxygen and enhance the flame retardancy of TS-IFRCs. In addition, the smoke release of TS-IFRCs was also studied, which provided a low amount of smoke production. 3aCamellia oleifera 3acalorimetry 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acombustion 3aflame retardants 3aoxygen 3asaponins 3asmoke 3atea 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awater vapor1 aLi, Xiang-Zhou1 aWu, Ping1 aLiu, Yan-Xin1 aFang, Cong-Cong1 aMeng, Wei0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 63, no. 10 p.2782-2788dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf505898d  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171300001600265520184400281592002802125650001802153650002502171650002102196650001902217650002402236650002202260650001502282650001502297650001602312650002802328650001102356653002802367653001802395653002002413653002102433653002302454653001602477700001902493700002202512700003202534700002502566773009202591856008602683852000902769655001202778IND60615568320221118222257.0190129e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061556832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuartero, Maria10aComparative enzymatic studies using ion-selective electrodes. The case of cholinesterases  ap. 316-322.  aThe application of traditional ion-selective electrodes for comparative enzymatic analysis was demonstrated for the first time in this study. A kinetic-potentiometric method based on the monitoring of the concentration of the ionic substrate involved in the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by different cholinesterases is used for this purpose. A comparative study was performed comprising both enzymatic assays using different ionic substrates and the corresponding inhibited reactions in presence of neostigmine (a synthetic anticholinesterase). The developed approach is used to obtain valuable comparative results through calculation of kinetic parameters, such as Michaelis and inhibition constants. Interesting results were obtained for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes, which were selected as proof-of-concept: (i) the binding affinity that these enzymes have for their natural substrates showed to be higher (acetylcholine and butyrylcholine respectively) than for their corresponding thiol derivatives (acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine), which are traditionally used in spectrophotometric enzymatic assays; (ii) as expected, the maximum hydrolysis rate found in the assays of each enzyme was independent of the substrate used; (iii) acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition due to neostigmine was found to be higher (higher inhibition constant). Advantageously, the use of ion-selective electrodes permits to perform cholinesterases’ enzymatic assays using their natural substrates and under physiological conditions, unlike the traditional spectrophotometric methods used in routine enzymatic assays. Importantly, while well-known enzymes are use throughout this work, this approach can be extended to other types of enzymatic assays as a tangible alternative to traditional spectrophotometric methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abinding capacity 3acholinesterase 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahydrolysis 3amonitoring 3aneostigmine 3aspecific ion electrodes 3athiols 0aIon-selective electrode 0aPotentiometry 0aCholinesterases 0aBinding affinity 0aAnticholinesterase 0aNeostigmine1 aPérez, Soraya1 aGarcía, Maria S.1 aGarcía-Cánovas, Francisco1 aOrtuño, Joaquín A.0 tTalanta.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 180 p.316-322dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245008900209300002000298520157300318592002801891650002501919650000901944650001601953650001801969650002001987650001002007700002102017700002202038700001602060700002002076700002302096700005902119773013102178856008402309852000902393655001202402IND60746398620221116214319.0210803e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074639862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c019822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlumb, Robert S1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1380-928510aHigh-Throughput UHPLC/MS/MS-Based Metabolic Profiling Using a Vacuum Jacketed Column  ap. 10644-10652.  aIn UHPLC, frictional heating from the eluent flowing through the column at pressures of ca. 10–15 Kpsi causes radial diffusion via temperature differences between the center of the column and its walls. Longitudinal dispersion also occurs due to temperature gradients between the inlet and outlet. These effects cause band broadening but can be mitigated via a combination of vacuum jacketed stainless steel tubing, reduced column end nut mass, and a constant temperature in the column from heating the inlet fitting. Here, vacuum jacketed column (VJC) technology, employing a novel column housing located on the source of the mass spectrometer and minimized tubing from the column outlet to the electrospray probe, was applied to profiling metabolites in urine. For a 75 s reversed-phase gradient separation, the average peak widths for endogenous compounds in urine were 1.2 and 0.6 s for conventional LC/MS and VJC systems, respectively. The peak tailing factor was reduced from 1.25 to 1.13 when using the VJC system compared to conventional UHPLC, and the peak capacity increased from 65 to 120, with a 25% increase in features detected in urine. The increased resolving power of the VJC system reduced co-elution, simplifying MS and MS/MS spectra, providing a more confident metabolite identification. The increased LC performance also gave more intense MS peaks, with a 10–120% increase in response, improving the quality of the MS data and detection limits. Reducing the LC gradient duration to 37 s gave peak widths of ca. 0.4 s and a peak capacity of 84.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aheat 3ametabolites 3aspectrometers 3astainless steel 3aurine1 aMcDonald, Thomas1 aRainville, Paul D1 aHill, Jason1 aGethings, Lee A1 aJohnson, Kelly A.,1 aWilson, Ian D.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8558-73940 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 19, v. 93, no. 30 p.10644-10652dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c019823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006600170300001600236520124200252592002801494650002701522650002101549650002001570650001501590650002801605653001501633653002501648653002301673653002101696653002001717773011301737856008601850852000901936655001201945IND60581836020221119152312.0190321e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058183602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichter, Beate10aKnowledge and perception of food waste among German consumers  ap. 641-648.  aEven within increasing discussions about environmental problems and sustainability, the issue of food waste is more and more in focus. Nevertheless it is unclear how consumers perceive the topic and how far they are aware of problems resulting from food waste. In light of this, consumers were divided in this study according their perception, attitudes and level of information. By means of a factor analysis and a cluster analysis, three clusters were built, which can be distinguished according to their understanding of the problem: guilty food wasters (cluster 1), unwitting food wasters (cluster 2) and careless food wasters (cluster 3). In total, there are differences in perceiving and understanding the issue. As a result guilty food wasters already are well informed, while unwitting and careless food wasters show a lower level of information. However, in general for all consumers groups more information about food waste might be useful. The topic, more strongly may be discussed in public and provide consumers deeper information about the issue, for example, about environmental impairments caused by food waste. But providing consumer with information should be coordinated to the level of information within the cluster.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acluster analysis 3afactor analysis 3afood waste 3asustainable development 0aFood waste 0aFood waste behaviour 0aConsumer behaviour 0aCluster analysis 0aFactor analysis0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.641-648dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245008600210520112600296592002801422650002401450650001101474650001001485650001801495653001701513653002501530653001901555653001201574653003301586700006401619700002601683700006501709700005801774700006901832773009401901856008601995852000902081655001202090IND60758933220221120025716.0220207e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075893322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e085322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhter, Nasrin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2183-820010aFabrication and characterization of stretchable denim fabric using core spun yarn  aThis study aimed to investigate the effect of extensibility on cotton blended polyester-spandex core-spun yarn in the weft direction of 3/1 right-handed Z-twill denim.

In this study, the application of ANN, empirical correlations and genetic algorithm for modeling and multi-criteria optimization of the thermophysical properties of clove-treated MWCNTs nanofluid which has been synthesized through a facile and eco-friendly procedure has been investigated. In this contribution, totally 6 structures are assessed: networks including one and two hidden layers with 2, 4, and 6 neurons. From assessment of the ANN, it is found that the network including two hidden layers with 4 neurons in every layer results in the least difference between the network outputs and the experimental data, providing the best performance. It is concluded that the optimal ANN model is a more precise and accurate way to predict the thermal conductivity and viscosity of environmentally friendly C-MWCNT/water nanofluid compared to empirical correlations obtained from non-linear regression method. Moreover, the evolutionary algorithm has been implemented for achieving the optimal conditions to maximize the thermal conductivity and to minimize the viscosity of nanofluid. In this regard, based on real-world engineering experience, the final optimal solutions opted from several distinguished procedures of decision-making including the Bellman-Zadeh, TOPSIS and LINMAP approaches has been investigated in parallel. The results of this study revealed that the obtained outputs using TOPSIS and LINMAP procedures are the closest to ideal solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3aengineering 3ananofluids 3aneural networks 3aneurons 3aregression analysis 3athermal conductivity 3aviscosity 0aANN modeling 0aMulti-criteria optimization 0aEco-friendly nanofluid 0aThermal conductivity 0aViscosity1 aAmani, Pouria1 aMahian, Omid1 aEstellé, Patrice0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.350-359dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009500174300001400269520132700283592002801610650002201638650002301660650001301683650001101696650001301707650002001720650001401740650001101754650001701765650001501782650001001797650001301807650001401820650001101834650001501845650001401860650000801874650001401882650001401896650001401910650001001924651001701934653002301951700002101974700002701995773013202022856008502154852000902239655001202248IND60694667320221118034201.0200513e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069466732DNAL7 a10.1080/02571862.2018.15223812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoshoff, Willem HP10aReaction of South African rye, triticale and barley forage cultivars to stem and leaf rust  ap. 77-82.  aRusts are a significant threat to sustainable wheat production in South Africa. In addition to accurate genotyping, resistance breeding and surveillance, a better understanding of the epidemiology of rust pathogens will facilitate their control. This includes an improved understanding of over-summering and the occurrence of early-season inoculum on ancillary hosts. In the current study Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and P. triticina, causing stem rust and leaf rust of wheat, respectively, were avirulent on rye entries planted as forage crops in South Africa. Isolates of P. graminis f. sp. secalis and P. recondita, the stem rust and leaf rust pathogens of rye, were avirulent on all triticale forage crop cultivars screened. Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race PTKST, known for its broad virulence on wheat in South Africa, was avirulent on triticale cultivars when compared with race BPGSC. Similarly, P. triticina race CFPS proved to be more avirulent on the triticale cultivars than race SDDN. Results indicated that leaf and stem rust infections on rye and triticale forage cultivars do not pose a threat to commercial wheat production in South Africa. However, the field response of barley forage cultivars suggested that both ‘Mobey’ and ‘SKG9’ can serve as hosts for the wheat stem rust pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia graminis 3aPuccinia recondita 3aTriticum 3abarley 3abreeding 3acrop production 3acultivars 3aforage 3aforage crops 3agenotyping 3ahosts 3ainoculum 3aleaf rust 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3arye 3astem rust 3atriticale 3avirulence 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 0astem and leaf rust1 aBender, Cornel M1 aPretorius, Zacharias A0 tSouth African journal of plant and soil =.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 36, no. 2 p.77-82dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2010x2167-034X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2018.15223813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245007900176300001600255520100900271592002801280650001701308650003801325650001201363650002101375650003301396650001301429650002101442650001301463650001201476650001401488650001201502700002101514773010701535856009001642852000901732655001201741IND60082486320221122225357.0141025e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008248632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb07092.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Cruz, Noel M.10aThermal Unfolding of Gelatin in Solids as Affected by the Glass Transition  ap. E64-E68.  aThe thermal unfolding or denaturation of solid‐state proteins during processing can affect their functionality. This project explored the relation between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and thermal unfolding temperature (Tₘ) using gelatin as a model system. Freeze‐dried gelatin was prepared containing various polyol types at several concentrations. Using differential scanning calorimetry, Tₘ andTg were determined. Moisture and polyols (that is, glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, sucrose, and trehalose) promoted a lowering of both Tg andTₘ, the extent of which depended upon the plasticizer type and concentration. For all the data, Tₘ > Tg, and a plot of Tₘ against Tg indicated a linear relationship (R²= 0.95). These results suggest that formulations must be in the rubbery state to have the necessary mobility for hydrogen bond disruption that leads to protein unfolding. Glass transition data should be considered when developing processing parameters for proteinaceous systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agelatin 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen bonding 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3atrehalose 3axylitol1 aBell, Leonard N.0 tJournal of food science.g2005 Mar., v. 70, no. 2 p.E64-E68dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb07092.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007700173520113400250592002801384650003001412650001901442650002101461650001501482650001601497653002101513653002401534653003201558653003101590700003201621700003101653773011701684856008501801852000901886655001201895IND60778559720221118225205.0220621e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077855972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1203142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcTague, John Paul12aA new paradigm for Continuous Forest Inventory in industrial plantations  aIn contrast to the conventional approach of using measured yields for independent variables in a double sampling estimator, a new estimator is presented for Continuous Forest Inventory (CFI) with partial replacement that is based on projected yields for independent variables. This proposed approach requires a modern growth and yield system for prediction and projection at the stand-level. Other attributes, such as trees per hectare and basal area per hectare are indirectly derived from the Sampling with Partial Replacement (SPR) estimator, together with a consistent stand-table of tree frequency at the diameter class level. The method is extended to stratified sampling and can accommodate cases in which the sample size of permanent plots for a stand is less than 10. Recommendations are provided about the plot size and plot configurations for temporary plots with the aim of establishing procedures that are fast, easy to measure, and inexpensive. It is demonstrated that the proposed sampling estimator can also be extended to some well-known plantation species where the silvicultural practice of thinning is common.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aforest ecology 3aforest inventory 3aprediction 3asample size 0aRidge regression 0aComposite estimator 0aInventory of thinned stands 0aMixed modeling methodology1 aScolforo, Henrique Ferraço1 aScolforo, José Roberto S.0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 519 p.120314-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.1203143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245013000167300001400297520110100311592002801412650002101440650001301461650000901474650002701483650001201510650002801522650001601550700002101566700002201587700002001609700001701629700002201646700002401668700002001692700001801712700001901730700002401749700002201773700002001795700001301815773008101828856007301909852000901982655001201991IND50071895920221122010126.0150206e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007189592DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.121302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeri, Sharanabasappa B.10aDevelopment of NILs from heterogeneous inbred families for validating the rust resistance QTL in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 80-85.  aHeterogeneous inbred families segregating for rust resistance were identified from the two crosses involving susceptible (TAG 24 and TG 26) and resistant (GPBD 4) varieties of peanut. Rust‐resistant (less than score 5) and rust‐susceptible (more than score 5) plants were identified in each HIF and evaluated under rust epiphytotic conditions. The set of plants belonging to the same HIF, but differing significantly in rust resistance, not in other morphological and productivity traits, was regarded as near‐isogenic lines (NILs). Largely, rust‐resistant NILs had GPBD 4‐type allele, and susceptible NILs carried either TAG 24 or TG 26‐type allele at the three SSR loci (IPAHM103, GM1536 and GM2301) linked to a major genomic region governing rust resistance. Comparison of the remaining genomic regions between the NILs originating from each of the HIFs using transposon markers indicated a considerably high similarity of 86.4% and 83.1% in TAG 24 × GPPBD 4 and TG 26 × GPBD 4, respectively.

A typical procedure in determining kidney performance is venipuncture to obtain serum creatinine in the blood, which requires a skilled technician to perform on a laboratory basis and multiple clinical steps to acquire a meaningful result. Recently, wearable sensors have undergone immense development, especially for noninvasive health monitoring without a need for a blood sample. This article addresses a fiber-based sensing device selective for tear creatinine, which was fabricated using a copper-containing benzenedicarboxylate (BDC) metal–organic framework (MOF) bound with graphene oxide-Cu(II) and hybridized with Cu₂O nanoparticles (NPs). Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to study the binding energies of creatinine toward the ternary hybrid materials that irreversibly occurred at pendant copper ions attached with the BDC segments. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to probe the unique charge-transfer resistances of the derived sensing materials. The single-use modified sensor achieved 95.1% selectivity efficiency toward the determination of tear creatinine contents from 1.6 to 2400 μM of 10 repeated measurements in the presence of interfering species of dopamine, urea, and uric acid. The machine learning with the supervised training estimated 83.3% algorithm accuracy to distinguish among low, moderate, and high normal serum creatinine by evaluating tear creatinine. With only one step of collecting tears, this lab-on-eyeglasses with disposable hybrid textile electrodes selective for tear creatinine may be greatly beneficial for point-of-care (POC) kidney monitoring for vulnerable populations remotely, especially during pandemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acoordination polymers 3acreatinine 3adensity functional theory 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adopamine 3afabrics 3aglomerular filtration rate 3agraphene 3akidneys 3apoint-of-care systems 3aurea 3auric acid1 aSangnuang, Pantawan1 aSurareungchai, Werasak0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 21, v. 93, no. 30 p.10661-10671dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c020853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016500172300001600337520128400353592002801637596009301665596006901758650002101827650001201848650001801860650000901878650002501887650002801912650001201940650001501952650002601967650001601993650001402009650000702023650001402030650001702044650001902061650001402080650002102094650001702115650002002132650002102152650000902173651001702182653001202199653001802211653002102229700002302250700002302273700002002296773013302316856008502449852000902534655001202543IND60694667520221118034150.0200513e20190527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069466752DNAL7 a10.1080/02571862.2018.15369302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzvene, Admire R10aCharacterisation of livestock biochars and their effect on selected soil properties and maize early growth stage in soils of Eastern Cape province, South Africa  ap. 199-209.  aFew studies have evaluated biochar application rates that would make economic sense using feedstocks readily available to subsistence farmers. Biochar from livestock manures were examined in Oakleaf and Tukulu soils. Pyrolysis had the most effect on poultry manure where it increased pH (7.8%), electrical conductivity (19.8%), total phosphorus (31%) and zinc (23.9%). Maize germination percentage in Oakleaf soil was enhanced more under cattle manure biochar (CMB) at 100 kg C ha−1, which differed from the control by 14.29%. In Tukulu soil, CMB at 400 kg C ha−1 enhanced germination percentage more and this increase was 22.50% higher than that of the control. In Oakleaf soil, 100 kg C ha−1 was optimal to increase plant height under sheep manure biochar (SMB), goat manure biochar (GMB), and poultry manure biochar (PMB), whereas 400 kg C ha−1 was optimal under CMB; however, in Tukulu soil 100 kg C ha−1 was optimum under GMB and CMB. The difference from the control in plant biomass was highest (28.06%) under SMB at 400 kg C ha−1 in the Oakleaf soil, whereas in Tukulu soil SMB at 300 kg C ha−1 produced the highest (19.03%) plant biomass. Overall, CMB provided a better alternative for use in Tukulu and Oakleaf soils, but field trials need to be conducted.  aPublisher supplied data  aPR_CSUR180208310950cNational Research Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001321  apr_csur180208310950cGovan Mbeki Research and Development Centre 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acattle manure 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3aelectrical conductivity 3afarmers 3afeedstocks 3afield experimentation 3agoat manure 3alivestock 3apH 3aphytomass 3aplant height 3apoultry manure 3apyrolysis 3aseed germination 3asheep manure 3asoil properties 3atotal phosphorus 3azinc 3aSouth Africa 0abiomass 0afood security 0alivestock manure1 aChiduza, Cornelius1 aMnkeni, Pearson NS1 aPeter, Prince C0 tSouth African journal of plant and soil =.g2019 May 27, v. 36, no. 3 p.199-209dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2010x2167-034X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2018.15369303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008400163500001100247520147900258592002801737650002501765650002501790650001901815650001301834650002901847650002901876650000901905650001001914650001301924650004201937650001601979650001701995650001702012650002302029650000902052650001702061650001202078650002202090650001202112650001602124650001402140650002802154650001402182650001102196650002502207650001302232650002002245650001202265700002102277700002002298773014002318856007802458852000902536655001202545IND60660588320221118171800.0190823e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066058832DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2018005692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidel, Ulrike10aTaurine: A Regulator of Cellular Redox Homeostasis and Skeletal Muscle Function  aREVIEW  aTaurine is a nonproteinogenic ß‐aminosulfonic acid. Important dietary sources of taurine are fish and seafood. Taurine interacts with ion channels, stabilizes membranes, and regulates the cell volume. These actions confirm its high concentrations in excitable tissues like retina, neurons, and muscles. Retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy, as well as skeletal muscle malfunction are evident in taurine‐deficient phenotypes. There is evidence that taurine counteracts lipid peroxidation and increases cellular antioxidant defense in response to inflammation. In activated neutrophils, taurine reacts with hypochloric acid to form taurine chloramine, which triggers the Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1–nuclear factor E2‐related factor 1 (Keap1–Nrf2) pathway. Consequently, Nrf2 target genes, such as heme oxygenase‐1 and catalase, are induced. Furthermore, taurine may prevent an overload of reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly by an inhibition of ROS generation within the respiratory chain. Taurine affects mitochondrial bioenergetics and taurine‐deficient mice exhibit an impaired exercise performance. Moreover, some studies demonstrate that taurine enhances the glycogen repletion in the postexercise recovery phase. In the case of taurine deficiency, many studies observed a phenotype known in muscle senescence and skeletal muscle disorders. Overall, taurine plays an important role in cellular redox homeostasis and skeletal muscle function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aathletic performance 3acardiomyopathy 3acatalase 3adietary nutrient sources 3aelectron transport chain 3afish 3agenes 3aglycogen 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3aion channels 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3amuscular diseases 3aneurons 3aneutrophils 3aphenotype 3areactive oxygen species 3arepletion 3aretina 3aretinal degeneration 3aseafoods 3askeletal muscle 3ataurine1 aHuebbe, Patricia1 aRimbach, Gerald0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Aug., v. 63, no. 16 p.e1800569-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2018005693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009800158300002000256520104000276592002801316650002201344650001101366650001301377650002501390700002101415700001901436700002001455700002001475700001801495700001601513773014401529856007501673852000901748655001201757IND60753461920221116152413.0211015e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075346192DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta04958e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Naoki,10aBonding heterogeneity in mixed-anion compounds realizes ultralow lattice thermal conductivity  ap. 22660-22669.  aCrystalline materials with intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity (κₗₐₜ) pave the way towards high performance in various energy applications, including thermoelectrics. Here we demonstrate a strategy to realize ultralow κₗₐₜ using mixed-anion compounds. Our calculations reveal that locally distorted structures in chalcohalides MnPnS₂Cl (Pn = Sb, Bi) derive bonding heterogeneity, which in turn causes a peak splitting of the phonon density of states. This splitting induces a large amount of scattering phase space. Consequently, the κₗₐₜ of MnPnS₂Cl is significantly lower than that of a single-anion sulfide CuTaS₃ with a similar crystal structure. The experimental κₗₐₜ of MnPnS₂Cl takes an ultralow value of about 0.5 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ at 300 K. Our findings will encourage the exploration of thermal transport in mixed-anion compounds, which remains a vast unexplored space, especially regarding unexpectedly low κₗₐₜ in lightweight materials derived from bonding heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3asulfides 3athermal conductivity1 aKuroda, Norihide1 aNakamura, Shun1 aKatsura, Yukari1 aKanazawa, Ikuzo1 aKimura, Kaoru1 aMori, Takao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 9, no. 39 p.22660-22669dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta04958e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04022naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009100174300001600265500001900281520238800300536019502688592002802883596001202911650005802923650001202981650001902993650001203012650001903024650001903043650001103062650002503073650001303098650001903111650002803130653002703158653002303185653001603208653003403224653001503258653002603273700002103299700001903320773010703339856008503446852000903531655001203540IND60736254820221119004517.0210506e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073625482DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2020.18433882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonegger, Matthias10aPotential implications of carbon dioxide removal for the sustainable development goals  ap. 678-698.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs the international community’s best expression of a collective vision of a desirable future, the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present a framework against which to assess the broader impact of emerging technologies. Implications of technologies and practices for removing CO₂ from the atmosphere (CDR) are not fully understood and have not yet been mapped against the full range of SDGs. CDR is widely seen as necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement’s global goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2°C, yet local geographical, socio-economic, and political interdependencies are often overlooked. This review synthesizes the best available understandings of potential implications of CDR options aiming to complement emissions reductions. It seeks to identify effects on and interactions between specific social, environmental, and policy environments, in which various CDR options could be pursued. Climate change mitigation and co-benefits from CDR could significantly benefit SDGs, yet poorly designed CDR policies could also challenge SDGs. Specific CDR options could generate conflicts over land, water, biomass, or electric power resources, and exclude communities from policy benefits with negative cascading effects for a range of SDGs. In the literature, implications of CDR activities on sustainable development are derived from current pilot activities, inferred from similar practices already operational or model outputs regarding land, energy, or material requirements. Important gaps remain. We identify questions for further disciplinary and inter- or transdisciplinary work strengthening understanding of how CDR could either support or threaten the achievement of the SDGs. Key policy insights CO₂ removal (CDR) appears essential for limiting warming to well below 2°C; such stabilization of global climate is a precondition for at least partially achieving the SDGs. CDR options can generate positive and negative local/regional impacts on various SDGs via physical, social, economic, and political channels. None of these options are universally ‘good’ or ‘bad’. The scale of implementation of CDR and related impacts are highly dependent on policy design and national planning processes. More research is needed to clarify how policy design can allow CDR options to generate synergies between, and prevent harm across, multiple SDGs.  aThis work was supported by the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative (C2G) and Energimyndigheten [Grant Number 46193-1].

Based on the energy consumption characteristics of the numerical control (NC) machine tool, the energy consumption module of NC machine tool was analyzed. The power composition of machining process which was based on energy consumption module was proposed, and then CSEC was given with the cutting process parameters. The optimization model to minimum cutting specific energy consumption and minimum processing time was established with the process parameters under the actual constraint conditions in the manufacturing process. The multi-objective optimization model was transformed into the single objective optimization model by introducing the subjective and objective comprehensive weights and solved by the quantum genetic algorithm. When the optimization goal was to trade off processing time and CSEC to reduce the energy consumption, the selecting of the milling parameters should consider the complex effect if the constraints could be met with, large feed speed and large milling depth could benefit if the constrains of milling process were met with. The processing energy consumption of optimized process parameters decreased 27.21% compared with that of preferred process parameters while CSEC was reduced 32.07% and the processing time was reduced 34.11%. The proposed approach in this paper provided an efficient solution to reduce the impact of the environment caused by energy consumption and to realize the sustainable manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acutting 3aenergy 3amanufacturing 3amilling 3amodels 3aspecific energy 3asustainable manufacturing 0aEnergy consumption 0aCSEC 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aSubjective and objective comprehensive weight 0aQuantum genetic algorithm1 aZhang, Hua1 aFu, Yahui1 aWan, Linlin1 aLiu, Wei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 10, v. 166 p.1407-1414dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008600180300001600266520117200282592002801454650001301482650002201495650001301517650001101530650002001541650002401561650001801585650002301603650003201626650001001658650001801668650001001686650002401696650002401720650001201744650001301756650001201769650001301781651002101794653001301815653002301828653001801851653001401869700002001883700001701903700002901920773011801949856008602067852000902153655001202162IND60671357720221120115936.0210114e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067135772DNAL7 a10.1080/03670244.2019.16177062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGezmen-Karadağ, Makbule10aSchool Teachers’ Awareness about National Obesity Prevention Programs in Turkey  ap. 470-480.  aNutritional programs are one of the most important public health policies in order to prevent obesity. School teachers are role models for students and their nutrition knowledge about these policies can affect children’s dietary habits. The aim of this observational descriptive study was to evaluate the school teachers’ awareness about nutrition programs for the prevention of obesity of the Ministry of Education in Turkey. It was conducted to 87,070 classroom teachers working at state schools from all the cities of Turkey. Data collection was obtained with a plain web-based survey, and national nutrition programs (Nutrition-Friendly School Program, White-Flag Protocol, and circular letter on foods can be sold in school canteens) were questioned. Mean age of teachers was 38.3 ± 9.30 years and 50.4% of them were male. It was determined that only 66.2% of the teachers know whether their school is nutrition-friendly. Frequency of knowing “White-Flag” Protocol was 80.1%. Present study showed that educational programs about nutrition policies are required in order to increase knowledge among school teachers and thus, prevent childhood obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acities 3adata collection 3adescriptive studies 3aeating habits 3aeducation programs 3afood and nutrition programs 3afoods 3ahealth policy 3amales 3anutrition knowledge 3aschool food service 3aschools 3astudents 3asurveys 3ateachers 3aTurkey (country) 0aChildren 0aobesity prevention 0aschool health 0anutrition1 aYildiran, Hilal1 aKöksal, Eda1 aErtaş Öztürk, Yasemin0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g2019 Sept. 3, v. 58, no. 5 p.470-480dRoutledgewJournal:jnl2815x1543-52377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2019.16177063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245013200213300001600345520149900361592002801860650002701888650001801915650001601933650001101949650002901960650002901989650002502018650001802043650001302061650002502074650001202099651001002111653001402121653001602135653001302151653001802164653001502182653001402197773010402211856008502315852000902400655001202409IND60570656520221118054736.0170708e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057065652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Hidenori1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4712-781010aPolitical and environmental attitude toward participatory energy and environmental governance: A survey in post-Fukushima Japan  ap. 190-198.  aThe Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent Fukushima nuclear accident triggered citizen dialogue on energy and environmental management in Japan. However, an international survey has shown that the willingness of Japanese citizens to participate in political and social activities has declined since the Fukushima accident. Employing an internet-based survey in four urban or nuclear power plant-hosting prefectures in Japan, this study examines the willingness to participate in random sampling deliberation on post-disaster energy and environmental policy. It focuses on the effects of political, environmental, and social attitudes towards willingness to participate in citizen dialogue. The survey shows around 40% of respondents may participate in energy and environmental deliberation. Statistical analysis reveals that environmental consciousness raises the propensity to participate in deliberation, while political obedience and social hesitation decreases the will to participate. The effect of environmental attitudes is larger than that of political and social attitudes. The survey also finds that governmental response to deliberation, i.e., information generation and disclosure based on requests from citizen dialogue, encourages participation in deliberation in a conservative prefecture, when citizen dialogue is held at the national level. Random sampling deliberation opens a new mode of environmental governance regardless of local political and social characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconsciousness 3aearthquakes 3aenergy 3aenvironmental governance 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental policy 3anuclear power 3apolitics 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3aJapan 0aDemocracy 0aCitizenship 0aDialogue 0aParticipation 0aGovernance 0aFukushima0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 201 p.190-198dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011100160500001100271520135700282592002801639596008601667596005901753596007401812650001401886650002801900650001001928650001801938650002101956650001101977650001801988650001402006650004302020650002602063650003102089650001902120650002202139650001102161650000802172650001602180700001702196700001602213700001302229700001302242700001402255700001602269700001402285700005402299773014002353856007802493852000902571655001202580IND60660588420221118171818.0190823e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066058842DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2019003892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Mengshi10aTea Consumption and Health Outcomes: Umbrella Review of Meta‐Analyses of Observational Studies in Humans  aREVIEW  aSCOPE: The aim of this article is to conduct an umbrella review to study the strength and validity of associations between tea consumption and diverse health outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Meta‐analyses of observational studies examining associations between tea consumption and health outcomes in all human populations and settings are screened. The umbrella review identifies 96 meta‐analyses with 40 unique health outcomes. Tea consumption shows greater benefits than harm to health in this review. Dose–response analyses of tea consumption indicates reduced risks of total mortality, cardiac death, coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus with increment of two to three cups per day. Beneficial associations are also found for several cancers, skeletal, cognitive, and maternal outcomes. Harmful associations are found for esophageal and gastric cancer when the temperature of intake is more than 55–60 °C. CONCLUSION: Tea consumption, except for very hot tea, seems generally safe at usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating the largest reduction for diverse health outcomes at two to three cups per day. Generally, tea consumption seems more beneficial than harmful in this umbrella review. Randomized controlled trials are further needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal.  aPublisher supplied data  a98–680cChinese Medical Board Grant on Evidence‐Based Medicine, New York, USA  a30901427cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016SZ0047cSichuan Provincial Science and Technology Support Project 3acognition 3acoronary artery disease 3adeath 3adose response 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobservational studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk reduction 3astomach neoplasms 3astroke 3atea 3atemperature1 aWu, Xiaoting1 aZhuang, Wen1 aXia, Lin1 aChen, Yi1 aZhao, Rui1 aWan, Qianyi1 aDu, Liang1 aZhou, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2918-22420 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Aug., v. 63, no. 16 p.e1900389-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019003893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245007900203300001400282520140000296592002801696650002101724650001201745650001801757650002001775650001801795650001701813650000901830650001901839650002401858650001301882650001301895650001701908650000901925650002001934653002501954653000801979653002101987653002002008653001402028700001902042700001402061773010002075856008302175852000902258655001202267IND60618071320221118101439.0190411e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061807132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanders, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9634-985310aTreating canine Cushing’s syndrome: Current options and future prospects  ap. 42-51.  aNaturally occurring hypercortisolism, also known as Cushing’s syndrome, is a common endocrine disorder in dogs that can be caused by an adenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenoma (pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism, PDH; 80–85% of cases), or by an adrenocortical tumor (ACT; 15–20% of cases). To determine the optimal treatment strategy, differentiating between these two main causes is essential. Good treatment options are surgical removal of the causal tumor, i.e. hypophysectomy for PDH and adrenalectomy for an ACT, or radiotherapy in cases with PDH. Because these options are not without risks, not widely available and not suitable for every patient, pharmacotherapy is often used. In cases with PDH, the steroidogenesis inhibitor trilostane is most often used. In cases with an ACT, either trilostane or the adrenocorticolytic drug mitotane can be used. Although mostly effective, both treatments have disadvantages. This review discusses the current treatment options for canine hypercortisolism, and considers their mechanism of action, efficacy, adverse effects, and effect on survival. In addition, developments in both adrenal-targeting and pituitary-targeting drugs that have the potential to become future treatment options are discussed, as a more selective and preferably also tumor-targeted approach could have many advantages for both PDH and ACTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCushing syndrome 3aadenoma 3aadrenalectomy 3aadverse effects 3acorticotropin 3adog diseases 3adogs 3ahypophysectomy 3amechanism of action 3amitotane 3apatients 3aradiotherapy 3arisk 3asteroidogenesis 0aCushing’s syndrome 0aDog 0aHypercortisolism 0aPharmacotherapy 0aTreatment1 aKooistra, H.S.1 aGalac, S.0 tveterinary journal.g2018 Nov., v. 241 p.42-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2018.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04847naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007100166300001600237500001900253520263900272536031402911592002803225596011803253596009803371596007703469596012003546650001903666650001103685650005803696650001103754650001903765650001903784650002503803650002303828650001103851650002503862650001103887650002203898651001003920651001003930653001803940653000903958653002203967653003003989653002204019700001704041700001604058700001804074773010704092856008504199852000904284655001204293IND60736255120221117234154.0210506e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073625512DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2020.18642672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Qiwen10aDrivers of global and national CO₂ emissions changes 2000–2017  ap. 604-615.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the drivers of CO₂ emissions changes is useful in supporting future mitigation. This study applies a log-mean divisia index decomposition to assess four drivers of CO₂ emissions changes – population, income, energy intensity and carbon intensity – in 138 countries worldwide over the period 2000–2017. At the global level, income and population are the main drivers of increased emissions over time, with contributions of 116% and 60% to global CO₂ emissions changes, respectively. Energy intensity is the key mitigation driver, with a contribution of −80%. Although carbon intensity increased CO₂ emissions overall over the period 2000–2017 with a contribution of 4%, it has started to reduce emissions in recent years. China, the United States of America, the European Union, India and Russia are the five regions responsible for most changes in global emissions. The five regions together contribute −73% of the energy intensity effect, and China’s income contribution is 83% in relation to the total of 116%. At the national level, in 2017, CO₂ emissions returned to below 2000 levels in 62% of Annex I (developed) countries but increased in 88% of non-Annex I (mostly developing) countries. Among the 35 countries realizing CO₂ emissions reductions, 24 were driven primarily by energy intensity, six by carbon intensity, three by economic recession, and one by population decrease. Among the 103 countries with increasing CO₂ emissions, 63 were driven primarily by income, 26 by population, nine by carbon intensity increase, and five by energy intensity increase. Our analysis emphasizes the necessity of considering differences in national development stages when formulating climate change mitigation policies. Key policy insights Over the period 2000–2017, at the global and national levels, CO₂ emissions increases were driven mainly by economic development and population growth, and mitigation was driven mainly by energy intensity improvement. Improving energy intensity and carbon intensity is the key to mitigating CO₂ emissions. Carbon intensity is expected to play an increasing role in the future. In over one-third of Annex I countries, CO₂ emissions increased from 2000 to 2017. To meet the Paris Agreement goals, Annex I countries will need to enhance mitigation ambition by further tapping the mitigation potentials of energy and carbon intensity. In accordance with national circumstances, development needs and international support, non-Annex I countries should achieve low-carbon economic and energy transitions and peak CO₂ emissions as early as possible.  aThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC1509001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71703167), the Tsinghua University – INDITEX Sustainable Development Fund (TISD201909), and the Science Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing (2462020YXZZ038).  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC1509001cNational Key RD Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China  a71703167cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aTISD201909cTsinghua University – INDITEX Sustainable Development Fund  a2462020YXZZ038cScience Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijingdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010244 3aEuropean Union 3aRussia 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic recession 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3aincome 3apopulation growth 3aChina 3aIndia 0aCO2 emissions 0aLMDI 0aemissions drivers 0aclimate change mitigation 0adevelopment stage1 aWang, Hailin1 aLiu, Xinzhe1 aPan, Xunzhang0 tClimate policy.g2021 May 28, v. 21, no. 5 p.604-615dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2020.18642673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245013600177300001800313520090000331592002801231650000901259650001601268650001601284650001301300650000901313650001901322650002101341650001101362650002301373650001101396650002201407650002401429650000901453700002101462700001901483700002101502700002201523700001701545773010901562856009001671852000901761655001201770IND60082486920221122225249.0141025e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008248692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb07088.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Young‐Hee10aProtective Effect of Microencapsulation Consisting of Multiple Emulsification and Heat Gelation Processes on Immunoglobulin in Yolk  ap.

Path coefficient analysis in sugarcane showed number, height and diameter of stalks control cane yield. The objectives of this study were to determine optimum combinations of number, height and diameter of stalks for high sugarcane yield in agro-ecological regions and evaluate the increase in yield when optimum combinations were applied during selection. Data for number, height, diameter of stalks and cane yield measured from seven breeding populations, each representing an agro-ecological region in South Africa, were analysed using logistic regression. The optimum trait combinations for low yield agro-ecological environments was higher number of stalks that were taller, whereas in high yield environments, thicker stalks were favourable. Harvest ages 18–24 months suited genotypes with more stalks than 12 months. The genotypes selected using optimum trait combinations produced 43% to 89% higher cane yield than those discarded. The high-yielding genotypes produced more stalks that were taller and thicker than the low-yielding genotypes. The highest yield advantage of 72% to 89% were attained in regions with lowest yield potential. The benefits from using trait combinations were highest in breeding programmes located in harsh agro-ecological regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecological zones 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3agenotype 3aplant breeding 3aregression analysis 3asugarcane 3ayield components 3aSouth Africa 0aagro-ecological regional breeding 0asugarcane breeding0 tSouth African journal of plant and soil =.g2019 May 27, v. 36, no. 3 p.211-219dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2010x2167-034X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2018.15370133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245010000215300002000315520205300335592002802388650002502416650002302441650001402464650003002478650001902508650002202527650002302549650001602572650001702588650001502605650002202620700002002642700005902662700006102721700005802782700005902840773013102899856008403030852000903114655001203123IND60746399520220218000000.0210803e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074639952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c022442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarunaratne, Erandika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2338-181410aHigh-Throughput Non-targeted Chemical Structure Identification Using Gas-Phase Infrared Spectra  ap. 10688-10696.  aThe high-throughput identification of unknown metabolites in biological samples remains challenging. Most current non-targeted metabolomics studies rely on mass spectrometry, followed by computational methods that rank thousands of candidate structures based on how closely their predicted mass spectra match the experimental mass spectrum of an unknown. We reasoned that the infrared (IR) spectra could be used in an analogous manner and could add orthologous structure discrimination; however, this has never been evaluated on large data sets. Here, we present results of a high-throughput computational method for predicting IR spectra of candidate compounds obtained from the PubChem database. Predicted spectra were ranked based on their similarity to gas-phase experimental IR spectra of test compounds obtained from the NIST. Our computational workflow (IRdentify) consists of a fast semiempirical quantum mechanical method for initial IR spectra prediction, ranking, and triaging, followed by a final IR spectra prediction and ranking using density functional theory. This approach resulted in the correct identification of 47% of 258 test compounds. On average, there were 2152 candidate structures evaluated for each test compound, giving a total of approximately 555,200 candidate structures evaluated. We discuss several variables that influenced the identification accuracy and then demonstrate the potential application of this approach in three areas: (1) combining IR and mass spectra rankings into a single composite rank score, (2) identifying the precursor and fragment ions using cryogenic ion vibrational spectroscopy, and (3) the incorporation of a trimethylsilyl derivatization step to extend the method compatibility to less-volatile compounds. Overall, our results suggest that matching computational with experimental IR spectra is a potentially powerful orthogonal option for adding significant high-throughput chemical structure discrimination when used with other non-targeted chemical structure identification methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achemical structure 3adatabases 3adensity functional theory 3aderivatization 3amass spectrometry 3amechanical methods 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics1 aHill, Dennis W.1 aPracht, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8495-95041 aGascón, José A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4176-90301 aGrimme, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5844-43711 aGrant, David F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3616-66890 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 21, v. 93, no. 30 p.10688-10696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c022443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169300001600311520128400327592002801611650001501639650001501654650000901669650001801678650001401696650000901710650001601719650002401735650001801759650001701777650001201794651001701806653001901823653001601842653001901858653002401877700003101901773013301932856008502065852000902150655001202159IND60694668220221118034258.0200513e20190527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069466822DNAL7 a10.1080/02571862.2018.15443812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStolk, Anizka10aClay and iron oxide contents of prismacutanic B, G, soft plinthic B, and E horizons described during the land type survey of South Africa  ap. 165-172.  aHumans organise their environment, including soils. With soil classification the challenge is to consistently differentiate between soils. This study was therefore initiated to summarise selected properties of the prismacutanic B, G, soft plinthic B, and E horizons, described during the land type survey of South Africa, and to define quantitative differentiating criteria for these horizons. A total of 1 181 soil profiles, comprising 299 Sterkspruit, 331 Estcourt, 49 Katspuit, 257 Kroonstad, 103 Westleigh and 142 Longlands soils were extracted from the database and used in the analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose the following criteria be used to quantitatively differentiate between the studied horizons: E horizons have <1.0% Fe and <16% clay; with practically no change in either Fe or clay content from the overlying horizon; with a Fe:clay ratio <0.04. Soft plinthic B horizons have ≥1.0% Fe and <25% clay; the clay increase from the overlying horizon is >1.5 times; with a Fe:clay ratio ≥0.04. G horizons have ≥1.0% Fe and >25% clay; the clay increase from the overlying horizon is >1.0; with a Fe:clay ratio <0.04. Prismacutanic B horizons have ≥1.0% Fe and >25% clay; the clay increase from the overlying horizon is >2.5; with a Fe:clay ratio <0.04.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB horizons 3aE horizons 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3adatabases 3airon 3airon oxides 3asoil classification 3asoil profiles 3asoil texture 3asurveys 3aSouth Africa 0aclassification 0adiagnostics 0aquantification 0awetland delineation1 avan Huyssteen, Cornelius W0 tSouth African journal of plant and soil =.g2019 May 27, v. 36, no. 3 p.165-172dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2010x2167-034X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2018.15443813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015100171300002000322520150600342592002801848650002501876650001601901650002301917650001601940650002201956650002101978650001201999650001202011650001102023650002202034650001602056650002602072650001402098650001402112650001502126650001602141650002602157650001602183700002002199700001402219700001502233700001602248700005402264773013102318856008402449852000902533655001202542IND60746399620221116214447.0210803e20210720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074639962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c022742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Changxiang10aReusable OIRD Microarray Chips Based on a Bienzyme-Immobilized Polyaniline Nanowire Forest for Multiplexed Detection of Biological Small Molecules  ap. 10697-10703.  aQuantitative detection of multiple biological small molecules is critical for health evaluation and disease diagnosis. In this study, a microarray chip featuring a bienzyme-immobilized polyaniline nanowire forest on fluorine-doped tin oxide (bienzyme-PANI/FTO) is developed for this purpose. On such a chip, the target molecules are oxidized under the catalysis of their attached oxidases to produce hydrogen peroxide, which further induces the partial oxidation of local PANI nanowires in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme. The redox state change of PANI nanowires is monitored by the oblique incident reflectivity difference (OIRD) technique in a real-time and wireless manner, thus allowing for quantitative analysis of the target molecules. As typical model targets, hydrogen peroxide, glucose, lactic acid, and cholesterol are successfully detected with low detection limits, excellent specificities, and broad detection ranges, all of which fully meet the requirements for clinical analysis of human serum samples. Simultaneous detection of multiple targets on an individual chip is further demonstrated using the OIRD scanning mode. Meanwhile, by simple electrochemical reduction of the PANI nanowires, the chip is reusable for more than eight detection cycles without evident decay in its performance. The detection principle of this chip is also universal to other small molecules, and thus, it shows great promise as a valuable device to analyze biological small molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3acatalytic activity 3acholesterol 3adisease diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aforests 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactic acid 3amicroarray technology 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3apolyaniline 3aquantitative analysis 3atin dioxide1 aZhong, Changyin1 aChen, Nan1 aYi, Lingya1 aLi, Junying1 aHu, Weihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6278-95510 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 20, v. 93, no. 30 p.10697-10703dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c022743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245007100153300001800224520096500242592002801207650004401235650001901279650002501298650002301323650002001346650006601366650002801432650001301460650001301473650002901486650001601515700001301531700001301544700001101557700001301568700001201581700001401593700001401607700001301621773012501634856007401759852000901833655001201842IND60639817820221119074904.0190503e20160418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063981782DNAL7 a10.1039/c5gc02830b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Z.10aCarbon dioxide as a sustainable resource for macrocyclic oligourea  ap. 2528-2533.  aAs carbon dioxide is an inexpensive, abundant, sustainable and green carbonyl resource, its utilization to produce value-added chemicals and polymeric materials has attracted much more attention. In this work, novel macrocyclic oligourea were synthesized and it is the first time to produce macrocyclic oligourea from a sustainable substrate of CO₂. The chemical composition and molecular structure of oligourea have been confirmed by FTIR, MALDI-TOF and tandem mass spectrometry. The formation of macrocyclic polyurea largely depends on the kind of solvent chosen and the reaction duration, which has been discussed according to the reaction phase behavior observation. The synthesized novel macrocyclic oligourea is expected to have important and special applications in the pharmaceutical industry. The present work provides a green and renewable process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic oligomer, which opens a new route for carbon dioxide utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3agreen chemistry 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avalue added1 aDong, Y.1 aWang, J.1 aYu, Y.1 aZhou, Y.1 aSun, Y.1 aZhang, C.1 aCheng, H.1 aZhao, F.0 tGreen chemistry.g2016 Apr. 18, v. 18, no. 8 p.2528-2533dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5gc02830b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014500168300001600313520132600329592002801655650001001683650001701693650001501710650001701725650001001742650002901752650001801781650001201799650001001811650001601821650001901837650001101856650001501867650001601882650002301898650001801921651001001939653002901949653004401978653002302022653001702045653001502062700001502077700001202092700001602104700001402120700001602134700001502150700001502165700001802180700001302198773010702211856008202318852000902400655001202409IND60570657120221118054837.0220523e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057065712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Changchun10aTracing high time-resolution fluctuations in dissolved organic carbon using satellite and buoy observations: Case study in Lake Taihu, China  ap. 174-182.  aField measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and remote-sensing reflectance were conducted to develop a regional, empirical red-blue algorithm to retrieve surface DOC from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data for Lake Taihu, China. The auxiliary data (in-situ observations of the optical properties and water quality, buoy measurements of hydrodynamic data and water chemical parameters) were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variations in DOC. GOCI was shown to be capable of successfully obtaining hourly variations in DOC, with a root mean square error percentage (RMSP) of 17.29% (RMSE=0.69mg/L) for the match-up data. The GOCI-derived DOC in Lake Taihu confirms that the highest DOC concentration is in northwest Lake Taihu, followed by Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay and northeast Lake Taihu. Hourly DOC variation is significant and presents a different trend for each lake segment due to the variety of influencing factors. Discharge of DOC from surrounding rivers is an important factor to the variation of DOC in northeast Lake Taihu. However, organic products of algae will be the primary contributor to DOC when algal bloom occurred. During the period of algal bloom, high DOC levels in Lake Taihu can lead to hypoxia when coupled with high temperatures and low disturbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acolor 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahydrodynamics 3ahypoxia 3alakes 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asatellites 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3aChina 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aGeostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) 0aOptical properties 0aCarbon cycle 0aLake Taihu1 aYunmei, Li1 aLiu, Ge1 aGuo, Yulong1 aYang, Hao1 aZhu, A-xing1 aSong, Ting1 aHuang, Tao1 aZhang, Mingli1 aShi, Kun0 tITC journal.g2017 Oct., v. 62 p.174-182dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009400172300001600266520178200282536012602064592002802190650001502218650001502233650000802248650001002256650001402266650002002280650001002300650003102310650001002341650002102351650001202372650001402384650003202398650001702430650000902447650002102456650001102477650001302488651000902501653002602510653002702536653002802563653002402591700002402615700001702639773012202656856008502778852000902863655001202872IND60671358420221120131020.0191003e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067135842DNAL7 a10.1080/03949370.2019.16300132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasazuka, Makoto10aShell utilization and shell-shedding behaviour by the land hermit crab Coenobita spinosus  ap. 544-556.  aGastropod shells are vital resources for hermit crabs for their growth, reproduction and survival. However, the land hermit crab Coenobita spinosus, which lives in wet and dark coastal forests, sheds its shell. In the present study, to understand this unique behaviour in terms of its ecological and evolutionary aspects, we examined shell utilization and shell-shedding behaviour by C. spinosus as well as sympatric C. brevimanus as a reference. We searched for land hermit crabs during the night on the island of Guam. The shells of the crabs were grasped with the fingers and held up in the air; then, crab behaviour (shell shed or not shed), body size of the crab, and shell length were recorded. Almost all individuals of C. brevimanus occupied shells of invasive giant African snails, and the larger crabs occupied larger shells, whereas C. spinosus occupied smaller snail shells. C. spinosus also utilized nut shells and plastic caps, which were much smaller than the snail shells. Our results suggest that niche differentiation in terms of shell use might have occurred through a shift in shell utilization by C. spinosus to smaller shell types. When the shells of the crabs were held up, a large proportion of C. spinosus individuals shed their shells, whereas almost all C. brevimanus retreated into and hid in their shells. It is known that diurnal birds prey on land hermit crabs. We hypothesize that when a bird grasps a shell of C. spinosus with its bill, the crab itself could be retained within the ground debris through the shell-shedding behaviour, thereby reducing the predation risk. Our hypotheses should be tested by elucidating the original shell use habits and predator-prey interactions of C. spinosus in populations on islands without invasive snails.  aThis study did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aPaguroidea 3aair 3abirds 3abody size 3acoastal forests 3acrabs 3aecological differentiation 3ahulls 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3areproduction 3arisk 3ashell (molluscs) 3asnails 3asympatry 3aGuam 0aniche differentiation 0aantipredator behaviour 0aterrestrial hermit crab 0agiant African snail1 aHamasaki, Katsuyuki1 aDan, Shigeki0 tEthology, ecology & evolution.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 31, no. 6 p.544-556dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12280x1828-71317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2019.16300133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015600168300002000324520177000344592002802114650000802142650002502150650002502175650001602200650002202216650002002238650001702258650001702275650002102292650001102313650001802324650002802342650001902370700001302389700001702402700001602419700006002435773013102495856008402626852000902710655001202719IND60746399720221116214253.0210803e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074639972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c022852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li-juan10a3′-Terminal Repair-Powered Dendritic Nanoassembly of Polyadenine Molecular Beacons for One-Step Quantification of Alkaline Phosphatase in Human Serum  ap. 10704-10711.  aAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an important hydrolase with crucial roles in biological processes, and the dysregulation of ALP may cause various human diseases. The conventional ALP assays usually involve cumbersome procedures with poor sensitivity. Herein, taking advantage of intrinsic superiorities of molecular beacons (MBs) and unique features of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), we demonstrate for the first time the 3′-terminal repair-powered dendritic nanoassembly of polyadenine (A) MBs for one-step quantification of ALP in human serum. When ALP is present, it catalyzes 3′-terminal dephosphorylation of poly-A MBs to induce TdT-mediated template-free polymerization, generating long chains of polythymidine (T) sequences. The long poly-T chains can function as the anchoring templates to hybridize with many poly-A MBs, leading to the unfolding of loop structures and the dissociation of FAM/BHQ1 pairs (the 1st amplification stage). Subsequently, all 3′-hydroxylated poly-A MBs can be extended with the assistance of TdT to generate the branched long poly-T chains, leading to the hybridization of more poly-A MBs and the dissociation of more FAM/BHQ1 pairs (the 2nd amplification stage). Through multiple rounds of extension, assembly, and activation of poly-A MBs, dendritic DNA nanostructures are automatically formed, resulting in the dissociation of abundant fluorophores from the FAM/BHQ1 pairs to generate an exponentially amplified fluorescence signal (the nth amplification stage). This strategy possesses high sensitivity and excellent specificity, and the detection limit can reach 1 cell. Moreover, it can evaluate kinetic parameters, screen inhibitors, estimate cellular inhibition effects, and measure ALP in human serums.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3adephosphorylation 3adetection limit 3adissociation 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahumans 3ahybridization 3anucleotidyltransferases 3apolymerization1 aLiu, Hao1 aZou, Xiaoran1 aXu, Qinfeng1 aZhang, Chun-yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8010-19810 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 July 22, v. 93, no. 30 p.10704-10711dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c022853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007700171300001600248520108100264592002801345650002301373650001601396650002201412650001501434650001101449650001401460650001201474650002101486650001701507650002401524650001301548650001401561650001101575650001101586650001001597650001701607650001601624653001301640653002201653653001001675653001101685653000901696700002101705700002001726700001901746773011301765856008601878852000901964655001201973IND60581837220221119152147.0190321e20171110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058183722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalma, Vincenzo10aHighly active and stable Pt-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts for ethanol reforming  ap. 263-272.  aIn this work, the Pt-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation and tested for steam and oxidative steam reforming of ethanol at low-temperature (300–600 °C).

During stability tests, carried out at 500 °C and 20,000 h−1 for at least 45 h, oxygen addition reduced carbon formation rate (CFR) of almost 30%, assuring a complete conversion for 55 h.

Remote sensing data, collected at various spatial resolutions, provide an effective way to map the spatial distribution of mangrove forests over time. However, the spectral signatures of mangrove forests are significantly affected by tide levels. Therefore, mangrove forests may not be accurately mapped with remote sensing data collected during a single-tidal event, especially if not acquired at low tide. This research reports how a decision-tree −based procedure was developed to map mangrove forests using multi-tidal Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Three indices, including the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDVIL·NDMIH (the multiplication of NDVIL by NDMIH, L: low tide level, H: high tide level) were used in this algorithm to differentiate mangrove forests from other land-cover and land-use types in Fangchenggang City, China. Additionally, the recent Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data were selected to validate the results and compare if the methodology is reliable. The results demonstrate that short-term multi-tidal remotely-sensed data better represent the unique nearshore coastal wetland habitats of mangrove forests than single-tidal data. Furthermore, multi-tidal remotely-sensed data has led to improved accuracies using two classification approaches: i.e. decision trees and the maximum likelihood classification (MLC). Since mangrove forests are typically found at low elevations, the inclusion of elevation data in the two classification procedures was tested. Given the decision-tree method does not assume strict data distribution parameters, it was able to optimize the application of multi-tidal and elevation data, resulting in higher classification accuracies of mangrove forests. When using multi-source data of differing types and distributions to map mangrove forests, a decision-tree method appears to be superior to traditional statistical classifiers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3adigital elevation models 3ahabitats 3aland use and land cover maps 3alittoral zone 3amangrove forests 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3astatistical analysis 3asubtropics 3awetlands 3aChina 0aMangrove forest 0aDecision trees 0aMaximum likelihood 0aTide level 0aNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 0aNormalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)1 aTreitz, Paul M.1 aChen, Dongmei1 aQuan, Chang1 aShi, Lixin1 aLi, Xinhui0 tITC journal.g2017 Oct., v. 62 p.201-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013700170300001600307520164600323592002801969650002601997650001502023650001602038650001402054650001302068650002302081650002402104650002602128650001402154650001202168650000902180650002002189650001102209650001402220650001002234650002002244650001502264650001402279650001302293650001702306651001702323653001902340653002602359653001302385653002402398653002202422653001702444653001502461700002102476700002302497700002402520773012102544856008302665852000902748655001202757IND60618071920221118101520.0190131e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061807192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Kelsie A.14aThe effects of stress, cortisol administration and cortisol inhibition on black sea bass (Centropristis striata) sex differentiation  ap. 154-160.  aSex differentiation in many lower vertebrates (e.g. reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) can be influenced by environmental factors experienced during sensitive developmental periods. Environmental stressors, acting through cortisol, masculinize some teleost fishes during development by limiting gonadal cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a), the enzyme that irreversibly converts testosterone to 17β-estradiol. In this study, we examined the influence of cortisol, cortisol inhibitors and a repeated, acute stressor (net-chasing) on sex differentiation in black sea bass (BSB; Centropristis striata), a protogynous hermaphroditic teleost. Wild-caught, sexually-undifferentiated, BSB juveniles (~90 mm) were collected from Rhode Island waters, raised in recirculating systems and fed diets supplemented with cortisol, a cortisol receptor antagonist (mifepristone), a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone), or net-chased twice a week for two min until gonads were differentiated (77–89 days). Long term cortisol administration partially masculinized all female fish, but repeated net-chasing did not alter sex differentiation relative to the control group. Blocking cortisol receptor binding delayed sex differentiation in some individuals, but overall led to increased masculinization compared to control fish. The proportion of treatment fish that developed as males suggests a functionally, diandric protogynous reproductive strategy in this species. We also identified a glucocorticoid response element in the gonadal aromatase (cyp19a1a) promoter, indicating a possible relationship between cortisol and cyp19a1a gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropristis striata 3aamphibians 3aantagonists 3aaromatase 3acortisol 3acortisol receptors 3adietary supplements 3aenvironmental factors 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afish 3agene expression 3agonads 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amasculinization 3ametyrapone 3aprotogyny 3areptiles 3atestosterone 3aRhode Island 0aBlack sea bass 0aCentropristis striata 0aCortisol 0aSex differentiation 0aStress, aromatase 0aMifepristone 0aMetyrapone1 aKenter, Linas W.1 aBreton, Timothy S.1 aBerlinsky, David L.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 Jan., v. 227 p.154-160dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007600162520094200238592002801180650002201208650001301230650001201243650001801255650001001273650001701283650001201300650001301312650002401325650001901349650001201368700002101380700002201401700002201423700001901445773012201464856007401586852000901660655001201669IND60794373820221119081335.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079437382DNAL7 a10.3390/v140920572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmither, Sophie J.10aAerosol Survival, Disinfection and Formalin Inactivation of Nipah Virus  aNipah virus is a relatively newly discovered emerging virus on the WHO list of priority pathogens which has the potential to cause outbreaks with high fatality rates. Whilst progress is being made in the development of animal models for evaluating vaccines and therapies, some of the more fundamental data on Nipah virus are lacking. We performed studies to generate novel information on the aerosol survival of Nipah virus and to look at the efficacy of two common disinfectants. We also performed studies to evaluate the inactivation of Nipah virus by using neutral buffered formalin. Nipah virus was relatively stable in a small particle (1–5 µm) aerosol in the dark, with it having a decay rate of 1.46%min⁻¹. Sodium hypochlorite (at 10%) and ethanol (at 80%) reduced the titre of Nipah virus to undetectable levels. Nipah virus that was in tissue culture medium was also inactivated after 24 h in the presence of 10% formalin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNipah henipavirus 3aaerosols 3aanimals 3aculture media 3adeath 3adisinfection 3aethanol 3aformalin 3asodium hypochlorite 3atissue culture 3aviruses1 aEastaugh, Lin S.1 aO’Brien, Lyn M.1 aPhelps, Amanda L.1 aLever, Mark S.0 tViruses.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140920573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010500173300001800278520135800296592002801654650002101682650001501703650001501718650001901733650001301752650002001765650000901785650001101794650002301805650001601828650001101844653002101855653001901876653002401895653001401919653001301933653002901946700001901975700006201994773009202056856008502148852000902233655001202242IND60611007020221120185927.0200607e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061100702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vinod Kumar10aAdsorption isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamic simulation of CO2-CSAC pair for cooling application  ap. 1158-1173.  aThis research article proposes to develop a waste heat driven single-stage adsorption-based cooling system by selecting CO₂ and indigenous coconut shell based activated carbon (CSAC) as the adsorbate/adsorbent pair. The CO₂ adsorption isotherms and kinetics of activated carbon are measured at different temperatures (273–368 K) using volumetric method. In order to illustrate adsorption isotherms, experimental data of CO₂ uptake is correlated with the Langmuir and Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A) models. On the other hand, Linear Driving Force (LDF) and Fickian Diffusion (FD) models are utilized to explain adsorption kinetics data. Fugacity and pseudosaturation pressure of CO₂ plays a significant role in the estimation of high-pressure CO₂ adsorption and thermodynamic properties above the critical temperature of CO₂, and these parameters are evaluated using adsorption isotherms data. The key thermodynamic properties and kinetics parameters of the assorted pair are estimated using measured adsorption isotherms and kinetics data which are used for the thermodynamic analysis of CO₂-CSAC pair based cooling system. The maximum theoretical values of SCE and COP of CO₂-CSAC pair are obtained as 12.52 kJ kg⁻¹ and 0.10, respectively at the regeneration temperature of 80 °C along with the evaporator temperature of 15 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acoconuts 3acooling systems 3aheat 3amodels 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastes 0aActivated carbon 0aCarbon dioxide 0aCooling application 0aIsotherms 0aKinetics 0aThermodynamic simulation1 aKumar, E.

Given their benefits, G. mellonella models are being employed in investigations of systemic infections caused by highly resistant microorganisms. Among the multiresistant microorganisms, we highlight Candida auris, a yeast with high mortality potential and resistance. Among the potential drugs, amphotericin B (AmB) stands out; however, microbial resistance episodes and side effects caused by low selectivity have been observed. The incorporation of AmB into a nanoemulsion (NE) can contribute to the control of C. auris infections and resistance as well as decrease the side effects of this drug. This study aimed to develop AmB-loaded NE (NEA) and evaluate its antifungal action against C. auris in G. mellonella. NEs were obtained by using sunflower oil and cholesterol as the oily phase, polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether (Brij® 58) and soy phosphatidylcholine as the surfactant system, and PBS buffer as the aqueous phase. An alternative in vivo assay with G. mellonella for acute toxicity and infection was performed using adult stage larvae (200 mg to 400 mg). According to the obtained results, NE and NEA exhibited sizes of 43 and 48 nm, respectively. The PDI was 0.285 and 0.389 for NE and NEA, respectively. The ZP showed electronegativity for both systems, with −3.77 mV and −3.80 mV for NE and NEA, respectively. Acute toxicity showed that free AmB had greater acute toxicity potential than NEA. The survival assay showed high larval viability. NEA had a better antifungal profile against systemic infection in G. mellonella. It is concluded that the alternative model proved to be an efficient in vivo assay to determine the toxicity and evaluate the therapeutic property of free AmB and NEA in systemic infections caused by C. auris.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aGalleria mellonella 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aamphotericin B 3acholesterol 3aenvironment 3alarvae 3amedicinal properties 3amodels 3amortality 3ananoemulsions 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyethylene glycol 3asunflower oil 3asurfactants 3atherapeutics 3aviability 3ayeasts 0aCandida auris 0aGalleria mellonella 0aNanoemulsion 0aAmphotericin B 0aSystemic infection1 aRamos, Matheus Aparecido Dos Santos1 aLima, Laura Caminitti1 aChorilli, Marlus1 aBauab, Tais Maria0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 10, v. 807 p.151023-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1510233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013200177300001600309520133600325592002801661650002501689650001901714650001701733650001501750650001301765650001301778650001301791650001901804653002601823653002601849653005001875653001701925653001901942700002301961700001501984773011201999856008402111852000902195655001202204IND60601476120221120043236.0180706e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060147612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Fernández, L.10aEffects of mixed solvents on the structural morphology and membrane distillation performance of PVDF-HFP hollow fiber membranes  ap. 324-338.  aPoly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene), PVDF-HFP, hollow fiber membranes were prepared by the dry/wet spinning technique, maintaining all the parameters the same except the solvent used to prepare the polymer solution. Different solvents namely, single N,N-dimethyl acetamide (DMAC) and different mixed solvents, DMAC and trimethyl phosphate (TMP) as well as N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and TMP were employed. The relative affinity of the PVDF-HFP and the solvent(s) and the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects responsible for membrane formation were investigated and related with the structure of the prepared hollow fiber membranes. The structural and morphological properties of the hollow fiber membranes as well as the necessary parameters to be known for a membrane proposed for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) were studied by different characterization techniques. It was observed that an increase of TMP ratio in the solvents mixture resulted in a decrease of the finger-like structure of the external layer, an increase of the pore sizes of the hollow fibers and the DCMD permeate flux enhancement as consequence. When changing DMAC by DMF a thicker hollow fiber membrane was obtained and the DCMD was decreased due partly to the formation of macro-voids in the middle layer of the hollow fiber membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adirect contact 3adistillation 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3asolvents 3aspinning 3athermodynamics 0aHollow fiber membrane 0aMembrane distillation 0aPoly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) 0aDesalination 0aSolvent effect1 aGarcía-Payo, M.C.1 aKhayet, M.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 468 p.324-338dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010600159300002000265520123200285592002801517650001901545650001401564650002001578650001701598650002101615650001801636650001901654650000901673650002201682650002001704700001701724700001501741773012501756856007401881852000901955655001201964IND60691380220221120082857.0200429e20200421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069138022DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01832e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruijing10aIn vivo selective imaging of metabolic glycosylation with a tetrazine-modified upconversion nanoprobe  ap. 15990-15996.  aGlycans play an important role in various physiological and pathological processes. Metabolic labeling with bioorthogonal chemistry is a distinguished tool for detecting and tracking glycans in cells and in vivo. However, most of the currently available bioorthogonal turn-on probes based on organic fluorophores still suffer from some inevitable deficiencies, including shallow tissue penetration and spontaneous fluorescence. Herein, we designed and reported a bioorthogonal turn-on nanoprobe UCNP-T, which could realize the specific labeling and visualization of glycans on living cell membranes. UCNP-T was constructed based on a multi-spectral upconversion nanophosphor (UCNP) as the luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) donor and an organic molecule, tetrazine, as the acceptor. Using the as-prepared UCNP-T, we could specifically label the cell-surface glycans and monitor their level in living mice in real time through the ratio of upconversion luminescence (UCL) emissions of 540 nm to 650 nm (UCL₅₄₀/UCL₆₅₀), providing sensing with highly intrinsic reliability by self-calibration. Thus, the nanoprobe would provide a reliable tool for elucidating the role of glycosylation in cells and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3aemissions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aglycosylation 3aimage analysis 3amice 3aorganic compounds 3apolysaccharides1 aZheng, Judun1 aZhang, Tao0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 21, v. 10, no. 27 p.15990-15996dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra01832e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245009100158300001600249500000900265500001500274520160100289592002801890650002001918650002001938650002101958650002601979650002302005650002402028650001502052650002202067650001602089650000902105650003302114650002402147653001602171700001502187700001602202700001502218700001902233700001802252773010502270852000902375856007702384655001202461IND4444501420221119173202.0191126e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444450142DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2009.01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssouline, S.10aOn the Diurnal Soil Water Content Dynamics during Evaporation using Dielectric Methods  ap. 709-718.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aThe water content dynamics in the upper soil surface during evaporation is a key element in land–atmosphere exchanges. Previous experimental studies have suggested that the soil water content increases at the depth of 5 to 15 cm below the soil surface during evaporation, while the layer in the immediate vicinity of the soil surface is drying. In this study, the dynamics of water content profiles exposed to solar radiative forcing was monitored at a high temporal resolution using dielectric methods both in the presence and absence of evaporation. A 4-d comparison of reported moisture content in coarse sand in covered and uncovered buckets using a commercial dielectric-based probe (70 MHz ECH₂O-5TE, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) and the standard 1-GHz time domain reflectometry method. Both sensors reported a positive correlation between temperature and water content in the 5- to 10-cm depth, most pronounced in the morning during heating and in the afternoon during cooling. Such positive correlation might have a physical origin induced by evaporation at the surface and redistribution due to liquid water fluxes resulting from the temperature-gradient dynamics within the sand profile at those depths. Our experimental data suggest that the combined effect of surface evaporation and temperature-gradient dynamics should be considered to analyze experimental soil water profiles. Additional effects related to the frequency of operation and to protocols for temperature compensation of the dielectric sensors may also affect the probes' response during large temperature changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asolar radiation 3asubsurface flow 3asoil temperature 3adielectric properties 3asoil water content 3aexperimental design 3asoil depth 3adiurnal variation 3aevaporation 3asand 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3asoil water movement 0amethodology1 aNarkis, K.1 aTyler, S.W.1 aLunati, I.1 aParlange, M.B.1 aSelker, J.

In particular, it aims to set up aquifer management contracts for the main overused aquifers, which should bring together broad coalitions of actors around coordinated supply and demand policies. This article analyses to what extent the actors involved in groundwater use and management are coming together for the definition and implementation of policies to deal with groundwater overuse in four regions. A broad coalition has been built around the design of an aquifer management contract only in the Souss. Catchment management agencies and the Ministry of the Interior collaborate to control the drilling of boreholes in the Saiss, Souss and Berrchid regions. Largeâscale farmers in the Souss support the Ministry of Agriculture and the Souss Massa catchment management agency in developing more water resources. Smallâscale farmers were involved in none of these coalitions. The depth of the aquifer, the importance of the groundwater economy in each region, and the motivation and capacities of actors help explain the diversity in the coalitions that were created. While such elements help define the way coalition building may be supported in each case, in all cases particular human resources and skills will be needed to catalyse such coalitions, as will innovative ways to include smallâscale farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 3amotivation 3alarge farms 3asmall farms 3adesign 3afarmers 3ahuman resources 3awatershed management 3asupply balance 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3aissues and policy 3aagricultural watersheds 3aMorocco 0acontracting1 aEL Amrani, Mohamed1 aEL Aydi, Soufiane1 aLahlou, Ahmed0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2012 Apr., v. 61 Suppl S1 p.126-134dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1531-03537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.1652  aDNAL 7aarticle00822naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245006100132300001300193520016700206592002800373650001300401650002000414650001700434700001900451773010100470852000900571655001200580IND60612368220221119205036.0180905e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061236822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBUNCE, G.

E38-E44.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMast cell tumours (MCTs) are the most frequent canine round cell neoplasms and show variable biological behaviours with high metastatic and recurrence rates. The disease is treated surgically and wide margins are recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy used in this disease cause DNA damage in neoplastic cells, which is aimed to induce apoptotic cell death. Resisting cell death is a hallmark of cancer, which contributes to the development and progression of tumours. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the proteins involved in the apoptotic intrinsic pathway and to evaluate their potential use as prognostic markers for canine cutaneous MCTs. Immunohistochemistry for BAX, BCL2, APAF1, Caspase‐9, and Caspase‐3 was performed in 50 canine cases of MCTs. High BAX expression was associated with higher mortality rate and shorter survival. BCL2 and APAF1 expressions offered additional prognostic information to the histopathological grading systems. The present results indicate that variations in the expression of apoptotic proteins are related to malignancy of cutaneous MCTs in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aadjuvants 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amast cells 3ametastasis 3amortality 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3aradiotherapy1 aMacedo, B.

Sigrun10aEffect of grass-diet and grass-legume-diet manure applied to planting holes on smallholder maize production in Rwanda  aNAL-light  aAnimal manure provides plant nutrients and also affects soil nutrient availability, pH buffering and soil physical properties through its contribution to soil organic matter pools. However, the quality and quantity of manure are often low on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa and the initial effect of manuring on crop yield may be small or even negative. In a two-factorial experiment over four seasons in southern Rwanda, the fertiliser value to a maize crop of manures produced by cattle fed a basal diet of only Chloris gayana grass or a mixed C. gayana-Acacia angustissima diet was compared with that of NPK 17−17−17 and no fertiliser. The potential liming effect of the manures was also evaluated through inclusion (or not) of travertine as the second factor. All amendments were applied only to maize planting holes. The crop failed in season 1 due to drought, but manure application (5 t ha⁻¹) approximately doubled maize yield compared with the unfertilised control during seasons 2–4, while NPK (70 kg N ha⁻¹) increased yield by 3- to 4-fold, with corresponding improvements in crop performance indicators. The mixed diet increased manure quality and maize yield compared with the grass diet in season 4. Liming showed a consistent tendency to improve crop performance indicators and yield, but significant differences were only identified in some cases, possibly because the pH increase was small. The results suggest that in regions where manure availability is limiting, application of reduced rates only to planting holes may be an efficient technology. Enhanced animal feed can result in higher quality manure, and ultimately increase crop yield, if nutrient losses during manure handling and storage can be limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloris gayana 3aanimal manures 3acorn 3acrop failure 3acrop yield 3adiet 3adrought 3afeeds 3afield crops 3agrasses 3aliming 3amanure handling 3amanure spreading 3anutrient availability 3anutrients 3apH 3aplanting 3aresearch 3aseasons 3asmall farms 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asoil physical properties 3astorage 3aRwanda 0aManure 0aMaize production 0aLiming effect 0aLegume supplementation 0aPlanting hole application1 aMukangango, Marguerite1 aNaramabuye, Francois Xavier1 aNduwamungu, Jean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4627-97751 aNyberg, Gert0 tField crops research.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 263 p.108057-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.1080573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009700171300001800268520190500286592002802191650002202219650002102241650001802262650001502280650002902295650002002324650001102344650001202355650001102367650002102378650001302399650001502412650001602427650001702443650001102460650001502471650000902486650001302495650001702508650001502525650003702540650001802577650002802595650001102623650001302634650000902647653001702656653001702673653001902690653002502709653001602734700001702750700001802767773012102785856008802906852000902994655001203003IND60601830920221120120636.0190628e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060183092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.2762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hanxiang10aUnderstand the resilience and regime shift of the wetland ecosystem after human disturbances  ap. 1031-1040.  aWetland protection and restoration are important for human's sustainable development, and assess the resilience and regime shift of wetland ecosystem under human disturbances is necessary for this purpose. Geochemical records, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from seven wetland cores dated by 210Pb and 137Cs analysis were used to identify the historical background of human disturbances on wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain. We also carried out paleoecological analysis (including plant macrofossils and diatoms) in one core (Honghe wetland) to reconstruct the successions of wetland ecological communities. The resilience and regime shift of ecosystem were evaluated based on autocorrelation and the Sequential t-test analysis of regime-shifts algorithm. Our results show that enrichment factors (EFs) of N, P and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb etc.), and the concentrations of PAHs experienced slight increases from the 1920s but dramatic increases from the late 1970s. The dominant species of plant community began to change from Drepanocladus aduncus to Carex lasiocarpa from the late 1970s, and the diatoms began to change from wet-indicator to dry-indicator species from the 1950s in Honghe wetland. The regime shift of the wetland ecosystem occurred around 1990 CE, which due to a drop in water level caused by human activities, such as wetland drainage for the reclamation and the excessive use of groundwater for irrigation purpose, rather than climate moisture variations. There is a time gap between the severe disturbances and regime shift due to the stronger resilience of wetland ecosystem. The ecological characteristics (e.g. water level, biological compositions, and EFs of nutrient elements and heavy metals) of Honghe wetland before the late 1970s (release phase) were used as reference conditions for wetland restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCarex lasiocarpa 3aDrepanocladus 3aalgorithms 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautocorrelation 3acesium 3aclimate 3acopper 3adominant species 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3airrigation 3alead 3anitrogen 3apaleoecology 3aphosphorus 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aradionuclides 3asustainable development 3at-test 3awetlands 3azinc 0aGeochemistry 0aPaleoecology 0aAdaptive cycle 0aReference conditions 0aRestoration1 aGao, Chuanyu1 aWang, Guoping0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 643 p.1031-1040dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.2763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011800157300001800275520110500293592002801398650004401426650002201470650002801492650001401520650003401534650001101568650003701579650002201616650001001638650001901648650001101667650001901678650001801697650001501715650000701730650001901737650001501756650003301771650001101804650002101815650003701836650002501873700002101898700001901919700002501938700002601963700001701989773012302006856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60685451120221119142933.0200303e20200224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068545112DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00163e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Imran10aSynthesis, characterization and photo-catalytic activity of guar-gum-g-aliginate@silver bionanocomposite material  ap. 7898-7911.  aThe green mechanism for the synthesis of nanoparticles and their application to the wastewater treatment is of inordinate curiosity to the research community. Herein we outline a novel method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles via a green route using alginate-guar gum blend (GG-Alg@Ag) and their application to degrade methylene blue (MB) dye. The synthesized material was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM-EDX, TEM, TGA-DTG, AFM, and UV-vis techniques. A combination of RSM and CCD was employed to compute the system and optimized values of various interacting parameters such as exposure time (120 min), pH (4.98), dye concentration (194 mg L⁻¹), and catalyst dose (0.07 g) with a photodegradation capacity of 92.33% and desirability 1.0. The mechanism of degradation reaction was best elucidated by the pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemical deposition of MB on the GG-Alg@Ag surface through followed by the reduction mechanism in the occupancy of visible light. The optical studies indicated a value of 2.5 eV by Tauc's plot for bandgap energy (Eg) for GG-Alg@Ag bionanocomposite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3acatalysts 3adifferential thermal analysis 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aexposure duration 3alight 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater treatment1 aKhan, Rais Ahmad1 aAlharbi, Walaa1 aAlharbi, Khadijah H.1 aAbu Khanjer, Maymonah1 aAlslame, Ali0 tRSC advances.g2020 Feb. 24, v. 10, no. 13 p.7898-7911dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00163e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00983naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245003400132300001400166520029400180592002800474650001800502650002400520650002000544650002200564650003200586773010200618852000900720655001200729IND60612368520221119204909.0180905e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061236852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNUTT, KRISTEN10aLetʼs Not Reinvent the Wheel  ap. 36-39.  aThe necessity of cooperation between the public and private sectors is being recognized with increasing frequency.

On the other, many European countries have still not developed national supply chains to market wild game. Instead, these supply chains could represent a win–win strategy in providing a sustainable alternative to production via intensive livestock farming and developing rural territories. Our aim was to understand consumer behaviour towards wild game meat. We conducted a choice experiment on wild boar meat on a sample of Italian consumers (625). The application of a hybrid model combining a structural equation model and a latent class analysis allowed us to identify the antecedents of attitude towards wild game meat and to analyse consumer choices by utilising attitude as an explanatory variable. The results provide useful suggestions to implement rural development policies and offer food for thought in the area of consumer behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3agame animals 3agame meat 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3alivestock 3amodels 3arural development 3astructural equation modeling 3aItaly1 aContini, Caterina1 aScozzafava, Gabriele1 aCasini, Leonardo0 tAgricultural and food economics.g2022 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.23-23dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:21601x2193-75327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40100-022-00231-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245014200168300002000310520109000330592002801420650002201448650001601470650001401486650002501500650001001525700002301535700002001558700002601578700002101604700001901625700001501644700002201659700002601681700001701707700002201724773013501746856007801881852000901959655001201968IND60555871220170628000000.0161030e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055587122DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b078822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudebusch, Gabriel
E.12aA Biradical Balancing Act: Redox Amphoterism in a Diindenoanthracene Derivative Results from Quinoidal Acceptor and Aromatic Donor Motifs  ap. 12648-12654.  aThe reduced and oxidized states of an open-shell diindeno[b,i]anthracene (DIAn) derivative have been investigated by experimental and theoretical techniques. As a result of moderate biradical character and the ability of cyclopenta-fused scaffolds to stabilize both positive and negative charges, DIAn exhibits rich redox chemistry with four observable and isolable charged states. Structural and electronic properties of the DIAn system are brought to light by UV–vis–NIR and Raman spectroelectrochemical measurements. Aromatization of the diindeno-fused anthracene core upon successive single-electron injections is revealed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction of radical anion and dianion salts. We present a rare case where the pseudoaromatic/quinoidal ground state of a neutral biradical polycyclic hydrocarbon leads to a stable cascade of five redox states. Our detailed investigation of the transformation of molecular structure along all four redox events provides a clearer understanding of the nature of charge carriers in ambipolar organic field-effect transistors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanthracenes 3achemistry 3apolycyclic compounds 3asalts1 aEspejo, Guzmán L.1 aZafra, José L.1 aPeña-Alvarez, Miriam1 aSpisak, Sarah N.1 aFukuda, Kotaro1 aWei, Zheng1 aNakano, Masayoshi1 aPetrukhina, Marina A.1 aCasado, Juan1 aHaley, Michael M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 138, no. 38 p.12648-12654dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b078823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01683naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012200155300001800277500001900295520063900314592002800953650002300981650001401004650001801018650001901036650002801055650003501083700001601118700001701134773012301151856007401274852000901348655001201357IND60685451220221119142901.0200303e20200224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068545122DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00176g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yang10aAerobic photooxidative hydroxylation of boronic acids catalyzed by anthraquinone-containing polymeric photosensitizer  ap. 7927-7932.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report herein the synthesis of a polymeric photosensitizer and its application in aerobic photooxidative hydroxylation of boronic acids.

Two types of acrylate derivatives that bear an LC moiety and a fluorene moiety as luminophores are synthesized and used as functional monomers for photocrosslinking polymerizations. A trisubstituted acrylate derivative is used as a crosslinker to enhance the amount of photocrosslinking to produce a spatially linked network structure of polymers. The synthesized HNPs show a striated fan-shaped texture that is characteristic of the SC*-LC, and they exhibit notable Cotton effects owing to their circular dichroism in the absorption and luminescence processes. The CPL of the (R)- and (S)-HNP films shows considerably high dissymmetry factors (|gₗᵤₘ|) of 2.4 × 10–² and 2.5 × 10–², respectively. The CPL further increases in intensity by more than 4 times after heating the HNP film at 150 °C to provide |gₗᵤₘ| values of 1.0 × 10–¹ and 1.1 × 10–¹ for (R)- and (S)-HNP films, respectively. This increase in CPL intensity is ascribed to the thermally stimulated progress of the crosslinking between the monomers that still remain unreacted during photopolymerization at room temperature, thus leading to the completion of the helical network in the HNP film. The higher structural order of the HNP films prepared with the SC*-LC than those prepared with a chiral nematic LC (N*-LC) is confirmed through X-ray diffraction measurements. The present work is the first successful asymmetric polymerization using the SC*-LC as a chiral medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3afluorenes 3aliquid crystals 3aluminescence 3amoieties 3apolymerization 3atexture1 aInagaki, Takuya1 aPark, Jinwoo1 aYoshida, Satoru1 aKaneko, Kosuke1 aHanasaki, Tomonori1 aAkagi, Kazuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6767-27980 tMacromolecules.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 54, no. 19 p.8977-8986dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c011463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01369naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245007000156300002000226520030300246592002800549650001200577650002300589650002300612650001100635650002400646650001400670700001700684700001400701700001600715700001600731700001700747700002100764773013500785856007800920852000900998655001201007IND60555871420221121163944.0161030e20160928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055587142DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b079842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Lebin10aCopper Catalysis for Selective Heterocoupling of Terminal Alkynes  ap. 12348-12351.  aA Cu-catalyzed selective aerobic heterocoupling of terminal alkynes is disclosed, which enables the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical 1,3-diynes in good to excellent yields.

In addition, there was no deterioration of the electrical performance over repetitive convex and concave bending with a bending radius of 2.3mm.

All family members are considered to be pseudokinases in that they contain domains homologous to serine/threonine kinase catalytic cores, but they lack several conserved residues in the ATP-binding pocket. Trib1 is implicated in the inflammatory response pathway through its ability to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP). However, its role in macrophages function is unknown. Here, we investigated the functional role of Trib1 in Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses to IFN-γ in RAW264.7 cells. In gene knock-down experiments in macrophages using small interfering RNAs targeted to Trib1, it was observed that TNF-α production was increased following treatment with IFN-γ and/or TLR2 ligands. Finally, Trib1-silenced macrophages failed to show MCP-1 induced chemokinesis and indicating involvement of Trib1 in controlling of macrophage migration.This work demonstrates that Trib1 contributes to the pro-inflammatory response caused by TLR2 ligands and controls macrophage migration as well as being a biomarker in macrophage-related diseases in both human and veterinary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3abiomarkers 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3amacrophages 3amammals 3amedicine 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asmall interfering RNA 2aAnimals 2aCCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-betaxmetabolism 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCell Line 2aCell Movementximmunology 2aGene Knockdown Techniques 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aLigands 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aMacrophagesximmunologyxphysiology. 2aMice 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aToll-Like Receptor 2xmetabolism 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 0aC/EBP 0aERK 0aMARK 0aMCP-1 0aNF-κK 0aTLR2L 0aTrib 0aTrib1 0aInflammation 0aInnate immunity 0aTribbles 0aPro-inflammatory cytokines 0aMigration1 aTan, Karen A.L.1 aMorrison, Ivan W.1 aLamb, Jonathan R.1 aArgyle, David J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 155, no. 1-2 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2013.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03733naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245008800194300001800282520186400300592002802164650001402192650001202206650001502218650001402233650002202247650002302269650000902292650001302301650001002314650001802324650001502342650001102357650001402368650001602382650001402398650001502412650000902427650001102436650002202447650002502469650004902494650001202543650002802555650004102583650002402624650002302648650001502671650003102686650002302717650004202740650001502782650004502797700002002842700002102862700002102883700002302904773008702927856004803014852000903062655001203071IND50070013120221123042007.0131020e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007001312DNAL7 a236530692pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-013-2673-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertram, Christopher R.10aTrait-mediated indirect effects, predators, and disease: test of a size-based model  ap. 1023-1032.  aIncreasing prevalence of wildlife disease accentuates the need to uncover drivers of epidemics. Predators can directly influence disease prevalence via density-mediated effects (e.g., culling infected hosts leading to reduced disease prevalence). However, trait-mediated indirect effects (TMIEs) of predators can also strongly influence disease—but predicting a priori whether TMIEs should increase or decrease disease prevalence can be challenging, especially since a single predator may elicit responses that have opposing effects on disease prevalence. Here, we pair laboratory experiments with a mechanistic, size-based model of TMIEs in a zooplankton host, fungal parasite, multiple predator system. Kairomones can either increase or decrease body size of the host Daphnia, depending on the predator. These changes in size could influence key traits of fungal disease, since infection risk and spore yield increase with body size. For six host genotypes, we measured five traits that determine an index of disease spread (R ₀). Although host size and disease traits did not respond to kairomones produced by the invertebrate predator Chaoborus, cues from fish reduced body size and birth rate of uninfected hosts and spore yield from infected hosts. These results support the size model for fish; the birth and spore yield responses should depress disease spread. However, infection risk did not decrease with fish kairomones, thus contradicting predictions of the size model. Exposure to kairomones increased per spore susceptibility of hosts, countering size-driven decreases in exposure to spores. Consequently, synthesizing among the relevant traits, there was no net effect of fish kairomones on the R ₀ metric. This result accentuates the need to integrate the TMIE-based response to predators among all key traits involved in disease spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaoborus 3aDaphnia 3abirth rate 3abody size 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease prevalence 3afish 3agenotype 3ahosts 3ainvertebrates 3akairomones 3amodels 3aparasites 3aparturition 3apredators 3aprediction 3arisk 3aspores 3awildlife diseases 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimal Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmission. 2aAnimals 2aBody Sizexdrug effects 2aDaphniaxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aDipteraxmetabolism 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aFood Chain 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aModels, Biological 2aPheromonesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPrevalence 2aZooplanktonxdrug effectsxmicrobiology.1 aPinkowski, Mark1 aHall, Spencer R.1 aDuffy, Meghan A.1 aCáceres, Carla E.0 tOecologia.g2013 Nov., v. 173, no. 3 p.1023-1032dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2673-0  aDNAL 7aarticle05103naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165520318900306592002803495650001203523650002003535650003403555650002703589650001403616650001903630650001603649650002203665650001403687650001503701650002003716650001503736650001203751650001903763650001003782650002303792650002703815650001103842650001703853650003403870650001603904650001103920650001903931650001403950653002503964653002403989653005004013653002204063653001704085700001704102700005704119700001604176700001804192700001804210700001604228700001404244773011604258856008204374852000904456655001204465IND60724236320221120173455.0220606e20210424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072423632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2021.1137902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jisheng10aTo study the mechanism of Cuscuta chinensis Lam. And Lycium barbarum L. in the treatment of asthenospermia based on network pharmacology  aCuscuta chinensis Lam. and Lycium barbarum L. (SC-FL) is a commonly used kidney tonic Chinese medicine combination that is widely used in the clinical treatment of oligoasthenospermia.However, its specific mechanism remains unclear and requires in-depth study. To explore the potential targets of SC-FL in the treatment of oligoasthenospermia using network pharmacology, and to verify the results with in vivo and in vitro experiments. A herb-compound-target-disease network and PPI network were constructed with Cytoscape software. The targets of SC-FL for the treatment of male sterility were introduced into a bioinformatics annotation database, and the GO and KEGG databases were used for pathway enrichment analysis. Subsequently, Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. (GTW) polyglycoside was used to induce a spermatogenic dysfunction model in GC-1 spg cells and SD male rats in in vitro and in vivo experiments, respectively. The SC-FL and PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 was used to intervene in the spermatogenic dysfunction model to detect the expression of proteins and mRNA related to the PI3K pathway and to detect the indicators related to proliferation and apoptosis. In in vitro experiments, the percentage of spermatogenic cells and the proportion of GC-1 spg cells at G0/G1 and G2/M stages in the model group (GTW group) and the inhibitor group (LY group) were significantly decreased (P < 0.01) compared with the blank control group (NC group). The apoptosis rate of the GTW group was significantly increased (P < 0.01). The ultrastructures of GC-1 spg cells in the GTW group and LY group were obviously destroyed. Compared with the GTW group, the SC-FL group had a significantly reduced apoptosis rate of GC-1 spg cells, reduced percentage of cells in S phase, and a significantly improved mitochondrial membrane potential. SC-FL can repair the ultrastructure of GC-1 spg cells damaged by GTW. The above effects of SC-FL are closely related to up-regulation of GFRa1, RET, PI3K, p-AKT, and Bcl-2 and down-regulation of BAD and BAX proteins and mRNA expression. In vivo, compared with the GTW group, the body mass, testicular mass, and epididymal weight of the GTW + SC-FL group were significantly increased (P < 0.01). Sperm concentrations and the PR + NP of GTW + SC-FL were significantly higher than in the GTW group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). FSH, LH, and T levels in the GTW + SC-FL and LY + SC-FL groups were significantly higher than those in the GTW and LY group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). HE staining results showed that the morphology of testicular tissue in the GTW + SC-FL and LY + SC-FL groups was superior to that in the GTW and LY group. The above effects of SC-FL are closely related to the up-regulation of proteins and mRNA expression of PI3K, p-AKT, and Bcl-2. Through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, SC-FL up-regulates GFRa1, RET, PI3K, p-AKT, and Bcl-2, and down-regulates the expression of BAD and BAX proteins and mRNA, thus reducing the percentage of GC-1 spg cells in S-phase, significantly increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, significantly reducing cell apoptosis, and improving sperm counts and viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuscuta 3aLycium barbarum 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aTripterygium wilfordii 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3abody weight 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aepididymis 3agene expression 3ainterphase 3akidneys 3amale sterility 3amales 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3amodels 3apharmacology 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3aultrastructure 3aviability 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aOligoasthenospermia 0aCuscuta chinensis Lam. and Lycium barbarum L. 0aPI3K/Akt pathways 0aSex hormones1 aBao, Binghao1 aMeng, Fanchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5605-36761 aDeng, Sheng1 aDai, Hengheng1 aFeng, Junlong1 aLi, Haisong1 aWang, Bin0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Apr. 24, v. 270 p.113790-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.1137903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011200154300001800266520112400284592002801408650004401436650002601480650001201506650002301518650001201541650001301553650001101566650002201577650004401599650002101643650001101664700001401675700001401689700003101703700001501734700001801749700001601767700002001783773012301803856007401926852000902000655001202009IND60685451720221119142638.0200303e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068545172DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00315h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jie10aMold resistance of bamboo after laccase-catalyzed attachment of thymol and proposed mechanism of attachment  ap. 7764-7770.  aLaccase-catalyzed attachment of functional molecules onto the surface of bamboo represents an alternative, green approach to improve performance. Although treatment of bamboo with thymol improved resistance to mold, using laccase to fix the same concentration of thymol to the surface of the bamboo could increase both the antifungal activity and resistance to leaching. Leaching of thymol was reduced by as much as 48.4% when laccase was used in thymol fixation. To make clear the mechanisms of fixation, reaction of thymol catalyzed with laccase, was investigated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ¹H-NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Results show that thymol oligomer (l-thymol) was formed with ether linkages, which resist water leaching. Although further confirmatory studies are needed, it seems that ether linkages were the main connection of thymol to lignin. This study demonstrates that laccase catalysis is a promising strategy to functionalize the surface of bamboo in order to bestow new properties suitable for a wide range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantifungal properties 3abamboos 3acatalytic activity 3alaccase 3aleaching 3alignin 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3athermogravimetry 3athymol1 aWang, Hui1 aYe, Zelin1 aChizaram, Enyinwa Patience1 aJiang, Jun1 aLiu, Tingsong1 aSun, Fangli1 aZhang, Shaoyong0 tRSC advances.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 10, no. 13 p.7764-7770dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00315h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04782naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001700172245016400189300001600353520237100369592002802740650002002768650002102788650001302809650001002822650001102832650001002843650001302853650001002866650001002876650001502886650002102901650001302922650003102935650001602966650000902982650002002991650001503011650002503026650001203051650003303063650003603096650002303132650003103155650002403186650002403210650004903234650002903283650002203312650000903334650005603343650004603399650004203445650002903487650003203516651001503548651001503563653000903578653001303587653002003600653001503620653002003635700001703655700001703672700002103689700002003710700002003730700001403750773012703764856008803891852000903979655001203988IND50070340420221119073603.0190318e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007034042DNAL7 a240748412pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlover, A.D.12aA double-blind block randomized clinical trial on the effect of zinc as a treatment for diarrhea in neonatal Holstein calves under natural challenge conditions  ap. 338-347.  aDiarrhea is the leading cause of death in neonatal calves and contributes to major economic losses. The objective of this double-blind randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of oral inorganic or organic zinc supplementation as a treatment for neonatal diarrhea in calves. Seventy nine 1 to 8 day old male Holstein calves on a California calf ranch were block randomized to one of 3 treatments within 24h from their first onset of diarrhea. Calves received a daily dose of either a placebo composed of 80mg of zinc-free powder, 381.54mg of zinc methionine (Met) (equivalent to 80mg of zinc), or 99.69mg of zinc oxide (ZO) (equivalent to 80mg of zinc) in 2L of a zinc-free oral rehydration solution (ORS). Calves were treated once daily until normal fecal consistency or for a maximum of 14 days. Upon enrollment and exit, calves were weighed, and blood, feces, and liver biopsies were collected for trace mineral analysis. Fecal samples at enrollment and exit were tested for E. coli K99, Cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus. Pre-treatment liver zinc concentrations for the 71 calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 710.6 (SEM=147.7), 852.3 (SEM=129.6), and 750.7 (SEM=202.9)mg/kg dry weight (DW), respectively. Exit liver zinc concentrations for the calves in the placebo, zinc Met, and ZO treatment groups were 728.9 (SEM=182.9), 1141.0 (SEM=423.8), and 636.8 (SEM=81.5)mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Although statistically non-significant, there were clinically important findings identified for each of zinc Met and ZO treatments. Calves treated with zinc Met gained on average 40g/day during a diarrhea episode compared to a weight loss of 67g/day on average in the placebo-treated calves (Power 19.9%). Calves treated with ZO had 1.4 times higher hazard of clinical cure compared to calves in the placebo group (Power 5.3%). Calves that were fecal positive to cryptosporidium spp. at enrollment and treated with zinc Met had higher odds of testing negative at exit compared to placebo calves (Odds Ratio (OR)=16.0). In contrast, calves treated with ZO tended to recover (fecal score=1) one day earlier compared to calves treated with a placebo (8.5 d vs. 9.7 d). The current trial identified clinically important findings that warrant further research to investigate zinc's therapeutic effect for calf diarrhea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aEscherichia coli 3aHolstein 3ablood 3acalves 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3aliver 3aodds ratio 3aoral rehydration 3aranching 3arandomized clinical trials 3aweight loss 3azinc 3azinc methionine 3azinc oxide 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxmetabolism 2aAntidiarrhealsxtherapeutic use 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aCopperxbloodxmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFecesxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxvirology. 2aIronxbloodxmetabolism. 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMethioninexanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use. 2aOrganometallic Compoundsxtherapeutic use 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomicxveterinary 2aZincxbloodxmetabolism. 2aZinc Oxidextherapeutic use 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aCalf 0aDiarrhea 0aZinc methionine 0aZinc oxide 0aCryptosporidium1 aPuschner, B.1 aRossow, H.A.1 aLehenbauer, T.W.1 aChampagne, J.D.1 aBlanchard, P.C.1 aAly, S.S.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 112, no. 3-4 p.338-347dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006900142245013600211520234700347592002802694596003902722596007602761596007702837650001802914650002002932650001802952650001402970650002802984650002003012650002803032650001403060650001103074650001203085650003003097650001003127650001503137650002603152650001403178650001703192650002403209650002203233700002003255700002703275700002303302700002403325700002603349700003103375700003203406700006103438773010403499856007703603852000903680655001203689IND60778639420221120035827.0220530e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077863942DNAL7 a10.1155/2022/30295822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisuthranukul, Chonnikant1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1693-255010aAssociation of Human Intestinal Microbiota with Lifestyle Activity, Adiposity, and Metabolic Profiles in Thai Children with Obesity  aBackground. Dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota may be linked to pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic disorders. Objective. This study compared the gut microbiome of obese Thai children with that of healthy controls and examined their relationships with host lifestyle, adiposity, and metabolic profiles. Methods. This cross-sectional study enrolled obese children aged 7–15. Body composition was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Relative abundance and alpha- and beta-diversity were compared with normal-weight Thai children from a previous publication using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and ANOSIM. Relationships of gut microbiota with lifestyle activity, body composition, and metabolic profiles were assessed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Spearman correlation. Results. The study enrolled 164 obese children with a male percentage of 59%. Mean age was 10.4 ± 2.2 years with a BMI z-score of 3.2 ± 1. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were found to be lower in obese children compared to nonobese children. Alpha-diversity indices showed no differences between groups, while beta-diversity revealed significant differences in the family and genus levels. CCA revealed significant correlations of the relative abundance of gut microbial phyla with sedentary lifestyle and certain metabolic markers. Univariate analysis revealed that Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium were positively correlated with HDL-C and negatively correlated with body weight and screen time. Additionally, Actinobacteria was also negatively associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. Lactobacillus showed positive correlation with acanthosis nigricans and adiposity. Cooccurrence analysis revealed 90 significant bacterial copresence and mutual exclusion interactions among 43 genera in obese children, whereas only 2 significant cooccurrences were found in nonobese children. Conclusions. The composition and diversity of gut microbiota in obese Thai children were different from those of their normal-weight peers. Specific gut microbiota were associated with lifestyle, adiposity, and metabolic features in obese children. An interventional study is needed to support causality between specific gut microbiota and obesity.  aPublisher supplied data  aRA60/122cChulalongkorn University  aFDA-CO-2561-5614-THcNational Science and Technology Development Agency  cMinistry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand 3aBacteroidetes 3aBifidobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aadiposity 3abioelectrical impedance 3aclinical trials 3across-sectional studies 3adysbiosis 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amales 3ametabolism 3amultivariate analysis 3anutrition 3apathogenesis 3asedentary lifestyle 3aspecies diversity1 aSriswasdi, Sira1 aTepaamorndech, Surapun1 aJoyjinda, Yutthana1 aSaengpanit, Puthita1 aKwanbunbumpen, Tanisa1 aPanichsillaphakit, Ekkarit1 aUaariyapanichkul, Jaraspong1 aChomtho, Sirinuch1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9712-24740 tJournal of nutrition and metabolism.g2022 May 20, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:21568x2090-07327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/30295823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245015400170300001400324520183300338592002802171650003102199650001702230650002502247650002302272650002202295650001302317650003102330650001002361650002702371650001802398650001102416650001702427650001702444650004102461650001902502650000902521650001002530650001902540650002202559650002402581650002002605653001202625653002202637653003102659653002802690653003402718653001602752700001502768700001602783700001502799700001202814700002402826700001602850773010102866856008902967852000903056655001203065IND60567463020221120161154.0190410e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yongli10aDigital gene expression profiling of the pathogen-resistance mechanism of Oryza sativa 9311 in response to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 induction  ap. 89-97.  aPlant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial soil microorganisms that colonize plant roots for nutritional purposes and benefit plants by increasing plant growth or reducing plant disease. To clarify the complex mechanisms underlying plant-PGPR interactions, transcriptomic analyses of the response of rice (Oryza sativa) 9311 to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 were carried out using RNA-Seq technology. This resulted in the identification of 379 differentially expressed genes in rice roots and 719 in rice leaves following FZB42 interaction that are likely to be related to plant-PGPR interactions, plant stress-resistance, pathogen-resistance, growth and development and basic and energy metabolism. We focused on plant disease-resistance mechanisms induced by FZB42. Variations in the expression of crucial genes COI1, MEKK1, WRKY, and PR that are involved in signal transduction following plant-pathogen interaction at different interaction time points were examined. Significantly up-regulated expression of PR, LOX, and ERF genes involved in the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene signal transduction pathways, respectively, were detected, suggest that defense reactions in rice were induced following interaction with FZB42. Phytoalexin changes in rice induced by FZB42 were examined and momilactone A, phytocassane A, phytocassane D, phytocassane E levels were low at 12h, rose between 24 and 48h, suggesting a PGPR-mediated mechanism of plant pathogen resistance. The study indicated that plant responses to PGPR in multi-metabolism pathways, which includes improving plant pathogen-resistance by mediating multi-signal transduction that regulates the expression of PRs and other defense genes, as well as influencing fundamental metabolic pathways to enhance the plant’s physical condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aOryza sativa 3abiochemical pathways 3adisease resistance 3aenergy metabolism 3aethylene 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3aphytoalexins 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant response 3arice 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptomics 0aRNA-Seq 0aOryza sativa 9311 0aB. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 0aPlant-PGPR interactions 0aPathogen-resistance mechanism 0aPhytoalexin1 aWu, Liming1 aZhu, Bichun1 aWu, Huijun1 aGu, Qin1 aRajer, Faheem Uddin1 aGao, Xuewen0 tBiological control.g2017 July, v. 110 p.89-97dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011000167500002200277520183700299592002802136650001502164650001602179650002102195650002802216650001502244650001802259650001102277650001702288651001002305653002202315653002802337653001802365653003202383653002102415653001002436653000702446653000802453653000902461653000802470653000702478653000902485653000802494653000802502653001302510653000902523700001402532700001702546700001702563700002002580700001502600700001702615700001402632700001402646700001302660700001702673700001802690700001502708700001702723773006802740856008402808852000902892655001202901IND60564561520221117002036.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.02.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cuicui10aPersonal exposure to fine particulate matter, lung function and serum club cell secretory protein (Clara)  aPre-press version  aThe underlying mechanisms about the association between ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and lung function were unclear. Few epidemiological studies have evaluated the potential mediating effects of serum club cell secretory protein (Clara) (CC16), a biomarker of pulmonary epithelium integrity.To evaluate the short-term effect of personal PM2.5 exposure on lung function and to explore the potential mediating role of CC16 in this effect.We enrolled 36 healthy, nonsmoking college students for a panel study in Shanghai, China from December 17, 2014 to July 11, 2015. We measured personal and real-time exposure to PM2.5 for 72 h preceding each of four rounds of health examinations, including lung function test and serum CC16 measurement. We used linear mixed-effect models to examine the effects of PM2.5 on lung function and CC16 over various lag times. Furthermore, we analyzed the mediating effect of CC16 in the association between PM2.5 and lung function.Average PM2.5 exposure ranged from 36 to 52 μg/m3 across different lag periods. PM2.5 exposure was negatively associated with lung function and positively associated with serum CC16 concentration. The effect of PM2.5 on CC16 occurred earlier than that on lung function. For instance, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 0–2 h average exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 4.84% increase in serum CC16; and an IQR increase in 3–6 h average exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 1.08% decrease in 1-sec forced expiratory volume. These effects lasted up to 24 h after exposure. Increased serum CC16 contributed 3.9%–36.3% of the association between PM2.5 and impaired lung function.Acute exposure to PM2.5 might induce an immediate decrease in lung function by virtue of the loss of pulmonary epithelium integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acollege students 3aepidemiological studies 3aepithelium 3alung function 3amodels 3aparticulates 3aChina 0aPersonal exposure 0aFine particulate matter 0aLung function 0aClub cell secretory protein 0aMediation effect 0aPM2.5 0aSD 0aIQR 0aLBAB 0aLME 0aCI 0aFEV1 0aFVC 0aPEF 0aFEF25-75 0aCC161 aCai, Jing1 aChen, Renjie1 aShi, Jingjin1 aYang, Changyuan1 aLi, Huichu1 aLin, Zhijing1 aMeng, Xia1 aLiu, Cong1 aNiu, Yue1 aXia, Yongjie1 aZhao, Zhuohui1 aLi, Weihua1 aKan, Haidong0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.02.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011800166300001800284520188600302592002802188650002102216650001302237650001302250650002602263650002902289650002502318650001902343650001502362650001302377650001802390650001902408650001702427650001802444650000702462650001302469650003402482650001302516650001502529700002102544700002502565700002402590773014102614856007402755852000902829655001202838IND60644606820221117234756.0190517e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460682DNAL7 a10.1039/c8tb03102a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Obaidy, Saba S. M.10aBoosting the antimicrobial action of vancomycin formulated in shellac nanoparticles of dual-surface functionality  ap. 3119-3133.  aWe report a strong amplification of the antimicrobial action of vancomycin (VCM) encapsulated in shellac nanoparticles (NPs) with dual surface functionalisation. These shellac nanocarriers for VCM were produced in two steps: (i) a pH drop from aqueous ammonium shellac solution containing Poloxamer 407 (P407) as a steric stabilising polymer in solution of vancomycin hydrochloride, and (ii) subsequent doping with the insoluble cationic surfactant octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (ODTAB) though a solvent change to yield cationic surface functionality. We evaluated the encapsulation efficiency of VCM and its release profiles from these nanocarriers. This study explored the antibiotic action of these VCM nanocarriers at the various stages of their preparation which helped us to evaluate how they could be made to work efficiently, to adapt their design and demonstrate the role of the nanocarrier dual functionalisation on its antibiotic action and delivery. The antibiotic effect of VCM loaded in such versatile functionalised shellac nanocarriers was tested on three different proxy microorganisms, C. reinhardtii, S. cerevisiae and E. coli. We also compared the antibiotic effect of free VCM with non-coated VCM-loaded nanocarriers at the same overall concentrations. The ODTAB coating of the shellac NPs strongly enhanced the antibiotic action of the encapsulated VCM across all tested microorganisms. The enhanced VCM action is explained with the increased electrostatic adhesion between the ODTAB-coated VCM-loaded shellac NPs and the negatively charged surface of the microbial cell walls which allows local delivery of VCM with a high concentration directly on the cell membrane. This nanocarrier-mediated boost of the antibiotic action may potentially breathe new life into old antibiotics and help to fight off antibiotic resistance by making them more effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesion 3aammonium 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantimicrobial properties 3acationic surfactants 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3acoatings 3aencapsulation 3amicroorganisms 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolymers 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asolvents 3avancomycin1 aHalbus, Ahmed F.1 aGreenway, Gillian M.1 aPaunov, Vesselin N.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 May 15, v. 7, no. 19 p.3119-3133dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb03102a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001600270520144300286592002801729650001301757650001801770650001601788650001601804650002401820650001301844650001901857650002301876650001601899650001001915650001801925650001001943650001501953650001601968650001401984650001401998650001402012650001702026650001402043650002102057653002402078653002302102653002702125653002102152653003002173700003902203700002402242700002802266700003202294700006702326773011302393856008202506852000902588655001202597IND60605766820221121043819.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Hamed, Said10aFish pathogen bacteria: Adhesion, parameters influencing virulence and interaction with host cells  ap. 550-562.  aWild fisheries are declining due to over-fishing, climate change, pollution and marine habitat destructions among other factors, and, concomitantly, aquaculture is increasing significantly around the world. Fish infections caused by pathogenic bacteria are quite common in aquaculture, although their seriousness depends on the season. Drug-supplemented feeds are often used to keep farmed fish free from the diseases caused by such bacteria. However, given that bacteria can survive well in aquatic environments independently of their hosts, bacterial diseases have become major impediments to aquaculture development. On the other hand, the indiscriminate uses of antimicrobial agents has led to resistant strains and the need to switch to other antibiotics, although it seems that an integrated approach that considers not only the pathogen but also the host and the environment will be the most effective method in the long-term to improve aquatic animal health. This review covers the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity and details the foundations underlying the interactions occurring between pathogenic bacteria and the fish host in the aquatic environment, as well as the factors that influence virulence. Understanding and linking the different phenomena that occur from adhesion to colonization of the host will offer novel and useful means to help design suitable therapeutic strategies for disease prevention and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanimal health 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3aclimate change 3adisease prevention 3afarmed fish 3afeeds 3afish diseases 3ahosts 3aimmunology 3aoverfishing 3apathogens 3apollution 3ashellfish 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 0aInfectious diseases 0aBacterial adhesion 0aBacterial colonization 0aVirulence factor 0aPathogen-host interaction1 aTavares Ranzani-Paiva, Maria José1 aTachibana, Leonardo1 ade Carla Dias, Danielle1 aIshikawa, Carlos Massatoshi1 aEsteban, María Angeles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6264-14580 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.550-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245009400161506031000255520144900565592002802014650001202042650000902054650002902063650002502092650002702117650001902144650001002163650001902173650003302192650001602225650001802241650002002259650001602279653002702295653002902322653001502351653001902366700002402385700002402409700002202433700001702455700002002472773012402492856007602616852000902692655001202701IND60560927020221120154618.0170112e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092702DNAL7 a10.4081/jae.2016.5152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiso, Antonio10aEnvironmental Impact Assessment of Three Packages for High-Quality Extra-Virgin Olive Oil  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aLife cycle assessments of food packaging technologies have shown that they contribute considerably to the environmental impact of products. This study analyses the life cycle impact of three packaging solutions for high-quality extra-virgin olive oil. Two of them are widely used solutions, namely tin plated cans and dimmed glass bottles. The third one is a stainless steel bottle, which has been proposed recently. The analysis was performed with a cradle to grave approach and it takes into account raw materials extraction and processing, packaging production processes and several end-of-life scenarios. Impacts due to distribution were considered separately to assess uncertainties due to distribution distances. The results show that, for same sizes, dimmed glass bottles have the lowest overall impact value for all the six indicators selected except for ozone layer depletion, whereas stainless steel bottles have the highest impact values for all the other indicators. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how impact varies in function of distance and packaging weight. It shows that it is possible to set a breakeven point over which the impact of glass overcomes the one of the other packaging systems. Packaging shows a significant contribution to impact of bottled oil. For small packaging, such as a 0.100 L stainless steel bottle, this contribution can be as relevant as 60% of the overall global warming potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3acans 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afood packaging 3aglass 3aglobal warming 3alife cycle impact assessment 3aozonosphere 3araw materials 3astainless steel 3auncertainty 0aLife cycle assessments 0aglobal warming potential 0ashelf life 0agreenhouse gas1 aParenti, Alessandro1 aMasella, Piernicola1 aGuerrini, Lorenzo1 aBaldi, Fabio1 aSpugnoli, Paolo0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 47, no. 4dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-62687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jae.2016.5153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010300165300001800268520128500286592002801571650002601599650003101625650002401656650001501680650002301695650001501718650001501733651001001748700001301758700001701771700001701788700001701805700001901822773010601841856008101947852000902028655001202037IND50089440120221119093458.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008944012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2870-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yinguang10aStatistical analyses and controls of root-zone soil moisture in a large gully of the Loess Plateau  ap. 4801-4809.  aSoil moisture variability and controls are little known in large gullies of the Loess Plateau which represent complex topography with steep slopes. This study analyzed spatial–temporal variability of soil moisture at the 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, and 60–80 cm depths in a large gully of the Loess Plateau based on root-zone soil moisture measurements for 3 years (2009–2011). The result showed that mean soil moisture, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation, were highly dependent on depth; the highest mean value was observed at the 20–40 cm depth, while the lowest one was at the 0–20 cm depth. The SD increased with mean soil moisture for various depths as soil moisture was relatively wet; however, a transition that SD decreased with mean soil moisture occurred when soil moisture was relatively dry. Positive correlations exist between moisture contents over different depths, and that the relationships of the neighboring layers are relatively high with R²from 0.70 to 0.76. Correlation analysis, principle component analysis, and stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that soil particle size distribution and topography (slope and elevation) were the main environmental factors controlling soil moisture variability in the large gully.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aparticle size distribution 3aregression analysis 3asoil depth 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3atopography 3aChina1 aWu, Pute1 aZhao, Xining1 aLi, Hongchen1 aWang, Jiawen1 aZhang, Baoqing0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 June, v. 71, no. 11 p.4801-4809dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2870-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03955naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011600169300002000285520190000305592002802205596004302233596003402276596008502310650001102395650002502406650002702431650001402458650001602472650001602488650001202504650002102516650001402537650001502551650001702566650001602583650003002599650001602629650004202645650001802687650001502705650001002720650001002730650002002740650001702760650001302777650001402790650001702804650001402821650002202835650002802857650001302885650002502898700002402923700002802947700002402975700002602999700002103025773015503046856008303201852000903284655001203293IND60765837020221117105418.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16711-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshehri, Ali S.10aKaempferol prevents cadmium chloride-induced liver damage by upregulating Nrf2 and suppressing NF-κB and keap1  ap. 13917-13929.  aThis study evaluated the protective effect of kaempferol, a natural flavonoid, against cadmium chloride (CdCl₂)-induced liver damage and examined the possible anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms of protection.

With no effect on attenuating the reduced food intake, kaempferol significantly increased body weight and lowered serum levels of liver injury markers including bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (γ-GTT1) in the CdCl₂-treated rats. It also restored normal liver architectures, prevented hepatocyte, loss, and swelling and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. These effects were associated with a reduction in mitochondrial permeability transition pore, as well as in the expression of cytochrome-c and cleaved caspase-3, markers of mitochondrial damage, and intrinsic cell death. In both the control positive and CdCl₂-treated rats, kaempferol significantly lowered the hepatic levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukine-6 (IL-6), and the nuclear activity and localization of NF-κB p65. Besides, kaempferol significantly increased the hepatic total and nuclear levels of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1, as well as levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) but reduced the cytoplasmic protein levels of keap1. In conclusion, the protective effect of kaempferol against CdCl₂-induced hepatic damage is mediated by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects driven by upregulating Nrf2/HO-1 axis and suppressing the NF-κB p65 and keap1.  aPublisher supplied data  aR.G.P1 /227/41cking khalid university  aTURSP2020/99ctaif university  aFast-track Research Funding Programcprincess nourah bint abdulrahman university 3aadults 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acadmium 3acadmium chloride 3acaspase-3 3acell death 3acytochrome c 3afood intake 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3aglutathione 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ainterleukin-6 3akaempferol 3aliver 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amitochondria 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apermeability 3apollution 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aEl-kott, Attalla F.1 aEl-Gerbed, Mohamed S A.1 aEl-Kenawy, Ayman E.1 aAlbadrani, Ghadeer M.1 aKhalifa, Heba S.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.13917-13929dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16711-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245017300170300001600343520102800359592002801387650002301415650002101438650002301459650001901482650002401501650001501525650001101540650001801551650001501569650002301584650002001607650001601627653001801643653002001661653001501681653002801696653002301724700003301747700003801780773012101818856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60549547020221118001413.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrochier, Bethania10aInfluence of moderate electric field on inactivation kinetics of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase and on phenolic compounds of sugarcane juice treated by ohmic heating  ap. 396-403.  aThis study investigated the non-thermal effects of electricity on enzymatic inactivation kinetics of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase and on degradation of total phenolic and total flavonoid compounds during ohmic heating of sugarcane juice. A kinetic modeling was carried out from the adjustment of various models applicable to enzyme inactivation, and the Weibull distribution model was the most suitable to describe the inactivation of peroxidase. The presence of an electric field with low intensity significantly influenced the biochemical reactions occurred during peroxidase activation at 60 °C and inactivation at 80 °C. Polyphenol oxidase, a more thermolabile enzyme, was almost totally inactivated before reaching the target temperature (holding phase) of the experiments. The maximum total phenolic and total flavonoid degradation were approximately 23 and 39%, respectively. Statistical analyses showed no differences between conventional and ohmic heating for total phenolic and total flavonoid compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeibull statistics 3acatechol oxidase 3achemical reactions 3aelectric field 3aenzyme inactivation 3aflavonoids 3amodels 3aohmic heating 3aperoxidase 3aphenolic compounds 3asugarcane juice 3atemperature 0aOhmic heating 0aSugarcane juice 0aPeroxidase 0aModerate electric field 0aPhenolic compounds1 aMercali, Giovana Domeneghini1 aMarczak, Ligia Damasceno Ferreira0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Dec., v. 74 p.396-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245011300211500002200324520184400346592002802190650002702218650001202245650002202257650002402279650001302303650003502316650001502351650001002366650002102376650001302397650002102410650001302431650001302444650001102457650002002468650001502488650002502503650001402528650001302542651001202555653001602567653001602583653001302599653002502612653001202637773006802649856008402717852000902801655001202810IND60564561820221117002046.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPottinger, Tom G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7661-936910aModulation of the stress response in wild fish is associated with variation in dissolved nitrate and nitrite  aPre-press version  aDisruption of non-reproductive endocrine systems in wildlife by chemicals has received little attention but represents a potentially significant problem. Nitrate is a major anthropogenic contaminant in the freshwater aquatic environment and has been identified as a potential disrupter of endocrine function in aquatic animals. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between the function of the neuroendocrine stress axis in fish and inorganic N loading along reaches of rivers receiving cumulative point source and diffuse chemical inputs. To accomplish this, the responsiveness of the stress axis, quantified as the rate of release of cortisol to water across the gills during exposure to a standardised stressor, was measured in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) resident at three sites on each of four rivers in north-west England. The magnitude of the stress response in fish captured at the sites furthest downstream on all rivers was more than twice that of fish captured at upstream sites. Site-specific variation in stress axis reactivity was better explained by between-site variation in concentrations of dissolved nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia than by the concentration of wastewater treatment works effluent. An increase in the magnitude of the stress response was seen among sticklebacks at sites where long-term averaged concentrations of NH3-N, NO3-N and NO2-N exceeded 0.6, 4.0 and 0.1 mg/L respectively. These data suggest that either (i) inorganic N is a better surrogate than wastewater effluent concentration for an unknown factor or factors affecting stress axis function in fish, or (ii) dissolved inorganic N directly exerts a disruptive influence on the function of the neuroendocrine stress axis in fish, supporting concerns that nitrate is an endocrine-modulating chemical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquatic environment 3acortisol 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afreshwater 3agills 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3arivers 3astress response 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awild fish 3awildlife 3aEngland 0aStickleback 0aStress axis 0aCortisol 0aEndocrine disruption 0aNitrate0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011500166500001400281520150900295592002801804650001301832650001201845650001501857650001101872650001101883650001401894653003001908653002701938653001801965653002101983653001702004700005502021700001302076700001902089773011302108856008602221852000902307655001202316IND60719498020221118211637.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Wenqi10aPiezoelectric vibration energy harvesting for rail transit bridge with steel-spring floating slab track system  aNAL-light  aTaking two (4 × 40) m continuous rail transit rigid bridges as practical examples, the train-SSFST (steel-spring floating slab track)-bridge system was established to acquire the vehicle induced vibration responses on SSFST. Based on the concept of combing cymbal PE-VEH and multilayer stacks PE-VEH together, a kind of PE-VEH featured small size, lightweight, high bearing capacity and excellent efficiency in energy harvesting is proposed. The prominent highlight of the designed PE-VEH is the force amplifying mechanism composed of cover plates and bending plates, which is of great help in improving the energy harvesting efficiency. Secondly, the 6 multilayer piezoelectric stacks are favorable to meet the requirements of small dimensions when bearing the vehicle induced vertical steel-spring fulcrum forces. Dynamic simulation results showed that the optimum positions for the designed PE-VEH to be connected in series with the steel-springs is at the end of the floating concrete slab (FCS). Comparing with existed low-frequency PE-VEHs through evaluating by indicators of power density and NPD, the excellent energy output efficiency of the designed PE-VEH is demonstrated, and influence on the practical train-SSFST-bridge system is negligible as well. For the example bridge, with 144 PE-VEHs arranged on 36 blocks of FCS, the total energy power obtained would reach up to 31.4 kJ, enough to satisfy the normal use of intermittent collection and transmission components for wireless BHM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3adensity 3adimensions 3aenergy 3aforces 3avibration 0aVehicle induced vibration 0aFloating concrete slab 0aPiezoelectric 0aEnergy harvester 0aSteel-spring1 aZheng, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3235-69631 aGuo, Wei1 aPengcheng, Guo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 291 p.125283-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013000163300001800293500001500311520187200326592002802198650001702226650002102243650002402264650002002288650001502308650001102323650001302334650001802347650001802365650001502383651001702398651001002415653002302425700001702448700001902465700001902484700001802503773010602521856008102627852000902708655001202717IND50089440220221119093652.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008944022DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-2872-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Xiaofei10aSpatial and seasonal distributions of soil phosphorus in a typical seasonal flooding wetland of the Yellow River Delta, China  ap. 4811-4820.  a2019-12-05  aSoil samples from 0 to 100 cm depth were collected in four sampling sites (Sites A, B, C and D) along a 250-m length of sampling zone from the Yellow River channel to a tidal creek in a seasonal flooding wetland of the Yellow River Delta of China in fall of 2007 and spring of 2008 to investigate spatial and seasonal distribution patterns of total phosphorous (TP) and available phosphorus (AP) and their influencing factors. Our results showed that TP contents in spring and AP contents in both seasons in surface soils increased with increasing distances away from the Yellow River channel. TP contents in surface soils (0–10 cm) followed the order Site A (698.6 mg/kg) > Site B (688.0 mg/kg) > Site C (638.8 mg/kg) > Site D (599.2 mg/kg) in fall, while Site C (699.6 mg/kg) > Site D (651.7 mg/kg) > Site B (593.6 mg/kg) > Site A (577.5 mg/kg) in spring. Generally, lower TP content (630.6 mg/kg) and higher AP level (6.2 mg/kg) in surface soils were observed in spring compared to fall (656.2 mg/kg for TP and 5.2 mg/kg for AP). Both TP and AP exhibited similar profile distribution patterns and decreased with depth along soil profiles with one or two accumulation peaks at the depth of 40–80 cm. Although the mean TP content in soil profiles was slightly higher in spring (635.7 mg/kg) than that in fall (628.0 mg/kg), the mean TP stock was obviously lower in spring (959.9 g/m²) with an obvious accumulation at the 60–80 cm soil depth compared to fall (1124.6 g/m²). Topsoil concentration factors also indicated that TP and AP had shallower distribution in soil profiles. Correlation analysis showed that AP had significant and positive correlation with these soil properties such as soil organic matter, salinity, total nitrogen and Al (p < 0.01), but TP was just significantly correlated with TN and Al (p < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3ariver deltas 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3asoil depth 3aspring 3aaluminum 3asoil sampling 3asoil profiles 3aphosphorus 3aYellow River 3aChina 0adeltas (landforms)1 aBai, Junhong1 aLu, Qiongqiong1 aZhao, Qingqing1 aWang, Junjing0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 June, v. 71, no. 11 p.4811-4820dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2872-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014800171520122200319592002801541650001401569650001101583650001401594650001401608650001901622650001501641650001601656653003301672653002201705653002801727653002801755700001401783700001301797700001501810700001801825700001801843700001401861700001701875773009101892856009001983852000902073655001202082IND60770200320221122001434.0220421e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1069052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haibo10aTough and extremely temperature-tolerance nanocomposite organohydrogels as ultrasensitive wearable sensors for wireless human motion monitoring  aMXenes have attracted great attention due to their multifunctional properties and abundant surface terminations. However, it remains a considerable challenge to construct MXene hydrogels with high toughness and long-term sensory performance to withstand harsh environments. Herein, a multifunctional conductive organohydrogel based on 2D MXene nanosheets and ZA fibers were fabricated and then assembled wireless wearable sensors to track human movement. By introducing ternary mixture, the organohydrogels possess ultra-low temperature resistance (−81 °C) and moisture retention. Simultaneously, the interaction of alginate chains induced by Zn ions with PAM endows the organohydrogels with superior mechanics. Amazingly, the hydrogel sensor exhibited the highest pressure sensing performance (Sₚ₁ = 782.7 kPa⁻¹) and harsh-environment tolerance. Importantly, zinc-activated MXene nanosheet endowed the resultant with the favorable antibacterial ability and serves in organohydrogels for potential medical applications. This method provides a facile approach for designing sustainable dual-mode sensors with high toughness, antibacterial performance, all-weather availability, and wireless transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amechanics 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3atemperature 0aA Multifunctional composites 0aA Smart materials 0aB Electrical properties 0aB Mechanical properties1 aZou, Yuke1 aJi, Ying1 aZhong, Kai1 aDu, Xiaosheng1 aDu, Zongliang1 aCheng, Xu1 aWang, Shuang0 tComposites.g2022 June, v. 157 p.106905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1069053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011300177500001400290520164600304592002801950650001901978650001501997650002202012650001002034650001502044650002502059650001502084650002302099650001002122650001302132650001202145650002802157650002102185650001102206651001002217653002502227653001402252653001902266653001902285653002202304700002102326700002102347773011302368856008602481852000902567655001202576IND60719498120221118212501.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgovino, Massimiliano10aDoes national environmental regulation promote convergence in separate waste collection? Evidence from Italy  aNAL-light  aIn the European Union, which is increasingly oriented towards environmentally sustainable development, separate waste collection plays a crucial role. Over the years, the EU has produced several guidelines, programmes and directives aimed to build a green society and tone down the differences between, as well as within, Member States. In Italy, the waste management system is currently regulated by Legislative Decree 152/2006, through which European directives have been incorporated into the Italian law. The existing literature has focused on the effects of L.D. 152/2006 on Separate Waste Collection (SWC) rates; however, there are not previous studies on the effects of this decree on growth rates and on convergence process among regions in terms of SWC and its items (i.e., organic, plastic, paper, and glass). This paper aims to fill these gaps. For this purpose, we implement β- and σ-convergence analysis based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) on official Italian regional data over the period 2001–2018. Results show that Legislative Decree 152/2006 has two contrasting effects: on the one hand, it helped increase separate waste collection; on the other hand, it slowed down the convergence process in terms of separate waste collection among the Italian regions. However, the convergence process is characterised by different speeds across Italian macro-areas (Northern, Central, and Southern Italy), highlighting a three-speed country. To foster convergence, the national legislation should consider regional differences in terms of economic, infrastructural, institutional, social, and demographic characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3ademography 3aenvironmental law 3aglass 3aguidelines 3alaws and regulations 3aliterature 3amanagement systems 3apaper 3aplastics 3asociety 3asustainable development 3awaste management 3awastes 3aItaly 0aEnvironmental policy 0aRecycling 0aβ-Convergence 0aσ-Convergence 0aPanel data models1 aFerraro, Aniello1 aMusella, Gaetano0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 291 p.125285-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245010900162300002000271520146700291592002801758596005901786596005901845650004401904650002201948650003701970650001502007650001202022650001602034650001902050650001702069650002602086650000702112650001402119650001302133650001102146650001702157650001902174700001402193700001902207700001502226700001402241700001402255773015502269856008302424852000902507655001202516IND60765837120221118225549.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16547-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xia10aCharacteristics of Cu(II)-modified aerobic granular sludge biocarbon in removal of doxycycline hydroxide  ap. 14019-14035.  aIn this study, the biocarbon derived from aerobic granular sludge with different nutritive proportions was modified by Cu(NO₃)₂•3H₂O (Cu-BC) to improve its adsorption capacity of doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX). The surface area, pores, functional groups, and element composition of biocarbon were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), respectively. Effects of DOX concentration, initial pH, and background electrolyte on adsorption effects of composite were analyzed. Furthermore, the adsorption kinetics, isotherm, thermodynamics, and diffusion model were investigated. Results demonstrated that biocarbons which were prepared with aerobic granular sludge under different nutritive proportions presented different performances. The BET specific surface area of Cu-NaAC/AGS-BC was 260.1592 m²/g, and the micropore volume was 0.054101 cm³/g. The BET specific surface area of Cu-GLC /AGS-BC was only 10.6821 m²/g, and the micropore volume was 0.008687 cm³/g. Both kinds of modified biochar contain a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups. The highest adsorption efficiency of Cu-BC could reach 99.54%. The adsorption of DOX on two modified biocarbons conforms to the pseudo-second-order dynamic model and Temkin isothermal model.  aPublisher supplied data  a21667017cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a22166023cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3adoxycycline 3adynamic models 3aelectrolytes 3aelemental composition 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3asludge 3asurface area 3athermodynamics1 aWang, Hao1 aZhang, Guozhen1 aPei, Weina1 aXu, Yumin1 aLi, Bowen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.14019-14035dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16547-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245010900170300001800279520167400297592002801971650001001999650002202009650002602031650001302057650001302070650001502083650001102098650001302109650002202122650002502144650001302169650000902182650001202191650001402203700003302217700002602250773009802276856008402374852000902458655001202467IND4458790720221119023802.0150808e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445879072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2011.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnot, Thomas W.10aExtension of landscape-based population viability models to ecoregional scales for conservation planning  ap. 2041-2053.  aLandscape-based population models are potentially valuable tools in facilitating conservation planning and actions at large scales. However, such models have rarely been applied at ecoregional scales. We extended landscape-based population models to ecoregional scales for three species of concern in the Central Hardwoods Bird Conservation Region and compared model projections against long-term trend data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We used a spatially-explicit demographic model and structured the regional population into ecological subsections on the basis of habitat, landscape patterns, and demographic rates to assess species viability. Our model projections were within 2% of the Breeding Bird Survey trends over the last 40years for each species. Wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations remained relatively stable over the simulation and worm-eating warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus) abundance increased throughout most of the time period until reaching carrying capacity. In contrast, the prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) population steadily declined by 0.59% annually. The combination of habitat and demographic modeling allowed us to create models that address processes driving these populations at all scales, which is critical to understanding how regional populations respond to landscape processes such as habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, because it is spatially explicit and directly addresses population growth and viability, this approach provides a valuable foundation to planning conservation strategies, offering the ability to identify the most salient risks to viability and explore ways to address them.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acarrying capacity 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3apopulation structure 3aprairies 3arisk 3asurveys 3aviability1 aThompson, Frank R., IIIcIII1 aMillspaugh, Joshua J.0 tBiological conservation.g2011 July, v. 144, no. 7 p.2041-2053dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01574naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011900160300001800279520037200297592002800669650001400697650002700711650002300738650002100761650001400782650002100796650000900817650001200826650001100838650000700849650001500856700002100871700002000892700003000912700001800942773013300960856007401093852000901167655001201176IND60659579920221117182300.0190823e20120704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065957992DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc32832a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamanta, Subhra10aSelective four electron reduction of O₂ by an iron porphyrin electrocatalyst under fast and slow electron fluxes  ap. 7631-7633.  aAn iron porphyrin catalyst with four electron donor groups is reported.

In this study, PM2.5 soluble extract was collected, and its toxicological effect on lung pathological changes was examined. To assess its pathological mechanism, Human Monocyte-Like Cell Line, THP-1, and mouse macrophage, RAW264.7, were used to determine the effects of PM2.5 soluble extract on cell toxicity, phagocytosis, and transcriptome. We found that PM2.5 soluble extract exposure activated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, then induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. RNA-seq results showed that the transcription profiles, including 1213 genes, have been changed in responses to PM2.5 exposure. Additionally, PM2.5 led to phagocytic dysfunction, which may exacerbate the cause of lung injury. Exposure to PM2.5 soluble extract triggers the death of respiratory macrophages, impairs its phagocytosis capacity, thus delaying the inflammatory cell clearance in the lung, which results in chronic lung injury.  aPublisher supplied data  a82070912cnational natural science foundation of china  a91543131cnational natural science foundation of china  a81773326cnational natural science foundation of china  a2017BN04ckey project of research and development of ningxia hui autonomous region of china  aBE2019676cnatural science foundation of jiangsu province  aBK20171347cnatural science foundation of jiangsu province 3acytokines 3acytotoxicity 3adeath 3ahumans 3ainhalation exposure 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3aphagocytosis 3apollution 3aresearch 3asequence analysis 3atoxicology 3atranscriptome1 aPu, Wenyuan1 aNiu, Mengyuan1 aWazir, Junaid1 aSong, Shiyu1 aWei, Lulu1 aLi, Li1 aSu, Zhonglan1 aWang, Hongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2868-51120 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.13983-13997dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16797-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011400163300001200277520162900289592002801918650001501946650001401961650001601975650002001991650001402011650002102025650001602046650002302062650000902085650001802094650002402112650001902136650001402155650001502169650002602184653001402210653001602224653001502240653001802255653001502273700001602288700001702304700001702321700001302338700001902351700001502370773010202385856008502487852000902572655001202581IND60564562120221117001146.0181015e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Xu10aEffects of wastewater irrigation and sewage sludge application on soil residues of chiral fungicide benalaxyl  ap. 1-6.  aThe effects of wastewater irrigation and sewage sludge on the dissipation behavior of the fungicide benalaxyl and its primary metabolite benalaxyl acid in soil were studied on an enantiomeric level during a 148-day exposure experiment. Chiral separation and analysis of the two pairs of enantiomers were achieved using HPLC-MS/MS with a chiralpak IC chiral column. Benalaxyl decreased with half-life of 16.1 days in soil under tap water irrigation with preferential residue of S-benalaxyl. Benalaxyl acid was formed with great preference of R-enantiomer before 21 days while enriched in S-enantiomer afterwards. The degradation of benalaxyl was restrained by both wastewater and treated wastewater irrigation, but the enantioselectivity in S-benalaxyl residue was enhanced. Benalaxyl acid was also formed with similar enantioselectivity as in tap water irrigation. Sewage sludge could accelerate benalaxyl degradation with shorter half-life. Surprisingly, the enantioselectivity with preference degradation of S-enantiomer in sewage sludge was opposite to that in soil. More benalaxyl acid was generated with EF values always lower than 0.5 and remained longer in sewage sludge than in soil. A sterilization experiment indicated that the conversion of benalaxyl to benalaxyl acid and the enantioselectivity were determined by the microorganisms in soil or sewage sludge. Farming practices like wastewater irrigation and sewage sludge application might not only influence the fate of pesticide, but also the enantioselectivity of chiral pesticide enantiomers and thus the risks of pesticide residues posed to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3abenalaxyl 3aenantiomers 3afarming systems 3ahalf life 3airrigation water 3ametabolites 3apesticide residues 3arisk 3asewage sludge 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil treatment 3atap water 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation 0aBenalaxyl 0aDegradation 0aWastewater 0aSewage sludge 0aEnantiomer1 aYao, Guojun1 aLiu, Donghui1 aLiang, Yiran1 aLuo, Mai1 aZhou, Zhiqiang1 aWang, Peng0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017 May, v. 224 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014700167300001400314520196500328592002802293650001202321650001602333650001602349650002602365650002402391650002202415650001102437650002702448650001602475650002502491650001602516650000902532650002002541650001302561650001602574650003102590650003502621650002002656650002102676650001902697650002202716650001802738650001502756650001402771650003202785653002002817653001902837653001702856653002602873653001302899700001802912700001802930773011002948856008203058852000903140655001203149IND60605767620221121054607.0191227e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTing, Chen-Hung10aNile tilapia fry fed on antimicrobial peptide Epinecidin-1-expressing Artemia cyst exhibit enhanced immunity against acute bacterial infection  ap. 37-48.  aArtemia are often used as a live feed for fry in aquaculture. We have previously demonstrated that supplementing adult zebrafish feed with Artemia, which express an Epinephelus coioides-derived antimicrobial peptide, Epinecidin-1 (Epi-1), protects against bacterial infection. Thus, Artemia may serve as a bioreactor for producing biofunctional molecules. However, the application of Epi-1 transgenic Artemia in larval aquaculture of commercial fish species has not been investigated. Here we used a Tol2-transposon system to generate stable Epi-1 expressing Artemia. Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fry were then fed with decapsulated transgenic cysts and acutely challenged with Gram-positive Streptococcus iniae or Gram-negative Vibrio vulnificus (204). Survival analysis revealed that tilapia fry fed with Epi-1 transgenic cysts were resistant to acute bacterial infection. Immune-related gene expression profiling showed that S. iniae and V. vulnificus inoculations produced distinct immunomodulatory effects in the tilapia fry. Upon S. iniae infection, tilapia fry fed on control diet exhibited an immune response dominated by Tlr-7/MyD88, wherein Tnf-α, Il-8 and Cxcl-10 expression were all induced; conversely, the tilapia fry fed with Epi-1 transgenic cysts showed a Tlr-2/Tlr-5-dominant immune response, marked by the induction of Il-1β, Il-8 and Il-12 expression. However, after V. vulnificus (204) infection control fry exhibited a Tlr-2/MyD88/Traf-6-dominant response with activation of Tnf-α and Il-8 expression; meanwhile tilapia fry fed on Epi-1 transgenic cyst showed a dominant Tlr-2/Tlr-5-mediated immune response, including induction of Il-1β, Il-8, Il-12, and Cxcl-10 expression. These findings suggest that feeding larval fish fry with Epi-1 transgenic Artemia cysts confers enhanced immunity toward bacterial challenge. Epi-1 transgenic cysts should therefore be considered as a potential functional feed for larval aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aDanio rerio 3aEpinephelus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus iniae 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aadults 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aaquaculture 3abacterial infections 3abioreactors 3adiet 3adisease control 3afish fry 3afish larvae 3agene expression regulation 3agenetically modified organisms 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3alive feeds 3ashellfish 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTol2-transposon 0aMicroinjection 0aEpinecidin-1 0aAntimicrobial peptide 0aImmunity1 aChen, Yi-Chun1 aChen, Jyh-Yih0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Oct., v. 81 p.37-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012200176300001600298520209300314592002802407650002002435650001602455650001302471650001002484650001402494650001102508650001102519650001302530650002402543650001102567650001602578650002102594650001102615651001102626700002802637700002302665773013302688856008102821852000902902655001202911IND60615239920221119083923.0181009e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-017-2267-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvares, Clayton Alcarde10aModeling monthly meteorological and agronomic frost days, based on minimum air temperature, in Center-Southern Brazil  ap. 177-191.  aAlthough Brazil is predominantly a tropical country, frosts are observed with relative high frequency in the Center-Southern states of the country, affecting mainly agriculture, forestry, and human activities. Therefore, information about the frost climatology is of high importance for planning of these activities. Based on that, the aims of the present study were to develop monthly meteorological (F MET) and agronomic (F AGR) frost day models, based on minimum shelter air temperature (T MN), in order to characterize the temporal and spatial frost days variability in Center-Southern Brazil. Daily minimum air temperature data from 244 weather stations distributed across the study area were used, being 195 for developing the models and 49 for validating them. Multivariate regression models were obtained to estimate the monthly T MN, once the frost day models were based on this variable. All T MN regression models were statistically significant (p < 0.001), presenting adjusted R ² between 0.69 and 0.90. Center-Southern Brazil is mainly hit by frosts from mid-fall (April) to mid-spring (October). The period from November to March is considered as frost-free, being very rare a frost day within that period. Monthly F MET and F AGR presented significant sigmoidal relationships with T MN (p < 0.0001), with adjusted R ² above of 0.82. The residuals of the frost day models were random, which means that the sigmoidal models performed quite well for interpreting the frost day variability throughout the study area. The highlands of Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais had in average more than 25 and 13 frosts per year, respectively, for F MET and F AGR. The F MET and F AGR maps developed in this study for Center-Southern Brazil is a useful tool for farmers, foresters, and researchers, since they contribute to reduce frost spatial and temporal uncertainty, helping in planning project for strategic purposes. Furthermore, the monthly F MET and F AGR maps for this Brazilian region are the first zoning of these variables for the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimatology 3aforestry 3afrost 3ahighlands 3ahumans 3amodels 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3aspring 3auncertainty 3aweather stations 3azoning 3aBrazil1 aSentelhas, Paulo César1 aStape, José Luiz,0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2018 Oct., v. 134, no. 1-2 p.177-191dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2267-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245009300207300001900300506007600319520094100395592002801336506003701364650001501401650001301416650001001429650001601439650001601455650002401471650002901495653000901524653002601533653001901559653003501578653002201613653000901635653001501644700001901659700002501678773010801703856008501811852000901896655001201905IND60567464120221207123424.0180904e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2017.03.0092doi7 aPMC54247062pmcid7 a284312312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeom, Jinki10aSequestration from Protease Adaptor Confers Differential Stability to Protease Substrate  ap. 234-246.e5.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAccording to the N-end rule, the N-terminal residue of a protein determines its stability. In bacteria, the adaptor ClpS mediates proteolysis by delivering substrates bearing specific N-terminal residues to the protease ClpAP. We now report that the Salmonella adaptor ClpS binds to the N terminus of the regulatory protein PhoP, resulting in PhoP degradation by ClpAP. We establish that the PhoP-activated protein MgtC protects PhoP from degradation by outcompeting ClpS for binding to PhoP. MgtC appears to act exclusively on PhoP, as it did not alter the stability of a different ClpS-dependent ClpAP substrate. Removal of five N-terminal residues rendered PhoP stability independent of both the clpS and mgtC genes. By preserving PhoP protein levels, MgtC enables normal temporal transcription of PhoP-activated genes. The identified mechanism provides a simple means to spare specific substrates from an adaptor-dependent protease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3agenes 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3aregulatory proteins 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPhoP 0aprotease adaptor ClpS 0aprotease ClpAP 0aprotease substrate specificity 0aprotein stability 0aMgtC 0aSalmonella1 aWayne, Kyle J.1 aGroisman, Eduardo A.0 tMolecular cell.g2017 Apr. 20, v. 66, no. 2 p.234-246.e5dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245019000160300001400350520174500364592002802109650002302137650002402160650001502184650002002199650001702219650001002236650003502246650002502281650001402306650000902320650001002329650001702339650001402356650002002370650001902390650002302409650001802432650001402450650001702464650001502481650001502496650000902511650001402520650002402534650001402558650002102572653002302593653002302616653002102639653001902660700001802679700001202697700001702709700001402726700001902740700001702759700001702776773011002793856008202903852000902985655001202994IND60605767720221121054522.0191227e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wei14aThe synergic impacts of TiO2 nanoparticles and 17β-estradiol (E2) on the immune responses, E2 accumulation, and expression of immune-related genes of the blood clam, Tegillarca granosa  ap. 29-36.  aThe extensive use of TiO2 nanoparticles (nTiO2) in industrial products has led to their release into the marine environment, thereby posing a potential risk to marine organisms. However, in addition to affecting marine organisms through its inherent properties, nTiO2 can also act as a vehicle for other toxic pollutants due to their strong adsorption ability through the “Trojan horse” effect. Due to their potential hazard, the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as 17β-estradiol (E2), have been considered as one of the most serious anthropogenic threats to biodiversity and ecosystem health. However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the possible synergistic effects of nTiO2 and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on marine organisms to date. Therefore, the combined effects of nTiO2 and 17β-estradiol (E2) on the immune responses of the blood clam, Tegillarca granosa, were investigated in this study. After 10 days of treatment, the total number, phagocytic activity, red granulocytes ratio, and the phagocytosis of hemocytes were significantly reduced in almost all treatment groups. Furthermore, expressions of genes from NFκβ and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways were significantly altered after exposure to nTiO2 and/or E2, indicating a reduced sensitivity to pathogen challenges. In addition, compared to exposure to E2 alone, co-exposure to E2 and nTiO2 led to a significant increase in the content of alkali-labile phosphate (ALP) in hemolymph, suggesting an enhanced E2 bioconcentration in the presence of nTiO2. In general, the present study demonstrated that nTiO2 enhanced the immunotoxicity of E2 to the blood clam, which may be due to the increased E2 uptake in the presence of nTiO2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTegillarca granosa 3aToll-like receptors 3aadsorption 3abioaccumulation 3abiodiversity 3aclams 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental health 3aestradiol 3afish 3agenes 3agranulocytes 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3aimmunotoxicity 3amarine environment 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3arisk 3ashellfish 3asignal transduction 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 0aTegillarca granosa 0aTiO2 nanoparticles 0aImmune responses 0a17β-estradiol1 aGuan, Xiaofan1 aHan, Yu1 aZha, Shanjie1 aFang, Jun1 aXiao, Guoqiang1 aYan, Maocang1 aLiu, Guangxu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Oct., v. 81 p.29-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007100163500002200234520113100256592002801387650003601415650001001451650001901461650002101480650001601501650001001517650000901527650001301536650001401549650002501563653001801588653001701606653003601623653001201659700002001671700001401691700001801705773009701723856008201820852000901902655001201911IND60570517220221121092120.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Sumi10aGeneration and characterization of mouse knockout for glyoxalase 1  aPre-press version  aGlyoxalase 1 (Glo1) is the first enzyme involved in glutathione-dependent detoxification of methylglyoxal, eventually generating d-lactate by the second enzyme glyoxalase 2 (Glo2). An accumulation of intracellular glyoxal and methylglyoxal leads to protein malfunction and mutation via formation of the advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Studies on mouse behavior suggest that methylglyoxal has anxiolytic properties. In this report, we generated and characterized a mouse knockout for Glo1. The knockout mice were viable without a pronounced phenotypic defect. Increased level of AGEs in Glo1 knockout mice was detected by immunoblotting with anti-MGH1 in liver homogenate, but not in brain. Alterations in behavior were observed in open field, light-dark transition, and tail suspension test. Open field data indicate increased exploration for novel environment and entry/stay in center zone in Glo1 knockout mice. In addition, increased light-dark transition and immobility was observed in the knockout mice. These data indicate that Glo1 knockout reduces anxiety-like behavior, but increases depression-like behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3abrain 3aimmunoblotting 3aknockout mutants 3alactic acid 3aliver 3amice 3amutation 3aphenotype 3atail suspension test 0aMethylglyoxal 0aGlyoxalase 1 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aAnxiety1 aKwon, David Min1 aKwon, Kyu1 aPark, Chankyu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01279naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009300163300001600256520040100272592002800673653001600701653001300717653001600730653001600746653001600762773013500778856007900913852000900992655001201001IND60128493620221120134934.0151115e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012849362DNAL7 a10.2317/JKES-801.07.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Brian V.10aNew Records and a New Species of the Dohrniphora longirostrata Group (Diptera: Phoridae)  ap. 204-207.  aNew country records are given for three species of the Neotropical Dohrniphora longirostrata group: D. bicostula Kung and Brown is recorded from Brazil and Peru, D. oricilla Kung and Brown from Mexico, and D. perpendicularis Kung and Brown from Brazil.

One Uncinaria sp. was observed in the large intestines, and the other was observed in the small intestines. The nematode found in the large intestines was determined to be Uncinaria felidis by morphological identification. The other Uncinaria sp. found in the small intestines was morphologically different from U. felidis in the short-length of prevulvar flap. After isolation of genomic DNA of these worms, a second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA was amplified and sequenced using PCR techniques. The ITS2 region of U. felidis had 222 nucleotide sequences in length. The alignments of ITS2 sequence for Uncinaria felidis and Uncinaria sp. showed one nucleotide (0.45 %) replacement. These differrences may be regarded as intraspecific variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrionailurus bengalensis 3aUncinaria 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aislands 3alarge intestine 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence alignment 3asmall intestine 3aJapan 0aTsushima leopard 0aUncinaria 0aGenomic DNA 0aITS21 aTaharaguchi, S.1 aTaira, K.1 aMiyoshi, N.1 aYasuda, N.0 tHelminthologia.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 49, no. 3 p.123-127dVersitawJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11687-012-0026-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245011500158300001800273500002000291520168800311592002801999650001902027650002202046650001902068650001602087650001802103650001102121650001502132650001102147650001102158650001102169650002302180650001602203650001602219650001502235650001602250650001302266650001202279650002202291651001402313700002102327700002502348700002402373700002202397773012502419856007202544852000902616655001202625IND60600041420221121160102.0180702e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060004142DNAL7 a10.1002/eap.17202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSáez, Agustín14aThe costs and benefits of pollinator dependence: empirically based simulations predict raspberry fruit quality  ap. 1215-1222.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGlobally, agriculture increasingly depends on pollinators to produce many seed and fruit crops. However, what constitutes optimal pollination service for pollinator‐dependent crops remains unanswered. We developed a simulation model to identify the optimal pollination service that maximizes fruit quality in crops. The model depicts the pollination (i.e., autonomous self‐fertilization, pollen deposition) and post‐pollination (i.e., pollen germination, and time from germination to ovule fertilization) processes leading to fruit and seed set and allows for negative flower–pollinator interactions, specifically pistil damage. We parameterized and validated the model based on empirical observations of commercial raspberry in western Argentina. To assess the effects of pollination intensity for fruit production, we conducted simulations over a range of visit number per flower by the two primary managed pollinators worldwide, Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Simulations identified that ~15–35 visits per flower by A. mellifera or ~10–20 visits by B. terrestris provide adequate pollination and maximize raspberry fruit quality (i.e., estimated as the proportion of ovules that develop into drupelets). Visits in excess of these optima reduce simulated fruit quality, and flowers receiving >670 honey bee visits or >470 bumble bee visits would produce fruits of poorer quality than those receiving no bee visits. The simulations generated consistent, unbiased predictions of fruit quality for 12 raspberry fields. This model could be adapted easily to other animal‐pollinated crops and used to guide efficient pollinator management in any agro‐ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aBombus terrestris 3aagroecosystems 3afruit crops 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ahoney bees 3aovules 3apistil 3apollen 3apollen germination 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprediction 3araspberries 3aseed set 3aselfing 3asimulation models 3aArgentina1 aMorales, Juan M.1 aMorales, Carolina L.1 aHarder, Lawrence D.1 aAizen, Marcelo A.0 tEcological applications.g2018 July, v. 28, no. 5 p.1215-1222dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.17203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04138naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013800159500001500297506025800312520215800570592002802728650002502756650001602781650001002797650001702807650001402824650003102838650001102869650001402880650001502894650003002909650001002939650001702949650002402966650001302990650001403003650001503017650001503032650001703047650002503064650002903089650001503118650001403133650001203147651000903159653002203168653001503190653002303205653002603228653001903254700002003273700001703293773013903310856007803449852000903527655001203536IND60560927820221120145646.0170112e20161219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092782DNAL7 a10.4081/jear.2016.50852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeidi, K.10aHymenopterous Parasitoids Attacking Acanthiophilus Helianthi Rossi (Diptera: Tephritidae) Pupae in Kohgiluyeh Safflower Farms of Iran  a2019-12-06  aThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License (by-nc 4.0) which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.  aThe Safflower capsule fly (SCF), Acanthiophilus helianthi Rossi (Diptera: Tephritidae) is the most destructive insect pest attacking the Safflower Carthamus tinctorius L. plant which are cultivated as an oil crop. It is mainly controlled through application of broad-spectrum insecticides, which can adversely affect safflower farms ecosystem and consequently human health. Since a first step in setting up an integrated pest management program is to assess the biological control agents within the ecosystem. Therefore, in this research work the pupal parasitoids of Safflower capsule fly a main insect pest attacking Safflower plants were identified. The impact of these parasitoids against this pest was evaluated on the varying pest generations and within different locations in Kohgiluyeh province during 2008-2009 seasons. Pupal parasitoid adults of SCF were recorded from field-reared pupae, which had been collected from heavily infested small flower heads of the first generation as well from large flower heads of the second and third generations. Rate of parasitism on A. helianthi pupae was estimated as the number of parasitoids over the total count of parasitoids and flies. Ten hymenopterous species belonging to different families parasitizing insect pupae were screened as follows: Bracon hebetor (Spinola, 1808) and Bracon luteator (Spinola, 1808) (Braconidae); Isocolus tinctorious (Melika and Gharaei, 2006) (Cynipidae); Pronotalia carlinarum (Szelenyi and Erdos, 1951) (Eulophidae); Eurytoma acroptilae (Zerova, 1986) (Eurytomidae); Ormyrus orientalis (Walker, 1871) (Ormyridae); Colotrechnus viridis (Masi, 1921) and Pteromalus sp. (Walker, 1976) (Pteromalidae); and Antistrophoplex conthurnatus (Zerova, 2000) and Microdontomenus annulatus (Masi, 1899) (Torymidae). The average parasitization rate was 23±1 as revealed through the present study. The highest parasitization rate occurred during the first generation in all localities tested, as well as in years. Statistical analysis revealed that there were significant differences between parasitization rates by pupal parasitoids within various host generations and localities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aparasitoids 3apupae 3ainsecticides 3aoil crops 3aintegrated pest management 3aadults 3aOrmyridae 3aparasitism 3abiological control agents 3afarms 3ahuman health 3aHabrobracon hebetor 3aEurytoma 3aTorymidae 3aecosystems 3aPteromalus 3ainsect pests 3astatistical analysis 3aAcanthiophilus helianthi 3aEulophidae 3aCynipidae 3aflowers 3aIran 0apupal parasitoids 0aKohgiluyeh 0aBiological control 0aSafflower capsule fly 0aBracon hebetor1 aMirfakhraie, S.1 aMehrkhou, F.0 tJournal of entomological and acarological research.g2016 Dec. 19, v. 48, no. 3dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2279-70847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jear.2016.50853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03907naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245016800207500002200375520177100397592002802168650002602196650001402222650001602236650001402252650001402266650002302280650001002303650002402313650003702337650002902374650002302403650000902426653001402435653001402449653001602463653002402479653000702503653000802510653001602518653000902534653000802543653000702551653000902558653000902567653000802576653000802584653000902592653000902601653000802610653000802618653001002626653000802636653000802644653001102652653000802663653000902671653001102680653000802691653000802699653000902707653001102716653000902727653001102736653000902747653000902756700001402765700001802779700001402797700001602811700001502827700001902842700001802861773009202879856008502971852000903056655001203065IND60630405320221117234858.0190207e20190202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1528572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Mengnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9558-634710aChinese yam extract and adenosine attenuated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction by inhibiting RAS and apoptosis via the ER-mediated activation of SHC/Ras/Raf1 pathway  aPre-press version  aThis study aimed to examine the effects of the Chinese yam extract and adenosine on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac anomalies and the underlying mechanisms involved.Chinese yam extract [1630 mg/kg, intragastric (i.g.), 2 times/day] and adenosine (50 mg/kg, i.g., 2 times/day) were administered for 3 days, followed by the induction of sepsis by injecting LPS intraperitoneally [10 mg/kg, 2 h prior, intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. Also, estrogen receptor (ER)-unspecific antagonist Faslodex (ICI182,780, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 min before the treatments of Chinese yam extract or adenosine to evaluate whether the observed effects elicited by yam and adenosine were mediated via ERs. The heart function and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reversed mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), renin–angiotensin system (RAS), apoptosis markers, ER, and SHC/Ras/Raf1 were examined. The antagonistic effect of ICI182,780 (1μM) and FTS (1μM) against the Chinese yam extract (0.1 mg/mL) and adenosine (5μM) in LPS (20 μg/mL, 24 h)-induced H9c2 cells was also investigated.The Chinese yam extract and adenosine improved heart function, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, reversed MAPK and RAS, transformed the apoptosis markers, and increased the expression of ER and SHC/Ras/Raf1 following LPS challenge. These effects could be blocked by ICI182,780. FTS could not block the expression of ER on the Chinese yam extract and adenosine interposed on LPS-induced H9c2 cells, demonstrating that ER might be the upstream signaling regulator of SHC/Ras/Raf1.The Chinese yam extract and adenosine ameliorated LPS-induced cardiac contractility through the inhibition of RAS and apoptosis possibly via an ER–SHC/Ras/Raf1-dependent mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea polystachya 3aadenosine 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3acytokines 3aestrogen receptors 3aheart 3alipopolysaccharides 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3arenin-angiotensin system 3asepsis (infection) 3ayams 0aAdenosine 0aApoptosis 0aChinese yam 0aCardiac dysfunction 0aER 0aLPS 0aICI182, 780 0aMAPK 0aRAS 0aER 0aTBST 0aPVDF 0aMTT 0aPBS 0aDMSO 0aDMEM 0aFST 0aBax 0aBcl-2 0aH&E 0aCBA 0aERK1/2 0aJNK 0aIL-6 0aTNF-α 0aPCT 0aCRP 0aCTnI 0aAngⅡ 0aACE2 0aAng1-7 0aLVEF 0aLVFS1 aZhang, Li1 aZhang, Beibei1 aLi, Benke1 aKan, Yuxuan1 aYang, Hang1 aFeng, Weisheng1 aZheng, Xiaoke0 tPhytomedicine.g2019 Feb. 02,  p.152857-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1528573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010300165300001600268520156800284592002801852653002401880653001801904653001601922653001501938700002001953700002501973773013501998856007902133852000902212655001202221IND60128493920221120134901.0151115e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012849392DNAL7 a10.2317/JKES-802.06.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Joseph S.10aSampling Bee Communities (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) in a Desert Landscape: Are Pan Traps Sufficient?  ap. 288-300.  aPan traps (colored plastic bowls) are frequently used as an efficient standardized method of sampling bee faunas. We explored the utility of pan traps in three colors compared to net collecting using simultaneous sampling at biweekly intervals throughout the flowering season (May––Sep) at 11 sites in the eastern Great Basin Desert. Pan traps deployed for one day (9:00––16:00) on average captured significantly larger samples than net collections (2 hr.) at all intervals except the latter half of May. Average species richness for net collections exceeded pan traps only during late May and late September, periods with abundant floral resources. Capture rates were similar between colors. The composition of bees was also similar; Søørensen's similarity values exceeded 0.7. Color preferences for pollen specialists did not match flower color of their hosts. There were significant differences in species composition between net collections and pan trap collections. Almost one-third of the species showed a strong bias toward one method and in some cases between pan trap colors. The methods appear complementary: Halictinae and Perdita were predominantly collected in pan traps (85%%); three genera, Anthidium, Colletes, Epeolus were largely or entirely detected by netting. Net collecting should be used in addition to pan traps if comprehensive inventories are desired. Though pan trapping constitutes a standardized method that avoids collector bias, it may not be unbiased; capture rates were lowest when flowering plant richness was greatest.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUV reflective traps 0abee diversity 0aGreat Basin 0asand dunes1 aGriswold, Terry1 aMessinger, Olivia J.0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2008 July, v. 81, no. 3 p.288-300dThe Kansas Entomological Societyx0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317%2FJKES-802.06.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04251naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013800172300002000310520248700330592002802817596006602845650002302911650002202934650001702956650001602973650001902989650000803008650001803016650002603034650001303060650001603073650001003089650001503099650001403114650001303128650001003141650002003151650001303171650001603184650001103200651000903211700005803220700002703278700002203305700002203327700002303349700001803372700002903390700001903419773015503438856008303593852000903676655001203685IND60765838220221118215459.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16733-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefzadeh, Ameneh10aEvaluation of bio-aerosols type, density, and modeling of dispersion in inside and outside of different wards of educational hospital  ap. 14143-14157.  aExposure to bioaerosols in the air of hospitals is associated with a wide range of adverse health effects due to the presence of airborne microorganisms. Intensity and type of health effects depend on many factors such as the type, density, and diversity of bioaerosols in hospital environments. Therefore, identifying and determining their distribution in hospital environment contribute to reduce their adverse effects and maintain the physical health of patients and staff, as well as find the source of infections and possible allergies due to the presence of bioaerosols. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the type and concentration of the bacterial and fungal bioaerosols, and their distribution in the indoor and outdoor air of a teaching hospital to establish a reference for future studies or measures. The air samples were collected with a one-stage Anderson sampler and particle mass counter for a period of four months in the fall and winter of 2019. In total, 262 bacterial and fungal samples were collected from the air of the wards of Tohid Hospital, Sanandaj, Iran. Antibiotic resistance test, bacterial identification by PCR method, and modeling the dispersion of concentrations of bio-aerosols were also conducted. In order to identify bacteria and fungi, some biochemical and molecular tests and microscopic and macroscopic characteristic methods were applied, respectively. The results showed that the highest and lowest densities of the bioaerosols were observed in lung and operating wards (336.67 and 15.25 CFU/m³). Moreover, the highest and least concentrations of particles were seen in the emergency and operating wards, respectively. The most common fungi isolated from the hospital air were Penicillium (24.7%), Cladosporium (23. 4%), Aspergillus niger (13.3%), and Aspergillus Flavus (11.4%). Furthermore, the highest concentration of the isolated bacterium was Staphylococcus hemolyticus (31.84%). Most bacteria showed the highest resistance to gentamicin. The overall average hospital air pollution to bioaerosols was slightly higher than the standards proposed by international organizations. Due to the high concentration of bioaerosols and particles in the studied hospital, providing suitable conditions such as temperature, humidity, proper ventilation, and intelligent air conditioning system using efficient ventilation systems, and restricting the entrance of wards can reduce airborne particles in hospital environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aIR.MUK.REC.1397/226cKurdistan University of Medical Sciences 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus niger 3aCladosporium 3aPenicillium 3aStaphylococcus 3aair 3aair pollution 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abioaerosols 3afungi 3agentamicin 3ahospitals 3ahumidity 3alungs 3aphysical health 3aresearch 3atemperature 3awinter 3aIran1 aMaleki, Afshin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8261-87171 aAthar, Saeed Dehestani1 aDarvishi, Ebrahim1 aAhmadi, Manochehr1 aMohammadi, Ebrahim1 aTang, Van Tai1 aKalmarzi, Rasoul Nassiri1 aKashefi, Hajar0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.14143-14157dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16733-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245007600213500001400289520124400303592002801547650001601575650001701591650001101608650002401619650001501643650000901658650001201667650001701679650001601696650001701712650001101729651001701740653001701757653002401774653001701798653001901815653001801834700006201852700006301914773011301977856008602090852000902176655001202185IND60719499220221118211527.0210201e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshammari, Fuhaid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4766-990010aCleaner production of freshwater using multi-effect tubular solar still  aNAL-light  aTubular solar still is a promising technique for freshwater cleaner production. However, the main reason lowering its productivity is the heat lost from the tube surface to the surrounding atmosphere during the condensation process. The present study introduces a techno-economical feasibility study and evaluation of using multi-effect tubular solar still to introduce a clear vision for stakeholders in the desalination market in Saudi Arabia. The heat lost by the first-effect is utilized in the second-effect to evaporate more saline water which then condensates on the inner surface of the outer tube of the second-effect and so on. Minimum condensation energy is subjected to the last effect causing considerable lower heat loss to the surrounding. Major findings of the present study showed a great opportunity for the enhancement of the double and triple-effect active tubular solar still performance more than that of the higher effects. The proposed device is expected to increase the freshwater productivity by 60.5%, 97.8% and 122.4% for double, triple and quadruple-effect TSS, respectively. The optimum number of effects is the double and the triple-effect due to having the lower cost ($0.007) of water production per liter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensates 3adesalination 3aenergy 3afeasibility studies 3afreshwater 3aheat 3amarkets 3asaline water 3asolar still 3astakeholders 3avision 3aSaudi Arabia 0aSolar energy 0aTubular solar still 0aMulti-effect 0aCost per liter 0aHeat recovery1 aElashmawy, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1614-05021 aAhmed, Mohamed M.Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9550-74310 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 281 p.125301-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1253013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245023800169520132400407592002801731650000801759650001801767650001401785650001501799650002101814650002001835650001101855650003201866650001501898650001201913650002301925650001801948650001501966650001701981650002701998650001402025650001902039650001502058653001702073653002202090653000902112653001002121653002202131653003402153653001002187653000802197653000902205700002002214700002202234700001402256700002502270700001502295700002602310700007202336773009402408856008502502852000902587655001202596IND60630405420221117234851.0190502e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1528582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShailaja, V.L.12aA natural anticancer pigment,Pheophytin a,from a seagrass acts as a high affinity human mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) ligand, in silico, to reduce mitochondrial membrane Potential (∆ψmit) in adenocarcinomic A549 cells.  aThe present investigation looks at the most likely possibilities of usage of a naturally occurring photosynthetic pigment, Pheophytin a, from the seagrass, Syringodium isoetifolium, for plausible use as human TSPO ligand.Pheophytin a isolated in our laboratory previously was administered to A549 cell lines in vitro to examine its effects on cell migrations, DNA, cell cycle, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and gene expressions. In silico tools were used to predict the nature of the compound and target binding.Pheophytin a hadIC50 values of 22.9 ± 5.8 µM for cancerous A549 cell lines, whilst not targeting non-cancerous vero cells [IC50: 183.6 ± 1.92 µM]. Pheophytin a hindered cellular migration, fragmented DNA, arrested cell cycle precisely at S phase, reduced ∆ψmit and directed mRNA expressions toward apoptosis. In silico tools indicate that the compound binds to TSPO with high effectiveness to collapse ∆ψmit(which is proved using wet lab experiments) to promote mitophagy.Hence Pheophytin a could be seen as a possible TSPO ligand for targeting metastatic alveolar cancers like A549 via intrinsic apoptotic pathway.Given the inherent non-toxic nature of the compound and easy extractability from almost all autotrophic eukaryotes, one could be confident to testing in animal models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterphase 3aligands 3amembrane potential 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasms 3aphotosynthesis 3aseagrasses 0aPheophytin a 0aCell cycle arrest 0aTSPO 0aADMET 0aMolecular docking 0aMolecular dynamics simulation 0aADMET 0aMMP 0aTSPO1 aChristina, V.S.1 aMohanapriya, C.D.1 aSneha, P.1 aLakshmi Sundaram, R.1 aMagesh, R.1 aGeorge Priya Doss, C.1 aGnanambal, K.

C.10aPhosphorylation or Mutation of the ERK2 Activation Loop Alters Oligonucleotide Binding  ap. 1909-1917.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2 is able to elicit a wide range of context-specific responses to distinct stimuli, but the mechanisms underlying this versatility remain in question. Some cellular functions of ERK2 are mediated through regulation of gene expression. In addition to phosphorylating numerous transcriptional regulators, ERK2 is known to associate with chromatin and has been shown to bind oligonucleotides directly. ERK2 is activated by the upstream kinases MEK1/2, which phosphorylate both tyrosine 185 and threonine 183. ERK2 requires phosphorylation on both sites to be fully active. Some additional ERK2 phosphorylation sites have also been reported, including threonine 188. It has been suggested that this phospho form has distinct properties. We detected some ERK2 phosphorylated on T188 in bacterial preparations of ERK2 by mass spectrometry and further demonstrate that phosphomimetic substitution of this ERK2 residue impairs its kinase activity toward well-defined substrates and also affects its DNA binding. We used electrophoretic mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides derived from the insulin gene promoter and other regions to examine effects of phosphorylation and mutations on the binding of ERK2 to DNA. We show that ERK2 can bind oligonucleotides directly. Phosphorylation and mutations alter DNA binding and support the idea that signaling functions may be influenced through an alternate phosphorylation site.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3achromatin 3agel electrophoresis 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainsulin 3amass spectrometry 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutation 3aoligonucleotides 3aphosphorylation 3athreonine 3atranscription factors 3atyrosine1 aKarra, Aroon S.1 aLi, Yan1 aLopez, Elias Daniel1 aTurjanski, Adrian

METHODS AND RESULTS: Detection of Staph. aureus on hands or in the nose of 169 individuals was performed. Nasal and hand carriage was found in 39·6 and in 8·9% respectively. About 17·2% of the individuals were carriers of methicillin‐resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) in the nose and 4·7% on hands. The majority of nasal MRSA were resistant to β‐lactams, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. All nasal MRSA were SCCmec type IV and Panton‐Valentine leukocidin (PVL) negative. One MRSA isolated from hand was SCCmec type V. About 75·6% of MRSA isolates presented the same or closely related restriction patterns. Sixty per cent of Staph. aureus from hands and from noses from the same individual were the same strain. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA nasal carriage was high considering healthy health care professionals but in accordance with high level of MRSA infection in Portugal. Isolates recovered in this study seemed to be different from major clones previously isolated in other Portuguese hospitals. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These findings may have implications on the knowledge of healthy health care workers as vehicles of MRSA infections among the community. Presence of several virulence factors may contribute to increased pathogenesis in case of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aciprofloxacin 3aclones 3aerythromycin 3ahands 3ahealth care workers 3ahospitals 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3anose 3apathogenesis 3avirulence 3aPortugal1 aKomora, N.1 aFerreira, V.1 aLira, A.1 aMota, M.1 aSilva, J.1 aTeixeira, P.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.831-839dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.131863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245011500208300001200323506007600335520117800411592002801589506003701617650002201654650001401676650002201690650002201712650002601734650003301760650001601793650001201809650001301821650002001834653001401854653003001868653000901898653000901907653000901916653000901925653000901934700002101943773019001964856007802154852000902232655001202241IND60554810320221207114406.0161025e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055481032DNAL7 a10.5936/csbj.2013030102doi7 aPMC39622202pmcid7 a246887182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakabayashi, Sadao14aThe essential biology of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response for structural and computational biologists  ap. 1-9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is a cytoprotective mechanism that maintains homeostasis of the ER by upregulating the capacity of the ER in accordance with cellular demands. If the ER stress response cannot function correctly, because of reasons such as aging, genetic mutation or environmental stress, unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER and cause ER stress-induced apoptosis, resulting in the onset of folding diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus. Although the mechanism of the ER stress response has been analyzed extensively by biochemists, cell biologists and molecular biologists, many aspects remain to be elucidated. For example, it is unclear how sensor molecules detect ER stress, or how cells choose the two opposite cell fates (survival or apoptosis) during the ER stress response. To resolve these critical issues, structural and computational approaches will be indispensable, although the mechanism of the ER stress response is complicated and difficult to understand holistically at a glance. Here, we provide a concise introduction to the mammalian ER stress response for structural and computational biologists.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aapoptosis 3achemical elements 3adiabetes mellitus 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3ahomeostasis 3amammals 3amutation 3astress response 0aER stress 0aunfolded protein response 0aATF6 0aIRE1 0aPERK 0aXBP1 0aERAD1 aYoshida, Hiderou0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2013 Mar., v. 6 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.aResearch Network of Computational and Structural BiotechnologywJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5936/csbj.2013030103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100002800210245012200238300001400360506007600374506003100450520162300481592002802104596001902132506003702151650002602188650002302214650000902237650002502246650001402271650001802285650001802303650001502321650001902336650001002355650001202365650002002377650001702397650002902414700002602443773012002469856008202589961000902671852000902680655001202689IND60731886020221215142344.0220901e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073188602DNAL7 a10113/73188602hdl7 a10.1016/j.ijms.2017.01.0172doi7 a10.1016/j.ijms.2017.01.0172chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFagerquist , Clifton K.10aComplementary b/y fragment ion pairs from post-source decay of metastable YahO for calibration of MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS/MS  ap. 29-37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aComplementary b/y fragment ion pairs from post-source decay (PSD) of metastable YahO protein ion were evaluated for use in the calibration of MALDI-TOF-TOF for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The yahO gene from pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain EDL933 was cloned into a pBAD18 plasmid vector and transferred to a yahO gene knockout (ΔyahO) of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain K-12. YahO protein was over-expressed by overnight culturing of the K-12 mutant on Luria-Bertani agar (LBA) supplemented with arabinose. MS/MS-PSD of the YahO protein ion results in polypeptide backbone cleavage on the C-terminal side of seven aspartic acid (D) residues of the mature protein sequence resulting in a series of prominent b/y fragment ion pairs. Interestingly, we observe an unusual oscillatory pattern in the fragmentation efficiency of cleavage sites across the linear polypeptide chain of YahO. The instrument was calibrated for MS/MS-PSD using at least six of twelve of the most intense b- and y-type fragment ions of YahO. Calibration was tested on the disulfide bond-reduced B-subunit of Shiga toxin 2 from Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain EDL933 cultured overnight on LBA supplemented with ciprofloxacin. Two non-simultaneous calibrant/analyte acquisition scenarios were evaluated: 1. YahO and B-subunit on separate (but adjacent) spot locations; 2. YahO and the B-subunit co-located on the same spot. We observed no significant difference in mass accuracy for co-location vs. adjacent spot analysis in spite of a significant drop in ion intensity of both calibrant and analyte for co-location analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  cARS, USDA CRIS0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aShiga-like toxin 2 3aagar 3aamino acid sequences 3aarabinose 3aaspartic acid 3aciprofloxacin 3adisulfides 3agene targeting 3agenes 3amutants 3aplasmid vectors 3apolypeptides 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aZaragoza , William J.0 tInternational Journal of Mass Spectrometry.g2017 Apr., v. 415 p.29-37dElsevier BVwJournal:12055x1387-38067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijms.2017.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014000157300001600297500002000313500001500333520132200348592002801670650001601698650002201714650002301736650001301759650001501772650001401787650001601801650001101817650002401828650001201852650001001864650002201874653001401896700001501910700001501925773011501940856007302055961001302128852000902141655001202150IND60548389320221119220250.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054838932DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.131972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedrano, E.G.10aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) boll rotting bacteria vectored by the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)  ap. 757-766.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aAIM: To determine the capacity of the brown stink bug (BSB) (Euschistus servus) to transmit an infective Pantoea agglomerans strain Sc 1‐R into cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) bolls. METHODS AND RESULTS: A laboratory colony of BSB was maintained on fresh green beans. Either sterile or Sc 1‐R contaminated beans were offered to adult insects. Strain Sc 1‐R holds rifampicin resistance (Rifʳ). Insects were then caged with unopened greenhouse‐grown bolls. After 2 days, BSB were surface sterilized, ground, and then plated on media with and without Rif. Two weeks later, seed with lint were ground and plated on media with and without Rif. Microbes were recovered on nonselective media from all BSBs and from seed/lint at concentrations reaching 10⁹ CFU g⁻¹ tissue. Rifʳ bacteria were recovered strictly from insects exposed to Sc1‐R and from diseased seed/lint of respective bolls. CONCLUSIONS: Euschistus servus was capable of transmitting strain Sc 1‐R into bolls resulting in disease. Insects not exposed to the pathogen deposited bacteria yet the nonpathogenic microbes produced insignificant damage to the boll tissue. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This is the first study to concretely show the capacity of the BSB to transmit an infective P. agglomerans strain resulting in boll disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3alint cotton 3aavirulent strains 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abacteria 3arifampicin 3apathogens 3agreen beans 3aimagos 3aPantoea agglomerans 3ainsects 3abolls 3aEuschistus servus 0aHemiptera1 aBell, A.A.1 aDuke, S.E.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.757-766dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.131973Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04281naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002000168245013400188300001600322520248800338592002802826650001602854650001102870650000902881650001402890650002702904650001302931650000902944650002202953650001102975650001402986650001203000650002003012650001303032650001203045650001803057650002503075650002703100650003303127650002503160650001403185650002703199650002003226650003903246651001403285651001403299653002503313653002403338653002103362653001803383653001103401653001203412700002003424773013003444856008403574852000903658655001203667IND60082844020221117190413.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008284402DNAL7 a238314562pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2013.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgnarsson, Ingi12aA molecular phylogeny of the Australian huntsman spiders (Sparassidae, Deleninae): Implications for taxonomy and social behaviour  ap. 895-905.  aHuntsman spiders (Sparassidae) are a diverse group with a worldwide distribution, yet are poorly known both taxonomically and phylogenetically. They are particularly diverse in Australia where an endemic lineage, Deleninae, has diversified to form nearly 100 species. One unusual species, Delena cancerides, has been believed to be the sole group-living sparassid. Unlike all of the other subsocial and social spiders which are capture-web based or live in silken tunnels, D. cancerides are non-web building spiders that live in large matrilineal colonies of a single adult female and her offspring from multiple clutches of under the bark of dead trees. Here we report the discovery of two additional prolonged subsocial sparassid species, currently in Eodelena but here formally proposed as a synonomy of Delena (new synonoymy), Delena (Eodelena) lapidicola and D. (E.) melanochelis. We briefly describe their social demographics, behavior, and habitat use. In order to understand the evolutionary relationships among these species, and thus origin of sociality and other traits in this group, we also offer the first molecular phylogeny of Deleninae and relatives. We employ model based phylogenetic analyses on two mtDNA and three nuDNA loci using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, including both ‘classical’ concatenation approach as well as coalescent-based analysis of species trees from gene trees. Our results support the hypothesis that the delenine huntsman spiders are a monophyletic Australian radiation, approximately 23million year old, and indicate that the current ten genera should be merged to six genera in four clades. Our findings are inconsistent with some relatively recent changes in the taxonomy of Deleninae. The three known group-living delenine species are related and likely represent a single origin of sociality with a single reversal to solitary life-styles. Our results provide strong support for the classical Isopeda, but not for the recent splitting of that taxon into Isopeda, Isopedella, and Holconia. Another moderately supported clade within Deleninae unites three genera (Pediana, Beregama, Typostola) that, while morphologically diverse, all share extraordinary locomotory speed. A fourth clade is comprised of the speciose Neosparassus, containing Zachria. In sum, our study results in a robust phylogeny of Deleninae, casting light on the origin of sociality in the group, and facilitating future work on these unusual spiders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparassidae 3aadults 3abark 3adead wood 3ademographic statistics 3ahabitats 3aloci 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3amonophyly 3aprogeny 3asocial behavior 3ataxonomy 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aBiological Evolution 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aLikelihood Functions 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSocial Behavior 2aSpidersxclassificationxgenetics. 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aAustralian radiation 0aSparassid phylogeny 0aSpider evolution 0aSocial spider 0aDelena 0aIsopeda1 aRayor, Linda S.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2013 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.895-905dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2013.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04176naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245008400205300001300289506007600302520221600378592002802594506003702622650002602659650001102685650001802696650001802714650001302732650001402745650002202759650001702781650001002798650002002808650001502828650001502843650001702858650001102875650000902886650001602895650001302911650001402924650001902938650001502957650002202972650002402994653001903018653003203037653001203069653001703081653001303098653002103111700002203132700001703154700002303171700002103194700002103215773019103236856007803427852000903505655001203514IND60554810520221207121007.0161025e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055481052DNAL7 a10.5936/csbj.2013030122doi7 aPMC39621292pmcid7 a246887202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKildey, Katrina10aCharacterization of enu-induced mutations in red blood cell structural proteins  ap. 1-10.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMurine models with modified gene function as a result of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis have been used to study phenotypes resulting from genetic change. This study investigated genetic factors associated with red blood cell (RBC) physiology and structural integrity that may impact on blood component storage and transfusion outcome. Forward and reverse genetic approaches were employed with pedigrees of ENU-treated mice using a homozygous recessive breeding strategy. In a “forward genetic” approach, pedigree selection was based upon identification of an altered phenotype followed by exome sequencing to identify a causative mutation. In a second strategy, a “reverse genetic” approach based on selection of pedigrees with mutations in genes of interest was utilised and, following breeding to homozygosity, phenotype assessed. Thirty-three pedigrees were screened by the forward genetic approach. One pedigree demonstrated reticulocytosis, microcytic anaemia and thrombocytosis. Exome sequencing revealed a novel single nucleotide variation (SNV) in Ank1 encoding the RBC structural protein ankyrin-1 and the pedigree was designated Ank1EX34. The reticulocytosis and microcytic anaemia observed in the Ank1EX34 pedigree were similar to clinical features of hereditary spherocytosis in humans. For the reverse genetic approach three pedigrees with different point mutations in Spnb1 encoding RBC protein spectrin-1β, and one pedigree with a mutation in Epb4.1, encoding band 4.1 were selected for study. When bred to homozygosity two of the spectrin-1β pedigrees (a, b) demonstrated increased RBC count, haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (HCT). The third Spnb1 mutation (spectrin-1β c) and mutation in Epb4.1 (band 4.1) did not significantly affect the haematological phenotype, despite these two mutations having a PolyPhen score predicting the mutation may be damaging. Exome sequencing allows rapid identification of causative mutations and development of databases of mutations predicted to be disruptive. These tools require further refinement but provide new approaches to the study of genetically defined changes that may impact on blood component storage and transfusion outcome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aN-ethyl-N-nitrosourea 3aanemia 3aanimal models 3abiotechnology 3abreeding 3adatabases 3aerythrocyte count 3aerythrocytes 3agenes 3agenetic factors 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3amice 3amutagenesis 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3apoint mutation 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3astructural proteins 0aRed Blood Cell 0aN-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) 0aAnkyrin 0aSpectrin-1β 0aBand 4.1 0aMissense Library1 aFlower, Robert L.1 aTran, Thu V.1 aTunningley, Robert1 aHarris, Jonathan1 aDean, Melinda M.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2013 Mar., v. 6 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.aResearch Network of Computational and Structural BiotechnologywJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5936/csbj.2013030123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009800169300001600267520161000283592002801893650001701921650001501938650001501953650002701968650001401995650001102009650001002020650001802030650001502048653001102063653000902074653000902083653002802092653001202120700002202132700006402154700001702218700002202235700001902257700002302276773012702299856008302426852000902509655001202518IND60542663320221119230501.0190405e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrint, Nicola J.10aElectroencephalographic Responses to a Noxious Surgical Stimulus in Mules, Horses, and Ponies  ap. 955-962.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the electroencephalographic (EEG) response of equidae to a castration stimulus. Study 1 included 11 mules (2½–8 years; 230–315 kg) and 11 horses (1½–3½ years; 315–480 kg); study 2 included four ponies (15–17 months; 176–229 kg). They were castrated under halothane anesthesia after acepromazine premedication (IV [study 1] and intramuscular [study 2]) and thiopental anesthetic induction. Animals were castrated using a semiclosed technique (study 1) and a closed technique (study 2). Raw EEG data were analyzed and the EEG variables, median frequency (F50), total power (Ptot), and spectral edge frequency (F95), were derived using standard techniques at skin incision (skin) and emasculation (emasc) time points. Baseline values of F50, Ptot, and F95 for each animal were used to calculate percentage change from baseline at skin incision and emasculation. Differences were observed in Ptot and F50 data between hemispheres in horses but not mules (study 1) and in one pony (study 2). A response to castration (>10% change relative to baseline) was observed in eight horses (73% of animals) and four mules (36% of animals) for F50 and nine horses (82%) and four mules (36%) for Ptot. No changes in F95 data were observed in any animal in study 1. Responses to castration were observed in three ponies (75% of animals) for F50, one pony (25%) for F95, and all ponies for Ptot. Alteration of acepromazine administration and castration technique produced a protocol that identified changes in EEG frequency and power in response to castration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacepromazine 3aanesthesia 3acastration 3aelectroencephalography 3ahalothane 3ahorses 3amules 3anormal values 3athiopental 0aDonkey 0aMule 0aPony 0aElectroencephalographic 0aNoxious1 aJohnson, Craig B.1 aDe Sa Lorena, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1298-947X1 aLuna, Stelio1 aHussni, Carlos A.1 aWhay, Helen R.1 aMurrell, Joanna C.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.955-962dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009500167520163600262592002801898650000801926650001201934650000901946650001601955650002401971650001901995650001002014650002202024650001102046650002402057650001502081651001002096653001702106653002802123653002402151653001002175653001402185700001802199700001802217700001302235700001802248773010702266856008702373852000902460655001202469IND60775588020221121180002.0220509e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077558802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1191262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Aili10aImpact of synoptic climate system interaction on surface ozone in China during 1950–2014  aThe effects of meteorological conditions controlled by specific synoptic patterns on regional surface ozone episodes have been widely discussed. However, the impacts of synoptic climate systems and their interaction on long-term variation of ozone are less known. In this study, we use the daily meteorological data and hourly surface ozone concentrations in the summer of 1950–2014 from CMIP6 to investigate the relationship between ozone variations and synoptic climate types (SCTs). Eight SCTs are identified by an objective circulation classification method of an R package called synoptReg. Our results show that the mainland of China is controlled by the low-pressure system for SCT1–5, while dominated by Siberian high for SCT6–8. During SCT1–5 days, the interactions of Asian continental low, Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), warm ridge at 700 hPa, high-level shallow Asian trough, westerly belt, and topography lead to high surface temperature, low relative humidity, and poor diffusion over Northern China with frequent ozone exceedance days. However, the low-level ozone concentrations over Northern China are shown under SCT6–8, affected by the weakened Asian continental low, enhanced Siberian high, stronger WPSH, and denser westerly belt. While over Southern China, ozone concentrations are higher for SCT6–8 than SCT1–5, due to the significantly reduced cloud and precipitation affected by the delivery of cold dry air mass from high latitudes to the South. The interdecadal variabilities of ozone during all SCTs may be controlled by the large-scale climate system of the East Asian monsoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aclimate 3acold 3aenvironment 3ameteorological data 3amonsoon season 3aozone 3arelative humidity 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3atopography 3aChina 0aSummer ozone 0aSynoptic climate system 0aLong-term variation 0aCMIP6 0asynoptReg1 aYan, Yingying1 aKong, Shaofei1 aMa, Jing1 aTong, Zhixuan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 June 15, v. 279 p.119126-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1191263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168300001600255520104600271592002801317650002901345650001601374650001301390650002601403650002001429650001101449650002401460650002101484650001301505653003701518653001001555653001001565700002301575700001801598773012701616856008301743852000901826655001201835IND60542663420221119230527.0190405e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGołda, Ryszard10aAnalysis of Circulating Immune Complexes in the Serum of Clinically Healthy Horses  ap. 963-966.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the level of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in equine serum and the electrophoretic properties of the protein fraction thereof. The study was carried out using 42 clinically healthy breeding horses of noble half-blood. The average extinction value of CIC's in equine serum was E450 nm = 0.278 ± 0.09 nm. Generally, 23 protein fractions were identified in the molecular mass range between 294 and 25 kDa. Eight fractions whose molecular masses were 137, 72, 65, 52, 42, 32, 28, and 26 kDa, respectively, appeared in all analyzed samples. In 20 of the analyzed serum an additional nine protein fractions whose molecular masses were 260, 110, 84, 78, 67, 62, 57, 45, and 39 kDa, respectively, were identified. Circulating immune complexes are a source of information about immunologic processes that take place in mammals. Determining the average values of CIC levels and identifying the electrophoretic profile of proteins in clinically healthy horses could be useful in research and diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen-antibody complex 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrophoresis 3ahorses 3ainformation sources 3amolecular weight 3aproteins 0aCirculating immune complex (CIC) 0aSerum 0aHorse1 aKrumrych, Wiesław1 aDanek, Janusz0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.963-966dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002700190245012800217300001800345506007600363520191200439592002802351506003702379650001202416650001902428650001702447650001102464650002502475650001102500650002302511650004302534650000702577650001302584650001702597650002302614700002302637700002402660700002202684700002102706773010302727856008502830852000902915655001202924IND60532237120221207073608.0160804e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053223712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.5b005072doi7 aPMC57336972pmcid7 a269535032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkeby, Katrine

During this process, the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells are damaged; however, the underlying mechanism of this mode of cytotoxicity remains elusive. It is known that anionic lipids accelerate amyloid fibril formation, implicating the importance of the cellular membrane in the process, and that a pH close to the level in the β-cell secretory granules (pH 5.5) inhibits amyloid fibril formation. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the membrane-associated monomer state of α-helical hIAPP, analyzed specific interactions of hIAPP with a mixed anionic–zwitterionic lipid membrane and examined the influence of pH on the structure and dynamics of hIAPP and its interaction with the membrane. We find that hIAPP primarily interacts with the membrane by forming favorable interactions between anionic lipids and the positively charged residues in the N-terminal part of the peptide. Rationalizing experimental findings, the simulations show that the N-terminal part of the peptide interacts with the membrane in the lipid headgroup region. At neutral pH, the C-terminal part of the peptide, which contains the residues that initiate fibril formation, displays a highly dynamic, unfolded state, which interacts with the membrane significantly less than the N-terminal part. Such an unfolded form can be proposed to contribute to the acceleration of fibril formation. At low pH, protonation of His18 mediates a stronger interaction of the C-terminal part with the membrane, resulting in the immobilization of the C-terminal part on the membrane surface that might constitute a mechanism by which low pH inhibits fibril formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamyloid 3acell membranes 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3aislets of Langerhans 3alipids 3amolecular dynamics 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apH 3apatients 3apolypeptides 3asecretory granules1 aAndersen, Ole Juul1 aPogorelov, Taras V.1 aTajkhorshid, Emad1 aSchiøtt, Birgit0 tBiochemistry.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 55, no. 13 p.2031-2042dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b005073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009000155300001600245500002000261520182700281592002802108650000802136650002702144650003102171650001302202650002902215650002302244650001202267650002502279650001802304650001302322650001902335650001002354650001302364650002002377650001702397700001502414700001502429700001602444700001502460773011502475856007302590852000902663655001202672IND60548389720221119214953.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054838972DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.132042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiecuch, A.10aBiofilm prevention by dicephalic cationic surfactants and their interactions with DNA  ap. 682-692.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: The studies were aimed to contribute to the elucidation of the relationships between structure of the double‐headed cationic surfactants‐N,N‐bis[3,3′‐(dimethylamine)‐ propyl]alkylamide dihydrochlorides and N,N‐bis[3,3′‐(trimethylammonio)propyl]alkylamide dibromides (alkyl: n‐C₉H₁₉, n‐C₁₁H₂₃, n‐C₁₃H₂₇, n‐C₁₅H₃₁) and their antibacterial and biofilm preventing activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of dicephalic surfactants against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested using standard methods. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to studied compounds but MBC values against Staph. epidermidis reached 0·48–0·01 mmol l⁻¹. The influence of dicephalic surfactants on bacterial biofilm and adhesion to the various surfaces was investigated with crystal violet staining or colony counting. The reduction in bacterial adhesion was observed, especially in the case of glass and stainless steel. The condensation of the DNA was shown in the ethidium bromide intercalation assay. CONCLUSIONS: Dicephalic surfactants exhibited antibacterial activity against Staph. epidermidis. The activity of studied compounds depended on the hydrocarbon chain length and the counterion. Surfactants deposited on different materials reduced Staph. epidermidis adhesion, dependently on the surfactant structure and the substratum. Dicephalic surfactants showed the ability of DNA compaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study points the possibility of application of dicephalic surfactants as the surface‐coating agents to prevent biofilm formation. These compounds efficiently condensed DNA and are potential candidates for further studies towards the transfection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aadhesion 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3acationic surfactants 3adimethylamine 3aethidium 3agentian violet 3aglass 3astaining 3astainless steel 3atransfection1 aLamch, Ł.1 aPaluch, E.1 aObłąk, E.1 aWilk, K.A.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.682-692dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001800183245010700201506007600308520080700384592002801191506003701219650001901256650001201275650002001287650001901307650004201326650000901368650002701377650001001404650001601414650001601430650001501446650001601461651001001477653002301487653001501510653002601525653003501551653001701586653003001603700002301633700001901656700002201675773010801697856007801805852000901883655001201892IND60124949120221207070719.0151031e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012494912DNAL7 a10.3732/apps.14000452doi7 aPMC41626682pmcid7 a252256302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMochizuki, Ko10aIsolation and Characterization of 11 Microsatellite Markers for Glochidion acuminatum (Phyllanthaceae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPremise of the study: Microsatellite markers were developed for Glochidion acuminatum (Phyllanthaceae) to investigate pollen dispersal distances and thereby to assess the effectiveness of specialized Epicephala moths as pollinators.

The study of trends and sensitivities of bed hyporheic exchanges to the various influencing factors is of great significance. The surface&minus;groundwater flow process was simulated using a multiphysics computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and compared to previous flume experiments. Based on that, the single-factor effects of flow velocity (u), water depth (H), dune wave height (h), and bed substrate permeability (&kappa;) on hyporheic exchange in the bed hyporheic zone were investigated. The sensitivity analysis of various factors (H, u, dune wavelength (L), h, bed substrate porosity (&theta;), &kappa;, and the diffusion coefficient of solute molecules (D<inf>m</inf>)) in the surface&minus;subsurface water coupling model was done using orthogonal tests. The results indicated that u, h, and &kappa; were positively related, whereas H was negatively related to hyporheic exchange. H and u showed large effects, whereas &kappa;, D<inf>m</inf>, and &theta; had moderate effects, and L and h showed small effects on hyporheic exchange.

When whole leaves of tobacco cv. Samsun NN were damaged with liquid nitrogen, the ethylene formation was the highest, if 100Â % of leaves were injured and were kept in the light, the lowest when leaves after 100Â % injury were kept in darkness. Ethane production (lipid peroxidation) could be detected only in damaged, but not in control leaves, and was much higher in light than in darkness. In addition, there was a strong degradation of chlorophyll of damaged leaves kept in light. In light aminoethoxy-vinylglycine (AVG) inhibited ethylene formation in control, non-damaged whole leaves effectively, but in leaves with 100Â % damage the inhibitory effect was much weaker and similar to the effect of propyl gallate (PG), a free radical scavenger. Both AVG and PG treatments decreased ethylene formation by control leaf discs and discs with 100Â % damage. Ethane production was significantly inhibited by PG and slightly by AVG in the case of 100Â % damage. Tiron, another free radical scavenger gave similar results on leaf discs as PG did. Paraquat (methylviologen, Pq), as a photosynthesis inhibiting and reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing herbicide produced a large amount of ethylene and ethane in light but very small amount in darkness. In accordance, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection on the necrotic host resulted in significantly larger amount of ethylene and ethane formation in light than in darkness. We conclude that ethylene and ethane production of damaged plant tissues is strongly induced by light and ROS that are involved in this induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aethane 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afree radical scavengers 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aplant tissues 3apropyl gallate 3areactive oxygen species 3atobacco1 aPogÃ¡ny, M.1 aKoehl, J.1 aHeiser, I.1 aElstner, E.

Walp.) production. Results indicated that in the Ouémé valley Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. and Aphis craccivora Koch are specific concerns. Weeds such as Justicia anselliana (Nees) T. Anders, Ipomoea aquatica Forsskal and Commelina erecta L. were also reported as being troublesome. On the Ouémé plateau Imperata cylindrica L. Beauv. was reported to be a major weed. Callosobruchus maculatus Fab. and Bruchidius atrolineatus Fab. may cause up to 100% loss within a few months in storage. Birds and rodents were also reported. In certain areas on the plateau, farmers have developed pest control methods based on indigenous knowledge. In the valley the population density of Eichhornia crassipes (Mart) Solms. during flooding is used by farmers to predict aphid infestation. A number of plant species used to protect cowpea were reported. In Gbékandji village, natural enemies such as Rhabdepyris sp., Evania sp., and Chelonus sp., were observed. They were rare in the valley, where farmers rely on chemical control. Farmers reported alternative hosts of cowpea pests from the families Fabaceae (eight species), Mimosaceae (two species), Ceasalpiniaceae (five species), Capparidaceae (two species) and Pontederiaceae (one species). Based on the hierarchy of constraints, sustainable integrated pest management technologies are being developed with farmers using a participatory approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis craccivora 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aBruchidius atrolineatus 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aChelonus 3aCommelina 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aImperata cylindrica 3aIpomoea aquatica 3aJusticia 3aRhabdepyris 3aSclerotium (genus) 3aVigna unguiculata 3aalternative hosts 3abirds 3achemical control 3acowpeas 3acrop production 3afarmers 3aindigenous knowledge 3aindigenous species 3aintegrated pest management 3anatural enemies 3aplant protection 3apopulation density 3arodents 3asurveys 3avillages 3aweeds 3aBenin1 aGbèhounou, Gualbert,1 aAhanchédé, Adam1 aAhohuendo, Bonaventure1 aBouraïma, Yacouba1 aHuis, Arnold van,0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2001 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.123-132dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000201783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014300168300001400311520212000325592002802445650001202473650002002485650002302505650001302528650001402541650001302555650003102568650001302599650001002612650001002622650001402632650001402646650001602660650001002676650001102686653001402697653001502711653002002726653001302746653002502759653002502784653001602809700002302825700002202848700001802870773012202888856008303010852000903093655001203102IND60566341420221120135810.0190318e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056634142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalko, Radek14aThe effect of increased habitat complexity and density-dependent non-consumptive interference on pest suppression by winter-active spiders  ap. 26-33.  aArtificially increased habitat complexity can improve the biocontrol service provided by generalist predators as it can reduce intraguild predation (IGP). However, several counteracting mechanisms can buffer the effect of reduced IGP. Here, we investigated whether the cardboard bands installed in pear trees in early winter improve the suppression of the serious pest pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyri) by winter-active spiders (Anyphaena accentuata and Philodromus spp.). We also investigated in laboratory experiments whether the increased abundances of some predators (Philodromus sp.) would result in negative or positive predator-predator interactions and whether the type and/or intensity of interaction is temperature dependent. On average, pear trees with cardboard bands hosted less psylla than control trees. This pattern can be attributed to predation by winter-active spiders, as 45% of individuals were psylla positive using molecular gut-content analysis. However, 58% of Anyphaena spiders were also Philodromus positive. The suppression efficiency for psylla increased asymptotically with the increasing density of winter-active spiders. In the laboratory, the per capita capture rate of philodromids decreased with the density of conspecifics, which translated in an asymptotic increase in predation pressure on the pear psylla. Non-consumptive intra-trophic-level interference was more intense at 12°C than at 7°C. The results show that artificially increasing habitat complexity by installing corrugated cardboard bands around the trunks and branches of pear trees increased predation pressure on the pear psylla as it most likely reduced IGP among winter-active spiders. However, increased intra-trophic-level interference due to increased abundances of spiders reduced their per capita capture rate and caused only an asymptotic increase in the overall predation pressure on the pest. The installation of corrugated cardboard bands around trees could represent an environmentally-friendly management practice in fruit orchards that improves the biocontrol service provided by generalist predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aCacopsylla pyri 3abiological control 3abranches 3acardboard 3ahabitats 3alaboratory experimentation 3aorchards 3apears 3apests 3apredation 3apredators 3atemperature 3atrees 3awinter 0aAnyphaena 0aBiocontrol 0aCacopsylla pyri 0aFood web 0aGut-content analysis 0aIntraguild predation 0aPhilodromus1 aPetráková, Lenka1 aSentenská, Lenka1 aPekár, Stano0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 May 01, v. 242 p.26-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245020900159300001600368520116100384592002801545596007401573596005701647596010201704596008201806650001601888650001301904650001401917650002001931650004601951650001101997650001402008650001702022650001602039650001002055650004302065650002102108650002002129650001602149700001802165700001502183700001202198700001802210700005902228773013602287856007902423852000902502655001202511IND60673263720221120192818.0191018e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067326372DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmy0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ying10aValidation of a rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry method for simultaneous analysis of 15 key chemicals in slimming foods and herbal products  ap. 912-919.  aA rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for simultaneous analysis of 15 key chemicals in slimming foods and herbal products. These chemicals were strictly restricted adulterants (phenolphthalein, sibutramine, fenfluramine, clopamide, ephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, caffeine and phenformin) and physiologically relevant active components (l-carnitine, nuciferine, aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion). In multi-day validations, intra- (n = 5) and inter-day precision (n = 3), limits of detection and limits of quantification for all analytes were 0.60–7.22%, 0.75–9.45%, 0.09–10 μg/L and 0.30–33.3 μg/L, respectively. Mean recovery ranged from 71.4% to 116% for all analytes in three representative samples. The method was validated on 17 samples including 12 kinds of slimming foods and five kinds of herbal products, and was shown to be ideal for routine quantification of 15 key chemicals in slimming foods and herbal products, providing an efficient strategy for quality control and food safety evaluation of weight reducing supplements.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-HM01–00078-SFcDepartment of Science and Technology of Chengdu  cSichuan University Talent Introduction Start-up Fund  cPublic Health and Preventive Medicine Provincial Experiment Teaching Center at Sichuan University  cFood Safety Monitoring and Risk Assessment Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province 3aadulterants 3acaffeine 3acarnitine 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aemodin 3aephedrine 3afenfluramine 3afood safety 3afoods 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphenolphthaleins 3aquality control 3aweight loss1 aZhong, Yanqin1 aSun, Aimin1 aGao, Bo1 aSun, Chengjun1 aXiong, Jingyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9354-862X0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 56, no. 10 p.912-919dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmy0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245013000152300001600282500002000298520170900318592002802027650002702055650002402082650001602106650002602122650000902148650001602157650001402173650001702187650002502204650001002229650002202239650001602261700001502277700002002292773011502312856007302427852000902500655001202509IND60548390120221119214622.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054839012DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.131982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Y.10aEffect of temperature (5–25°C) on epiphytic lactic acid bacteria populations and fermentation of whole‐plant corn silage  ap. 657-671.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature (5–25°C) on epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) populations during 60 days of fermentation of whole‐plant corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vacuum bag mini‐silos of chopped whole‐plant corn were incubated at five different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25°C), according to a completely randomized design with four repetitions. The silos were opened and sampled on day 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 28 and 60. At 20 and 25°C, Lactobacillus plantarum‐ and Pediococcus pentosaceus‐related operational taxonomic units (OTU) dominated the fermentation within 1 day. After 7 days, the OTU related to the heterofermentative species Lactobacillus buchneri began to appear and it eventually dominated silages incubated at these temperatures. Population dynamic of LAB at 5 and 10°C was different. At these temperatures, Leuconostoc citreum OTU was identified at the beginning of the fermentation. Thereafter, Lactobacillus sakei‐ and Lactobacillus curvatus‐related OTU appeared and quickly prevailed. Corn silage at 15°C acted as a transition between 20–25°C and 5–10°C, in terms of LAB diversity and succession. CONCLUSION: The conditions of silage incubation temperature affect species diversity of LAB population with notable difference along the temperature gradient. Colder temperature conditions (5 and 10°C) have led to the identification of LAB species never observed in corn silage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated the impact of temperature gradient on the diversity and some important population shift of lactic acid bacteria communities during fermentation of corn silage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus buchneri 3aLeuconostoc citreum 3aPediococcus 3abacterial communities 3acorn 3acorn silage 3aepiphytes 3afermentation 3alactic acid bacteria 3asilos 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature1 aDrouin, P.1 aLafrenière, C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.657-671dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.131983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006200168300001800230520154200248592002801790650002001818650001701838650002801855650002501883650001901908650002801927650002001955650001601975650001901991700002102010700002102031773010302052856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60532237620161013000000.0160728e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053223762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.5b013362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGelman, Hannah10aReAsH as a Quantitative Probe of In-Cell Protein Dynamics  ap. 1968-1976.  aThe tetracysteine (tc) tag/biarsenical dye system (FlAsH or ReAsH) promises to combine the flexibility of fluorescent protein tags with the small size of dye labels, allowing in-cell study of target proteins that are perturbed by large protein tags. Quantitative thermodynamic and kinetic studies in-cell using FlAsH and ReAsH have been hampered by methodological complexities presented by the fluorescence properties of the tag–dye complex probed by either Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or direct excitation. We label the model protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) with AcGFP1 and ReAsH for direct comparison with AcGFP1/mCherry-labeled PGK. We find that fast relaxation imaging (FReI), combining millisecond temperature jump kinetics with fluorescence microscopy detection, circumvents many of the difficulties encountered working with the ReAsH system, allowing us to obtain quantitative FRET measurements of protein stability and kinetics both in vitro and in cells. We also demonstrate the to us surprising result that fluorescence from directly excited, unburied ReAsH at the C-terminus of the model protein also reports on folding in vitro and in cells. Comparing the ReAsH-labeled protein to a construct labeled with two fluorescent protein tags allows us to evaluate how a bulkier protein tag affects protein dynamics in cells and in vitro. We find that the average folding rate in the cell is closer to the in vitro rate with the smaller tag, highlighting the effect of tags on quantitative in-cell measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent proteins 3aimage analysis 3aphosphoglycerate kinase 3aprotein tagging 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aWirth, Anna Jean1 aGruebele, Martin0 tBiochemistry.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 55, no. 13 p.1968-1976dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b013363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012900167300001600296520113600312592002801448650001101476650002401487650002101511650001501532650001201547650001501559650002401574650001301598650001001611650001801621650002301639650001501662651001001677700001701687700002401704773016101728856008101889852000901970655001201979IND60685888820221121035710.0200311e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068588882DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000201662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdegwa, Paul N.10aHabitat Preferences and Activity Patterns of Glossina Swynnertoni Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae) in Aitong, Masai Mara, Kenya  ap. 113-122.  aThe habitat preferences and activity patterns of Glossina swynnertoni Austen were studied using Siamese traps, electrified screens and vehicle patrols in Aitong, southwestern Kenya in three habitats: large thicket, wooded grassland and an Acacia community. Except in the Acacia community, G. swynnertoni occurred in association with Glossina pallidipes Austen. Apparent density varied significantly among the three habitats, being highest in the Acacia community, intermediate in wooded grassland and lowest in large thickets. Density also varied seasonally, with higher densities occurring in the rainy season than in the dry season in all three areas. Vehicle patrol was a more effective and rapid method for sampling G. swynnertoni than either Siamese traps or electrified screens. However, vehicle patrol catches were strongly biased in favour of males (4:1). Diurnal activity in the Acacia community was unimodal for both sexes, with peaks of activity occurring at 1100–1200 h for males and at 1400–1500 h for females. Both sexes remained active in the afternoon but activity declined rapidly towards dusk (1700–1800 h).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aGlossina pallidipes 3adiurnal activity 3adry season 3afemales 3agrasslands 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3amales 3arapid methods 3aseasonal variation 3awet season 3aKenya1 aMihok, Steve1 aOyieke, Florence A.0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2001 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.113-122dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000201663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003600148245012100184300001600305520123100321592002801552650001901580650001801599650001001617650001401627650000901641650002801650650001001678650001801688650001901706650002101725650000901746650002501755650004401780700002501824700002901849700002201878700002201900700002901922700001901951773011101970856008402081852000902165655001202174IND4459218320221121025451.0141112e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445921832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2011.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Menezes, Charlene Cavalheiro10aOxidative parameters of Rhamdia quelen in response to commercial herbicide containing clomazone and recovery pattern  ap. 145-150.  aIn this study, fish Rhamdia quelen, were exposed to different concentrations of herbicide clomazone: 0.0 (control), 0.45 and 0.91mgLâ»Â¹. After exposure for 8days to herbicide, fish were transferred to clean water for a recovery period (8days). Oxidative stress indicators such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels and protein carbonyl content, as well as antioxidant defenses, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), ascorbic acid and non-protein thiols levels were studied, using the liver, brain and muscle tissues. Herbicide exposure increased TBARS in muscle and in liver at higher concentration. In liver protein carbonylation increased and catalase activity did not change in fish exposed to herbicide. SOD enhanced in liver at concentration of 0.91mgLâ»Â¹. GST, ascorbic acid and non-protein thiols levels increase at both concentrations. At the end of the recovery period the most of the parameters recovered whereas GST and ascorbic acid remain elevated.

The exopolysaccharide (EPS) from an anamorph of Cordyceps sinensis was found to have antitumor immunomodulatory activity. Mature dendritic cells play a role in initiating antitumor immunity, so we try to investigate the effects of EPS on the murine dendritic cell line DCS. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to assay the expression levels of cell surface molecules including major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 of DCS cells and their ability to take up antigens. The ability of DCS cells to activate the proliferation of CTLL-2 T cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. IL-12 and TNF-α levels were detected using ELISA. Western blotting was performed to estimate the levels of phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and p105. RESULTS: EPS increased the expressions of MHC-II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 of DCS cells and up-regulated their ability to take up antigens. EPS also enhanced their ability to activate the proliferation of CTLL-2 T cells. IL-12 and TNF-α secreted from DCS cells were up-regulated after EPS treatment. Furthermore, EPS significantly caused the decline of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, significantly increased levels of NF-κB p65 in the nucleus and decreased levels of NF-κB p105 in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: EPS may induce DCS cells to exhibit mature characteristics, and the mechanism involved is probably related to the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway and promotion of the NF-κB signal pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps 3aT-lymphocytes 3aWestern blotting 3aantigens 3abromides 3acell proliferation 3acytoplasm 3adendritic cells 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3afoods 3aherbal medicines 3aimmunity 3aimmunomodulators 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3aphosphorylase kinase 3asarcoma 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aCD40 Antigensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aB7-1 Antigenxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aB7-2 Antigenxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCordycepsxmetabolism 2aDendritic Cellsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aImmunologic Factorsxpharmacology 2aImmunomodulation 2aInterleukin-12xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aJanus Kinase 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgenetics 2aMice 2aNF-kappa Bxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aPolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aSTAT3 Transcription Factorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aT-Lymphocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 3aChina1 aHe, Zhenyue1 aWang, Chenhao1 aYuan, Fengjiao1 aDong, Ping1 aZhang, Weiyun0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2013 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.687-694dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-012-0373-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010400174300001800278520135200296592002801648650000801676650003201684650001501716650002101731650001601752650002701768700002401795700002201819700002101841700002301862700003301885773010301918856008502021852000902106655001202115IND60532237920221119062622.0160728e20160405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053223792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.6b000552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyaghire, Stanley
N.10aRNA G-Quadruplex Invasion and Translation Inhibition by Antisense γ-Peptide Nucleic Acid Oligomers  ap. 1977-1988.  aWe have examined the abilities of three complementary γ-peptide nucleic acid (γPNA) oligomers to invade an RNA G-quadruplex and potently inhibit translation of a luciferase reporter transcript containing the quadruplex-forming sequence (QFS) within its 5′-untranslated region. All three γPNA oligomers bind with low nanomolar affinities to an RNA oligonucleotide containing the QFS. However, while all probes inhibit translation with low to midnanomolar IC₅₀ values, the γPNA designed to hybridize to the first two G-tracts of the QFS and adjacent 5′-overhanging nucleotides was 5–6 times more potent than probes directed to either the 3′-end or internal regions of the target at 37 °C. This position-dependent effect was eliminated after the probes and target were preincubated at an elevated temperature prior to translation, demonstrating that kinetic effects exert significant control over quadruplex invasion and translation inhibition. We also found that antisense γPNAs exhibited similarly potent effects against luciferase reporter transcripts bearing QFS motifs having G₂, G₃, or G₄ tracts. Finally, our results indicate that γPNA oligomers exhibit selectivity and/or potency higher than those of other antisense molecules such as standard PNA and 2′-OMe RNA previously reported to target G-quadruplexes in RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aluciferase 3aoligonucleotides 3atemperature 3atranslation (genetics)1 aCherubim, Collin J.1 aTelmer, Cheryl A.1 aMartinez, Joe A.1 aBruchez, Marcel P.1 aArmitage, B.

Its distinct properties, such as debittering activity, aminolysis reaction and salt tolerance, make it find wide applications in food, nutraceutical, medical diagnosis and other fields. However, the insufficient stability and low yield of currently known PAPs limit their widespread applications. Therefore, there is a continuing demand to obtain PAPs with sufficient stabilities and high expression levels by protein engineering and development of novel fermentation strategies, respectively. In this review, PAPs ever reported are reclassified by phylogenetic analysis and MEROPS classification system. Current developments on their biochemical properties, sequence and structural features, protein engineering, high-level expression and industrial applications are also discussed. Finally, future research perspectives which could help broadening the applications of PAPs are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminolysis 3adebittering 3adietary supplements 3afermentation 3apeptides 3aphylogeny 3aproline 3aprolyl aminopeptidase 3asalt tolerance 3aserine 3ataxonomic revisions 0aProlyl aminopeptidase 0aReclassification 0aBiochemical properties 0aSequence and structural features 0aProduction 0aIndustrial applications1 aYang, Shuangshuang1 aZhang, Zhengtian1 aTang, Cunduo1 aKan, Yunchao1 aYao, Lunguang0 tProcess biochemistry.g2022 July, v. 118 p.121-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2022.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003600117024003900153040001800192100002100210245007500231300001600306506007600322506003100398506002800429506003600457520131100493592002801804596001101832596000901843506003701852650000901889650001201898650001501910650001301925650001101938650001101949650002501960650001801985650001602003700002002019773012502039856008202164961000902246852000902255655001202264IND60731887320221215142337.0220901e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073188732DNAL7 a10113/73188732hdl7 a10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.08.0232doi7 a10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.08.0232chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng , Lingfeng10aToo conservative to hedge: How much does a corn ethanol facility lose?  ap. 654-662.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aWhile the process of producing ethanol from corn has been well established for over a decade, the process profitability still eludes the industry investors. In particular, uncertainties exist in both the feedstock and the product spot prices. To manage the sophisticated price uncertainty, current practice in industry is to negotiate long-term fixed rate prices with both the suppliers of the feedstock and the purchasers of the product. Although this practice completely eliminates the price uncertainty and simplifies production decisions, it entails the potential loss of profit. Stochastic programming methods provide a framework which takes into account the uncertainties and determines the decisions that are optimal under this uncertain future. Therefore, in this study, a stochastic optimization model is presented to determine the weekly production level and swap hedging portfolios over a year's planning horizon with the objective of maximizing the process profit. The approach is also used in a back-testing perspective to compare the profit obtained from applying the optimal decisions with the negotiated profit derived from using the current practice. This comparison in turn validates the effectiveness of the proposed model framework, in particular during times of high price uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data  cCSREES  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorn 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3aindustry 3amodels 3aprices 3aproduction economics 3aprofitability 3auncertainty1 aAnderson , C.L.0 tInternational Journal of Production Economics.g2017 Nov., v. 193 p.654-662dElsevier BVwJournal:11939x0925-52737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011700166500001400283520171500297592002802012650001302040650001202053650000902065650002102074650001002095650002302105650001602128650001602144650002102160650001102181650001602192650001302208650001602221650001302237650002902250650001002279650001702289700002302306700003202329700002002361773012302381856008002504852000902584655001202593IND60718813520221120044148.0201126e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881352DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101116712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, Taylor 10aDifferentiating between Nitrogen and Water Deficiency in Irrigated Maize Using a UAV-Based Multi-Spectral Camera  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this research was to determine if canopy reflectance measured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a 5-band multi-spectral camera can differentiate between water and nitrogen (N) deficiency in irrigated maize. Crop reflectance was used to generate a Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE), Green Leaf Index (GLI), and a Blue Reflectance Index (BRI). These indices were then used in combination to categorize N and water stressed experimental units into a Combined Index (CI) indicating water-stressed, N-stressed, or non-stressed crops. The CI generated at blister (R2) successfully identified 90% of experimental treatments to the correct group but only identified 60% of treatments when generated at the 14th leaf stage (V14). The CI methodology was subsequently applied to two independent site-years where only N deficiency gradients were imposed. The CI was not successful at separating treatments at the validation sites, incorrectly identifying water stress where there was none. Among individual indices investigated, NDRE had the strongest relationship to grain yields (r² = 0.62, p < 0.001) but a weaker linear relationship compared to the CI (r² = 0.68, p < 0.005) where deficit irrigation treatments were imposed. At sites where irrigation was sufficient to meet crop water demand, NDRE (r² = 0.63, p < 0.05) had a stronger relationship to grain yield compared to the CI (r² = 0.41, p = 0.31). This study found that, under narrow cropping system circumstances, N and irrigation-induced differences in maize productivity can be differentiated in-season by a combination of reflectance indices, but that NDRE alone provides superior information under broader contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acameras 3acorn 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adeficit irrigation 3agrain yield 3ainformation 3aleaf reflectance 3aleaves 3amethodology 3anitrogen 3areflectance 3aresearch 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awater 3awater stress1 aNelsen, Taylor  S.1 aLeinfelder-Miles, Michelle 1 aLundy, Mark  E.0 tAgronomy.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101116713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245016000169520102900329592002801358650002801386650001201414650002801426653001501454653003701469653001501506653002901521653001401550700001501564700001701579700002201596700001801618773009101636856009001727852000901817655001201826IND60775589120221123043754.0220531e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077558912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1069522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimon, J.10aDesign and numerical modelling strategy to form Tailored Fibre Placement preforms: Application to the tetrahedral part with orthotropic final configuration  aTailored Fibre Placement (TFP) allows manufacturing net shape preforms with continuously varying orientations and thickness. This additive technology, combined with forming, enables the design of fibre reinforced composite parts with optimized fibre orientations. A new modelling strategy to simulate the forming of thin dry TFP preform without backing material is proposed. The finite element model is based on an embedded element formulation, which assumes the stitching yarn to act as a bond between fibre tows of adjacent layers. Fibre tows are modelled with 2-node beam elements having independent generalized stress stiffnesses. The forming of a tetrahedral shape with orthotropic final configuration is addressed both experimentally and numerically to validate the proposed approach. The tetrahedral shape has a direct industrial application since it corresponds to corner brackets. This study also demonstrates the ability to improve the mechanical properties of engineered part using the hybrid TFP-forming process.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3ahybrids 3aindustrial applications 0aA.

The region has an arid to semiarid climate with low precipitation and high potential evaporation, and thus, groundwater recharge processes remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate recharge mechanisms and soil water movement in the Loess Plateau aquifer and to assess the recharge to shallow loess aquifers using soil profiles. In general, we found that the δ18O and δ2H values of soil water varied both with season and with soil profile depth. The seasonal stable isotopic values in the soil profiles also differed between wet and dry years. In particular, soil water and groundwater isotopic values responded to precipitation. This response suggests that seasonal precipitation is the main source of recharge to soil water and groundwater and that soil water is involved in groundwater recharge. The precipitation infiltration, soil water replenishment, and groundwater recharge are complicated processes. Two main modes of infiltration allow water to move downward through the unsaturated zone and recharge groundwater can be concluded. The primary mode is preferential infiltration through microtopographic features. This channel-like infiltration can rapidly move precipitation downward to deep soil layers, greatly reducing evaporation even under the arid to semiarid conditions of the study area. The secondary mode is a combination of matrix flow, which includes inside preferential infiltration though finger-like flow in the upper layer and piston-like flow in the deeper layer. The upper finger-like flow can cause rapid infiltration to below the root zone during less intense rain or snowmelt. The annual precipitation through preferential flow is the dominant recharge mode for the shallow groundwater in the loess aquifers. These two modes of recharge maintain perennial groundwater in the arid to semiarid hill and gully regions of the Loess Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahills 3aloess 3aoxygen 3apreferential flow 3arain 3arhizosphere 3asemiarid zones 3asnowmelt 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water movement 3astable isotopes 3aChina 0aSoil water 0aGroundwater 0aStable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen 0aRecharge 0aHill and gully regions 0aLoess Plateau1 aLiu, Zihao1 aRao, Wenbo1 aWei, Haizhen1 aZhang, Yudong1 aJin, Ben0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 June 01, v. 243 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008600171300001600257500001500273520195300288592002802241650001602269650001702285650002402302650001702326650002102343650001302364650001602377650001402393650001402407650001102421650001002432650001302442650002002455650001902475650001902494650002302513650001102536651001802547651002402565653001402589700002602603773009802629856004802727852000902775655001202784IND4468424520221120084338.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446842452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-011-0374-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeagraves, Michael P.10aEffects of neonicitinoid seed treatments on soybean aphid and its natural enemies  ap. 125-132.  a2019-12-05  aInsecticidal seed treatments are increasingly being applied to soybeans in North America, and several recent studies question what they add to current pest management. Here, we examine the effects of two neonicotinoid insecticidal seed treatments on insect populations (pest and natural enemies) in SD soybeans over 2Â years. Moreover, we conducted laboratory experiments to determine the duration that seed treatments remained effective against the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines, Hemiptera: Aphididae) and how thiamethoxam affected survival of one of the aphidâs predators, Orius insidiosus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) on soybean. Soybean aphids, thrips, and grasshopper populations were unaffected by the insecticidal seed treatments in the field. The laboratory trial revealed that all bioactivity of the seed treatments against soybean aphids was gone within 46Â days after planting, prior to aphid populations damaging the crop. Bean leaf beetles, a sporadic pest in our area, were reduced by the seed treatments. But, there were no yield benefits of insecticidal seed treatments over the 2Â years of the study at this location. Natural enemy communities were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam seed treatments relative to the untreated control, particularly populations of Nabis americoferus (Hemiptera: Nabidae). Chrysoperla (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) adults were reduced in the imidacloprid-treated plots. In the laboratory, rearing O. insidiosus on soybean plants treated with thiamethoxam resulted in higher mortality for both the nymphs and the adult stage. Offering the predator insect prey on the thiamethoxam-treated plants improved survival of the adult stage, but not the nymphal stage. This work confirms that insecticidal seed treatments offer little benefit to soybean producers of the Northern Great Plains and adds to the discussion by suggesting that generalist predators are adversely affected by the insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysoperla 3agrasshoppers 3aCerotoma trifurcata 3athiamethoxam 3aOrius insidiosus 3asoybeans 3acrop damage 3apredators 3amortality 3anymphs 3apests 3aplanting 3anatural enemies 3aseed treatment 3aAphis glycines 3aNabis americoferus 3aadults 3aNorth America 3aGreat Plains region 0aHemiptera1 aLundgren, Jonathan G.0 tJournal of pest science.g2012 Mar., v. 85, no. 1 p.125-132dSpringer-Verlagx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-011-0374-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017800169300001600347520098200363592002801345650001301373650001801386651001201404651002201416651001001438651001001448653002001458653001301478653001401491653002201505700002601527700005801553700002601611700002301637700002801660773010701688856008501795852000901880655001201889IND60611811020221117232450.0190628e20190510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlday, Alfonso10aPottery with ramiform-anthropomorphic decoration from El Portalón de Cueva Mayor site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos) and the globalized symbolic world of the first Neolithic  ap. 125-137.  aAt the Holocene site of El Portalón at the Cueva Mayor in the karstic system of the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain), located in the northern plateau of the Iberian Peninsula, we found a Neolithic ceramic fragment with a very unique iconography, linking the inhabitants of this zone to populations in the peninsular Mediterranean and to other sedentary populations in Italy and Germany, which is a novel finding. Accordingly, we reflect on the creation of Early Neolithic symbolism in Europe and its cross-border circulation. Throughout their development, ramiform-anthropomorphic representations have been multiplied in very diverse designs and mediums, a fact that allows us to also reflect on a ceramic vessel found in another gallery at the Cueva Mayor, the Galería del Sílex, which possesses the same type of iconography.

This study comprehensively investigated the time-varying linkages among dominant oceanic and atmospheric modes of the Pacific and Atlantic areas on different timescales using the scale space multiresolution correlation analysis. For the Pacific Ocean, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) shows closer matches with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) than with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This indicates that the ENSO dominates climate variability of the whole Pacific Ocean not only on interannual but also on interdecadal scales. Interdecadal variations of the IPO appear to be more closely linked to southern Pacific Ocean climate before ∼1940, but become more closely linked to northern Pacific Ocean after ∼1940. The shifts on interdecadal connections among northern, tropical and southern parts of the Pacific Oceans seems to be related to the phase shifts of the IPO/PDO, which may contribute to the cooling trend from 1940s to 1970s.

Generally, there was an increase in damage to cowpea (measured as damage to pods and seeds) with increasing in insect density. There was also a highly significant correlation between the number of infesting adult bugs and damage to pods and seeds, and a significant negative correlation between bug numbers and cowpea yield. The results suggest that control measures should be initiated at: 4 bugs (fourth instar and above) per 10 plants for R. dentipes and M. jaculus; 2 bugs per 10 plants for A. curvipes and 6 bugs per 10 plants for N. viridula at podding stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoplocnemis curvipes 3aNezara viridula 3aRiptortus dentipes 3aVigna unguiculata 3aadults 3acontrol methods 3acowpeas 3acrop losses 3acrop yield 3ainsect density 3ainstars 3apods 3apopulation growth 3aseeds1 aOdebiyi, J.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Yoghurt was administered to mice suffering chemically induced intestinal inflammation or colon carcinogenesis. It was shown that this novel yoghurt was able to prevent local inflammation in the intestines of mice through a regulation of the immune response, prevent macroscopic and histological damages, and prevent colon carcinogenesis through an anti‐inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The developed yoghurt showed in vivo anti‐inflammatory properties by modulation of the host immune response for the prevention of colon inflammation and carcinogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new yoghurt could thus be considered a probiotic food and be useful as a complement to current treatment protocols for inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer, a first since there are no current functional foods specifically oriented for these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acarcinogenesis 3acolitis 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afermentation 3afunctional foods 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alactic acid bacteria 3amice 3apatients 3aprobiotics 3ayogurt1 ade Moreno de LeBlanc, A.1 aLeBlanc, J.G.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.821-830dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100003100167245009000198300001600288520058300304592002800887653001500915653002500930653001300955653001200968653001100980653001100991653001701002653000901019653001101028700002101039700002601060773013501086856011501221852000901336655001201345IND60128489720221117184406.0151115e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012848972DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567(2007)80[205:MAOBIT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernáández, Edgar Javier10aMorphometric Analysis of Bees in the Trigona fulviventris Group (Hymenoptera: Apidae)  ap. 205-212.  aThis study provides a morphometric analysis of a new morphotype belonging to the subgenus Trigona s. str. collected in Colombia.

It is located in the cytoplasm. The purpose of this paper was to explore the structure and anti-cancer function of RPL22 of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The cDNA of RPL22 was cloned successfully from the Giant Panda using RT-PCR technology. We constructed a recombinant expression vector containing RPL22 cDNA and over-expressed it in Escherichia coli using pET28a plasmids. The expression product obtained was purified by using Ni chelating affinity chromatography. The result indicated that the length of the fragment cloned is 414 bp, and it contains an open-reading frame of 387 bp encoding 128 amino acids. Primary structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative RPL22 protein is 14.74 kDa with a theoretical pI 9.21. The RPL22 gene can be really expressed in E. coli and the RPL22 protein, fusioned with the N-terminally His-tagged protein, gave rise to the accumulation of an expected 20.1 kDa polypeptide. The data showed that the recombinant protein RPL22 had a time- and dose-dependency on the cell growth inhibition rate. The human laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells treated with 0.05–6 μg/ml of RPL22 for 24 h displayed significant cell growth inhibition (p < 0.05, n = 8) in assayed using MTT compared to the control (untreated) cells. The data indicate that the effect at low concentrations is better than high concentrations, and the concentration of 1.5 μg/ml has the best rate of growth inhibition of 47.70 %. The inhibitory rate in mice treated with 1.5 μg/ml RPL22 protein can reach 43.75 %. Histology of tumor organs shows that the tissues arranged looser in RPL22 group than those in control group. Meanwhile, there is no obvious damage to other organs, such as heart, lung and kidney. Further research is on going to determine the bioactive principle(s) of recombinant protein RPL22 responsible for its anticancer activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acids 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3acarcinoma 3acell growth 3acomplementary DNA 3acytoplasm 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aheart 3ahistology 3ahumans 3akidneys 3alarynx 3amice 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3apolypeptides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal proteins1 aHou, Yiling1 aDing, Xiang1 aHou, Wanru1 aSong, Bo1 aZeng, Yichun0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.3529-3539dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3217-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011800170300001600288520133100304592002801635650001601663650002801679650002001707650002201727650002101749650001601770650002601786650001001812650001101822650001801833650001201851650001201863650001801875650001001893650001001903650001801913650003201931650001401963650000901977650002301986653002502009653003102034653003302065653001902098653003102117700006102148700002202209700002202231773015102253856008602404852000902490655001202499IND60570514220221121120853.0190214e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUemura, Mizuki10aPredator–prey interaction between greenhead ants and processionary caterpillars is mediated by chemical defence  ap. 213-222.  aThe predatory greenhead ant, Rhytidoponera metallica, readily attacks some insects but not the processionary caterpillar, Ochrogaster lunifer. This urticarial lepidopteran larva is covered in long hairs and has numerous smaller, detachable barbed setae present on the third instar and older larvae. These setae are a health risk to humans and other mammals. In this study, we tested whether O. lunifer larvae are defended against invertebrate predators, using R. metallica as an example. Field experiments at R. metallica nests and laboratory olfactometer experiments were used to assess possible behavioural, morphological and chemical defence mechanisms. We found that a volatile chemical component from O. lunifer larvae inhibited attack/approach by R. metallica. This odour was associated with O. lunifer cuticular components: larval hairs, setae and exoskeleton. Behavioural defence was not found to inhibit R. metallica attack. Furthermore, despite the dense hairs and setae covering O. lunifer larvae, these did not act as a physical barrier to ant attack. Our study demonstrates the key role of chemical ecology in invertebrate interactions involving such hairy caterpillars. Future isolation of the deterrent chemical(s) produced by O. lunifer larvae may offer novel possibilities for managing ant behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aRhytidoponera metallica 3aanimal behavior 3achemical defenses 3achemical ecology 3aexoskeleton 3afield experimentation 3ahairs 3ahumans 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3ainstars 3ainvertebrates 3anests 3aodors 3aolfactometers 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3arisk 3avolatile compounds 0acaterpillar defences 0achemical defence mechanism 0apredator–prey interactions 0apredatory ants 0aprocessionary caterpillars1 aPerkins, Lynda E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2098-11121 aZalucki, Myron P.1 aCribb, Bronwen W.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 July, v. 129 p.213-222dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245017800187300001600365520085100381592002801232653002301260653002301283653001701306653002001323653002201343653001001365700001701375773013501392856011501527852000901642655001201651IND60128489820221117184348.0151115e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012848982DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567(2007)80[213:NBATNA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHannan, MdAbdul10aNesting Biology and the Nest Architecture of Lithurgus (Lithurgus) collaris Smith (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on Iriomote Island, Southwestern Subtropical Archipelago, Japan  ap. 213-222.  aThe nests of Lithurgus collaris were found in dead branches of Hibiscus tiliaceus (L.)

Thermal resistance of Salmonella can be reduced by increasing water activity, thus a soaking process was designed prior to RF treatments. A pilot-scale 27MHz, 6kW RF heating system was used to rapidly heat 1.7kg washed in-shell almonds with hot air heating at 55°C. To achieve appropriate heating rate, constant drying temperature and short time cooling, the RF treatment protocol was obtained using an electrode gap of 13cm for heating, 14cm for drying, and followed by forced room air cooling of 5-cm thick samples. The results showed that almond temperatures above 75°C at 23% moisture contents for 2–4min RF heating could meet the requirements to achieve 5-log reduction of Salmonella. The RF treatment process for 20min reduced the moisture content to 5.7% w.b. Peroxide value, fatty acids values and kernel colors of the RF treated almonds met good quality standard used by nut industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aacid value 3aair 3aalmonds 3acolor 3acontrol methods 3acooling 3adielectric heating 3adrying temperature 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3aheating systems 3aindustry 3apasteurization 3aperoxide value 3aproduct quality 3aradio waves 3aseeds 3awater activity 3awater content1 aTang, J.1 aVilla-Rojas, R.1 aWang, Y.1 aWang, S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2011 May, v. 104, no. 2 p.299-306dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165300001600306520130700322592002801629650002001657650001301677650001201690650001701702650001401719650000901733650000901742650001901751650002101770650001901791650001701810650001901827650001601846650002001862650001301882650001501895650002001910650001601930650001201946650002201958650002001980653002702000653001902027653002202046653002502068653002602093700002202119700002202141773012102163856008102284852000902365655001202374IND60549545220221118001210.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraça, Carla10aRheology changes in oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by a complex system of animal and vegetable proteins induced by thermal processing  ap. 263-270.  aMixtures of animal and vegetable proteins were used to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions of a meat rich filling. Collagen and pea protein, combined in different proportions for a total protein of 9 g/100 g were used to prepare oil-water emulsions, to develop a new meat product. Texture and rheological parameters were measured to evaluate the behavior of the emulsions. Temperature sweeps from 20 to 90 °C and back (0.5 K/min) were applied and the impact on emulsions structure was monitored, in the rheometer, through the changes on the viscoelastic properties. All the mixtures studied exhibited a shear-thinning flow behavior and showed different viscoelastic properties. The tested systems, exhibited an increase of both viscoelastic moduli on cooling from 90 to 20 °C, where the storage modulus is always higher than the loss modulus. This increase in viscoelastic functions should result from intermolecular hydrophobic driven cross-linking as well as some hydrogen bonds and physical entanglements between proteins molecules on gel formation induced by the heating/cooling cycles. The 3:1 mixture of collagen and pea protein showed to be a potential formulation for the new meat-product development, as it shows texture values and rheological features according to product specifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal proteins 3acollagen 3acooling 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3agels 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aloss modulus 3ameat emulsions 3apea protein 3aprotein content 3arheology 3arheometers 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3atexture 3avegetable protein 3aviscoelasticity 0aOil-in-water emulsions 0aAnimal protein 0aVegetable protein 0aRheological behavior 0aIndustrial processing1 aRaymundo, Anabela1 aSousa, Isabel de,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Dec., v. 74 p.263-270dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010600185300001800291520158400309592002801893650004501921650001001966650003001976650001702006650002402023650002402047650001602071650001502087650002102102650001302123650001602136650002302152650001202175650001302187650002002200650001202220650002202232700002102254700001902275700002402294700002202318700002002340700002302360700001802383700001702401773012302418856008202541852000902623655001202632IND50089428720221119091610.0220304e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008942872DNAL7 a245044522pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3218-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkker, Mustafa10aInvestigation of insulin resistance gene polymorphisms in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer  ap. 3541-3547.  aWe aimed to investigate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) genotypes, which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of many solid tumors and have thus far not been studied in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The study consisted of 93 patients diagnosed with DTC (79 females, 14 males) and 111 healthy control subjects (63 females, 48 males). The anthropometric measurements, lipid profiles, thyroid function tests and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) as an indicator of insulin resistance (IR) of all patients were recorded. In addition IRS-1, IRS-2 and IGFBP-3 gene polymorphisms were determined by using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested for each gene polymorphisms, and genetic effects were evaluated by the Chi Square test and multiple logistic regression. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), body mass index, waist circumference and serum total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in patients with DTC than in the control group. There was no difference between the two groups with respect to IRS-1, IRS-2 and IGFBP-3 gene polymorphisms. In addition, these gene polymorphisms were found to have no effect on lymph node metastases or tumor staging. While, obesity and increased HOMA-IR may be risk factors in DTC development, we suggest that IRS-1, IRS-2 and IGFBP-3 gene polymorphisms do not play an important role in pathogenesis of DTC.  aPublisher supplied data 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3amales 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aregression analysis 3awaist circumference 3acholesterol 3ametastasis 3athyroid function 3agenotype 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3apatients 3abody mass index 3afemales 3athyroid neoplasms1 aGüldiken, Sibel1 aSipahi, Tammam1 aPalabıyık, Orkide1 aTosunoğlu, Ayhan1 aÇelik, Özlem,1 aTunçbilek, Nermin1 aSezer, Atakan1 aSüt, Necdet0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.3541-3547dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3218-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009600174300001600270520231400286592002802600650001602628650001802644650002802662650002002690650001402710650002702724650002102751650001502772650002602787650001402813650001302827650002202840650001902862650001102881650001502892650001602907650001302923650002702936650001402963650002202977650001602999700002403015700002803039700002303067700002203090700002103112700001703133700002703150773011803177856008103295852000903376655001203385IND60615237220221119084517.0181009e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-008-1052-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarques, Sónia Cotrim10aPredicting zooplankton response to environmental changes in a temperate estuarine ecosystem  ap. 531-541.  aA novel strategy that allows to predict the responses of zooplanktonic species to environmental conditions in an estuarine temperate ecosystem (Mondego estuary) is presented. It uses 12 indicator species from the zooplanktonic Mondego database (102 species) that are common members of the different habitats, characterized by their specific hydrological conditions. Indicator-species analysis (ISA) was used to define and describe which species were typical of each of the five sampling stations in a 4-year study (2003–2006). First, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was carried out to objectively identify the species-habitat affinity based on the relationship between species, stations and environmental data. Response curves for each of the zooplanktonic species, generated by univariate logistic regression on each of the independent variables temperature and salinity, were generally in agreement with the descriptive statistics concerning the occurrence of those species in this particular estuarine ecosystem. Species-specific models that predict probability of occurrence relative to environmental parameters like salinity, water temperature, turbidity, chlorophyll a, total suspended solids and dissolved oxygen were then developed for the zooplanktonic species. The multiple logistic models used contained between 1 and 3 significant parameters and the percentage correctly predicted was moderate to high, ranging from 62 to 95%. The predictive accuracy of the model was assured by direct comparison of model predictions with the observed occurrence of species obtained in 2006 (validation) and from data collected in the early 2000s in another Portuguese estuary—Ria de Aveiro (Canal de Mira), a complex mesotidal shallow coastal lagoon. The regression logistic model here defined, correctly suggested that the distribution of zooplankton species was mainly dependent on salinity and water temperature. The logistic regression proved to be a useful approach for predicting the occurrence of species under varying environmental conditions at a local scale. Therefore, this model can be considered of reasonable application (and should be tested in other estuarine systems) due to its ability to predict the occurrence of individual zooplanktonic species associated with habitat changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3acorrespondence analysis 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adescriptive statistics 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3aindicator species 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability 3asalinity 3atotal suspended solids 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3azooplankton1 aAzeiteiro, Ulisses,1 aLeandro, Sérgio Miguel1 aQueiroga, Henrique1 aPrimo, Ana Lígia1 aMartinho, Filipe1 aViegas, Ivan1 aPardal, Miguel Ângelo0 tMarine biology.g2008 Oct., v. 155, no. 5 p.531-541dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-008-1052-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245019300217300001400410520156600424592002801990650001302018650001302031650001302044650001102057650002002068650001302088650001802101650001502119650002502134650003102159650003002190650002402220650001902244653001802263653002102281653001502302653003102317653002802348700002302376773010302399856008702502852000902589655001202598IND60630402420221117234918.0190321e20190505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.01.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopovetskiy, Pavel S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7010-151810aSilver nanoparticles stabilized by AOT and Tergitol NP-4 mixture: Influence of composition on electrophoretic concentration, properties of concentrated organosols and conductivity of films  ap. 51-58.  aA comparative analysis of the main physico-chemical characteristics of silver nanoparticles produced in mixed reverse micelles of nonionic surfactant Tergitol NP-4 with addition of anionic AOT was carried out. The nanoparticles are shown to have a positive electrokinetic potential. The only exception is nanoparticles synthesized in Tergitol NP-4 reverse micelles without addition of AOT, which have a zero electrokinetic potential. An increase in AOT concentration in the mixture leads to a decrease in the size of particles produced and an increase in the electrokineticpotential. It was shown that silver nanoparticles with close to quantitative extraction rates can be concentrated by non-aqueous electrophoresis with AOT content in mixture equaled 5 mol% and more. For mixture with content of AOT more than 50 mol%, no concentration is observed for surfactants. In the systems with high content of Tergitol NP-4 an increase in the concentration of surfactants is observed compared to the starting organosol. A decrease in AOT concentration leads to a decrease in the stability of the nanoparticles that results in a reversible change in the surface plasmon resonance spectra of nanoparticles under drying and irreversible agglomeration of nanoparticles with a decrease in the surfactant concentration. The presence of reversible agglomeration of the nanoparticles is likely due to the strong negative effect of Tergitol NP-4 on the stability as well as the conductivity and adhesion of coatings produced by thermolysis of the nanoparticle concentrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acoatings 3acolloids 3adrying 3aelectrophoresis 3amicelles 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anonionic surfactants 3aphysicochemical properties 3asurface plasmon resonance 3athermal degradation 3azeta potential 0aNanoparticles 0aReverse micelles 0aSurfactant 0aNonaqueous electrophoresis 0aMetal-based inkjet inks1 aBeketova, Darya I.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 May 05, v. 568 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.01.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171500001400268520183200282592002802114650001202142650002202154650002302176650001602199650003002215650001402245650001202259650001002271650001302281650001102294650001702305650002702322650001102349653002102360653001702381653002902398653003102427653001602458700001202474700001502486773011302501856008602614852000902700655001202709IND60719495320221118212754.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Shuaijie10aManaging green innovation investment in a Co-opetitive supply chain under capital constraint  aNAL-light  aResponding the increasing concerns on environment and green consumerism, many firms found specialized environmental foundations to invest in green technology innovators (GTIs) and achieve green features in their products to attract consumers. However, facing increasing financial pressure during the economic downturn in recent years, they may have limited capital for green investments. In this paper, we investigate, in the presence of limited environmental foundation sizes, whether a pair of co-opetitive supply chain players (consisting of an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a Contract Manufacturer (CM) that serves as both a supplier and a competitor in downstream market for the OEM) should co-invest in a joint GTI. We consider two scenarios, Scenario N where the OEM and CM respectively invest in two independent GTIs, and Scenario Y where the two firms co-invest in a joint GTI. We analyze both the exogenous or endogenous reward rates cases for the promoting of green innovation efforts of the GTIs. Under both exogenous and endogenous reward rates, we find that although Scenario Y always yields higher greenness level than Scenario N for both the OEM and CM, the OEM doesn’t always have incentive to do so due to the CM’s strategic use of wholesale price or reward rate decision responses, while the CM is always better off in Scenario Y when the reward rate is exogenous. We also find that the market size and competitive intensity will post significant impacts on the green innovation outcomes, wholesale price and reward rates decisions in the co-opetitive relationship. Intensified downstream quantity competition can motivate upstream innovation investment. However, greener technology may result in worse environmental performance for the whole supply chain because of increased total quantity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aconsumer behavior 3aeconomic recession 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental performance 3aequipment 3amarkets 3apaper 3apressure 3aprices 3asupply chain 3asustainable technology 3ayields 0aGreen innovation 0aCo-opetition 0aEnvironmental foundation 0aGreen technology innovator 0aReward rate1 aYe, Fei1 aLin, Qiang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 291 p.125254-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007600158520118300234592002801417650001501445650002101460650003101481650001801512650001901530650001401549650001501563700002201578773012801600856007501728852000901803655001201812IND60703881020221120140313.0200721e20200312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070388102DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hao-Yu 10aRetrieval of Ocean Wind Speed Using Super-Resolution Delay-Doppler Maps  aThe use of reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals has shown to be effective for some remote sensing applications. In a GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) system, a set of delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) related to scattered GNSS signals is formed and serves as a measurement of ocean wind speed and roughness. The design of the DDM receiver involves a trade-off between computation/communication complexity and the effectiveness of data retrieval. A fine-resolution DDM reveals more information in data retrieval while consuming more resources in terms of onboard processing and downlinking. As a result, existing missions typically use a compressed or low-resolution DDM as a data product, and a high-resolution DDM is processed for special purposes such as calibration. In this paper, a deep learning, super resolution algorithm is developed to construct a high-resolution DDM based on a low-resolution DDM. This may potentially enhance the data retrieval results with no impact on the instrument design. The proposed method is applied to process the DDM products disseminated by the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) and the effectiveness of wind speed retrieval is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aequipment design 3aglobal positioning systems 3areflectometry 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3awind speed1 aJuang, Jyh-Ching 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 12, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120609163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245011600215300001600331520174100347592002802088650002302116650002202139650002502161650001602186650001402202650000902216650000902225650001802234650001102252650001502263650001302278650001502291653001902306653002002325653002602345653002502371653002202396700001802418700002102436700006802457700002202525773011502547856008602662852000902748655001202757IND60613331720221122062031.0200509e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZischg, Andreas Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4749-767010aExtending coupled hydrological-hydraulic model chains with a surrogate model for the estimation of flood losses  ap. 174-185.  aIn comparison to a local-scale flood risk analysis, modeling flood losses and risks at the river basin scale is challenging. Particularly in mountainous watersheds, extreme precipitation can be distributed spatially and temporally with remarkable variability. Depending on the topography of the river basin and the topological characteristics of the river network, certain rainfall patterns can lead to a synchronization of the flood peaks between tributaries and the main river. Thus, these complex interactions can lead to high variability in flood losses. In addition, flood inundation modeling at the river basin scale is computationally resource-intensive and the simulation of multiple scenarios is not always feasible. In this study, we present an approach for reducing complexity in flood-risk modeling at the river basin scale. We developed a surrogate model for flood loss analysis in the river basin by decomposing the river system into a number of subsystems. A relationship between flood magnitude and flood losses is computed for each floodplain in the river basin by means of a flood inundation and flood loss model at sub-meter resolution. This surrogate model for flood-loss estimation can be coupled with a hydrological-hydraulic model cascade, allowing to compute a high number of flood scenarios for the whole river system. The application of this model to a complex mountain river basin showed that the surrogate model approach leads to a reliable and computationally fast analysis of flood losses in a set of probable maximum precipitation scenarios. Hence, this approach offers new possibilities for stress test analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations in the analysis of system behavior under different system loads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3afloodplains 3amountains 3arain 3arisk 3arisk analysis 3arivers 3atopography 3atopology 3awatersheds 0aModel coupling 0aSurrogate model 0aFlood loss estimation 0aComplex river system 0aRiver basin-scale1 aFelder, Guido1 aMosimann, Markus1 aRöthlisberger, Veronika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1911-62681 aWeingartner, Rolf0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 Oct., v. 108 p.174-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245008300166506031000249520105900559592002801618650001101646650001901657650001501676650001501691650001201706650002201718650002201740650001101762650001001773651001001783653001101793653001701804653002201821653002301843653001901866700002201885700002001907700002401927773011601951856007602067852000902143655001202152IND60560925120221120185805.0170112e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092512DNAL7 a10.4081/ija.2016.7752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProbo, Massimiliano10aTargeted Grazing for the Restoration of Sub-Alpine Shrub-Encroached Grasslands  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aThe decline of agro-pastoral activities has led to a widespread tree and shrub-encroachment of former semi-natural meso-eutrophic grasslands in many European mountain regions. Temporary night camp areas (TNCA) and mineral mix supplements for targeted cattle were arranged over shrub-encroached areas to restore grassland vegetation within the Val Troncea Natural Park (Italy). From 2011 to 2015, their effects on vegetation structure and pastoral value of forage were assessed along permanent transects. Four years after treatments, both practices were effective in reducing the shrub cover and increasing the cover and average height of the herbaceous layer, but changes were more remarkable within TNCA. Moreover, the arrangement of TNCA decreased the cover of nanophanerophytes and increased the cover of graminoids and high quality species, as well as the overall forage pastoral value. In conclusion, TNCA were the most effective pastoral practice to contrast shrub-encroachment and increase herbage mass and forage quality of sub-alpine grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3aforage quality 3agraminoids 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aground vegetation 3aherbaceous plants 3ashrubs 3atrees 3aItaly 0aCattle 0achamaephytes 0ananophanerophytes 0apastoral practices 0apastoral value1 aPittarello, Marco1 aLonati, Michele1 aLombardi, Giampiero0 tItalian journal of agronomy.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 11, no. 4dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2039-68057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ija.2016.7753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011400169300001600283520137200299592002801671650001201699650002001711650001401731650001301745650001901758650001601777650001201793650001001805650000901815653002601824653002301850653002001873653001601893653002201909700002201931773015101953856008602104852000902190655001202199IND60570514520221121120843.0190214e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkop, Pavol10aBiometrical and behavioural associations with offering nuptial gifts by males in the spider Pisaura mirabilis  ap. 189-196.  aNuptial gifts are under strong selection in terms of female choice. It is hypothesized that nuptial gifts represent an honest signal resulting from the trade-off between self-maintenance and mating effort. Furthermore, nuptial gift size may correlate with certain personality traits, such as male fighting or hunting abilities. We investigated the nuptial gifts of a gift-giving spider, Pisaura mirabilis, consisting of both exogenous (prey) and endogenous (silk) components and their relationships to male biometry (the honest signalling hypothesis) and personality traits (the personality traits hypothesis). The gift's weight in the field was positively correlated with male size providing support for the honest signalling hypothesis. No differences in body condition and fluctuating asymmetry between males carrying and not carrying gifts in the field were found which does not support the honest signalling hypothesis. A substantial proportion of males offered worthless gifts that were smaller and lighter than genuine gifts. Reliable personality traits of males were not identified and no behavioural or survival differences between males carrying nuptial gifts, unwrapped prey and not carrying gifts in the field were observed. These results suggest that male size serves as an honest indicator of the exogenous component of the gift (i.e. the nuptial prey).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aanimal behavior 3aasymmetry 3abiometry 3abody condition 3acorrelation 3afemales 3amales 3asilk 0afluctuating asymmetry 0ahandicap principle 0anuptial feeding 0apersonality 0aPisaura mirabilis1 aSemelbauer, Marek0 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 July, v. 129 p.189-196dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245012800159500019900287500001500486506031000501520158500811592002802396650002102424650001602445650002002461650001102481650001002492650001302502650001102515650002502526650001602551650001802567650001502585650002002600650001302620650001202633650001702645650002002662653001602682653001002698653001102708653001102719700002202730773011602752856007602868852000902944655001202953IND60560925220221120185656.0170112e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092522DNAL7 a10.4081/ija.2016.7772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilic, Semra10aRole of Exogenous Folic Acid in Alleviation of Morphological and Anatomical Inhibition on Salinity-Induced Stress in Barley  aFunding: this work was supported by the Project SDUBAP (3304-YL2-12).

Ever increasing salinity negatively affects processes such as plant growth and development, ultimately causing diminished economic yield and quality of production, and it might cause a worldwide famine in the future. Thus, helping plants adapt to saline soils and increasing their yield and quality is a must. Our study focused on the enhancing role of exogenously applied folic acid (FA) in mitigation of toxicity caused by salt (NaCl). Barley seeds were pre-treated with 50 mM FA for 24 h and then exposed to salt. Morphological and anatomical changes in seed germination and seedling growth stages were compared between different treatments of salt in laboratory conditions. Adverse effects of salt in both germination and seedling growth stages depended on the concentration of salt treatment (0.0, 0.25, 0.275, 0.30, 0.325 and 0.35 M). It was shown that the application of FA effectively alleviated the salt-induced inhibition, and reduced the negative effects of salt on germination (germination index and vigour index), seedling growth (radicle and coleoptile lengths, fresh weight) and leaf (stomata and epidermis number, stomatal index, stomata sizes of adaxial and abaxial surfaces) parameters. Moreover, FA elevated all examined parameters of barley also under non-stress conditions. Especially, germination and vigour indices were significantly higher than the control. Our results suggest that exogenous FA is involved in the resistance of barley to salt-stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseed germination 3acoleoptiles 3aseedling growth 3abarley 3avigor 3asalinity 3afamine 3adevelopmental stages 3asalt stress 3asoil salinity 3afolic acid 3asodium chloride 3atoxicity 3astomata 3asaline soils 3aadverse effects 0agermination 0aseeds 0aBarley 0aleaves1 aAca, Hatice Tugba0 tItalian journal of agronomy.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 11, no. 4dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2039-68057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ija.2016.7773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245011600167520205900283592002802342650002802370650002002398650001402418650001302432650001102445650001502456650001502471650001902486650001102505650001802516650002902534650001502563650001602578650001502594651001902609700002002628700003502648773012802683856007502811852000902886655001202895IND60703881220221120140305.0200721e20200311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070388122DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAristizabal, Fernando 10aHigh-Resolution Inundation Mapping for Heterogeneous Land Covers with Synthetic Aperture Radar and Terrain Data  aFloods are one of the most wide-spread, frequent, and devastating natural disasters that continue to increase in frequency and intensity. Remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and near-real time (NRT) information due to its high-spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation. However, the efficacy of flood inundation mapping with SAR is susceptible to reflections and scattering from a variety of factors including dense vegetation and urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR along with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of inundation in heterogeneous areas. Three machine learning classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual-polarized SAR only and dual-polarized SAR along with HAND to map inundated areas. Three study sites along the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The binary classification analysis (inundated as positive vs. non-inundated as negative) revealed significant improvements when incorporating HAND in several metrics including classification accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive predictive value (PPV), but true negative rate (TNR) fell -14.4%. By incorporating HAND, a significant number of areas with high SAR backscatter but low HAND values were detected as inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected but to a lesser extent as evident in the metrics. This study demonstrates that HAND could be considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3adisasters 3adrainage 3afloods 3ahurricanes 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asurface water 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atopography 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3aNorth Carolina1 aJudge, Jasmeet 1 aMonsivais-Huertero, Alejandro 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 11, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120609003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008500171300001400256520122200270592002801492650001701520650001101537650001501548650001301563650002401576650001701600650001601617650002701633650001401660650002501674650000901699650001101708650001301719650001201732650001301744650001301757650001701770650001801787650001301805650001601818653002901834653001401863653002001877653002601897653002501923700001601948700001601964700001301980773010301993856008702096852000902183655001202192IND60630402720221117234955.0190321e20190505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuc-Mathis, D.10aEmulsifying properties of food by-products: Valorizing apple pomace and oat bran  ap. 84-91.  aThe potential emulsifying properties of two food byproducts, apple pomace and oat bran, were investigated to assess if their insoluble and soluble contents can stabilize oil in water emulsions. If so, this would mean that such raw, unpurified and complex materials could be used whole, with no additional processing and/or solvents added to separate and purify the desired fractions. If the two byproducts only need to be dried and micronized, the environmental impact would be considerably reduced. Rapeseed, jojoba and myritol oils were used to assess feasibility for both food and cosmetic applications. Dynamic rheological measurements, droplet size distribution, backscattered light, light and confocal microscopy showed that apple powder has better emulsifying potential, especially in myritol and rapeseed oil. The action of the insoluble fibers maintained the stability of the emulsions through Pickering mechanism and/or network formation in the continuous phase, probably favored by stabilization of proteins and pectins in the soluble fraction. Such raw materials can thus be a renewable source of stabilizing agents with useful functional properties such as gel behavior and stability against coalescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapple pomace 3aapples 3abyproducts 3acolloids 3aconfocal microscopy 3adroplet size 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3aenvironmental impact 3agels 3ajojoba 3aoat bran 3apectins 3aproteins 3arapeseed 3arapeseed oil 3araw materials 3asolvents 3astabilizers 0aUnpurified raw materials 0aEmulsions 0aSolid particles 0aFunctional properties 0aStability mechanisms1 aJournet, C.1 aFayolle, N.1 aBosc, V.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 May 05, v. 568 p.84-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245016200197300001800359500002000377520142900397592002801826650001801854650001901872650002401891650001701915650001901932650001501951650002701966650002401993650004202017650002602059650002802085650001102113650001502124650002502139651001002164700002102174700001402195700001302209700002002222773015002242856007302392852000902465655001202474IND60600039220221121065824.0180702e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060003922DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Peng‐yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2621-279510aResponses of flocculent and granular sludge in anaerobic sequencing batch reactors (ASBRs) to azithromycin wastewater and its impact on microbial communities  ap. 2341-2350.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Azithromycin (AZM), a 15‐member macrolide antibiotic, has caused widespread pollution in China, where anaerobic digestion is the predominant wastewater treatment technology. However, the type of anaerobic sludge most suitable for treating antibiotic wastewater is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the response of anaerobic flocculent and granular sludge to AZM wastewater, and, using a high‐throughput sequencing technique, to explain the diverse microbial community structures. RESULTS: Anaerobic granular sludge provided better resistance to the decline of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal caused by AZM and greater biodegradation efficiency than flocculent sludge. Furthermore, there was stronger resistance to AZM‐induced reactive oxygen species in the granular sludge than in the flocculent sludge. The granular sludge exhibited richer microbial communities than the flocculent sludge after AZM exposure to the phylum Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. CONCLUSION: At high AZM concentration, anaerobic granular sludge was superior to flocculent sludge in COD removal and AZM degradation. This is attributed to less cell death and greater microbial diversity and richness in the granular sludge than in the flocculent sludge following exposure to AZM. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes contributed to the resistance to AZM in the granular sludge. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aProteobacteria 3aanaerobic digestion 3aazithromycin 3abiodegradation 3acell death 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobial communities 3areactive oxygen species 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aChina1 aChen, Jia‐rong1 aShao, Lei1 aTan, Jun1 aChen, Dai‐jie0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 93, no. 8 p.2341-2350dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245006400170520214200234592002802376650001502404650001302419650000902432650001002441651001002451651002402461653003102485653002202516653003702538653001902575700002202594773010602616856008702722852000902809655001202818IND60770198420221120052805.0220523e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrijith, S.S.10aEnhancement in free-tropospheric aerosol loading over India  aFree-tropospheric aerosol loading and its changes assume importance as the diabatic heating due to radiation absorption by aerosols is more intense at higher altitudes. The present study quantifies trends in free-tropospheric aerosol loading over Indian landmass and examines the role of local production and long range transport, using multi-satellite observations and reanalysis data. Increasing trends in free-tropospheric aerosol abundance are seen over most of the regions in almost all the seasons. Strongest positive trend over the Indian landmass is seen in post-monsoon, with mean rate of increase in free-tropospheric aerosol optical depth (AODFᵣₑₑ Tᵣₒₚₒₛₚₕₑᵣₑ) 0.063dec⁻¹. While dust aerosol loading in the free-troposphere decreases, smoke aerosol concentration increases over the Indian landmass. While increase in columnar and free-tropospheric aerosol loading is seen over larger regions of the Indian landmass, including regions of northwest India, Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP), central India and southern peninsula, enhancement in aerosol production is observed mainly over the regions of northwest India in post-monsoon. Due to the prevailing westerly winds, aerosols over northwest India are transported through IGP to its central and eastern regions. Increase in aerosol production over northwest India and strengthening of updrafts over the central and eastern IGP lead to vertical uplift of more aerosols into the free-tropospheric altitudes. These free-tropospheric aerosols are subsequently transported, by the prevailing anti-cyclonic system, to the regions of central India and southern peninsula and cause the enhancement in free-tropospheric aerosol loading over these regions in post-monsoon. Though strengthening of updraft is observed over the regions of central India and southern Peninsula, net aerosol production is not seen to be increasing over these regions. The observed enhancement in free-tropospheric aerosols over Indian landmass is important as they can affect the thermal structure and stability of the atmosphere and modify the properties and distribution of clouds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3adust 3asmoke 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0aFree-tropospheric aerosols 0aAerosol transport 0aAerosol flux continuity equation 0aTrend analysis1 aSai, M.V.R.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the impact of a cross-linking enzyme (laccase) on the appearance of structured oil-in-water emulsions containing a lipophilic model colorant (Nile red). A layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition approach was used to prepare oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by interfacial protein-pectin complexes under acidic conditions (pH3.5, 10mM citrate buffer). Laccase (an oxidoreductase) was then added to the system, since this enzyme is often used to covalently cross-link interfacial biopolymer layers. The optical properties of the emulsions were monitored during storage using spectral reflectance to determine the L*a*b values, while the physical properties were monitored by measuring changes in droplet surface charge and particle size distribution. No changes in the size or charge of the droplets were observed during storage, indicating that the emulsions had good physical stability. In the absence of laccase, the emulsions were stable to colour fading, but in the presence of laccase rapid colour changes occurred (red to blue to white). These results have important implications for the formation of structured food emulsions containing certain types of food dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3achemical bonding 3acitrates 3acolor 3acrosslinking 3adroplets 3adyes 3aemulsions 3afood coloring 3alaccase 3amodels 3aparticle size distribution 3areflectance 0aColour 0aOil-in-water emulsion 0aLaccase 0aAppearance 0aSugar beet pectin 0aEnzyme1 aZeeb, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3171-70821 aMcClements, David Julian1 aWeiss, Jochen0 tFood research international.g2017 July, v. 97 p.223-230dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017800167300001600345520177100361592002802132650002202160650002102182650001102203650001302214650002502227650001902252650001702271650000902288650001902297650001002316650001102326650001002337650001402347650001202361650001202373650001702385650001402402650002402416650001202440653001102452653001702463653003302480653001602513653001102529700001602540700001802556700001802574700001302592700001902605700001702624773011202641856008202753852000902835655001202844IND60605765520221121043944.0190411e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qingsong10aLRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein) recognizes bacteria and promotes hemocytic phagocytosis in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas  ap. 622-628.  aIn bivalve mollusks, circulating hemocyte mediated phagocytosis is one of the primary ways to eliminate invading microbes. Here, we have identified one CgLRFN (leucine-rich repeat and fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein) in the Crassostrea gigas as a novel transmembrane LRR (Leucine-rich repeat) domain containing protein in C. gigas, homologous to the jawless fish VLR protein, that plays an important role in recognizing bacteria and promoting hemocytic phagocytosis. Tissue distribution analysis of CgLRFN in Pacific oyster showed that it is widely expressed in various tissues like the gills, adductor muscles, digestive glands, gonads, heart and in the hemocytes. Furthermore, infection of Pacific oysters with two marine Vibrio strains V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus was found to significantly increase CgLRFN expression in the hemocytes. Analysis of subcellular localization showed that CgLRFN is primarily localized in the cell membrane. Additionally, CgLRFN was found to be able to bind both the bacterial strains, indicating its possible role as a cell surface receptor. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that CgLRFN coated bacteria was phagocytosed by oyster hemocytes at a significantly higher rate compared to the uncoated bacteria. Finally, RNAi mediated knockdown of CgLRFN in vivo resulted in reduced clearance of both the bacterial strains from the oyster hemolymph. Overall, our study demonstrates that CgLRFN acts as a pattern recognition receptor for Vibrio spp. and promotes hemocytic phagocytosis in the Pacific oyster, which is critical for understanding the mechanism of bacterial infection in lower invertebrates, and also contributes to disease management of this economically and ecologically important marine mollusk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aRNA interference 3aVibrio 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acell membranes 3afibronectins 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3agills 3agonads 3aheart 3ahemocytes 3amuscles 3aoysters 3aphagocytosis 3ashellfish 3atissue distribution 3atissues 0aCgLRFN 0aPhagocytosis 0aPattern recognition receptor 0aVibrio spp. 0aOyster1 aYu, Mingjia1 aChen, Hongmei1 aZeng, Manhong1 aSun, Yan1 aSaha, Tusar T.1 aChen, Dongbo0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Jan., v. 72 p.622-628dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014800163300001600311520146000327592002801787650001201815650002401827650001401851650000901865650001001874650001401884650002001898650002001918650002401938650001501962650001201977650002201989650001402011650003602025650001402061650002402075650001302099650002702112650002202139653002102161653005502182653002702237653001602264700001502280700001402295700005802309700001202367773011302379856008202492852000902574655001202583IND60605765620221121044002.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Pengzhi10aMolecular cloning and functional analysis of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in thick shell mussel, Mytilus coruscus  ap. 631-640.  aTumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) is one of the key adapter molecules in Toll-like receptor signal transduction that triggers downstream cascades involved in innate immunity. Despite of the well study in vertebrates, there is few data ascribe to this TRAF member in invertebrates, especially in bivalves. In the present study, a novel TRAF6 homologue termed McTRAF6 was firstly characterized in Mytilus coruscus. Like its counterparts in mammals, McTRAF6 shared the domain topology containing one RING domain, two zinc finger domains, one coiled-coil region and a MATH domain. McTRAF6 transcripts predominantly expressed in gills, digestive glands and hemocytes in M. coruscus, and were significantly up-regulated in hemocytes after challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Further, the subcellular localization in cytoplasm and the activation of Nk-κB or ISRE luciferase reporter by overexpressed McTRAF6 were identified in HEK293T cells. These results collectively indicate that McTRAF6 is a member of TRAF6 subfamily and plays a potential role in immune defense system against pathogenic agents invasions in thick shell mussel. To our knowledge, this is the first report on component of TLR signaling pathway in thick shell mussel, providing further evidence for the existence of TLR pathway in M. coruscus and contribute to clarify the innate immune system of thick shell mussel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus 3aToll-like receptors 3acytoplasm 3afish 3agills 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3alipopolysaccharides 3aluciferase 3amammals 3amolecular cloning 3apathogens 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3ashellfish 3asignal transduction 3atopology 3atumor necrosis factors 3azinc finger motif 0aMytilus coruscus 0aTumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 0aInnate immune response 0aTLR pathway1 aHe, Yuehua1 aLiao, Zhi1 aDong, Wenqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8929-51721 aXia, Hu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.631-640dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300001600303520140200319592002801721650001901749650001701768650001301785650001101798650001601809650001401825650002201839650001601861650001701877650001501894650003301909650001701942650001501959650002601974650001802000650001702018650004402035651001002079653002002089653003702109653002602146653002302172653001502195700002502210700002102235700002002256700005802276700001802334773012102352856008102473852000902554655001202563IND60549545720221118001704.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Urso, Gilda10aCharacterisation of Fragaria vesca fruit from Italy following a metabolomics approach through integrated mass spectrometry techniques  ap. 387-395.  aThe phytochemical content of Fragaria vesca L. (wild strawberry) grown in Campania Region (South Italy) was investigated. Wild and cultivated fruit were collected from different geographic areas and from bothautochthonous and non-autochthonous germplasm. Extracts were submitted to untargeted liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-Orbitrap–MS) for metabolite profiling. 39 different phenolic compounds have been detected and identified in the methanolic extract of spontaneous and cultivated strawberries from different origins. Targeted quantitative analyses of selected known metabolites were performed using UHPLC interfaced to Q-Trap mass spectrometer in Multiple Reaction Monitoring mode. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to both untargeted and targeted results. PCA was applied to the untargeted profiling data indicating that fruits from locations with different pedoclimatic conditions can be discerned. Results from quantitative analysis indicate that autochthonous strawberries display significantly higher levels of anthocyanins, especially cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and other phenolic compounds, like gallic acid and procyanidin B1, compared to the one from non-autochthonous germplasm. The targeted and untargeted metabolite profiling approach used in this work is proposed for the assessment of geographical origin of the berries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria vesca 3aanthocyanins 3acyanidin 3afruits 3agallic acid 3agermplasm 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amonitoring 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprocyanidins 3aprovenance 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectrometers 3astrawberries 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aItaly 0aWild strawberry 0aTargeted and untargeted analysis 0aLC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS/MS 0aLC-ESI-QTrap-MS/MS 0aPolyphenol1 aMaldini, Mariateresa1 aPintore, Giorgio1 ad'Aquino, Luigi1 aMontoro, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9445-60061 aPizza, Cosimo0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2016 Dec., v. 74 p.387-395dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011200175300001600287520108100303592002801384650001701412650001101429650002201440650002301462650002501485650002001510650001501530650001701545653002201562653001901584653003701603653003101640653003101671700002201702700002101724700002301745700002301768773011501791856008601906852000901992655001202001IND60613332120221122042950.0200509e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewland, Charles P.10aEmpirically derived method and software for semi-automatic calibration of Cellular Automata land-use models  ap. 208-239.  aLand-use change models generally include neighbourhood rules to capture the spatial dynamics between different land-uses that drive land-use changes, introducing many parameters that require calibration. We present a process-specific semi-automatic method for calibrating neighbourhood rules that utilises discursive knowledge and empirical analysis to reduce the complexity of the calibration problem, and efficiently calibrates the remaining interactions with consideration of locational agreement and landscape pattern structure objectives. The approach and software for implementing it are tested on four case studies of major European cities with different physical characteristics and rates of urban growth, exploring preferences for different objectives. The approach outperformed benchmark models for both calibration and validation when a balanced objective preference was used. This research demonstrates the utility of process-specific calibration methods, and highlights how process knowledge can be integrated with automatic calibration to make it more efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3acomputer software 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental models 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aurbanization 0aCellular automata 0aLand-use model 0aCalibration complexity reduction 0aSemi-automatic calibration 0aAutomatic parameter tuning1 aZecchin, Aaron C.1 aMaier, Holger R.1 aNewman, Jeffrey P.1 avan Delden, Hedwig0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 Oct., v. 108 p.208-239dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009300166500001400259520126200273592002801535650001201563650001601575650001401591650002201605650001101627650001501638650001001653650000901663650001101672653002401683653004101707653001701748700001401765700001301779700001101792773011301803856008601916852000902002655001202011IND60719496020221118212904.0210121e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanhui10aReducing food loss and waste in a two-echelon food supply chain: A quantum game approach  aNAL-light  aThis paper proposes a quantum game to study the food loss and waste (FLW) reduction in a two-echelon food supply chain (FSC) consisting of single supplier and single retailer. First, a Non-zero-sum game model based on the efforts of supplier and retailer in the process of FLW reduction is developed. Then, the classic strategy space is extended to quantum strategy space. The results show that in both classical environment and the separable quantum game scenario, it is difficult to achieve the Pareto optimal strategy of the two parties adopting the full effort strategy, because the full-effort party will bear the risk of betrayal by the non-effort party. However, in the context of maximally entangled quantum game, the risk causing by the non-effort party are borne by himself rather than the full-effort party. Correspondingly, both parties will adopt the full effort strategy to achieve a win-win situation and improve FLW in FSC significantly. Furthermore, an entanglement contract is proposed to ensure that neither of them has the motivation to deviate from the quantum strategy. Based on these findings, some managerial implications are presented to improve the level of cooperation and effort of the supplier and the retailer on FLW reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsidae 3aenvironment 3afood loss 3afood supply chain 3amodels 3amotivation 3apaper 3arisk 3awastes 0aFood loss and waste 0aEffort to reduce food loss and waste 0aQuantum game1 aZhao, Yan1 aFu, Jing1 aXu, Lu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.125261-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245008800181300001600269520111400285592002801399650002301427650001301450650001101463650001101474650001101485700001801496700002701514700002301541773009901564856008101663852000901744655001201753IND50089430820221119093217.0150214e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008943082DNAL7 a245849032pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-014-9990-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKell, Adam10aOn destabilization of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex of Chlorobaculum tepidum  ap. 323-329.  aThe Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum was studied with respect to its stability. We provide a critical assessment of published and recently measured optical spectra. FMO complexes were found to destabilize over time producing spectral shifts, with destabilized samples having significantly higher hole-burning efficiencies; indicating a remodeled protein energy landscape. Observed correlated peak shifts near 825 and 815 nm suggest possible correlated (protein) fluctuations. It is proposed that the value of 35 cm⁻¹widely used for reorganization energy (E λ), which has important implications for the contributions to the coherence rate (Kreisbeck and Kramer 3:2828–2833, 2012), in various modeling studies of two-dimensional electronic spectra is overestimated. We demonstrate that the value of E λ is most likely about 15–22 cm⁻¹and suggest that spectra reported in the literature (often measured on different FMO samples) exhibit varied peak positions due to different purification/isolation procedures or destabilization effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorobium tepidum 3abacteria 3aenergy 3amodels 3asulfur1 aAcharya, Khem1 aBlankenship, Robert E.1 aJankowiak, Ryszard0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2014 June, v. 120, no. 3 p.323-329dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-014-9990-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013900161300001600300520100900316592002801325650004401353650002201397650001601419650002201435650003801457650001201495650002301507650002101530650001801551650001801569650001801587650001901605650001101624650001601635650002301651650002101674650003701695650001401732653002201746653001201768653001201780653001801792653001201810700001401822700001601836700001801852700001501870700001701885773012101902856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60549545820221118001444.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Chao10aPreparation and characterization of size-controlled starch nanoparticles based on short linear chains from debranched waxy corn starch  ap. 303-310.  aStarch nanoparticles (SNPs) with controllable particle sizes were prepared by nanoprecipitation using short linear chains from debranched waxy corn starch.

A digital scanner was used to measure two simple shapes (circle and square) at three resolutions (118.159, 236.270 and 472.441 pixels/cm) and five sizes (3.14, 12.58, 28.29, 50.29, and 78.60 cm²). Additionally, the accuracy and precision of two digital scanner models were compared using two shapes (circle and square) of similar size at five resolutions (29.528, 39.370, 59.055, 118.159, 236.270, and 472.440 pixels/cm). A method is described to measure leaf area using an image histogram and photographic software tools (Photoshop®®). This method was validated by comparison of the digitally captured images to a leaf area meter (LI-COR®® 3100). Overall, simple changes in shape have a statistically significant effect on the accuracy of digital measurements of area for some sizes and resolutions.  aPublisher supplied data 0adigital analysis 0adigital scanner 0aleaf area measurement 0ainsect herbivory1 aRice, Marlin E.1 aHill, John H.0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2007 Oct., v. 80, no. 4 p.339-347dThe Kansas Entomological Societyx0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317%2F0022-8567%282007%2980%5B339%3ADAOLSA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245012400208520199000332592002802322650001302350650002102363650001402384650000902398650003102407650001602438650001702454650001302471651001002484651001602494653002102510653002502531653003102556653001302587653002302600653002702623700002002650700001902670773010602689856008702795852000902882655001202891IND60770198820221120052825.0220628e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Jae-Hee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4280-526714aThe influence of atmospheric blocking on regional PM10 aerosol transport to South Korea during February–March of 2019  aThe particulate matter (PM₁₀) trend has decreased at a growing rate in South Korea, which is on the downwind side in the East Asian region over the last five-year period of 2014–2018. Nevertheless, nationwide, days of high PM₁₀ levels and haze frequently occurred over the period of February–March in 2019. During the period of February–March 2019, two major atmospheric blockings were identified over the Alaskan region in the northeast Pacific over the periods of February 21-March 1 and March 18–29. Warm and stagnant synoptic meteorological conditions favorable for high-PM₁₀ haze days in the East Asian region were accompanied 4–5 days later by the remote Alaskan atmospheric blockings. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used, applying zero-out emission to analyze the regional PM₁₀ contribution on severe haze days exceeding a daily average of 100 μg m⁻³ over South Korea during March 3–6, 2019. The daily average regional PM₁₀ contribution indicated a rate of 57% compared to rates of 23% before and 29% after severe haze days. Furthermore, the major regional PM₁₀ components were nitrates (49%), other inorganics (28%), and sulphates (9%) during the severe haze days. Among inorganic PM₁₀ aerosols, other inorganics mainly composed of anthropogenic fine dust were not a major contribution component in the South Korean case due to fuel consumption changes in China. However, higher nitrate flux from sources in eastern China remained in South Korea, though in slightly reduced amounts. The contribution rate of NOX discharged from automobiles has gradually increased in China, and the level of SO₂ remained on a low level through emission control technologies and regulatory options. The warm and stagnant atmosphere in the East Asian region caused the flux of relatively more nitrates were likely transported, with ammonium nitrate in the atmosphere and with lower sulphate levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aammonium nitrate 3achemistry 3adust 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironment 3aparticulates 3asulfates 3aChina 3aSouth Korea 0aSevere haze days 0aAtmospheric blocking 0aPM10 regional contribution 0aWRF-Chem 0aEast Asian warming 0aDecrease in wind speed1 aKim, Hak-sŏng,1 aYoon, Ma-Byong0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 May 15, v. 277 p.119056-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245013400209300001200343520244000355592002802795650001602823650001102839650001602850650002102866650001402887650001402901650001102915650001102926650002102937650002202958650001102980700002002991700002103011700002303032700002403055700002103079773011903100856008203219852000903301655001203310IND60615238020221119084511.0181129e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-018-3427-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGervais, Connor R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6501-979810aToo hot to handle? Using movement to alleviate effects of elevated temperatures in a benthic elasmobranch, Hemiscyllium ocellatum  ap. 162.  aTropical coral reef flats can be 3–4 °C warmer than surrounding deeper reef slopes, and some experience daily temperature fluctuations of up to 12 °C, which will be exacerbated as global temperatures continue to rise. Epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), predominantly found on reef flats, may have evolved behavioural and/or physiological strategies to mitigate the effects of these dramatic temperature fluctuations. Here, juvenile sharks were acclimated, for at least 6 weeks, to average summer temperatures (28 °C) or predicted end-of-century summer temperatures (32 °C) to investigate the effects of elevated temperatures on growth, survival, and the use of movement to thermoregulate. In addition, sharks experience seasonal temperature changes; therefore, the upper critical thermal limits were determined for adult, wild sharks during both summer and winter months. We found that regardless of acclimation temperature, juveniles maintained the same food consumption rates (~ 5% body mass every other day), but for those living at 32 °C, this resulted in significantly decreased growth rates (body mass and total length). During winter months, maximum habitat temperatures (~ 24 °C) are far below adult sharks’ critical thermal limits (35.92 ± 0.21 °C). During summer months, maximum habitat temperatures (~ 35 °C) are closer to adult critical thermal limits (38.85 ± 0.31 °C). When estimating thermoregulatory behaviour of juvenile sharks maintained at 28 °C, those sharks examined in winter exhibited no thermoregulatory behaviour, while those examined in summer actively sought to control their thermal exposure, preferring 30.7 ± 1.04 °C (day) and 28.54 ± 0.75 °C (night). Furthermore, after acclimation to predicted end-of-century conditions, these same sharks behaviourally sought out 32.94 ± 0.46 °C (day) and 30.74 ± 0.68 °C (night); despite the cost of decreased growth and/or survival. Sharks maintained in control conditions had a mortality rate of 33% during the initial 90-day period of exposure, while mortality was 100% in those sharks exposed to elevated conditions. Ultimately, as ocean temperatures continue to rise, the distribution and abundance patterns for epaulette sharks and many other coral reef species are likely to change if trade-offs associated with acclimation outweigh the benefits of moving to more favourable habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aadults 3acoral reefs 3afood consumption 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3asharks 3asummer 3athermoregulation 3awater temperature 3awinter1 aNay, Tiffany J.1 aRenshaw, Gillian1 aJohansen, Jacob L.1 aSteffensen, John F.1 aRummer, Jodie L.0 tMarine biology.g2018 Nov., v. 165, no. 11 p.162-162dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3427-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245012800158300001600286520081600302592002801118650002101146650002701167650002601194650002901220650002101249650001601270650001601286650002201302650001201324650002601336650001901362650001501381650001401396650002201410650002101432650003701453653001801490653002701508653002701535653002201562700001901584700002201603700001501625700001701640773012101657856008101778852000901859655001201868IND60549545920221118001436.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Na10aElaboration and characterization of corn starch films incorporating silver nanoparticles obtained using short glucan chains  ap. 311-318.  aNanocomposites are being used as a new type of packaging that has good biodegradability and antibacterial ability and that has wide applicability in the preservation and storage field.

The involvement of endogenous protease(s) in the generation of Free Amino Acids (FAAs) participating in the Maillard reaction was characterized. The browning and myosin heavy chain degradation during air-drying were obviously mitigated by the addition of metalloprotease inhibitors, especially EGTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, followed by serine proteinase inhibitor, especially PMSF. The amount of total FAAs in dried products increased by only 0.17% with the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline and 5.0% with added EGTA. In autolysis models, protein autolysis was almost completely inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline. The addition of, 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited the increase in total FAAs including arginine (Arg), followed by EGTA and PMSF. The results indicated that endogenous metalloproteases and serine proteases might influence the generation of FAAs including Arg, and contribute to product discoloration during air-drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aTodarodes pacificus 3aair drying 3aarginine 3aautolysis 3adiscoloration 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3afree amino acids 3ameat 3ametalloproteinases 3amodels 3amyosin heavy chains 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 3asquid 0aMaillard browning 0aFree amino acid 0aProtease inhibitors 0aMetalloprotease 0aSquid1 aKaido, Toshiki1 aKasukawa, Masaru1 aTakahashi, Kigen1 aOkazaki, Emiko1 aOsako, Kazufumi0 tFood research international.g2017 July, v. 97 p.231-239dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245011700172300001800289520172200307592002802029650001902057650002202076650002202098650001102120650002302131650001502154650001202169650001602181650001102197700006202208773013602270856008002406852000902486655001202495IND60617542420221121025232.0181025e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061754242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b070672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonje-Galvan, Viviana10aPreferred Binding Mechanism of Osh4’s Amphipathic Lipid-Packing Sensor Motif, Insights from Molecular Dynamics  ap. 9713-9723.  aAmphipathic helices are key domains of peripheral membrane proteins, targeting specific membranes to enable proper protein function as well as changing the local topology and lipid dynamics of the membranes they bind. Here, we use extended all-atom molecular dynamics to study, in detail, the binding mechanism and conformation of the N-terminus of the lipid-transport protein Osh4 in yeast, that is, the amphipathic lipid-packing sensor (ALPS) motif. We identified two binding conformations: (i) a vertical one with the N-terminus of the peptide embedded into the hydrophobic core and (ii) a horizontal, and energetically favored, conformation in which the hydrophobic side chains of ALPS are fully embedded into the membrane hydrophobic core. From extensive analysis on 21 trajectories of 2 μs each, we describe peptide binding in terms of the structural changes that both the peptide and the membrane undergo upon binding as well as energetics of this interaction. The membrane models in this study include a simple binary lipid mixture, with a neutral and a charged lipid (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine–1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine) and complex mixtures with lipid compositions characteristic of two organelles in yeast (each with more than six lipid types and an accurate sterol content). Our conclusions are in agreement with available literature, showing that the ALPS peptide is more likely to bind membrane surfaces with packing defects and higher anionic character. In addition, we show that there is an interplay between ALPS binding an existing packing defect and creating or enhancing one as the peptide binds to the membrane, which was previously suggested in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid composition 3amembrane proteins 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aorganelles 3asterols 3asurfactants 3ayeasts1 aKlauda, Jeffery B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8725-18700 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Oct. 03, v. 122, no. 42 p.9713-9723dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b070673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001500172245013600187300001400323520173500337592002802072650001302100650001602113650001402129650002102143650001602164650001102180650001102191650001202202650001402214650001302228650001902241650001702260650000902277650001902286650002202305650002502327650003602352650002702388650004602415650003802461650001702499650003102516650001402547650002102561650002402582651001002606651001002616653002302626653002702649653002002676653004102696700001702737700001802754700002302772700001602795700001702811700001902828700001202847773010402859856008702963852000903050655001203059IND50066836820221120230807.0160902e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006683682DNAL7 a236442802pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuewen10aInfluence of planting patterns on fluoroquinolone residues in the soil of an intensive vegetable cultivation area in northern China  ap. 63-69.  aRecent studies have demonstrated the persistence of antibiotics in soil, especially in areas of vegetable cultivation. However, there are very few studies of the influence of planting regimes on the levels of antibiotic pollution. This work introduces geographical-detector models to investigate the relationship between planting patterns (vegetable planting model, manure type and quantity, planting age, greenhouse area, and topographic elevation) and residual fluoroquinolones (FQs) in soil in a pilot project in Shouguang County, Shandong Province (the largest vegetable-producing area in China). The results led to the following findings. 1. The vegetable planting model is the major determinant of the spatial stratification of FQ in the soil. For example, the “cucumber–cucumber” model (growing cucumbers after cucumbers) has a three-fold power of determinant compared to the “pepper–melon” model (growing melons after peppers). 2. Planting age (years with continuous vegetable cultivation) does not necessarily affect the spatial distribution of FQ owing to their relatively short degradation period. 3. Interactions between risk factors were more significant than the individual factors for FQ pollution. In particular, the interaction between the vegetable planting model and amount of manure resulted in the highest pollution level. The findings of the present study make it possible to introduce effective and practical measures to alleviate pollution of soils by FQ in the study area. Adjustment of the vegetable cultivation models and application of chicken manure (less than 6kg/m2 manure annually with a more dry than fresh manure) could be an effective and flexible approach to alleviate FQ pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aantibiotics 3acucumbers 3afluoroquinolones 3agreenhouses 3amelons 3amodels 3apeppers 3aplant age 3aplanting 3apoultry manure 3arisk factors 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3avegetable growing 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgrowth & development 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxanalysis 2aFluorescence 2aFluoroquinolonesxanalysis 2aGeography 2aManurexanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 3aChina 0aChina 0aAntibiotic residue 0aSpatial stratification 0aFluoroquinolone 0aIntensive vegetable cultivation area1 aXie, Yunfeng1 aWang, Jinfeng1 aChristakos, George1 aSi, Jiliang1 aZhao, Huinan1 aDing, Yanqiang1 aLi, Jie0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 458-460 p.63-69dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245014900210300001600359506011700375506007600492520118900568592002801757506003701785650001101822650001401833650000901847650001301856650000901869650002301878650001801901651001101919653002901930653002101959653003401980653002802014700006002042700001202102700006402114773030402178856008402482852000902566655001202575IND60773286720221207052136.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077328672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.iswcr.2022.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Geovane J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6852-646910aNatural disaster in the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil: Assessment of the daily rainfall erosivity as an early warning index  ap. 547-556.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRainfall erosivity is defined as the potential of rain to cause erosion. It has great potential for application in studies related to natural disasters, in addition to water erosion. The objectives of this study were: i) to model the Rdₐy using a seasonal model for the Mountainous Region of the State of Rio de Janeiro (MRRJ); ii) to adjust thresholds of the Rdₐy index based on catastrophic events which occurred in the last two decades; and iii) to map the maximum daily rainfall erosivity (Rₘₐₓdₐy) to assess the region's susceptibility to rainfall hazards according to the established Rdₐy limits. The fitted Rdₐy model presented a satisfactory result, thereby enabling its application as a Rdₐy estimate in MRRJ. Events that resulted in Rdₐy > 1500 MJ ha⁻¹.mm.h⁻¹. day⁻¹ were those with the highest number of fatalities. The spatial distribution of Rₘₐₓdₐy showed that the entire MRRJ has presented values that can cause major rainfall. The Rdₐy index proved to be a promising indicator of rainfall disasters, which is more effective than those normally used that are only based on quantity (mm) and/or intensity (mm.h⁻¹) of the rain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amodels 3amountains 3arain 3aresearch 3asoil 3awater conservation 3awater erosion 3aBrazil 0aDaily rainfall erosivity 0aRainfall hazards 0aBrazilian mountainous regions 0aRainfall warning system1 aMello, Carlos R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6033-53421 aGuo, Li1 aThebaldi, Michael S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4579-67140 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2022 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.547-556dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower ResearchwJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2022.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245005000184300001600234520069200250592002800942650001700970650001800987650002901005650001801034650001401052650001601066650002401082650001301106700001401119700001301133773009201146856008101238852000901319655001201328IND60119749920221120221023.0150318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011974992DNAL7 a255476812pmid7 a10.1007/s12250-014-3542-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jianchun10aRecent progress in dengue vaccine development  ap. 353-363.  aDengue virus (DENV) has four distinct serotypes. DENV infection can result in classic dengue fever and life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. In recent decades, DENV infection has become an important public health concern in epidemic-prone areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent and control viral infections. However, several challenges impede the development of effective DENV vaccines, such as the lack of suitable animal models and the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon. Although no licensed DENV vaccine is available, significant progress has been made. This review summarizes candidate DENV vaccines from recent investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3aanimal models 3adengue hemorrhagic fever 3apublic health 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines1 aChen, Hui1 aAn, Jing0 tVirologica Sinica.g2014 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.353-363dSpringer-Verlagx1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-014-3542-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245010400177300001800281520070300299592002801002650002101030650001901051650001501070650001601085650001101101650002401112650001701136650002901153650001101182650002401193650002401217650002101241650002101262651001101283653004101294653002301335653002801358653002801386653001901414653002701433700002901460773009101489856008401580852000901664655001201673IND60604540620221120083453.0180717e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060454062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOropeza Pérez, Iván,14aThe influence of an estimated energy saving due to natural ventilation on the Mexican energy system  ap. 1080-1091.  aThis article shows the impacts of the extensive use of NV (natural ventilation) in the Mexican residential sector on the Mexican energy system. By integrating a thermal-airflow simulation programme with an energy systems analysis model, the impact on the Mexican energy system of replacing air conditioning, in particular, with natural ventilation to cool residential buildings is determined. It is shown that when, as in Mexico, there is a relatively simple connection between supply and electricity demand, NV creates savings which could be used to reduce either the fossil-fuel-based generation and mitigate CO2 emissions, or the use of water reservoirs and hydro generation during a dry season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3acarbon dioxide 3adry season 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3anatural ventilation 3aresidential housing 3asystems analysis 3awater reservoirs 3aMexico 0aExtensive use of natural ventilation 0aResidential sector 0aEnergy saving potential 0aEnergy systems analysis 0aCO2 mitigation 0aWater reservoir saving1 aØstergaard, Poul Alberg0 tEnergy.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 64 p.1080-1091dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014400165300001600309520149900325592002801824650002101852650002601873650002001899650001501919650002401934650002201958650003101980650001102011650002002022650002502042650002302067650002202090650000902112650001102121650001302132650002202145650001302167650001502180650001102195650001402206650001002220700001502230700001902245700001602264700001602280700001602296700001802312773011902330856008402449852000902533655001202542IND60090133220221121153323.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009013322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Bing10aProteomic analysis of secretion from human transplanted submandibular gland replacing lacrimal gland with severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca  ap. 550-560.  aPurpose: Proteomic analysis of secretions from transplanted or non-transplanted submandibular glands in patients with severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca and tears from normal eyes. Experimental design: Secretions from submandibular glands transplanted to replace lacrimal glands and non-transplanted submandibular glands were collected at 1year from 5 patients with severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca undergoing transplantation, and tears were collected from 3 normal subjects. 2-D electrophoresis (2-DE), then mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins. Western blot analysis was used to confirm protein expression. Results: We identified 34 and 11 distinct proteins in the saliva from transplanted submandibular glands and tears, respectively. The saliva from transplanted submandibular glands contained almost all the proteins abundant in tear fluid. The functions of identified proteins in the saliva from transplanted submandibular gland were mainly immune response and anti-bacterial. In total, 7 proteins showed differential expression between the saliva of transplanted and non-transplanted submandibular glands. The upregulation of short palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated protein 2 and carbonic anhydrase VI was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Conclusions: Identified proteins in saliva from transplanted submandibular glands may protect ocular structures. These findings can help in understanding the functional status of transplanted submandibular glands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acarbonate dehydratase 3aelectrophoresis 3aepithelium 3aexperimental design 3afunctional status 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3akeratoconjunctivitis 3alacrimal apparatus 3amass spectrometry 3anose 3apalate 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asaliva 3asecretion 3atears1 aZhang, Lei1 aLiu, Xiao-jing1 aDing, Chong1 aWu, Li-ling1 aGan, Ye-Hua1 aYu, Guang-yan0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Apr., v. 1824, no. 4 p.550-560dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013600166300001600302520142300318592002801741650001901769650002201788650002201810650002201832650002301854650001201877650002001889650001401909650002301923650001201946650001801958650001001976650001201986650001101998650003102009650001102040650000902051650001602060650002202076650002902098650001902127650001602146650001202162650001102174650001702185650000902202653002902211653002402240653002302264700001902287700001702306700001902323773013702342856008502479852000902564655001202573IND60595411520221121013810.0180602e20180512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059541152DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2017.14053772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeu, Silke10aTrace elements bioavailability to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown subsequent to high biomass plants in a greenhouse study  ap. 574-580.  aMultielement-contaminated agricultural land requires the adaptation of agronomic practices to meet legal requirements for safe biomass production. The incorporation of bioenergy plants with, at least, moderate phytoextraction capacity into crop rotations with cereals can affect trace elements (TE) phytoavailability and, simultaneously, constitute economic revenues for farmers outside the food or forage sector. Hence, in a crop rotation pot study sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), modified for high biomass and TE accumulation by chemical mutagenesis, was compared to winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) as pre-crop. On two agricultural soils with different TE loads, the crops´ potential for phytoextraction and for impacts on TE uptake by subsequent winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was studied. The results showed that rape tolerated high-level mixed contamination with metals (Cd, Pb and Zn) and As more than sunflower. In both soils, labile metals concentration increased and soil acidity remained high following sunflower. Furthermore, enhanced grain As accumulation in subsequent wheat was observed. By contrast, soil acidity and Cd or Zn accumulation of subsequent wheat decreased following rape. In the short term, moderate phytoextraction was superimposed by nutrient use or rhizosphere effects of pre-crops, which should be carefully monitored when designing crop rotations for contaminated land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aHelianthus annuus 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3abioenergy 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3afarmers 3aforage 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aincome 3alead 3amutagenesis 3aphytoaccumulation 3aplant cultural practices 3apolluted soils 3arhizosphere 3asoil pH 3awinter 3awinter wheat 3azinc 0aHeavy metals and arsenic 0awinter oilseed rape 0aenhanced sunflower1 aMüller, Ingo,1 aHerzig, Rolf1 aDudel, E.

Femoral head necrosis and spondylitis were described as the main pathological changes in infected chickens. Nevertheless, little is known about the pathogenesis of Enterococcus cecorum infection in broilers. This report shows for the first time the whole course of disease over an entire growing period including repeated necropsies and subsequent microbiological investigations. CASE PRESENTATION: In a flock of 18200 broilers, a decrease in flock uniformity was detected from 14 days post hatch onwards with affected chickens showing lameness and an increase in flock mortality up to 7.22% at day 33 post hatch. In the first 3 weeks post hatch, pericarditis and hepatitis were found as the main pathological changes in 27.6% and 9.8% of the examined broilers respectively. Femoral head necrosis and vertebral osteomyelitis were detected in the last week of the growing period with 10.3% and 2.3% respectively. Heart, liver, spleen, yolk sac and vertebral column of 59 broilers with pathological changes were subjected to bacteriological analysis. Enterococcus cecorum was isolated from 23 birds (39%), the first broiler was already positive at day 3 post hatch in the yolk sac. Additionally, 9.75% of the broilers were rejected at the slaughterhouse primarily because of pathological changes. The investigated broiler cycle had by far the best footpad score compared to 7 cycles before and 4 cycles after the Enterococcus cecorum infection at the same farm. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteraemia and generalized infection appear to be important steps in the pathogenesis of Enterococcus cecorum infection in broilers. Furthermore, this disease causes economic losses for the farmer not only due to an increase in flock mortality, but probably also through substantially higher condemnation rates at the slaughterhouse. It was speculated that the broilers were infected via the respiratory tract as this flock had lower footpad scores likely the result of drier litter. The latter may have led to higher dust concentrations and thus airborne Enterococcus cecorum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus cecorum 3abacteremia 3achickens 3adisease course 3afarmers 3afarms 3afemur 3aflocks 3aheart 3ahepatitis 3alameness 3aliver 3amortality 3anecropsy 3anecrosis 3aosteomyelitis 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apericarditis 3arespiratory system 3aslaughterhouses 3aspine (bones) 3aspleen 3ayolk sac 3aGermany1 aRautenschlein, Silke0 tBMC veterinary research.g2014 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.311-311dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-014-0311-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245015800174300001600332520146700348592002801815650002101843650001601864650002401880650002301904650001401927650002201941650001101963650001201974650001301986650002401999650001602023650001102039650001202050653000702062653000902069653000902078653002002087653003802107653002502145700001902170700002502189700001602214700002102230700002102251700002202272700002202294773009802316856008602414852000902500655001202509IND60604491920221121131638.0180717e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060449192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsfasman, Tatyana10aAmphipathic alpha-helices and putative cholesterol binding domains of the influenza virus matrix M1 protein are crucial for virion structure organisation  ap. 114-118.  aThe influenza virus matrix M1 protein is an amphitropic membrane-associated protein, forming the matrix layer immediately beneath the virus raft membrane, thereby ensuring the proper structure of the influenza virion. The objective of this study was to elucidate M1 fine structural characteristics, which determine amphitropic properties and raft membrane activities of the protein, via 3D in silico modelling with subsequent mutational analysis. Computer simulations suggest the amphipathic nature of the M1 α-helices and the existence of putative cholesterol binding (CRAC) motifs on six amphipathic α-helices. Our finding explains for the first time many features of this protein, particularly the amphitropic properties and raft/cholesterol binding potential. To verify these results, we generated mutants of the A/WSN/33 strain via reverse genetics. The M1 mutations included F32Y in the CRAC of α-helix 2, W45Y and W45F in the CRAC of α-helix 3, Y100S in the CRAC of α-helix 6, M128A and M128S in the CRAC of α-helix 8 and a double L103I/L130I mutation in both a putative cholesterol consensus motif and the nuclear localisation signal. All mutations resulted in viruses with unusual filamentous morphology. Previous experimental data regarding the morphology of M1-gene mutant influenza viruses can now be explained in structural terms and are consistent with the pivotal role of the CRAC-domains and amphipathic α-helices in M1-lipid interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthomyxoviridae 3acholesterol 3acomputer simulation 3aconsensus sequence 3ainfluenza 3amembrane proteins 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3amutational analysis 3asurfactants 3avirion 3aviruses 0aaa 0aCRAC 0avRNP 0aInfluenza virus 0aCholesterol binding (CRAC) domain 0aM1 protein structure1 aKost, Vladimir1 aMarkushin, Stanislav1 aLotte, Vera1 aKoptiaeva, Irina1 aBogacheva, Elena1 aBaratova, Ludmila1 aRadyukhin, Victor0 tVirus research.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 210 p.114-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014200167300001600309520167700325592002802002650003302030650003102063650001702094650001802111650001602129650001402145650001602159650001602175650001502191650001902206650001102225650001202236650001302248650001602261650002202277700002402299700002702323700001702350700002302367700002302390700001902413700002302432773011902455856008402574852000902658655001202667IND60090133420221121153309.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009013342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPica, Andrea10aExploring the unfolding mechanism of γ-glutamyltranspeptidases: The case of the thermophilic enzyme from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans  ap. 571-577.  aγ-glutamyltranspeptidases (γ-GTs) are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of γ-glutamyl bonds in glutathione and glutamine and the transfer of the released γ-glutamyl group to amino acids or short peptides. These enzymes are generally synthesized as precursor proteins, which undergo an intra-molecular autocatalytic cleavage yielding a large and a small subunit. In this study, circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence measurements have been used to investigate the structural features and the temperature- and guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding of the mature form of the γ-GT from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans (GthGT) and that of its T353A mutant, which represents a mimic of the precursor protein. Data indicate that a) the mutant and the mature GthGT have a different secondary structure content and a slightly different exposure of hydrophobic regions, b) the thermal unfolding processes of both GthGT forms occur through a three-state model, characterized by a stable intermediate species, whereas chemical denaturations proceed through a single transition, c) both GthGT forms exhibit remarkable stability against temperature, but they do not display a strong resistance to the denaturing action of GdnHCl. These findings suggest that electrostatic interactions significantly contribute to the protein stability and that both the precursor and the mature form of GthGT assume compact and stable conformations to resist to the extreme temperatures where G. thermodenidrificans lives. Owing to its thermostability and unique catalytic properties, GthGT is an excellent candidate to be used as a glutaminase in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thermodenitrificans 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3afood industry 3aglutaminase 3aglutamine 3aglutathione 3aguanidinium 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amutants 3aproteins 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aRusso Krauss, Irene1 aCastellano, Immacolata1 aRossi, Mosè1 aLa Cara, Francesco1 aGraziano, Giuseppe1 aSica, Filomena1 aMerlino, Antonello0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Apr., v. 1824, no. 4 p.571-577dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245008800184300001600272520131100288592002801599650001201627650001301639650001101652650002201663650001601685650001701701650001101718650001601729650002401745650001301769650000901782650001701791650001801808650000901826651001201835653001301847653002301860653002101883653001501904653001201919700002701931700003101958700002301989700003302012773008902045856008402134852000902218655001202227IND60604540920221120083623.0180717e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060454092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelaez-Samaniego, Manuel Raul10aProduction and use of electrolytic hydrogen in Ecuador towards a low carbon economy  ap. 626-631.  aThis paper presents a pre-feasibility study of producing and using electrolytic hydrogen in Ecuador as part of a strategy towards a low carbon economy. Hydrogen could be produced using hydropower either alone or combined with other renewable energy sources. For this study, we analyzed two scenarios of energy availability based on data from the largest hydroelectric power plant in the country. The first scenario assumes that an amount of water equivalent to 30% of that spilled in 2011 could be used to generate additional electricity. Thus, an additional amount of energy equivalent to 5% of the energy produced in 2011 could be available. The second scenario doubles this amount of energy. Economic analysis showed that to obtain low-cost hydrogen (3.00 US$/kg) it is necessary to operate the electrolysis plants 24 h/day, using low-cost electricity (30 US$/MWh). A continuous supply of energy could be possible when new hydroelectric utilities start operating or by integrating hydropower with solar and wind. Three possibilities for using hydrogen are discussed: 1) production of ammonia as a raw material for nitrogenous fertilizers, 2) hydro-treating heavy oils and bio-oils in oil refineries, and 3) as an energy storage medium to offset natural instability and unpredictability of renewables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3aeconomic analysis 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3afertilizers 3ahydroelectric power 3ahydrogen 3aoils 3apower plants 3araw materials 3awind 3aEcuador 0aHydrogen 0aLow carbon economy 0aRenewable energy 0aSmart grid 0aEcuador1 aRiveros-Godoy, Gustavo1 aTorres-Contreras, Santiago1 aGarcia-Perez, Tsai1 aAlbornoz-Vintimilla, Esteban0 tEnergy.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 64 p.626-631dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300002000273520152500293592002801818650001601846650001601862650001401878650001001892650001301902650001901915650001601934650001101950650001101961650001201972650002101984650001502005650001502020650002002035650002202055650001102077650001202088700001702100700001802117773014902135856008102284852000902365655001202374IND60583105320221120025216.0171008e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058310532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8484-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajid, N .

Hg, like other non-essential metals, inflicts the deterioration of biological functions in human and other creatures. In the present study, effects of Hg on the physiology and biochemical content of P. radula were undertaken to understand the occurrence of the morphological changes observed. Young leaves of P. radula were treated with different concentrations of Hg-containing solution (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 ppb) along with controls for 4 h, prior to further analysis. Elevated Hg concentration in treatment solution significantly prompted an increased accumulation of Hg in the leaf tissues. Meanwhile, total protein, chlorophyll and low molecular mass thiol contents (cysteine, glutathione and oxidized glutathione) decreased as Hg accumulation increased. However, phytochelatin 2 productions were induced in the treated leaves, in comparison to the control. Based on these findings, it is postulated that as low as 0.5 ppb of Hg interferes with the metabolic processes of plant cells, which was reflected from the morphological changes exhibited on P. radula leaves—the colour of the Hg-treated leaves changed from green to yellowish-brown, became chlorosis and wilted. Changes in the tested characteristics of plant are closely related to the Hg-induced morphological changes on P. radula leaves, a potential bioindicator for detecting Hg in drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelargonium 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3acolor 3acysteine 3adrinking water 3aglutathione 3ahumans 3aleaves 3amercury 3amolecular weight 3amonitoring 3aphysiology 3aprotein content 3asafety assessment 3athiols 3atissues1 aPhang, I.

The redistribution of precipitation among atmospheric water, soil water and groundwater are related to the land surface afforested ecological system. The study took widely replanted Pinus sylvestris var. Mongolica (PSM) in Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) as a research object and monitored precipitation, soil moisture, sap flow, and deep soil recharge (DSR) to find out moisture distribution in shallow soil layers. Results showed that the restoration process of PSM in MUSL changed the distribution of precipitation, with part of it infiltrating downward as DSR and part of it being stored in the shallow soil. Consequently, evapotranspiration increased and DSR significantly decreased, resulting in up to 466.9 mm of precipitation returning to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in 2016. Vegetation increased soil water storage (SWS) capacity, with maximum SWS in PSM plot and bare sandy land (BSL) being 260 mm and 197 mm per unit horizontal area, respectively in 2016. DSR decreased from 54% of precipitation in the BSL plot to 0.2% of precipitation in the PSM plot in 2016. A great portion of infiltrated water was stored in the PSM ecosystem, resulting in a time lag of infiltration to reach the deep soil layer, and the infiltration rate in the BSL plot was 11 times of that in the PSM plot. SWS decreased 16 mm and 7.6 mm per unit horizontal area over a one-year period (from March to October, non-freezing time) in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The PSM annual sap flow was maintained at a relatively constant level of 154 mm/yr. Through in-situ measurement and comparative analysis of the precipitation redistribution of the BSL plot and the PSM plot, we find that PSM can significantly reduce the shallow soil water storage and DSR. However, substantial reduction of shallow soil water storage and DSR is detrimental for the long-term development of PSM forest. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce PSM density to cut the water consumption by PSM per unit area, thus to augment the shallow SWS and DSR, which will be beneficial for the PSM to survive under extreme drought conditions in the future. This study helps us understand the role of precipitation-induced groundwater recharge in the process of vegetation restoration in semi-arid regions and explains the possible causes of PSM forest degradation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrought 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ainfiltration rate 3aresearch 3asap flow 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3awater conservation 3aChina 0aThree North Shelterbelt project 0aMu us sandy land 0aPinus sylvestris var mongolica 0aPrecipitation redistribution 0aDeep soil recharge1 aZhan, Hongbin1 aYang, Wenbin1 aFeng, Wei1 aLu, Qi1 aWang, Yunqi1 aJiang, Qunou1 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0563-56681 aShi, Mingchang1 aWang, Tao1 aXin, Zhiming1 aHao, Ruifang0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2022 Mar. 28, dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower ResearchwJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2022.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04000naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024002200148040001800170100002100188245017200209300001200381506007600393520246400469592002802933506003702961650001302998650001403011650001903025650001603044650001503060650001503075650002103090650001203111650002203123650002503145650002503170651001403195700002103209700001803230700002003248700002303268773016103291856008103452852000903533655001203542IND60119750220221207080401.0151107e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011975022DNAL7 a255401142pmid7 a10.1186/s12966-014-0157-12doi7 aPMC43041382pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaitland, Clover14aThe Dynamic Family Home: a qualitative exploration of physical environmental influences on children’s sedentary behaviour and physical activity within the home space  ap. 157.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Recent changes in home physical environments, such as decreasing outdoor space and increasing electronic media, may negatively affect health by facilitating sedentariness and reducing physical activity. As children spend much of their time at home they are particularly vulnerable. This study qualitatively explored family perceptions of physical environmental influences on sedentary behaviour and physical activity within the home space. METHODS: Home based interviews were conducted with 28 families with children aged 9–13 years (total n = 74 individuals), living in Perth, Australia. Families were stratified by socioeconomic status and selected to provide variation in housing. Qualitative methods included a family interview, observation and home tour where families guided the researcher through their home, enabling discussion while in the physical home space. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Emergent themes related to children’s sedentariness and physical activity included overall size, space and design of the home; allocation of home space; equipment within the home space; perceived safety of the home space; and the changing nature of the home space. Families reported that children’s activity options were limited when houses and yards were small. In larger homes, multiple indoor living rooms usually housed additional sedentary entertainment options, although parents reported that open plan home layouts could facilitate monitoring of children’s electronic media use. Most families reported changing the allocation and contents of their home space in response to changing priorities and circumstances. CONCLUSIONS: The physical home environment can enhance or limit opportunities for children’s sedentary behaviour and physical activity. However, the home space is a dynamic ecological setting that is amenable to change and is largely shaped by the family living within it, thus differentiating it from other settings. While size and space were considered important, how families prioritise the use of their home space and overcome the challenges posed by the physical environment may be of equal or greater importance in establishing supportive home environments. Further research is required to tease out how physical, social and individual factors interact within the family home space to influence children’s sedentary behaviour and physical activity at home.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildren 3aequipment 3afamily studies 3ahome safety 3ainterviews 3amonitoring 3anitrogen content 3aparents 3aphysical activity 3aqualitative analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3aAustralia1 aStratton, Gareth1 aFoster, Sarah1 aBraham, Rebecca1 aRosenberg, Michael0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.157-157dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-014-0157-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245007900204300001100283500001100294506007600305520104800381592002801429506003701457650001901494650002501513650001401538650001201552650002001564650001001584650001301594650001601607650002401623650001201647650001601659650001001675650001201685650002901697650003101726650002101757700001301778700001701791700001801808773009401826856008101920852000902001655001202010IND60548540520221207115118.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054854052DNAL7 a10.1186/s12986-016-0090-12doi7 aPMC48488432pmcid7 a271275332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ping10aRole of BAF60a/BAF60c in chromatin remodeling and hepatic lipid metabolism  ap. 30.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) complexes play an important role in hepatic lipid metabolism regulating both transcriptional activation and repression. BAF60a is a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes that activates the transcription of fatty acid oxidation genes during fasting/glucagon. BAF60c, another subunit of SWI/SNF complexes, is recruited to form the lipoBAF complex that activates lipogenic genes, promoting lipogenesis and increasing the triglyceride level in response to feeding/insulin. Interestingly, hepatocytes located in the periportal and perivenous zones of the liver display a remarkable heterogeneity in the activity of various enzymes, metabolic functions and gene expression. Especially, fatty-acid oxidation was shown to be mostly periportal, whereas lipogenesis was mostly perivenous. Therefore, the present review highlights the role of of SWI/SNF regulating lipid metabolism under nutritional and hormonal control, which may be associated with hepatocyte heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta oxidation 3abiochemical pathways 3achromatin 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucagon 3ahepatocytes 3ahormonal regulation 3ainsulin 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3asucrose 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 3atriacylglycerols1 aLi, Lulu1 aBao, Zhengxi1 aHuang, Feiruo0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.30-30dBioMed Centralx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-016-0090-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04364naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245017200189300001800361520208400379592002802463650002002491650002502511650002302536650001602559650001202575650002202587650002002609650001802629650002302647650002202670650001702692650002202709650001302731650001502744650001002759650001402769650001702783650001402800650001602814650001602830650002602846650004702872650001202919650004002931650006002971650005303031650003103084650002103115650003403136650002703170650002003197650003403217650000903251650005503260650005203315650003003367651001003397700003103407700002603438700001903464773011403483856004803597852000903645655001203654IND50067780220221116142131.0130712e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006778022DNAL7 a233450642pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-013-0359-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKannan, Alagarsamy10aEffect of feeding of calcium hydroxide-treated or vitamin E-supplemented cottonseed meal on plasma gossypol levels, blood parameters, and performance of Bikaneri lambs  ap. 1289-1295.  aTo study the effect of feeding calcium hydroxide-treated or vitamin E-supplemented cottonseed meal (CSM) incorporated diets on plasma gossypol, blood parameters and animal performance, 24 male Bikaneri lambs of 6-7 months of age and of uniform body weight were divided into four groups of six animals each in a completely randomized design and respectively fed isonitrogenous and isocaloric concentrate mixtures containing 20 % soybean meal (CON) or 40 % raw CSM (RCSM), 40 % raw CSM supplemented with 500 IU of vitamin E per head per day (ERCSM), and 40 %, 1.5 % calcium hydroxide-treated CSM (CaCSM) along with ad libitum wheat straw throughout 510 days of experimental feeding. The lambs on all the diets grew linearly throughout the experimental period. The total weight gain, in turn the average daily gain (ADG), was not affected by dietary variations. The daily intake of dry matter, crude protein (CP), digestible crude protein (DCP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) were found comparable among lambs of all the groups. Though total gossypol intake was similar in RCSM, ECSM and CaCSM groups, however, free gossypol intake was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in RCSM, ECSM groups as compared to CaCSM group. Serum iron and blood hemoglobin levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in RCSM group as compared to CaCSM and CON groups, and ALT activity was significantly (P < 0.05) higher on RCSM group as compared to other groups. Plasma gossypol and osmotic fragility of erythrocytes were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in RCSM group as compared to CaCSM and ERCSM groups. However, there was no significant difference in the concentration of other blood/serum biochemical constituents among the lambs on different groups. Based on the results, it may be concluded that feeding of 40 % CSM in the concentrate mixture of the diet in Bikaneri lambs did not have any major adverse effect in blood parameters and animal performance. Either calcium hydroxide treatment or vitamin E supplementation did not produce any major additional benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal performance 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acottonseed meal 3acrude protein 3adigestible protein 3adry matter intake 3aerythrocytes 3afeed concentrates 3agossypol 3ahemoglobin 3alambs 3anutrients 3asoybean meal 3avitamin E 3aweight gain 3awheat straw 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxveterinary 2aCalcium Hydroxidexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxveterinary 2aCottonseed Oilxmetabolism 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplementsxanalysis 2aErythrocytesxcytology 2aGossypolxblood 2aHematologic Testsxveterinary 2aMale 2aSheep, Domesticxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0aIndia1 aSastry, Vadali Rama Bhadra1 aAgrawal, Dinesh Kumar1 aKumar, Avneesh0 tTropical animal health and production.g2013 Aug., v. 45, no. 6 p.1289-1295dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-013-0359-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245008100212520144900293592002801742650002001770650002201790650002901812650000901841650001501850650001501865650002501880650002501905650001301930650001501943650001101958650001701969651001801986653001402004653002002018700006402038700002202102773012502124856008302249852000902332655001202341IND60654392120221118053634.0190807e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065439212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2019.1066152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurchfield, Emily K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0459-627014aThe impact of agricultural landscape diversification on U.S. crop production  aThe last century has seen a dramatic simplification of global landscapes, driven largely by the expansion and intensification of agriculture. Landscape simplification has known negative impacts on ecosystem health and function; however, less is known about how landscape simplification affects agricultural production. There is mounting field-scale evidence that simplification can reduce agricultural production by eroding the ecosystem processes on which agricultural systems depend; however, many of these processes emerge not at the field scale, but from complex interactions between land use, biophysical context, and human activity at the landscape scale. This research uses hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the relationship between landscape-scale agricultural diversity and the yields of corn, soy, and winter wheat in the coterminous United States. We find that the yields of corn and winter wheat increase by as much as 20% in highly diversified agricultural systems. Our findings also indicate that (1) crop production is more responsive to the number of distinct crop types cultivated on a landscape than their cultivated extent and that (2) increasing diversity in agricultural systems that are already diverse brings the highest yield gains. Our models provide strong evidence at national and regional scales that agricultural diversification—an intervention with known ecosystem benefits—can increase crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aagricultural land 3aanthropogenic activities 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental impact 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3awinter wheat 3aUnited States 0aDiversity 0aCrop production1 aNelson, Katherine S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4240-54741 aSpangler, Kaitlyn0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 285 p.106615-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.1066153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012300165300001600288506011700304506007600421520183000497592002802327506003702355650002902392650001802421650001302439650001202452650001802464650004302482650002002525650000902545650002202554650002402576653001202600653002902612653002202641653001802663653002002681653001002701700001302711700001502724700001502739700001702754700001802771700005402789700001502843700001602858773017402874856008403048852000903132655001203141IND60773287420221207052230.0220502e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077328742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2022.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yiqing10aEffects of Tai Chi on health outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 108-120.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo explore the effects and dose–response relationship of Tai Chi for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to evaluate the methodological quality of the included trials and evidence quality of the outcomes. Nine major English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of Tai Chi for T2DM from inception to December 2021. The effects and dose–response relationships were assessed with a meta-analysis and meta-regression using Stata.16. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the risk of bias tool. The evidence quality of the outcomes was assessed using the GRADE tool. A total of 24 studies with 1314 patients were included. Compared with the usual care, Tai Chi improved HbA1c (MD = −0.80%, 95% CI [−1.05, −0.54], P < .001, I² = 18.29%, very low–quality evidence), FBG (SMD = −0.58, 95% CI [−0.86, −0.31], P < .001, I² = 53.2%, low-quality evidence), fasting insulin (FIN), diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and the outcomes of quality of life (QoL) in patients with T2DM. However, when Tai Chi was compared with other exercise, there was no between-group difference in the HbA1c, FBG, TC, TG, HDL, LDL, BMI, and waist circumference (WC). Furthermore, the findings showed that an increase at every 18 weeks in length or an 823-h increase in the total time of Tai Chi intervention resulted in approximately a one unit reduction in the SMD of FBG. Compared with usual care, Tai Chi may improve HbA1c (with clinical significance), FBG, FIN, BMI, diastolic blood pressure, and outcomes of QoL in T2DM patients. The effects of Tai Chi were similar to those of other exercises on the HbA1c, FBG, TC, TG, HDL, LDL, BMI, and WC. Given the overall poor methodological quality and evidence quality, these findings should be treated cautiously.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adose response 3aexercise 3ainsulin 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aquality of life 3arisk 3asystematic review 3awaist circumference 0aTai Chi 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aSystematic review 0aMeta-analysis 0aDose–response 0aGRADE1 aLiu, Xin1 aZhao, Anni1 aMao, Junru1 aGuo, Xiangyu1 aLi, Guangzong1 aYang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5299-82531 aWu, Yingqi1 aFei, Yutong0 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2022 Apr., v. 9, no. 2 p.108-120dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2022.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01246naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006100164300001600225520035600241592002800597650001400625650001700639650002000656650002600676650001400702651001100716700002300727773011100750856007400861852000900935655001200944IND60440215420221119114247.0151024e199903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044021542DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029794102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Wulf-Peter10aEnvironmental considerations on battery-housing recovery  ap. 107-112.  aA simplified LCA is conducted hased on the methodology of simplified LCAs according to SETAC (Europe).

We also investigate the factors that impact the convergence of per capita carbon dioxide emissions in each sector. The results show that per capita carbon dioxide emissions in all sectors converged across provinces from 1996 to 2010. Factors that impact the convergence of per capita carbon dioxide emissions in each sector vary: GDP (gross domestic product) per capita, industrialization process and population density impact convergence in the Industry sector, while GDP per capita and population density impact convergence in the Transportation, Storage, Postal, and Telecommunications Services sector. Aside from GDP per capita and population density, trade openness also impacts convergence in the Wholesale, Retail, Trade, and Catering Service sector. Population density is the only factor that impacts convergence in the Residential Consumption sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatering 3aemissions 3agross domestic product 3aindustrialization 3apopulation density 3atelecommunications 3atrade 3atransportation 3aChina 0aCarbon dioxide emissions 0aConvergence 0aSector analysis 0aQ53 0aO4701 aZhang, Kezhong0 tEnergy.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 65 p.605-611dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009100171300001800262520115400280592002801434650001201462650001101474650002101485650001101506650002101517650000701538650001101545650001401556650002201570650001101592650003001603650001401633650001301647650001801660651001401678651001801692653000901710653001801719653001801737700002401755700001901779700002001798700002501818700002401843700002101867700001901888773010901907856008402016852000902100655001202109IND60285704520221120065705.0150630e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6028570452DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.9056902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombo, Juan C.10aSeasonal and inter-annual variability of water quality in the Uruguay River, Argentina  ap. 1155-1163.  aWater quality of the Uruguay River was evaluated with multi-parametric (temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen) and sediment trap data (particle flux, total organic carbon and nitrogen contents) and correlated to precipitation, river discharge and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices for the period 2006–2011. Hydro-meteorological parameters averaged 24–85% variability with coincident precipitation (200–400 mm month ⁻¹), discharge (7000–28 000 m ³ s ⁻¹) and turbidity peaks (50–80 NTU) in the austral spring, and absolute maxima during the El Niño 2009 episode. Spectral analysis of discharge and sea-surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) showed consistent variance maxima at approx. 3 and 1.5 years. Deseasonalized discharge was significantly correlated to SSTA. During river floods, pH decreased (from 7.5 to 6.6) and particle dynamics peaked (turbidity: 15–80 NTU; vertical fluxes: 20–200 g m ⁻² d ⁻¹; total solid load: <1000 to 100 000 t d ⁻¹),whereas TOC remained stable (3.2 ± 0.8%) and C/N ratios increased (10–12) due to the higher contribution of terrestrial detritus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3acarbon 3adissolved oxygen 3afloods 3anitrogen content 3apH 3arivers 3asediments 3aspectral analysis 3aspring 3asurface water temperature 3aturbidity 3avariance 3awater quality 3aArgentina 3aUruguay River 0aENSO 0awater quality 0aUruguay River1 aSkorupka, Carlos N.1 aBilos, Claudio1 aTatone, Leandro1 aCappelletti, Natalia1 aCarolina Migoya, M.1 aAstoviza, Malena1 aSperanza, Eric0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2015 June 3, v. 60, no. 6 p.1155-1163dTaylor & Francisx2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.9056903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245019200174300001600366500001500382520138800397592002801785650001001813650001301823650001101836650002101847650001201868650001001880650000901890650001601899650001701915650001501932650001901947650001501966653001501981653001101996700002802007700002302035700001802058700001902076773010302095856008402198852000902282655001202291IND60090133920221121153322.0141102e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009013392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelinskaya, Tatyana10aDifferences in amino acid residues in the binding pockets dictate substrate specificities of mouse senescence marker protein-30, human paraoxonase1, and squid diisopropylfluorophosphatase  ap. 701-710.  a2019-12-06  aSenescence marker protein-30 (SMP-30) is a candidate enzyme that can function as a catalytic bioscavenger of organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents. We purified SMP-30 from mouse (Mo) liver and compared its hydrolytic activity towards various esters, lactones, and G-type nerve agents with that of human paraoxonase1 (Hu PON1) and squid diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase). All three enzymes contain one or two metal ions in their active sites and fold into six-bladed β-propeller structures. While Hu PON1 hydrolyzed a variety of lactones, the only lactone that was a substrate for Mo SMP-30 was d-(+)-gluconic acid δ-lactone. Squid DFPase was much more efficient at hydrolyzing DFP and G-type nerve agents as compared to Mo SMP-30 or Hu PON1. The Kₘ values for DFP were in the following order: Mo SMP-30>Hu PON1>squid DFPase, suggesting that the efficiency of DFP hydrolysis may be related to its binding in the active sites of these enzymes. Thus, homology modeling and docking were used to simulate the binding of DFP and selected δ-lactones in the active sites of Hu SMP-30, Hu PON1, and squid DFPase. Results from molecular modeling studies suggest that differences in metal–ligand coordinations, the hydrophobicity of the binding pockets, and limited space in the binding pocket due to the presence of a loop, are responsible for substrate specificities of these enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3alactones 3ahumans 3amolecular models 3aenzymes 3asquid 3amice 3aamino acids 3aactive sites 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3ametal ions 0asenescence 0aesters1 aPattabiraman, Nagarajan1 adiTargiani, Robert1 aChoi, Moonsuk1 aSaxena, Ashima0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 May, v. 1824, no. 5 p.701-710dElsevier B.V.x1570-96397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008000164500002200244520090300266592002801169650001501197650002001212650001101232650001001243650001001253653002401263653001101287653002401298700002201322700002201344773011801366856008301484852000901567655001201576IND60654392420221118053518.0190725e20190712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065439242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Kailun10aCommon sampling orders of regular vines with application to model selection  aPre-press version  aThe selection of vine structure to represent dependencies in a data set with a regular vine copula model is still an open question. Up to date, the most popular heuristic to choose the vine structure is to construct consecutive trees by capturing largest correlations in lower trees. However, this might not lead to the optimal vine structure. A new heuristic based on sampling orders implied by regular vines is investigated. The idea is to start with an initial vine structure, that can be chosen with any existing procedure and search for a regular vine copula representing the data better within vines having 2 common sampling orders with this structure. Several algorithms are proposed to support the new heuristic. Both in the simulation study and real data analysis, the potential of the new heuristic to find a structure fitting the data better than the initial vine copula model, is shown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3amodels 3atrees 3avines 0aDependence modeling 0aCopula 0aRegular vine copula1 aKurowicka, Dorota1 aNane, Gabriela F.0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2019 July 12,  p.106811-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011600162300001600278520129700294592002801591596007701619596005801696596005801754596006801812596006401880650002101944650001601965650001601981650001501997650002502012650001802037650002602055650002402081650001002105650003502115650002202150650001102172650001202183650002102195650004302216650005202259650001402311650001002325650001002335650002002345650001602365700001302381700001602394700001702410700002002427700001702447700001202464773015402476856008202630852000902712655001202721IND60611338620221123001229.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061133862DNAL7 a10.1007/s40626-018-0116-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuang10aABCF3 regulates the expression of aquaporin genes and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes in Arabidopsis  ap. 215-222.  aThe ATP-binding cassette (ABC) F/GCN (general control non-derepressible) subfamily is a group of soluble ABC proteins that has two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) but no transmembrane domains (TMDs). Previous study has indicated that ABCF3, also called GCN20/SCORD5, is involved in stress-associated protein translation control and defense responses to bacterial infection. Here, we show that ABCF3 regulates H₂O₂ uptake and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses in Arabidopsis. ABCF3 expressed mainly in leaves, stems, root tips, seeds, and anther. Analysis of abcf3 mutants and transgenic overexpressors (OX) of ABCF3 indicates that ABCF3 regulates H₂O₂ uptake. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that ABCF3 affects the expression of several aquaporin genes that were involved in H₂O₂ uptake in plants. In addition, abcf3 mutants exhibited enhanced sensitivity to ER stress and amino acid deprivation when challenged with ER stress inducers tunicamycin and amino acid synthesis inhibitor chlorsulfuron compared to wild type. Overexpression of AtABCF3 increases, whereas, abcf3 mutants depress the expression of ER stress-related genes. Taken together, these results indicated that ABCF3 regulates stress response by modulating aquaporin gene expression and ER stress responses.  aPublisher supplied data  a(2016YFC0501901)cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a(31772383cChina National Natural Sciences Foundation  a31272239)cChina National Natural Sciences Foundation  a(2017-ZJ-Y20)cQinghai innovation platform construction project  a(2014HB043)cYunnan Province Foundation for academic leader 3aABC transporters 3aArabidopsis 3aamino acids 3aaquaporins 3abacterial infections 3achlorsulfuron 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amutants 3aplant physiology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroot tips 3aseeds 3astems 3astress response 3atunicamycin1 aLi, Dong1 aZhang, Ping1 aWang, Ruling1 aSun, Liangliang1 aWan, Jinpeng1 aXu, Jin0 tTheoretical and Experimental Plant Physiology.g2018 Sept., v. 30, no. 3 p.215-222dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22892x2197-00257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40626-018-0116-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010900171300001800280520130600298592002801604650000801632650002401640650001901664650001501683650001901698650001601717650001101733650002401744650002901768650002101797650002001818650001501838650001201853650002201865650001201887650001101899651001201910653002701922653002101949653001701970653002101987653002902008653002202037700002002059700001802079700002802097773009102125856008402216852000902300655001202309IND60604541420221120045128.0180717e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060454142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Oussama10aAir source heat pump water heater: Dynamic modeling, optimal energy management and mini-tubes condensers  ap. 1102-1116.  aThis paper presents a dynamic simulation model to predict the performance of an ASHPWH (air source heat pump water heater). The developed model is used to assess its performance in the Lebanese context. It is shown that for the four Lebanese climatic zones, the expected monthly values of the average COP (coefficient of performance) varies from 2.9 to 5, leading to high efficiencies compared with conventional electric water heaters. The energy savings and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reduction are investigated for each zone. Furthermore, it is recommended to use the ASHPWH during the period of highest daily ambient temperatures (noon or afternoon), assuming that the electricity tariff and hot water loads are constant. In addition, an optimal management model for the ASHPWH is developed and applied for a typical winter day of Beirut. Moreover, the developed dynamic model of ASHPWH is used to compare the performance of three similar systems that differ only with the condenser geometry, where results show that using mini-condenser geometries increase the COP (coefficient of performance) and consequently, more energy is saved as well as more GHG emissions are reduced. In addition, the condenser “surface compactness” is increased giving rise to an efficient compact heat exchanger.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aclimatic zones 3acondensers 3adynamic models 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat exchangers 3aheat pumps 3aheaters 3asimulation models 3atariffs 3awinter 3aLebanon 0aHeat pump water heater 0aDynamic modeling 0aOptimization 0aLebanese context 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aEnergy management1 aFardoun, Farouk1 aYounes, Rafic1 aLouahlia-Gualous, Hasna0 tEnergy.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 64 p.1102-1116dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007700162300001400239520099200253592002801245650002501273650003301298650001901331773010901350856007401459852000901533655001201542IND60440215820221119114231.0151024e199903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044021582DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029794062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwens, J.

This contrasts with a SETAC definition of LCIA that is less than five years old. This commentary discusses the two themes that underlie this change in terms and definitions. The first theme is the arrival of a consensus that current LCIA indicators do not describe actual environmental impacts or effects. The second theme is the recognition that some of the ways used to generate indicators results in subjective scores while other ways involve highly simplified assumptions about complex environmental processes. The outcome of the new description is a new emphasis on LCIA transparency. Both the environmental relevance and the scientific basis of each indicator must now be described according to ISO. This increased transparency is essential for decision makers to understand the usefulness of LCIA indicators in making decisions and for audiences to understand what an LCA does or does not say about a product system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3alife cycle impact assessment 3aproduct system0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g1999 Mar., v. 4, no. 2 p.81-86dEcomedx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029794063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008000169500002200249520160900271592002801880650002401908650002301932650001901955650001101974650001501985650001302000650002502013653002102038653001402059653002702073653001502100653002602115653002302141653002202164653001302186653002802199653001702227653001002244653001602254653002402270700001902294700002402313773011802337856008302455852000902538655001202547IND60654392620221118053604.0190725e20190708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065439262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJentsch, Carsten10aTime-dependent Poisson reduced rank models for political text data analysis  aPre-press version  aWe consider Poisson reduced rank models where parameters depend on time. Our main motivation comes from studies in comparative politics where one wants to locate party positions in a certain political space. For this purpose, several empirical methods have been proposed using text as data sources. As the data structure of texts is very complex, its analysis to extract information is generally a difficult task. Furthermore, political texts usually contain a large number of words such that a simultaneous analysis of word counts becomes challenging. In this paper, we consider Poisson models for each word count simultaneously and provide a statistical method suitable to analyze political text data. We consider a novel model which allows the political lexicon to change over time and develop an estimation procedure based on LASSO and fused LASSO penalization techniques to address high-dimensionality via significant dimension reduction. This model gives insights into the potentially changing use of words by left and right-wing parties over time. The procedure allows to identify automatically those words having a discriminating effect between party positions. To address the dependence structure of word counts over time, we propose integer-valued time series processes to implement a suitable bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals for the model parameters. We apply our approach to party manifesto data from German parties over seven federal elections after German reunification. The approach does not require any a priori information nor expert knowledge to process the data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3aempirical research 3aexpert opinion 3amodels 3amotivation 3apolitics 3atime series analysis 0aParty manifestos 0aText data 0aTerm document matrices 0aCount data 0aHigh-dimensional data 0aPolitical spectrum 0aPolitical lexicon 0aWordfish 0aINAR time series models 0aPenalization 0aLASSO 0aFused LASSO 0aDimension reduction1 aLee, Eun Ryung1 aMammen, E.q(Enno),0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2019 July 08,  p.106813-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007600147245011100223300001600334520138300350592002801733650001801761650002101779650001101800650001601811650001201827650001401839650001401853650002001867650001101887650001401898650001701912650001301929650001601942700003001958700002701988700002502015773015402040856008202194852000902276655001202285IND60611338720221123001328.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061133872DNAL7 a10.1007/s40626-018-0114-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Assis-Gomes, Mara de Menezes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9204-188310aExogenous brassinosteroid application delays senescence and promotes hyponasty in Carica papaya L. leaves  ap. 193-201.  aThe application of brassinosteroids (BR) is associated with increased tolerance to various stresses such as those induced by pathogens, temperature, salinity and drought. Here, we studied the influence of BRs analogues on the leaf senescence of papaya juvenile plants. The objective was to determine whether BRs affect plant growth and leaf senescence by promoting or inhibiting the degradation of chlorophyll and/or leaf abscission. Two-month-old plants were divided into five treatments: C (control without BR application); BRWC (BR applied in the whole canopy); BRL1 (BR applied in the youngest fully expanded leaf, L1); BRL2 (BR applied in L2 which is the secondly more mature leaf in relation to L1) and BRL3 (BR applied in L3 which is the third more mature leaf in relation to L2). We concluded that BRs do not interfere with the senescence of the youngest leaf (L1) but in older leaves (L3) BRWC maintains the leaves greener and attached to the plant for a longer time when compared to the leaves from the other treatments. BR application in whole-canopy increased the plant height, and it caused a delay in leaf senescence and, consequently, in leaf abscission. In addition, hyponastic leaves developed after BR-application in the whole-canopy. The senescence process and leaf abscission in papaya, stimulated by exogenous BRs, were directly related to leaf age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3abrassinosteroids 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3ahyponasty 3ajuveniles 3aleaf abscission 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aplant height 3asalinity 3atemperature1 aPinheiro, Daniel Teixeira1 aBressan-Smith, Ricardo1 aCampostrini, Eliemar0 tTheoretical and Experimental Plant Physiology.g2018 Sept., v. 30, no. 3 p.193-201dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22892x2197-00257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40626-018-0114-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04246naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245012900213300001100342506007600353520214800429592002802577506003702605650004302642650001102685650001202696650002502708650001802733650000902751650002002760650001502780650003402795650001102829650001502840650001202855650001102867650002802878650000902906650001202915650001202927650002302939650001202962650000902974650001202983650001302995650002403008650000903032650002603041650003503067650001103102650001603113650001103129650000803140650001503148650002203163700002603185700002103211700002603232700003203258700002903290700002103319773009403340856008103434852000903515655001203524IND60548541020221207115127.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054854102DNAL7 a10.1186/s12986-016-0092-z2doi7 aPMC48679802pmcid7 a271862332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoochakpoor, Gelareh14aThe effect of interaction between Melanocortin-4 receptor polymorphism and dietary factors on the risk of metabolic syndrome  ap. 35.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Controversial data is available on the effect of the Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) gene variation on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and ineffectiveness of diet in managing MetS. Effects of the interaction between MC4R polymorphism and dietary factors on MetS were investigated in this study. METHODS: Subjects of this nested case-control study were selected from among participants of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. Each case (n = 815) was pair matched randomly with a control by age (±5 years) and sex from among those who had not developed ≥1 MetS components at the time that the corresponding case developed MetS. Dietary patterns were determined using factor analysis on 25 foods groups using a valid and reliable, 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). MC4R rs12970134 were genotyped by Tetra-Primer ARMS-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Adjusted conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the interactions of SNP with quartiles of dietary factors in relation to MetS. MetS was defined by the modified National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment panel III. RESULTS: Two dietary patterns were extracted. The healthy dietary pattern was loaded heavily on vegetables, legumes, low fat dairy, whole grains, liquid oils and fruits; the western dietary pattern consisted of a high intake of soft drinks, fast foods, sweets, solid oils, red meats, salty snacks, refined grains, high fat dairy, tea and coffee, eggs and poultry. Among A allele carriers, being in the highest quartiles of western dietary pattern score and saturated fatty acid intake had an increased risk of MetS, compared to those in the lowest quartile (P trend = 0.007). Saturated fatty acid intake could modulate the association of A allele carriers of MC4R with MetS (P interaction = 0.03). A significant interaction was observed between rs12970134 with total fat and iron intake on the risk of abdominal obesity (P interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an interaction between rs12970134 and western dietary pattern, fat and vegetable intakes on the risk of MetS or its components.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Cholesterol Education Program 3aadults 3aalleles 3acase-control studies 3aeating habits 3aeggs 3afactor analysis 3afast foods 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruits 3agenotyping 3aglucose 3agrains 3ahigh fat dairy products 3airon 3alegumes 3aliquids 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3aoils 3apoultry 3ared meat 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asaturated fatty acids 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asnacks 3asoft drinks 3asweets 3atea 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods1 aDaneshpour, Maryam S.1 aMirmiran, Parvin1 aHosseini, Seyed Ahmad1 aHosseini-Esfahani, Firoozeh1 aSedaghatikhayat, Bahareh1 aAzizi, Fereidoun0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.35-35dBioMed Centralx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-016-0092-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009300173300001400266520170400280592002801984650002302012650001802035650001702053650002302070650001302093650001202106650001202118650001002130650001202140650001002152651001102162653003402173653002502207653002602232653003202258653003302290653001102323700002102334700002202355773010502377856008502482852000902567655001202576IND50066039020221120031719.0190215e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006603902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevenson, Todd C.10aSocioeconomic consequences of fishing displacement from marine protected areas in Hawaii  ap. 50-58.  aMarine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented across the globe to protect marine biodiversity, critical habitats, and to enhance commercially harvested fish stocks. Although ecological effects of MPAs are well documented, their impacts on fishing communities and the spatial distribution of fishing effort remains elusive and poorly understood. In 1999, a MPA network was implemented to protect against perceived declines of reef fish harvested for the aquarium trade on the island of Hawaii. We investigated how the MPA network altered the spatial distribution of fishing effort and impacted perceived fisher socioeconomic well-being and fishing operations, as well as if the economic and catch benefits offset costs in the newly established non-MPA fishing areas. Data were collected using social surveys, experimental fishing, and catch reports. The results suggest the MPA network significantly displaced fishing effort from the central to the northern and southern coastal regions of the island farther from ports of entry. Estimated catch revenues and experimental catch per unit effort were statistically greater as distance from port of entry increased. Perceived fisher socioeconomic well-being was unaffected, but perceived fishing cost and travel time increased significantly post-MPA network implementation. Although the MPA network displaced fishing effort, fisher socioeconomic well-being was not compromised likely because they expanded their operating range and favorable market factors helped offset potential economic losses. Our findings are relevant because they help clarify how MPA networks alter spatial fishing behavior and impact the well-being of small-scale fishers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3aaquarium fish 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3aislands 3amarkets 3areefs 3asurveys 3atrade 3aHawaii 0aMarine protected areas (MPAs) 0aFishing displacement 0aSocioeconomic impacts 0aMarine ornamental fisheries 0aSpatial fisheries management 0aHawaii1 aTissot, Brian N.1 aWalsh, William J.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Apr., v. 160 p.50-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011600163300001800279520025800297592002800555650002600583650002100609650002100630650002300651650003100674650001300705653001600718653002000734653002400754653002900778700001500807773011200822856008400934852000901018655001201027IND60599546720221118144020.0180702e20141105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059954672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.09.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Bin10aProton transfer-assisted host–guest complexation between a difunctional pillar[5]arene and amine-based guests  ap. 6274-6276.  aProton transfer from a difunctional pillar[5]arene containing two carboxylic acid moieties to amine-based guests occurs in the host–guest complexation.

We previously demonstrated that insertion of foreign epitope tags in the C-terminus of PCV2 ORF2 produced infectious virions that elicited humoral immune responses against both PCV2 capsid and inserted epitope tags. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the non-pathogenic chimeric virus PCV1-2a, which is the basis for the licensed PCV2 vaccine Fostera™ PCV, can express PRRSV antigenic epitopes, thus generating dual immunity as a potential bivalent vaccine against both PCV2 and PPRSV. Four different linear B-cell antigenic epitopes of PRRSV were inserted into the C-terminus of the capsid gene of the PCV1-2a vaccine virus. We showed that insertion of 12 (PRRSV-GP2 epitope II, PRRSV-GP3 epitope I, and PRRSV-GP5 epitope I), and 14 (PRRSV-GP5 epitope IV) amino acid residues did not impair the replication of the resulting PCV1-2a-PRRSVEPI chimeric viruses in vitro. The four chimeric PCV1-2a viruses expressing PRRSV B-cell linear epitopes were successfully rescued and characterized. An immunogenicity study in pigs revealed that two of the four chimeric viruses, PCV1-2a-PRRSVEPIGP3IG and PCV1-2a-PRRSVEPIEPIGP5IV, elicited neutralizing antibodies against PRRSV VR2385 as well as PCV2 (strains PCV2a, PCV2b, and mPCV2b). The results have important implications for exploring the potential use of PCV1-2a vaccine virus as a live virus vector to develop bivalent MLVs against both PCV2 and PRRSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aamino acids 3acapsid 3aepitopes 3agenes 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunogenicity 3amixed infection 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aprotein tagging 3aswine 3avaccines 3avirion 3aviruses 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 0aPorcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) 0aBivalent modified live-attenuated vaccine (MLV) 0aChimeric PCV1-2 vaccine1 aKenney, Scott P.1 aGiménez-Lirola, Luis G.1 aHeffron, C.

Its ecotoxicological significance is well known and, therefore, the compound is often required to be removed prior to discharge. In this study, plant-bacterial synergism was established in floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) in an attempt to maximize the removal of phenol from contaminated water. A common wetland plant, Typha domingensis, was vegetated on a floating mat and augmented with three phenol-degrading bacterial strains, Acinetobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus cereus LORH97, and Pseudomonas sp. LCRH90, to develop FTWs for the remediation of water contaminated with phenol. All of the strains are known to have phenol-reducing properties, and grow well in FTWs. Results showed that T. domingensis was able to remove a small amount of phenol from the contaminated water; however, bacterial augmentation enhanced the removal potential significantly, i.e., 0.146 g/m²/day vs. 0.166 g/m²/day, respectively. Plant biomass also increased in the presence of bacterial consortia; and inoculated bacteria displayed successful colonization/survival in the rhizosphere, root interior and shoot interior of the plant. Similarly, highest reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD₅), and total organic carbon (TOC) was achieved by the combined application of plants and bacteria. The study demonstrates that the plant-bacterial synergism in a FTW may be a more effective approach for the remediation of phenol-contaminated water.  aHigher Education Commission, Government of Pakistan (20–3854/R&D/340 HEC/14).

Such attributes give this archipelago a special significance for the conservation of Odonata in the Neotropics. However, despite the importance of these islands, inadequately surveyed regions persist, mainly in the Greater Antilles, and there is not enough information to set IUCN threat categories for eight species supposed to be at risk, which are currently classified as data deficient (DD). To update the distribution of endangered (EN), vulnerable (VU) and DD species, we conducted a series of field surveys in Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Cuba, and compiled data from literature, museum collections as well as personal communications. We sampled a total of 37 species, including Microneura caligata, Phylolestes ethelae and Hypolestes clara (EN); H. trinitatis (VU); and Diceratobasis macrogaster, Neoneura maria and Protoneura capillaris (DD). We provide new locality records for M. caligata, N. carnatica (DD), N. maria (DD), P. capillaris, H. clara, H. trinitatis and Erythrodiplax bromeliicola (DD). According to our results, we suggest changing the category of D. macrogaster, D. melanogaster, N. carnatica, N. maria and P. capillaris to VU.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdonata 3aislands 3arisk 3asurveys 3atropics 3aCaribbean 3aCuba 3aDominican Republic 3aJamaica 0aOdonata 0adragonfly 0aWest Indies 0adistribution 0aconservation1 aTrapero-Quintana, Adrian D.1 aLorenzo-Carballa, M.

However, strategies must be developed to overcome the unfavourable plant growth conditions that these substrates present and to optimize Ni yields. In this study, the Ni hyperaccumulators Alyssum serpyllifolium, Alyssum inflatum, and Alyssum bracteatum were evaluated for their Ni phytoextraction efficiency from quarry tailings. Effects of two organic amendments, composted municipal sewage sludge and cow manure, on plant growth and physiological status and Ni removal were determined. Organic amendments were incorporated at two addition rates (5% and 20% w/w). The best-performing hyperaccumulators were A. inflatum and A. serpyllifolium. Organic amendments improved plant biomass production, photosynthetic efficiency and nutrition, but reduced shoot Ni concentrations. However, the stimulation in biomass resulted in significantly enhanced Ni yields. The most promising results were found using low addition rates and after manure incorporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acattle manure 3ahyperaccumulators 3amine tailings 3anickel 3anutrition 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological state 3aphytoaccumulation 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aquarries 3aserpentine 3asewage sludge 0aAlyssum 0aNi hyperaccumulator 0aorganic amendment 0aphytoextraction 0aserpentine quarry1 aGhaderian, Seyed Majid1 aMonterroso, Carmela1 aKidd, Petra S.0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 June 7, v. 20, no. 7 p.699-708dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.14133353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007500171300001600246500001500262520142400277592002801701650001901729650001301748650001501761650002601776650001501802650002401817650001001841650001101851650001001862650000901872651001001881653002501891653002601916773008501942856004802027852000902075655001202084IND50068675320221118085646.0130820e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006867532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-012-9461-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTutu, Raymond Asare10aSelf-rated resilience among young migrants in old Fadama, Accra, Ghana  ap. 709-725.  a2019-12-06  aA number of young people from the north of Ghana migrate to live in the slums of the city of Accra, the administrative capital. These slums, characterized by poor quality housing, and inadequate sanitary facilities, make the young migrants vulnerable to the effects of economic, social, political and environmental insecurities and stressors. One of such slums is Old Fadama, which is located in the heart of the city. The main objective of this paper is to explain how resilient a sample of young migrants are to the stressors encountered at the slum through a self-rated level of resilience. Drawing on resilience thinking, the Youth Resilience Framework and Social Resilience perspectives are discussed and variables for analysis are considered from their synthesis. A survey questionnaire instrument is used to collect data from 104 young migrant residents in the slum. The methods of analysis include: analyses of variance, Chi-square test, and ordinal regression. From the multivariate analyses (that is, the ordinal regression analyses), it is suggested that significant predictors of resilience among the sampled young migrants in Old Fadama include type of employment, social capital, number of stressors experienced, and ability to afford medicine. Specific social capital constructs such as having a boy or girlfriend and strong leadership are predictors of resilience among these young migrants in the slum.  aPublisher supplied data 3asocial capital 3amedicine 3aemployment 3asurveying instruments 3aleadership 3aregression analysis 3ayouth 3acities 3aheart 3aboys 3aGhana 0aanalysis of variance 0amultivariate analysis0 tGeoJournal.g2013 Aug., v. 78, no. 4 p.709-725dSpringer-Verlagx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-012-9461-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012500210300001600335506007600351520077100427592002801198506003701226650002101263650001501284650002101299650001801320650002001338650001701358650002501375650002001400650002501420700001901445700001901464700001201483773011001495856008101605852000901686655001201695IND60583106320221207063257.0171008e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058310632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-017-2502-82doi7 aPMC58986122pmcid7 a284881202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Carlos10aEfficient Antibody Assembly in E. coli Periplasm by Disulfide Bond Folding Factor Co-expression and Culture Optimization  ap. 520-529.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMolecular chaperones and protein folding factors of bacterial periplasmic space play important roles in assisting disulfide bond formation and proper protein folding.

By optimizing DsbA/C co-expression, promoter for 3F3 Fab, host strains, and culture media and conditions, a high yield of 30-mg purified 3F3 Fab per liter culture was achieved. Produced 3F3 Fab exhibited binding affinity of 34 nM and inhibition potency of 970 nM.

The aim of the present study was to investigate associations between iron status among one-year-olds and feeding, with focus on the type of milk. Randomly selected healthy infants were prospectively investigated until 1 year of age in two cohorts born 1995-1996 (n = 114) and 2005 (n = 140). Information on birth data, feeding and growth until 12 months and iron status at 12 months was collected. Data from the two cohorts were pooled and the infants categorized into three groups according to their predominant milk consumption at 9 months of age, that is, breast milk, cow's milk or follow-on formula. The prevalence of iron deficiency was highest in the cow's milk group and lowest in the follow-on formula group. According to a linear model, adjusted for gender, birth weight and exclusive breast-feeding duration, cow's milk consumption was negatively associated with serum ferritin (SF) and formula positively, but breast milk not. Predicted SF (μg/l) = 11.652(intercept) - 5.362(boy) + 0.005 × birth weight (g) + 2.826(exclusively breastfed ≥ 4 months) + 0.027 × formula (ml) - 0.022 × cow's milk (ml) + 0.005 × breast milk (ml). Correction for other dietary factors did not change these results. In this pooled analysis, cow's milk intake in late infancy associated negatively, and follow-on formula positively, with iron status.

Penelitian tentang , khususnya bakteri yang terlibat dalam fermentasi , masih belum banyak dilakukan. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk melakukan isolasi dan karakterisasi bakteri asam laktat yang diisolasi dari serta mengevaluasi potensinya sebagai probiotik. Sampel diperoleh dari beberapa industri rumah tangga di Kalimantan Timur, yang dibuat dengan kadar garam 5, 10 dan 15%. Delapan puluh lima isolat bakteri asam laktat diperoleh dari pada hari ke-4, 8 dan 12 fermentasi dan dikaji sifat-sifat probiotiknya. Semua isolat menunjukkan toleransi yang baik terhadap pH rendah (pH 2,0) dengan penurunan jumlah sel hidup kurang dari 2 log cfu/ml. Isolat bakteri asam laktat dapat tumbuh dengan adanya 0,5% garam empedu walaupun jumlah sel hidupnya menurun dibandingkan dengan jumlah sel hidup pada medium tanpa garam empedu. Penurunan jumlah isolat viabel kurang dari 1 log cfu/ml teramati pada 21 isolat. Sembilan belas isolat dapat mentoleransi pH 2,0 dan garam empedu 0,5% lebih baik daripada yang lain dengan total penurunan jumlah sel hidup kurang dari 1 log cfu/ml. Sebagian besar isolat (11 dari 19) yang mentoleransi pH rendah diperoleh dari fermentasi hari ke-8. Isolat MC812 dan MC809 mempunyai sifat antimikroba yang baik terhadap semua patogen uji(ATCC 13932, ATCC 19433, ATCC 10876, ATCC 25922 dan ATCC 14028). Sembilan isolat lain mempunyai sifat antimikroba yang baik terhadap 3 atau lebih patogen uji. Resistensi terhadap antibiotik bervariasi dengan -PCR. Keseluruhan hasil mengindikasikan bahwa kesepuluh bakteri asam laktat yang diisolasi dari mandai berpotensi sebagai probiotik.

This paper compares the matrix method (Barren, 1977, Biometrics33, 414â418; Greenland, 1988a, Statistics in Medicine7, 745â757) and the inverse matrix method (Marshall, 1990, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology43, 941â947) to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that corrects the odds ratio for bias due to a misclassified binary covariate. Under the assumption of differential misclassification, the inverse matrix method is always more efficient than the matrix method; however, the efficiency depends strongly on the values of the sensitivity, specificity, baseline probability of exposure, the odds ratio, caseâcontrol ratio, and validation sampling fraction. In a study on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), an estimate of the asymptotic relative efficiency ( ) of the inverse matrix estimate wasO99, while the matrix method's wasO19. Under nondifferential misclassification, neither the matrix nor the inverse matrix estimator is uniformly more efficient than the other; the efficiencies again depend on the underlying parameters. In the SIDS data, the MLE was more efficient than the matrix method ( ). In a study investigating the effect of vitamin A intake on the incidence of breast cancer, the MLE was more efficient than the matrix method ( ).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3abreast neoplasms 3adeath 3aepidemiological studies 3anutrient intake 3aodds ratio 3avitamin A1 aSpiegelman, Donna0 tBiometrics.g1999 June, v. 55, no. 2 p.338-344dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00338.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007700169300001600246520122800262592002801490650002601518650001101544650001301555650002801568650002701596650001601623653001701639653002601656653002301682653002701705653001001732700001901742700001701761773011301778856008601891852000901977655001201986IND60585484520221117110642.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058548452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Byungun10aTechnology assessment model for sustainable development of LNG terminals  ap. 927-937.  aThe liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry is one of the highest value-added industries, and strategic technology development not only contributes to its growth, but also to the one of national economies. For sustainable technology development, the first step is to accurately diagnose the technological capabilities a firm possesses, based on which the development strategy is established. However, few efforts have been made to identify technology management issues in LNG terminals. Therefore, this study aims to develop a technology assessment system, named K-TOL that assigns a grade according to the level of technologies, using a set of indexes customized to LNG terminals. The K-TOL was applied to a Korean company and its feasibility and utility verified. Academically, this is one of the first attempt to develop a technology assessment system especially for sustainable technology management in LNG terminals. Practically, the K-TOL will be useful for strategic technology planning to improve internal technological capabilities, and can be further developed to a global standard to appraise, evaluate, and certify technology excellence of LNG terminals, contributing to the advances of the LNG industry worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquefied natural gas 3amodels 3aplanning 3asustainable development 3asustainable technology 3avalue added 0aLNG terminal 0aTechnology assessment 0aAssessment indexes 0aSustainable management 0aKorea1 aShin, Juneseuk1 aLee, Sungjoo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.927-937dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245016700178300001400345500001900359520120600378592002801584650002301612650002601635650001501661650001801676650001301694650001001707650003001717650001401747650002001761653001401781653002001795653001901815653001501834653001401849653002001863653001701883653001501900700002901915700003201944700003301976773017702009856008102186852000902267655001202276IND60697886920221119221040.0200607e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2019.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adel Valle de Toro, Antonio10aDescripción de datos clínico-epidemiológicos de pacientes pediátricos con diarrea por Aeromonas spp. y estudio de la sensibilidad antibiótica de dicho agente  ap. 22-26.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of our study was to describe the epidemiological features of pediatric patients with diarrhea caused by Aeromonas spp. and to study the antibiotic susceptibility of this agent during a seven-year period. Aeromonas caviae was identified in 93 stool samples from 52.2% males and 85.6% patients younger than 36 months. The season with the lowest number of isolates was winter (14.4%). Co-infection with other diarrheagenic microorganisms was observed in 31.1% of the cases. The largest number of isolates was obtained from Emergency Department samples (45.6%); 43.3% of the patients presented with fever, 87.8% with diarrhea (43% of these cases were associated with pathological products) and 67.8% with vomiting, while 73.3% of the patients did not require hospital admission. Susceptibility higher than 87% was observed to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime and cefepime. All the patients overcame the infectious process and 63.3% of them did not receive any antibiotic treatment during the process. A. caviae was the isolated species associated with intestinal infection.

Unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing has the capacity to provide high-resolution, continuous spatial data that can be used to detect forest invasion dynamics. In this study, UAS-based RGB and multispectral image data and digital aerial photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) were acquired and used to detect areas of bamboo invasion in a subtropical forest of Southern China. First, a point cloud segmentation (PCS) method was applied for individual tree detection (ITD) using photogrammetric point clouds (PPCs). A random forest (RF) classifier was used to perform tree species classification based on PPC metrics, vegetation indices, and texture metrics. Finally, based on the results of the ITD and tree species classification, alpha-diversity (i.e., the species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener (H’), Simpson (D), and Pielou’s evenness index(J)) and the spatial variation in species composition along the altitude gradient (beta-diversity) in the invaded forests were assessed. Results demonstrated that PCS worked well for tree detection in invaded forests (F₁-score = 80.63%), and the overall accuracy of tree species classification was 75.69%, with a kappa accuracy of 73.76%. The forest diversity analysis showed that all alpha-diversity values were generally predicted well (R² = 0.84–0.91, RMSE = 0.05–0.84). The diversity showed a decreasing tendency with increasing bamboo invasion, and the predominantly broad-leaved invaded forests had higher diversity than the predominantly coniferous invaded forests. The human intervention had a significant impact on bamboo invasion. The ANOVA of the dispersion of the dissimilarities along the elevation gradient showed significant differences in abundance-weighted similarity among the altitude classes (ANOVA of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, F₄,₄₀ = 6.453, P = 0.0004***; ANOVA of the Jaccard dissimilarity, F₄,₄₀ = 5.20, P = 0.0017**). This study indicated the potential benefits of using UAS- based remote sensing data to identify tree species and predict forest diversity in bamboo-invaded forests. Our results suggested that tree species diversity can be directly estimated using individual tree detection results based on PPC data instead of modelling the relationship between field-measured indices and remote sensing data-derived metrics, and revealed the influence of human intervention on bamboo invasion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3aaerial photogrammetry 3aaltitude 3aasexual reproduction 3abamboos 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3amultispectral imagery 3aspatial data 3aspecies richness 3atexture 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aChina 0aBamboo invasion 0aUAS 0aTree species classification 0aAlpha-diversity 0aBeta-diversity1 aWang, Anke1 aZhang, Sujiong1 aZhu, Zhenxian1 aBi, Yufang1 aWang, Yukui1 aDu, Xuhua0 tITC journal.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 104 p.102587-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.1025873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03490naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245016300172520188000335592002802215650001902243650001502262650001302277650001102290650001302301650001102314650001002325650001502335650002202350650001702372650001502389653001002404653001002414653002702424653001502451653001902466653002702485653001302512653001302525653002102538653002102559700005602580700002102636700001902657700001902676700005802695773012002753856009002873852000902963655001202972IND60736099920221121170917.0220314e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073609992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Sandra10aNondestructive simultaneous prediction of internal browning disorder and quality attributes in ‘Rocha’ pear (Pyrus communis L.) using VIS-NIR spectroscopy  aThis study explores the possibility of predicting the soluble solids content (SSC), firmness and the presence of internal browning disorders in ‘Rocha’ pear (Pyrus communis L.) using a single VIS-NIR spectroscopic measurement in semi-transmittance mode. The spectroscopic measurement setup was developed to mimic real world conditions and takes into account geometry and technical requirements of a commercial fruit sorting optical module. The randomness of the fruit position during the spectra acquisition was simulated by sampling each fruit on four sides. Calibration models for internal quality properties were built using individual and/or average side spectra. The results show that models using the spectrum of each side as an individual sample only under-perform slightly relatively to the models based on spectra averages, which are common in the laboratory but very difficult to implement on an automated grading line. The performance of PLS, SVM and Ridge Regression models was compared for the prediction of SSC and firmness. Multiple types of spectra pre-processing were computed and the best combination of model and pre-processing method identified. The lowest RMSEP results for SSC and firmness were 0.7% (R² = 0.71) and 7.66 N (R² = 0.68) respectively, achieved using SVM on data pre-processed with Standard Normal Variate corrected 2nd derivative. For the internal disorder detection (browning), a classification benchmark composed by five different models (PLS-LDA, PCA-Logistic Regression, PCA-Extremely Randomized Trees, Extremely Randomized Trees and SVC) was implemented. PLS-LDA applied to the raw spectra presented the highest sensitivity, 76%. The results confirm that simultaneously achieving viable firmness and SSC predictions and internal disorder detection levels in pears is possible using a single VIS-NIR spectral measurement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus communis 3aautomation 3afirmness 3afruits 3ageometry 3amodels 3apears 3aprediction 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3atechnology 0a00-01 0a99-00 0aVIS-SWNIR spectroscopy 0aRegression 0aClassification 0aSoluble solids content 0aFirmness 0aBrowning 0aInternal quality 0aMachine learning1 aGuerra, Ruy,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8642-57921 aBrazio, António1 aCavaco, Ana M.1 aAntunes, Dulce1 aPassos, Dário1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5345-51190 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2021 Sept., v. 179 p.111562-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245007300162520163900235592002801874650001401902650001801916650002001934650002901954650001701983650001702000650003702017650004302054650002102097650004802118650001602166650001402182700001802196700002502214773012602239856007802365852000902443655001202452IND60729203420221118024950.0210228e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072920342DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100202932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRömer, Axel 10aLipotoxic Impairment of Mitochondrial Function in β-Cells: A Review  aLipotoxicity is a major contributor to type 2 diabetes mainly promoting mitochondrial dysfunction. Lipotoxic stress is mediated by elevated levels of free fatty acids through various mechanisms and pathways. Impaired peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling, enhanced oxidative stress levels, and uncoupling of the respiratory chain result in ATP deficiency, while β-cell viability can be severely impaired by lipotoxic modulation of PI3K/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. However, fatty acids are physiologically required for an unimpaired β-cell function. Thus, preparation, concentration, and treatment duration determine whether the outcome is beneficial or detrimental when fatty acids are employed in experimental setups. Further, ageing is a crucial contributor to β-cell decay. Cellular senescence is connected to loss of function in β-cells and can further be promoted by lipotoxicity. The potential benefit of nutrients has been broadly investigated, and particularly polyphenols were shown to be protective against both lipotoxicity and cellular senescence, maintaining the physiology of β-cells. Positive effects on blood glucose regulation, mitigation of oxidative stress by radical scavenging properties or regulation of antioxidative enzymes, and modulation of apoptotic factors were reported. This review summarizes the significance of lipotoxicity and cellular senescence for mitochondrial dysfunction in the pancreatic β-cell and outlines potential beneficial effects of plant-based nutrients by the example of polyphenols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood glucose 3acell senescence 3aelectron transport chain 3alipotoxicity 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3apolyphenols 3aviability1 aLinn, Thomas 1 aPetry, Sebastian  F.0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100202933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010000161506011700261506007600378520135600454592002801810506003701838650001601875650002501891650001801916650002201934650001201956650001401968650002401982650001002006653003102016653003102047653003602078653003002114700001702144700001802161700002202179773009602201856008202297852000902379655001202388IND60754585120221207145015.0220523e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075458512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2021.1025882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Zihan10aCharacterizing spatiotemporal variations of forest canopy gaps using aerial laser scanning data  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpatiotemporal variations of forest canopy gaps are essential indicators for both forest dynamic monitoring by capturing their size and location variations and forest ecosystem management for tree seedling regeneration through altering the radiation regime within and under forest canopies. To differentiate the effects of forest canopy gaps on forest three-dimensional (3-D) structure and direct incoming solar radiation, we proposed two novel concepts named physical forest canopy gap (PCG) and physiological forest canopy gap (POCG). Using aerial laser scanning (ALS) data, this study developed ALS-based methods of extracting and characterizing spatiotemporal variations of the PCG and POCG in a natural homogeneous forested area. The ALS-based PCG and POCG results were validated using visual-based interpretation and field-measured data, respectively. The overall accuracy was all over 0.80 and Kappa coefficients all over 0.70 for PCG extraction. The coefficient of determination between the ALS-based POCG area and field-based one was 0.86 (n = 16, p < 0.01), and the root mean square error was 16.28 m². Spatiotemporal variations of forest canopy gaps included variations of their sizes and locations and the sunlit areas within them. This study provided a solid foundation for forest dynamic monitoring and forest ecosystem management.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acanopy gaps 3aecosystem management 3aforest canopy 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3aseedlings 3ashortwave radiation 3atrees 0aAerial laser scanning data 0aPhysical forest canopy gap 0aPhysiological forest canopy gap 0aSpatiotemporal variations1 aZheng, Guang1 aShen, Guochun1 aMoskal, L.

The objective of this study was to determine the cross-resistance between both drugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a hospital with high incidence of tuberculosis in Lima, Peru. The frequency of mutations to isoniazid in the katG gene and the inhA promoter region was identified by the Genotype MTBDRplus v2.0 molecular test. The gold standard Agar Proportion method (APM) allowed todetect resistance to isoniazid and ethionamide. Of 107 isoniazid-resistant isolates (54 multidrug-resistant isolates identified by the Genotype MTBDRplus test, 45.8% (49/107) were also resistant to ethionamide by the APM. Mutations were found in the katG gene in 50.5% (54/107), in the promoter region inhA in 23.3% (25/107) and 14.0% (15/107) that share both mutations in the resistant isolates to INH. The absence of the wild type and mutation bands indicated that 12.1% (13/107) of the isolates were resistant to INH. The mutation C-15T in the inhA promoter region showed a strong association with resistance to ethionamide in 73.4% (36/49) of the isolates analyzed. The results of the present study suggest that the identification of mutations related to resistance to isoniazid, especially in the inhA promoter region, could be very useful to identify cross-resistance to ethionamide and improve the treatment of individuals suffering from this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aagar 3across resistance 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahospitals 3aisoniazid 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutation 3apromoter regions 3atuberculosis 3aPeru 0aEtionamida 0aIsoniacida 0aMultifarmacorresistente 0aResistencia cruzada 0aEthionamide 0aMultidrug-resistant 0aCross-resistance1 aMonteghirfo, Mario1 aSalazar, Omar1 aGalarza, Marco0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2020 Jan.,  Mar., v. 52, no. 1 p.36-42dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245017600173300001800349520157700367592002801944650002301972650001601995650001202011650001302023650002002036650001302056650001202069650001302081650001402094650001202108650001802120650002302138650001602161700001902177773011602196856005502312852000902367655001202376IND4465650120221119180146.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446565012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01804.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwodeinde, F.

Four genetic crosses were made: C. gariepinus♀ × C. gariepinus♂, H. bidorsalis♀ × H. bidorsalis♂, C. gariepinus♀ × H. bidorsalis♂ and H. bidorsalis♀ × C. gariepinus♂. The experiment was divided into two phases: artificial propagation of the fish species using a synthetic hormone and rearing the fry for 14 days, then further rearing the 14‐day‐old fry for an additional 35 days. In the first phase of the experiment, fry survival was estimated in each experimental unit (genetic cross); in the second phase, growth and nutrient utilization were investigated. Results revealed that the highest percentage of fertilization, hatching rate and percentage of survival was in the hybrid (H. bidorsalis♀ × C. gariepinus♂) followed by the purebred H. bidorsalis (H. bidorsalis♀ × H. bidorsalis♂). These three factors were significantly different (P < 0.05) among the genetic crosses. The purebred H. bidorsalis (H. bidorsalis♀ × H. bidorsalis♂) had the highest percentage values of weight gain, specific growth rate and protein efficiency ratio and that these three parameters were significant (P < 0.05) among the four genetic crosses. Based on the results of this study, the purebred H. bidorsalis is recommended for commercial aquacultural practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClarias gariepinus 3aaquaculture 3acatfish 3acrossing 3afeed conversion 3ahatching 3ahybrids 3aproteins 3apurebreds 3arearing 3asurvival rate 3asynthetic hormones 3aweight gain1 aNdimele, P.

Rhynchosporium on barley was not affected overall, although it decreased on the high‐level contamination areas early in the season. The Eca strain was detected on the upper foliage of both wheat and barley. • Increased S. tritici symptoms in the field may be due to ‘synergistic’ interactions between the Eca and the fungal mycelium, as reported in previously published laboratory experiments. The potential importance of such fungal–bacterial interactions is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aleaf blotch 3aRhynchosporium secalis 3abarley 3agrain crops 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aHordeum vulgare 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahost plants 3aSeptoria 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3apowdery mildew 3astreptomycin 3apotatoes 3aTriticum aestivum 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3awinter wheat 3ascald diseases1 aToth, Ian K.1 aNeave, Paul1 aHyman, Lizbeth J.0 tnew phytologist.g2004 July, v. 163, no. 1 p.133-138dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01077.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04081naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245026600181300001400447520221400461592002802675650001902703650002602722650002302748650002202771650001702793650001002810650002202820650003002842650001302872650001902885650001202904650000902916650002702925650001702952650001402969650001402983650001302997651001403010653001903024653002403043653001603067653002503083653001903108700003203127700001903159700002203178700002203200700002103222700002503243700002703268773011003295856008903405852000903494655001203503IND60602122120221119225126.0180709e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060212212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennington, Pamela M.14aThe Chagas disease domestic transmission cycle in Guatemala: Parasite-vector switches and lack of mitochondrial co-diversification between Triatoma dimidiata and Trypanosoma cruzi subpopulations suggest non-vectorial parasite dispersal across the Motagua valley  ap. 80-87.  aParasites transmitted by insects must adapt to their vectors and reservoirs. Chagas disease, an American zoonosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted by several species of triatomines. In Central America, Triatoma dimidiata is a widely dispersed vector found in sylvatic and domestic habitats, with distinct populations across the endemic region of Guatemala. Our aim was to test the strength of association between vector and parasite genetic divergence in domestic environments. Microsatellite (MS) loci were used to characterize parasites isolated from T. dimidiata (n=112) collected in domestic environments. Moderate genetic differentiation was observed between parasites north and south of the Motagua Valley, an ancient biogeographic barrier (FST 0.138, p=0.009). Slightly reduced genotypic diversity and increased heterozygosity in the north (Allelic richness (Ar)=1.00–6.05, FIS −0.03) compared to the south (Ar=1.47–6.30, FIS 0.022) suggest either a selective or demographic process during parasite dispersal. Based on parasite genotypes and geographic distribution, 15 vector specimens and their parasite isolates were selected for mitochondrial co-diversification analysis. Genetic variability and phylogenetic congruence were determined with mitochondrial DNA sequences (10 parasite maxicircle gene fragments and triatomine ND4+CYT b). A Mantel test as well as phylogenetic, network and principal coordinates analyses supported at least three T. dimidiata haplogroups separated by geographic distance across the Motagua Valley. Maxicircle sequences showed low T. cruzi genetic variability (π nucleotide diversity 0.00098) with no evidence of co-diversification with the vector, having multiple host switches across the valley. Sylvatic Didelphis marsupialis captured across the Motagua Valley were found to be infected with T. cruzi strains sharing MS genotypes with parasites isolated from domiciliated triatomines. The current parasite distribution in domestic environments can be explained by multiple parasite-host switches between vector populations and selection or bottleneck processes across the Motagua Valley, with a possible role for didelphids in domestic transmission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aDidelphis marsupialis 3aTriatoma dimidiata 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3abiogeography 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aheterozygosity 3ainsects 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3azoonoses 3aGuatemala 0aPhylogeography 0aPopulation genetics 0aCophylogeny 0aVector-borne disease 0aChagas disease1 aMessenger, Louisa Alexandra1 aReina, Jeffrey1 aJuárez, José G.1 aLawrence, Gena G.1 aDotson, Ellen M.1 aLlewellyn, Martin S.1 aCordón-Rosales, Celia0 tActa tropica.g2015 Nov., v. 151 p.80-87dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024004300140040001800183100002200201245013100223506007600354506003100430520153500461592002801996596003902024506003702063650002202100650002502122650001902147650001602166650001702182650001802199650001802217650001302235650001802248650001102266650001402277650001502291650001902306650001002325650001702335650001902352650002302371650002502394653001102419653001402430653001402444653001402458653001402472700002302486700005702509700006402566773012002630856009002750852000902840655001202849IND60736100120221207054924.0220314e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073610012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115682chorus7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbeli, Patrick J.10aBlueberry fruit quality and control of blueberry maggot (Rhagoletis mendax Curran) larvae after fumigation with sulfur dioxide  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aPostharvest fumigation of fruits and vegetables is an important tool for managing pests and diseases that can cause devastating loss if not properly controlled. Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) may have promise as replacement for methyl bromide, which is expected to be phased out. However, SO₂ is known to cause injury to small fruit such as table grapes (Vitis vinifera L.). We extend previous research on SO₂ fumigation by focusing on an economically important fruit pest genus and through quantitative and qualitative measurements of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) fruit bleaching. This study assesses fruit damage due to SO₂ fumigation at concentrations ranging 0–2.2 % (v/v) as well as the effectiveness of SO₂ as a fumigant prior to cold storage for control of blueberry maggot, Rhagoletis mendax Curran. We show that fruit quality traits such as firmness, total soluble solid content, and titratable acidity are largely unaffected except at the highest SO₂ concentration (2.2 %). SO₂ caused bleaching and discoloration of blueberry fruit in a dose-dependent manner. Damage was also cultivar-dependent, with cv ‘Bluecrop’, and ‘Jersey’ more susceptible than ‘Draper’, ‘Elliott’, and ‘Liberty’. We show that R. mendax can be effectively controlled using a short-term (2 h), high concentration (22,000 μL L⁻¹) SO₂ fumigation followed by >14 d of cold storage at 0.5 °C. However, this treatment for control of R. mendax would likely result in damage, affecting fruit marketability.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA Agricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhagoletis mendax 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aVitis vinifera 3ablueberries 3acold storage 3adiscoloration 3adose response 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3afumigants 3afumigation 3amethyl bromide 3apests 3aplant damage 3asulfur dioxide 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 0aVacuum 0aHypobaric 0aFruit fly 0aTephritid 0aBleaching1 aFanning, Philip D.1 aIsaacs, Rufus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7523-46431 aBeaudry, Randolph M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6122-44950 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2021 Sept., v. 179 p.111568-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015200171300001600323520182100339592002802160653002902188653002702217653003202244653002002276653003002296653003502326700001802361700002002379700001902399700001902418700002002437773013702457856008402594852000902678655001202687IND60557710020221119110423.0161103e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055771002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.endoen.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmor, Antonio J.10aClinical status of a cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes diagnosed more than 2 decades before. Results of a specific clinical follow-up program  ap. 339-344.  aThe clinical course of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has changed in recent decades. The aim of our study was to assess the long-term (>20 years) clinical status of a patient cohort with T1DM under a specific treatment and follow-up program.A single center, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted of a patient cohort diagnosed with T1DM in the 1986–1994 period at our tertiary university hospital. Clinical characteristics, metabolic parameters, and occurrence of chronic complications and comorbidities after >20 years of follow-up were collected. All subjects entered our specific program for patients with newly diagnosed T1D and were followed up using the same clinical protocol. Data are shown as mean (standard deviation) or as number of patients and percentage. The appropriate test was used to compare quantitative and qualitative data. A P value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 279 patients were recorded, of whom 153 (53.6% women; mean age 46.6±8.6 years; age at onset 23.3±8.8 years; disease duration, 23.3±2.6 years) continued to attend our diabetes unit at the time of the analysis. Of these patients, 24.8% were administered continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Mean HbA1c in the past 5 years and in the last year were7.8±0.9% and 7.7±1.1% respectively (7.3±1.5% in those given CSII). Smoking was reported by 19.6% of patients, while 15.7% had high blood pressure and 37.9% dyslipidemia. Diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed in 20.4%, and 11.3% of the total cohort had nephropathy. Only 1.3% of our patients had a history of CVD.Data collected from a cohort of patients with T1DM for more than 2 decades regularly followed up with a specific program in a tertiary university hospital suggest a remarkably low prevalence of diabetic complications.  aPublisher supplied data 0aType 1 diabetes mellitus 0aCardiovascular disease 0aMicrovascular complications 0aDiabetes tipo 1 0aEnfermedad cardiovascular 0aComplicaciones microvasculares1 aCabrer, Maria1 aGiménez, Marga1 aVinagre, Irene1 aOrtega, Emilio1 aConget, Ignacio0 tEndocrinología y nutrición (English Edition).g2016 Aug.,  Sept., v. 63 p.339-344dElsevier España, S.L.U.aSEENx2173-50937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.endoen.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245018800164300001400352520070400366592002801070650001201098650001001110650002001120650001601140650001201156653001701168653001101185653002501196653001101221700002201232773013401254856007501388852000901463655001201472IND60595242720221122074923.0180620e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059524272DNAL7 a10.30963/aramit55122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Michael,10aEin Beitrag zur Springspinnenfauna (Araneae, Salticidae) der griechischen Dodekanes-Insel Rhodos mit der Neubeschreibung von Pseudeuophrys rhodiensis und sechs weiteren Erstnachweisen  ap. 64-74.  aContribution to the jumping spider fauna (Araneae, Salticidae) of the Greek Dodecanese island of Rhodes, with a description of Pseudophrys rhodiensis and six new records.

The aquaculture farm-wetland complex of Veta la Palma (SW Spain) is an example of a currently viable land-based IMTA system that produced 657 t of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in 2010. This farm combined the semi-intensive production of D. labrax in grow-out fish ponds with the extensive production of Mugilidae and Palaemonidae naturally recruited in multitrophic polyculture lagoons. Two sets of polyculture lagoons and their respective adjacent fish ponds were studied biweekly in 2009–2010. The polyculture lagoons promoted an extensive natural food web and removed an estimated 91% of the total incoming dissolved inorganic nitrogen discharged by the fish ponds. Water recirculation across the farm supplied the fish ponds with natural food from the polyculture lagoons and thus the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of D. labrax was <1.0 during a three-year rearing period after nursery production. The multivariate technique of factor analysis identified 10 factors, which together accounted for 72% of the overall environmental data variability in the lagoons, mainly due to seasonality followed by changes in the turbidity characteristics of the incoming water. Some of these factors were affected by specific farm management procedures related to i) an adaptive design that allows operation in open- or closed-circuit conditions and thus mitigates the natural variability of salinity and turbidity of the estuarine source water, ii) the constant recirculation of the water across the entire farm, which extends the benefits of the polyculture lagoons (water purification, microalgae and natural prey provision) to the fish ponds, and iii) management decisions to promote sustainability regarding the periodical drying of lagoons, a low fingerling stocking density (4–5 fish m−3) and an external aquafeed supply limited to warmer months in the grow-out fish ponds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aMugilidae 3aPalaemonidae 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture feeds 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3adrying 3aestuaries 3afactor analysis 3afarm management 3afarms 3afeed conversion 3afingerlings 3afish ponds 3afood webs 3amicroalgae 3amultivariate analysis 3arearing 3asalinity 3astocking rate 3aturbidity 3awater purification 3aSpain 0aMicroalgae 0aHaptophytes 0aRuppia 0aPUFAs 0aGuadalquivir estuary1 aMilstein, A.1 aJiménez-Rodríguez, A.1 aMazuelos, N.1 aMedialdea, M.1 aSerrano, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2711-70680 tAquaculture.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 495 p.484-495dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141242010800167245010400275300001400379520055600393592002800949650001600977650001300993650001001006650001101016650001301027651001601040651002001056651001101076653001501087653001501102653001501117653001101132700002301143700001801166773013401184856007501318852000901393655001201402IND60595242820221122092434.0180620e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059524282DNAL7 a10.30963/aramit55132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuttenberger, Jürgen10aPrinerigone vagans neu für Polen (Araneae: Linyphiidae), mit Kommentaren zur Taxonomie und Verbreitung10aPrinerigone vagans new to Poland (Araneae: Linyphiidae), with comments on taxonomy and distribution  ap. 75-78.  aThe first record of the hygrophilous linyphiid spider Prinerigone vagans (Audouin, 1826) for Poland, collected on a bank of the River Olza near the Czech Border, is presented together with a discussion of known habitats of the species.

How shifts in the availability of N or P affect fungal communities in temperate forests is not well understood. Here, we conducted a factorial P × N fertilization experiment to disentangle the effects of nutrient availability on soil-residing, root-associated, and ectomycorrhizal fungi in beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests differing in P availability. We tested the hypotheses that in P-poor forests, P fertilization leads to enhanced fungal diversity in soil and roots, resulting in enhanced P nutrition of beech, and that N fertilization aggravates P shortages, shifting the fungal communities toward nitrophilic species. In response to fertilizer treatments (1 × 50 kg ha⁻¹ P and 5 × 30 kg ha⁻¹ N within 2 years), the labile P fractions increased in soil and roots, regardless of plant-available P in soil. Root total P decreased in response to N fertilization and root total P increased in response to P addition at the low P site. Ectomycorrhizal species richness was unaffected by fertilizer treatments, but the relative abundances of ectomycorrhizal fungi increased in response to P or N addition. At the taxon level, fungal assemblages were unaffected by fertilizer treatments, but at the order level, different response patterns for saprotrophic fungi among soil and ectomycorrhizal fungi on roots were found. Boletales increased in response to P, and Russulales decreased under N + P addition. Our results suggest that trait conservatism in related species afforded resistance of the resident mycobiome composition to nutritional imbalances.  aPublisher supplied data  aSPP1685 Po362/22-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aSPP1685 LA1398/13-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aRTG2300 SP4cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aCAFYBB2018GC010cInstitute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (CN) 3aBoletales 3aFagus sylvatica 3aRussulales 3aectomycorrhizae 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrition 3aphosphorus 3asaprotrophs 3asoil 3aspecies richness1 aLikulunga, L.

The grafting of copolymer was confirmed by DRS-UV, FTIR, NMR, Raman, XRD and XPS spectral techniques. The AC-g-P(DMC-MACPPC) exhibits higher flocculation efficiency towards harvesting of C. vulgaris micro algae, when compared to that of copolymer P(DMC-MACPPC) and homo polymer PMACPPC. The higher efficiency exhibited by the grafted copolymer can be attributed to the increase in positive charge and molecular weight after grafting on to acryloyl chitosan. The grafted copolymer AC-g-P(DMC-MACPPC) is very easy to synthesize, economical and water soluble which makes it a promising flocculant in the algae harvesting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalgae 3achitosan 3acomposite polymers 3aflocculation 3aharvesting 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 0aAlgae flocculation 0aAcryloyl chitosan 0aCopolymer 0aPiperazine and structural modification1 aS., Balasubramanian0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Nov. 05, v. 152 p.459-467dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007600170300001800246520142700264592002801691650001101719650001901730650001901749650001101768650002001779650002201799650002901821653003001850653004201880653002801922653003101950653002201981700001602003700001602019700001602035700001602051773011502067856008602182852000902268655001202277IND60585485220221117110412.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058548522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhongbao10aCarbon emission performance evaluation and allocation in Chinese cities  ap. 1254-1272.  aThis paper presents a DEA approach with multiple abatement factors to evaluate CO₂ emission performance and allocate CO₂ emission quotas in Chinese cities. We first consider the difference of marginal abatement costs among cities, and construct the non-radial directional distance function with multiple abatement factors. The total-factor CO₂ emission performance index and its dynamic change index are then proposed to measure CO₂ emission performance. Considering equity and efficiency, we develop a composite index by the hybrid method to allocate emissions quota, which considers CO₂ emissions as well as CO₂ emission performance. Then we conduct an empirical study using inputs and outputs dataset of 71 Chinese cities in 2005–2012. Chinese cities have poor energy efficiency and still have high CO₂ emissions. The eastern region outperforms the central region and the western region performs worst, whereas the dynamic CO₂ emission performance of the central region has the largest increase. The change of CO₂ emission performance is driven mainly by technological advances. As for the CO₂ emission allocation, the composite index method encourages cities to reduce emissions and enhance emission performance through carbon trading market. It also motivates cities with high historical emissions to reduce their emissions by improving technology when they have poor CO₂ emission performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acities 3adata collection 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 0aData envelopment analysis 0aTotal-factor CO2 emission performance 0aCO2 emission allocation 0aMultiple abatement factors 0aUrban environment1 aLiu, Cenjie1 aZeng, Ximei1 aJiang, Yong1 aLiu, Wenbin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.1254-1272dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.2083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013600165500001900301520194600320592002802266650002202294650002902316650003002345650000902375650001202384650001902396650002502415650002302440650002102463650002002484650001102504650002102515650001402536650001402550650001902564650002702583650001202610650001102622653002802633653001102661653001902672653002402691700001302715700001602728700001202744700001202756700001602768700001702784700001802801700001402819773011802833856008602951852000903037655001203046IND60736100420221123023841.0210708e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073610042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1135132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jie10aFunctional identification of five CYP450 genes from birch responding to MeJA and SA in the synthesis of betulinic acid from lupitol  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBirch (Betula platyphylla Suk.) bark contains important pentacyclic triterpenes such as betulin and betulinic acid, which possess a range of biological effects, including anti-tumor and anti-HIV activity. In order to meet the worldwide demand for anti-tumor drugs, improvements in triterpenes' production and quality are of crucial importance. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450) is essential for the diversification and functional modification of the triterpene skeleton. In this study, five new CYP450 genes responding to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) were cloned from birch. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that five BpCYP450 genes were located in five subfamilies, named CYP94B89, CYP89S1, CYP97B62, CYP86B54, and CYP86A182. The five CYP450 genes in different tissues and their responses to different stresses were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. CYP89S1, CYP97B62, squalene epoxidase (BpSE), and dammarenediol synthase (BpDS) were highly expressed in leaves. The results of quantitative gene expression and correlation analysis suggested that CYP89S1, CYP97B62 with BpSS, BpW, BpDS, and BpY might be co-expressed, which may affect the synthesis of triterpenoids in birch as gene clusters or co-expression module. Ectopic expression showed that CYP89S1, CYP97B62, CYP86A182 had C-28 oxidation function and catalyzed the conversion of lupeol to betulinic acid. CYP97B62 gene has the highest catalytic efficiency, increasing the content of betulinic acid by 1136 %. In addition, co-expression of BpMYB21 and CYP86A182 can significantly enhance the conversion and synthesis efficiency of betulinic acid in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.); CYP89S1 can enhance salt and alkali resistance in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In this study, the discovery of five CYP450 provided new and important gene resources for the regulation of betulinic acid synthesis and the further analysis of the triterpene metabolic network.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantiretroviral properties 3abark 3abetulin 3abetulinic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acatalytic activity 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3alupeol 3amethyl jasmonate 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3asalicylic acid 3asqualene monooxygenase 3atobacco 3ayeasts 0aBetula platyphylla Suk. 0aCYP450 0aC-28 oxidation 0aTriterpene skeleton1 aLi, Ying1 aZhang, Yuqi1 aJia, Li1 aSun, Lu1 aWang, Siyao1 aXiao, Jialei1 aZhan, Yaguang1 aYin, Jing0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 167 p.113513-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1135133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011600176520133400292592002801626650001301654650001201667650001101679650002501690650001401715650001501729650001601744653001601760653001401776653001001790653002501800653001601825700001701841700001901858700001601877773009901893856008601992852000902078655001202087IND60754585620221118173435.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075458562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijewardene, Lishani10aEpiphytic biofilms in freshwater and interactions with macrophytes: Current understanding and future directions  aEpiphytic biofilm is an important component in freshwater ecosystems and is one of the main primary producers in shallow freshwater ecosystems. The epiphytic biofilm is comprised of an autotrophic community made up of diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria, and a heterotrophic community consisting of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and other microorganisms. Macrophytes are the host domain for epiphytic biofilm, providing substrate and influencing epiphytic biofilm via structural characteristics. Strong competitive, mutualistic, and commensalistic relationships between epiphytic biofilm and macrophytes have resulted from interactions for resources (e.g., light and nutrients) and trophic and allelopathic dynamics. Even though these interactions have wider implications on ecosystem structure, function, and integrity, the current understanding of epiphytic biofilm-macrophyte interactions is limited. In this review, we highlight the current understanding of epiphytic biofilms in freshwater ecosystems and synthesize their different interactions with macrophytes by providing illustrative examples. Furthermore, we identify key areas where research is currently lacking and provide directions for future research in this field, which will allow for better integrated aquatic ecosystem management and conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3abiofilm 3abotany 3aecosystem management 3aepiphytes 3afreshwater 3amacrophytes 0aCompetition 0aNutrients 0aLight 0aTrophic interactions 0aAllelopathy1 aWu, Naicheng1 aFohrer, Nicola1 aRiis, Tenna0 tAquatic botany.g2022 Jan., v. 176 p.103467-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245005700172300001600229520083500245592002801080653002301108653002001131653002001151653001901171653002401190653002701214653002701241653002001268653001901288653002501307700001901332700002101351773013701372856008401509852000901593655001201602IND60557710420221119110402.0161103e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055771042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.endoen.2016.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalofré, Juan C.10aThyroid dysfunction in the era of precision medicine  ap. 354-363.  aThe launching of the Precision Medicine Initiative by the President of the United States in January 2015 was an invitation for all healthcare professionals to review their practice. This call should stimulate thyroidologists working in different areas (from basic research or epidemiology to the frontline of the clinical arena or to those designing public health programs) to be aware of this new outlook. The aim of the initiative is to eradicate imprecision in estimating the probability of a correct diagnosis, to be as sure as possible of the most effective treatment, and to maximize the chances of a successful outcome. This paper summarizes some of the current challenges faced by endocrinologists in the field of thyroid dysfunction, and illustrates how precision medicine may improve diagnosis and therapy in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPrecision medicine 0aThyroid disease 0aHyperthyroidism 0aHypothyroidism 0aThyroid dysfunction 0aMedicina de precisión 0aEnfermedades tiroideas 0aHipertiroidismo 0aHipotiroidismo 0aDisfunción tiroidea1 aDíez, Juan J.1 aCooper, David S.0 tEndocrinología y nutrición (English Edition).g2016 Aug.,  Sept., v. 63 p.354-363dElsevier España, S.L.U.aSEENx2173-50937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.endoen.2016.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01316naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245015100166300001300317520023500330592002800565650002300593650001500616650002200631650001100653650001900664700002300683700002200706700001900728700002700747773013300774856007400907852000900981655001200990IND60617540320221121050309.0181025e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061754032DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc90090f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarczak‡, Magdalena10aCorrection: Organic semiconductor perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) electrodes for electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide  ap. 2566.  aCorrection for ‘Organic semiconductor perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) electrodes for electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide’ by Magdalena Warczak et al., Chem.

A detailed time course experiment using four plant, and four fungal species, was used to investigate the sequential development of hyphae, arbuscules, hyphal coils, arbusculate coils and vesicles. • The survey indicated that there was a continuum of mycorrhizal structures ranging from Arum to Paris, depending upon both the host plant and the fungus. The time course showed that total colonization increased, and that the establishment of the various mycorrhizal structures did not appear to change greatly over time. • It was concluded that identification of fungal structures and their subsequent development into morphological types is not easily defined. Visual inspection of root squashes is not always adequate, especially where transverse sections are needed to determine if longitudinal hyphae are inter or intracellular; this is essential to distinguish intermediate types.  aPublisher supplied data 3amycorrhizal fungi 3asymbiosis 3aGigaspora margarita 3aScutellospora calospora 3aArum 3amicrobial colonization 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aGlomus mosseae 3aParis (Melanthiaceae)0 tnew phytologist.g2004 July, v. 163, no. 1 p.187-200dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01095.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02945naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007800172300001600250520150500266592002801771650001501799650001201814650002301826650002301849650002401872650002501896650001201921650002101933650001501954650001201969650001601981650001301997650002102010650001302031650001002044650001102054651002602065653001202091653001602103653001502119653002802134653001802162700003002180700002602210773011002236856008402346852000902430655001202439IND60123222520221118035501.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012322252DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2013.8786412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastoldi, Gustavo10aNitrogen budget in a soil-plant system after brachiaria grass desiccation  ap. 162-172.  aBrachiaria spp. have been grown in a variety of cropping systems and are often terminated with herbicides, which may cause nitrogen (N) loss from the soil-plant system. In this study ammonia (NH ₃-N) loss by shoots and N balance in a soil-plant system were determined after desiccation of palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich) Stapf, cv. Marandu), signalgrass (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf), humidicola (Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Schweick) and Congo grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis Germain et Evrard). The grasses were grown in pots filled with an Oxisol in a greenhouse. Sixty days after planting, the plants were desiccated with glyphosate. Analyses were performed on plant and soil at desiccation and then at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after desiccation in order to assess NH ₃-N losses by shoots and to estimate the N balance in the system. Total nitrogen (Total-N) concentration in shoots and roots of brachiarias decreased after desiccation, thereby reducing the amount of N in plants of the four brachiaria species. However, as most of the N lost by plants was released into the soil, N losses from the soil-plant system were small compared with the total N in the system: 1.2, 0.5, 0.4 and 1.4% for palisade grass, signalgrass, humidicola and Congo grass, respectively. N losses as NH ₃ from the soil-plant system after desiccation with glyphosate varied among brachiaria species, ranging from 0.8 to 2.0 g m ⁻² kg ⁻¹, and accounted for 30–80% of total loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachiaria 3aOxisols 3aUrochloa brizantha 3aUrochloa decumbens 3aUrochloa humidicola 3aUrochloa ruziziensis 3aammonia 3acropping systems 3aglyphosate 3agrasses 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplanting 3aroots 3ashoots 3aRepublic of the Congo 0aAmmonia 0abrachiarias 0aglyphosate 0anitrogen volatilization 0anitrogen loss1 aPivetta, Laércio Augusto1 aRosolem, Ciro Antonio0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 60, no. 2 p.162-172dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.8786413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100001700160245008900177300001400266506002800280520204400308592002802352506003702380650002802417650001602445650002602461650001202487650001902499650002802518650001902546650002302565650001202588653002502600653002802625653002602653653002702679653001102706700001702717700001702734700001602751773013402767856009502901852000902996655001203005IND60785157620221207130540.0200223e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078515762DNAL7 adoi:10.33249/2663-2144-2019-80-7-41-472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarpenko, V.10aPigments content in the leaves of lentil under the action of biological preparations  ap. 41-47.  aResource is Open Access  aThe article presents the results of the field experiment on the influence of microbial preparation (Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain K-29, w. s., 100 ml/ha seeds norm) and plant growth regulator (Regoplant, w. s: 250 ml/t – pre-sowing seed treatment; 50 ml/ha – post-germination application) on the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls a and b, their sum and carotenoids) in the leaves of lentil of Linza variety. The analysis of a and b chlorophylls content, their sum and carotenoids in the leaves of lentil was carried out at bud-formation stage and the beginning of blossoming in selected samples of leaves in the field conditions according to the methods, described by V.F. Havrylenko and T.V. Zhyhalova using spectrophotometer LEKI SS1104. According to the results of the experiments was found dependence of the investigated pigments content in lentil leaves on weather conditions, application of the biological preparation and on phase of growth and development of the culture. Thus, under combined application of biological preparations in the leaves of lentil of Linsa variety there was the increase in the content of chlorophylls a and b, their sum and carotenoids, which created favorable conditions for the main physiological and biochemical processes that account for the formation of high productivity of crops. In the phase of bloom beginning of the lentil, when the activity of growth processes was the highest, content of the investigated pigments was much higher than in the phase of budding. The highest content of pigments in the leaves of lentil was recorded in the variants of the experiment under pre-sowing treatment of seeds with the mixture of microbial preparation (Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strain К-29, w. s., 100 ml/hа seed rate) and plant growth regulator Regoplant, w. s., 250ml/t with its further post-germination application at the rates 50ml/ha, where the exceed compared to control for the chlorophylls a and b on average made up 35 %, and for carotenoids 43 %.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3acarotenoids 3afield experimentation 3alentils 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth substances 3aseed treatment 3aspectrophotometers 3aweather 0achlorophylls a and b 0asum of chlorophylls a+b 0amicrobial preparation 0aplant growth regulator 0alentil1 aNovikova, T.1 aPrytulia, P.1 aHnatyuk, M.0 tNaukovì gorizonti.g2019 July, v. 80, no. 7 p.41-47dZhytomyr National Agroecological UniversitywJournal:27917x2663-21447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/doi:10.33249/2663-2144-2019-80-7-41-473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012300174300001600297520118900313592002801502650001901530650001301549650002201562650001201584650002601596650002201622650002301644650001401667651001001681653003701691653002001728653002001748653002101768653001001789700002301799773011301822856008601935852000902021655001202030IND60585485420221117110405.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058548542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aExpósito, Alfonso10aMunicipal solid-waste recycling market and the European 2020 Horizon Strategy: A regional efficiency analysis in Spain  ap. 938-948.  aThis paper focuses on the analysis of the efficiency of Spanish regions in the development of the recycling market in their respective territories through the use of a novel Data Envelopment Analysis method with multiple outputs. The efficiency analysis takes into account the mandatory goals of reducing mixed-collected municipal solid waste and the augmentation of selective collection of recyclable materials, as set by the European Union and the Spanish legal framework. This issue is highly relevant, since neither of these two management goals may be achieved without the recycling market and its associated industry having been previously developed to a sufficient level. Results confirm that Catalonia, Navarre and Madrid function as benchmark regions to be emulated by the remaining inefficient regions. The necessary regional investments and output projections to reach an efficient development of the recycling sector are also estimated. Additionally, it is found that per capita income and population density significantly explain differences in regional efficiencies. Finally, taking efficient regions as benchmarks to learn from, some policy recommendations are offered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amunicipal solid waste 3aper-capita income 3apopulation density 3arecycling 3aSpain 0aMunicipal solid waste management 0aWaste recycling 0aWaste reduction 0aRecycling market 0aSpain1 aVelasco, Francisco0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.938-948dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.2213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245006800209300001600277500001500293506007600308520160100384592002801985506003702013650001402050650002102064650001702085650001602102650001502118650001302133650002402146650001202170650001402182650001502196650002302211653002402234700001802258700002702276773008502303856004802388852000902436655001202445IND50067044120221207120211.0130614e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006704412DNAL7 a231880552pmid7 aPMC36794202pmcid7 a10.1007/s00442-012-2530-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinkat, Gregor10aHabitat structure alters top-down control in litter communities  ap. 877-887.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe question whether top-down or bottom-up forces dominate trophic relationships, energy flow, and abundances within food webs has fuelled much ecological research with particular focus on soil litter ecosystems. Because litter simultaneously provides habitat structure and a basal resource, disentangling direct trophic and indirect non-trophic effects on different trophic levels remains challenging. Here, we focussed on short-term per capita interaction strengths of generalist predators (centipedes) on their microbi-detritivore prey (springtails) and addressed how the habitat structuring effects of the leaf litter modifies this interaction. We performed a series of laboratory functional response experiments where four levels of habitat structure were constructed by adding different amounts of leaf litter to the experimental arenas. We found that increased leaf litter reduced the consumption rate of the predator. We interpreted this as a dilution effect of the augmented habitat size provided by the increasing leaf litter surface available to the species. Dilution of the prey population decreased encounter rates, whereas the capture success was not affected. Interestingly, our results imply that top-down control by centipedes decreased with increasing resource supply for the microbi-detritivore prey (i.e. the leaf litter that simultaneously provides habitat structure). Therefore, effective top-down control of predators on microbi-detritvore populations seems unlikely in litter-rich ecosystems due to the non-trophic, habitat-structuring effect of the basal litter resource.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afood webs 3apredator control 3aplant litter 3aenergy flow 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3apopulation dynamics 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aPredatory Behavior 0afunctional response1 aBrose, Ulrich1 aRall, Björn Christian0 tOecologia.g2013 July, v. 172, no. 3 p.877-887dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2530-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245011000184300001600294520148200310592002801792650002201820650002801842650002001870650001201890650001301902650002401915650002101939650001501960650001501975650001201990650000902002653002402011653003602035653001802071653002502089653004302114700002202157700003202179700002102211773011002232856008402342852000902426655001202435IND60123222620221118035536.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012322262DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2013.8786422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirgarsoltani, Mohammad Taghi10aEvaluation of models for description of wet aggregate size distribution from soils of different land uses  ap. 123-133.  aA proper description of aggregate size distribution (ASD) with an optimum mathematical model would be useful in modeling and monitoring land use effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of six cumulative distribution models, namely, Jaky, normal, log-normal, Rosin-Rammler, Fredlund and a mass-based fractal model with wet aggregate size distribution (WASD) data sets from a given range of soil structural properties. The models were tested on wet sieving data of samples that had been collected from a number of different land use types (dry farmland, rangeland and forestland). Three statistical criteria, namely, coefficient of determination (R ²), Mallows statistics (C ₚ), and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), were used for evaluating model performance, based on the least sum of square error and number of fitting parameters. Analysis of R ² showed that the Fredlund three-parameter model showed the best performance in all of the soils apart from the number of parameters. The log-normal model gave a good fit on WASD from rangeland and forestland; it was the best especially in dry farmland. The normal model provided a good description of WASD from the rangeland and forest. However, it failed in dry farmland. According to C ₚ and AIC as the evaluation criteria, the fractal model was the optimum to describe WASD for all of the land uses. The Fredlund, log-normal, Jaky and Rosin-Rammler models ranked next in the given order.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acumulative distribution 3adata collection 3aforests 3aland use 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3amonitoring 3arangelands 3asieving 3asoil 0aDifferent land uses 0aevaluation of model performance 0aoptimum model 0astatistical criteria 0awet aggregate size distribution models1 aGorji, Manoochehr1 aMohammadi, Mohammad Hossein1 aMillan, Humberto0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 60, no. 2 p.123-133dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.8786423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245012800212300001400340520199800354592002802352650001402380650001402394650001402408650001802422650002202440650001702462650001602479653003802495653001302533653001702546653001902563653001402582653001502596653001702611653001402628700003602642700002602678773011802704856008202822852000902904655001202913IND60531576620221118180054.0190329e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053157662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2016.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegner, H.q(Helmut),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1783-129514aThe immunomodulatory role of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis: Proximate mechanism for reproduction-immune trade offs?  ap. 43-60.  aThe present review discusses the communication between the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis and the immune system of vertebrates, attempting to situate the HPG-immune interaction into the context of life history trade-offs between reproductive and immune functions. More specifically, (i) we review molecular and cellular interactions between hormones of the HPG axis, and, as far as known, the involved mechanisms on immune functions, (ii) we evaluate whether the HPG-immune crosstalk serves as proximate mechanism mediating reproductive-immune trade-offs, and (iii) we ask whether the nature of the HPG-immune interaction is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, despite the changes in immune functions, reproductive modes, and life histories. In all vertebrate classes studied so far, HPG hormones have immunomodulatory functions, and indications exist that they contribute to reproduction-immunity resource trade-offs, although the very limited information available for most non-mammalian vertebrates makes it difficult to judge how comparable or different the interactions are. There is good evidence that the HPG-immune crosstalk is part of the proximate mechanisms underlying the reproductive-immune trade-offs of vertebrates, but it is only one factor in a complex network of factors and processes. The fact that the HPG-immune interaction is flexible and can adapt to the functional and physiological requirements of specific life histories. Moreover, the assumption of a relatively fixed pattern of HPG influence on immune functions, with, for example, androgens always leading to immunosuppression and estrogens always being immunoprotective, is probably oversimplified, but the HPG-immune interaction can vary depending on the physiological and envoironmental context. Finally, the HPG-immune interaction is not only driven by resource trade-offs, but additional factors such as, for instance, the evolution of viviparity shape this neuroendocrine-immune relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogens 3aestrogens 3aevolution 3aimmune system 3aimmunosuppression 3alife history 3avertebrates 0aHypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis 0aImmunity 0aReproduction 0aNeuroendocrine 0aEvolution 0aVertebrate 0aLife history 0aTrade-off1 aVerburg-van Kemenade, B.M.

In the present study, we observed an inverse relationship between the depth of ED and the respiration rate of grapevine buds. Moreover, the respiration of dormant and non-dormant buds differed in response to temperature and glucose, two stimuli that normally increase respiration in plant tissues. While respiration in non-dormant buds rose sharply in response to both stimuli, respiration in dormant buds was only slightly affected. This suggests that a metabolic inhibitor is present. Here, we propose that the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) could be this inhibitor. ABA inhibits respiration in non-dormant buds and represses the expression of respiratory genes, such as ALTERNATIVE NADH DEHYDROGENASE (VaND1, VvaND2), CYTOCHROME OXIDASE (VvCOX6) and CYTOCHROME C (VvCYTC), and induces the expression of VvSnRK1, a gene encoding a member of a highly conserved family of protein kinases that act as energy sensors and regulate gene expression in response to energy depletion. In addition to inducing ED the SD-photoperiod up-regulated the expression of VvNCED, a gene that encodes a key enzyme in ABA synthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that ABA through the mediation of VvSnRK1, could play a key role in the regulation of the metabolic changes accompanying the entry into ED of grapevine buds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aVitis vinifera 3aabscisic acid 3abuds 3acell respiration 3acytochrome c 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aenergy 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3aphotoperiod 3aplant tissues 3aprotein kinases 3arespiratory rate 3atemperature 0aAbscisic acid 0aBud-respiration 0aEndodormancy 0aGrapevines1 aNoriega, Ximena1 aDantas, Débora1 aBressan-Smith, Ricardo1 aPérez, Francisco J.,0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 201 p.71-78dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165300001600279520161500295592002801910650001501938650002101953650002801974650001902002650002402021650001802045650002302063650002102086650001702107650002902124700002402153773011402177856008102291852000902372655001202381IND60121012020221120212735.0150213e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012101202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-002-1339-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Joo-Woon10aSurface perspectives in the biomedical applications of poly(α-hydroxy acid)s and their associated copolymers  ap. 526-537.  aImpressive advances in biotechnology, bioengineering, and biomaterials with unique properties have led to increased interest in polymers and other novel materials in biological and biomedical research and development over the past two decades. Although biomaterials have already made an enormous impact in biomedical research and clinical practice, there is a need for better understanding of the surface and interfacial chemistry between tissue (or cells) and biomedical materials. This is because the detailed physicochemical events related to the biological response to the surface of materials still often remain obscure, even though surface properties are important determinants of biomedical material function. In this regard, data available in the literature show the complexity of the interactions (surface reorganization, non-specific/specific protein adsorption, and chemical reactions such as acid–base, ion pairing, ion exchange, hydrogen bonding, divalent-ion bridging) and the interrelationship between biological environments, interfacial properties, and surface functional groups responsible for the biological responses. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of surface and interfacial phenomena at the surface of biomedical polymers, this review focuses on several aspects of current work published on poly(α-hydroxy acid)s and their associated copolymers:surface structure–biomedical function relationships;physicochemical strategies for surface modification; and, finally,synthetic strategies to increase biocompatibility for specific in-vivo and/or in-vitro biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abioengineering 3abiomedical research 3abiotechnology 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrogen bonding 3aion exchange 3aresearch and development1 aGardella, Joseph A.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2002 Aug., v. 373, no. 7 p.526-537dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-002-1339-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245006000158300001400218506002800232520113100260592002801391506003701419650001501456650001001471650001501481650001001496650001201506650002701518650001701545650001501562650001501577650001001592651001201602653001401614773013301628856007601761852000901837655001201846IND60785157820221207125250.0090701e198708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078515782DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha1712332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPALFALVI, P.10aVicia faba germplasm collection in eastern Transylvania  ap. 35-38.  aResource is Open Access  a<em>Vicia faba</em> accessions have been collected from peasants in Eastern Transylvania in the period 1981-1985.

This study evaluates three non-wood perennials to find alternative raw materials for the paper and pulp industry. Meadow hay, cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) and Virginia mallow (Sida hermaphrodita (L.) Rusby) are attracting attention as potential raw materials for the bioeconomy due to biodiversity benefits, low fertilizer requirements as well as high yields. For the first time a detailed view on their fibre morphology and use as paper feedstock is given. After three different mechanical grinding methods, the plant material was screened, pulped in NaOH and beaten in a PFI mill. Birch fibre has been chosen as short-fibre control and blend base. Hand-sheets with different pulp blends of birch and one of the three raw materials were made, and paper properties were measured. For meadow hay, Virginia mallow and cup plant fibre lengths of 0.5, 1.3, and 0.9 mm were measured. Therefore, all perennial plant materials have comparable fibre lengths to hardwoods. Meadow hay blends with birch pulp percentages of 50 % and 75 % generated higher paper strength compared to the pure birch paper at a beating intensity of 5000 revolutions (PFI).

Chiral selectivity, the ratio of these two fragment ion abundances for the complex containing the analyte in one enantiomeric form expressed relative to that for the fragments of the corresponding complex containing the other enantiomer, ranges from 0.65 to 7.32. Chiral differentiation is highly dependent on the choice of chiral reference compound and central metal ion. The different coordination geometry of complexes resulting from the different d-orbital electronic configurations of these transition metal ions plays a role in chiral discrimination . Of all the transition metal ions examined chiral recognition is lowest for Cuᴵᴵ, because of large distortion of the coordination complexes, and hence weak metal–ligand interactions and small stereochemical effects. It seems that two independent π-cation interactions occur when N-acetyl-substituted aromatic amino acids used as the reference ligands and this accounts for improved chiral discrimination. If both metal–ligand and ligand–ligand interactions are optimized, large chiral selectivity is achieved. The sensitive nature of the methodology and the linear relationship between the logarithm of the fragment ion abundance ratio and the optical purity, which are intrinsic to the kinetic method, enable mixtures to be analyzed for small enantiomeric excess (ee) by simply recording the ratios of fragment ion abundances in a tandem mass spectrum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aamino acids 3adissociation 3aenantiomers 3agases 3aligands 3ametal ions1 aTao, Andy W.1 aCooks, R.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2002 Aug., v. 373, no. 7 p.618-627dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-002-1356-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04076naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013900174300001600313520240700329592002802736650002202764650003002786650001102816650001402827650000902841650001402850650001202864650001602876650001702892650001902909650002202928650002402950650001402974650001802988650001603006650001503022650001703037650001603054651002303070653001703093653002703110653000903137653001603146653001403162653001403176700002503190700002303215700001803238700002103256700002603277773009703303856008903400852000903489655001203498IND60602123020221119231331.0180709e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060212302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaffer, Aneesa10aEvaluating the sterilizing effect of pyriproxyfen treated mosquito nets against Anopheles gambiae at different blood-feeding intervals  ap. 131-135.  aPyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and new insecticides with different modes of action are urgently needed. Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone mimic that reduces fecundity and fertility of adult Anopheles mosquitoes when used as a contact insecticide. A long-lasting insecticidal net incorporating pyriproxyfen is under development. As wild, host-seeking females may succeed in blood-feeding at different intervals after initial contact with mosquito nets the aim of this study was to determine the effect that age and gonotrophic status (nulliparous or parous) and the interval between initial pyriproxyfen exposure and blood-feeding has in terms of subsequent reduced fecundity and fertility.Anopheles gambiae s.s. were exposed to pyriproxyfen LLIN for three minutes in WHO cone bioassays. Four regimens were tested with different blood-feeding intervals A-1 hour (nulliparous), B-1 hour (parous), C-24h (nulliparous), or D-120h (nulliparous) after pyriproxyfen exposure. Mosquito oviposition rate, fecundity and fertility of eggs were recorded for several days. All four treatment regimens produced levels of mortality similar to unexposed females. The overall reduction in reproductive rate of 99.9% for regimen A relative to the untreated net was primarily due to oviposition inhibition in exposed females (97%). Pyriproxyfen was equally effective against older parous mosquitoes and when blood-feeding was 24h after exposure. Regimen D produced a reduction in reproductive rate of 60.1% but this was of lesser magnitude than other regimens and was the only regimen that failed to reduce fertility of laid eggs, indicating the effects of pyriproxyfen exposure on reproduction are to some extent reversible as mosquitoes age. In an area of moderate to high mosquito net coverage a host-seeking mosquito is likely to contact a treated mosquito net before: (a) penetrating a holed net and blood-feeding shortly after exposure or, (b) be frustrated by intact nets before succeeding in blood-feeding on an unprotected individual the following night. Mosquito nets are an appropriate delivery system for pyriproxyfen, based on the large reductions in reproductive rate when blood-feeding between 1h and 24h after exposure. Combining with a pyrethroid should be an effective approach if susceptible mosquitoes are killed and resistant mosquitoes sterilized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3abioassays 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3ahematophagy 3ahost seeking 3ainsect vectors 3ajuvenile hormones 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3amosquito nets 3aoviposition 3apyrethrins 3apyriproxyfen 3asterilizing 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aPyriproxyfen 0aJuvenile hormone mimic 0aLLIN 0aOviposition 0aFecundity 0aFertility1 aProtopopoff, Natacha1 aMosha, Franklin W.1 aMalone, David1 aRowland, Mark W.1 aOxborough, Richard M.0 tActa tropica.g2015 Oct., v. 150 p.131-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03995naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001600282520291100298592002803209650002003237650001303257650001003270650002003280650000903300650001103309650002203320650002303342650001103365650001103376700001903387700001803406700001703424773009003441856008103531852000903612655001203621IND60516492020221119134122.0160325e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051649202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-014-9605-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Tsu-Chiang10aEvaluating differences in spatial visual attention in wayfinding strategy when using 2D and 3D electronic maps  ap. 153-167.  aWith the evolution of mapping technology, electronic maps are gradually evolving from traditional 2D formats, and increasingly using a 3D format to represent environmental features. However, these two types of spatial maps might produce different visual attention modes, leading to different spatial wayfinding (or searching) decisions. This study designs a search task for a spatial object to demonstrate whether different types of spatial maps indeed produce different visual attention and decision making. We use eye tracking technology to record the content of visual attention for 44 test subjects with normal eyesight when looking at 2D and 3D maps. The two types of maps have the same scope, but their contents differ in terms of composition, material, and visual observation angle. We use a t test statistical model to analyze differences in indices of eye movement, applying spatial autocorrelation to analyze the aggregation of fixation points and the strength of aggregation. The results show that aside from seek time, there are significant differences between 2D and 3D electronic maps in terms of fixation time and saccade amplitude. This study uses a spatial autocorrelation model to analyze the aggregation of the spatial distribution of fixation points. The results show that in the 2D electronic map the spatial clustering of fixation points occurs in a range of around 12° from the center, and is accompanied by a shorter viewing time and larger saccade amplitude. In the 3D electronic map, the spatial clustering of fixation points occurs in a range of around 9° from the center, and is accompanied by a longer viewing time and smaller saccadic amplitude. The two statistical tests shown above demonstrate that 2D and 3D electronic maps produce different viewing behaviors. The 2D electronic map is more likely to produce fast browsing behavior, which uses rapid eye movements to piece together preliminary information about the overall environment. This enables basic information about the environment to be obtained quickly, but at the cost of the level of detail of the information obtained. However, in the 3D electronic map, more focused browsing occurs. Longer fixations enable the user to gather detailed information from points of interest on the map, and thereby obtain more information about the environment (such as material, color, and depth) and determine the interaction between people and the environment. However, this mode requires a longer viewing time and greater use of directed attention, and therefore may not be conducive to use over a longer period of time. After summarizing the above research findings, the study suggests that future electronic maps can consider combining 2D and 3D modes to simultaneously display electronic map content. Such a mixed viewing mode can provide a more effective viewing interface for human–machine interaction in cyberspace.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3abrowsing 3acolor 3adecision making 3aeyes 3apeople 3aspatial variation 3astatistical models 3at-test 3avision1 aWu, Shih-Chieh1 aChao, Chi-Wen1 aLee, Su-Hsin0 tGeoJournal.g2016 Apr., v. 81, no. 2 p.153-167dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-014-9605-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245007300179300001600252500001500268520075700283592002801040650002001068650002701088650001201115650001501127650002501142650001001167650001601177650002101193650001801214650003201232650001201264650001001276650001701286653002401303653001501327653001601342653003401358653002701392700002701419700001901446700003001465700002601495700002301521700002201544700002601566773017901592856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60697888420221119215032.0200626e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2019.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta Pedemonte, Noelia B.10aBacillus cereus bacteremia in a patient with an abdominal stab wound  ap. 115-117.  agolden set  aBacillus cereus is a gram positive microorganism commonly involved in gastrointestinal infection but capable of causing severe infections and bacteremia.

The genetics of its resistance to two major grapevine pests, the phylloxera D. vitifoliae and the dagger nematode X. index, vector of the Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), was investigated in a backcross progeny between the F1 resistant hybrid material VRH8771 (Vitis-Muscadinia) derived from the muscadine R source ‘NC184–4’ and V. vinifera cv. ‘Cabernet-Sauvignon’ (CS). RESULTS: In this pseudo-testcross, parental maps were constructed using simple-sequence repeats markers and single nucleotide polymorphism markers from a GBS approach. For the VRH8771 map, 2271 SNP and 135 SSR markers were assembled, resulting in 19 linkage groups (LG) and an average distance between markers of 0.98 cM. Phylloxera resistance was assessed by monitoring root nodosity number in an in planta experiment and larval development in a root in vitro assay. Nematode resistance was studied using 10–12 month long tests for the selection of durable resistance and rating criteria based on nematode reproduction factor and gall index. A major QTL for phylloxera larval development, explaining more than 70% of the total variance and co-localizing with a QTL for nodosity number, was identified on LG 7 and designated RDV6. Additional QTLs were detected on LG 3 (RDV7) and LG 10 (RDV8), depending on the in planta or in vitro experiments, suggesting that various loci may influence or modulate nodosity formation and larval development. Using a Bulked Segregant Analysis approach and a proportion test, markers clustered in three regions on LG 9, LG 10 and LG 18 were shown to be associated to the nematode resistant phenotype. QTL analysis confirmed the results and QTLs were thus designated respectively XiR2, XiR3 and XiR4, although a LOD-score below the significant threshold value was obtained for the QTL on LG 18. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a high-resolution linkage map and a segregating grapevine backcross progeny, the first QTLs for resistance to D. vitifoliae and to X. index were identified from a muscadine source. All together these results open the way to the development of marker-assisted selection in grapevine rootstock breeding programs based on muscadine derived resistance to phylloxera and to X. index in order to delay GFLV transmission.  aPublisher supplied data  a311775cFP7 Ideas: European Research Council  aC-2014-09cMinistère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt  aEDP 09 16 00 2775cMinistère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt  aEDP 09 17 00 3392cMinistère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt  aEDP 09 18 00 3764cMinistère de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Forêt 3aDaktulosphaira vitifoliae 3aGrapevine fanleaf virus 3aPhylloxera 3aVitis rotundifolia var. rotundifolia 3aXiphinema index 3abackcrossing 3achromosome mapping 3alarval development 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3aplant biology 3aprogeny 3arootstocks 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avariance1 aLalanne-Tisné, Guillaume1 aVoisin, Roger1 aTandonnet, Jean-Pascal1 aPortier, Ulysse1 aVan Ghelder, Cyril1 aLafargue, Maria1 aPetit, Jean-Pierre1 aDonnart, Martine1 aJoubard, Benjamin1 aBert, Pierre-François1 aPapura, Daciana1 aLe Cunff, Loïc1 aOllat, Nathalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6182-96861 aEsmenjaud, Daniel0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.213-213dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-2310-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001800170245017200188300001400360520095000374592002801324650001401352650002001366650001601386650001501402650000901417650001801426650001601444650003101460650001501491650005201506650003401558650002801592650004301620650002401663651001101687651001001698653005101708653003101759653002801790653005001818700001601868700001701884700001601901773010201917856008502019852000902104655001202113IND60113373820221119235347.0160903e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011337382DNAL7 a233175662pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Weihua10aTesting of an automatic outdoor gamma ambient dose-rate surveillance system in Tokyo and its calibration using measured deposition after the Fukushima nuclear accident  ap. 93-98.  aAn in-situ fixed point radioactivity surveillance network has been developed at the Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada. The network consists of a number of spectrometric NaI(Tl) detectors measuring, in real-time, ambient gamma dose-rate. The present paper describes the gamma dose-rate monitoring by one detector installed at the Canadian embassy in Tokyo during the Fukushima nuclear accident. Soil samples were collected for the measurement of fallout fission products inventories at each location where the NaI(Tl) detector was installed. The gamma-ray attenuation by the soil matrix was estimated by the information on the depth distribution of 137Cs activities. The study demonstrated that the gamma dose-rates measured by the field NaI(Tl) spectrometric method agreed well with the laboratory results estimated by the inventories of fallout fission products deposited in the soil and the vertical distribution of 137Cs in the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetectors 3agamma radiation 3ainventories 3amonitoring 3asoil 3asoil sampling 2aCalibration 2aFukushima Nuclear Accident 2aGamma Rays 2aRadiation Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aRadioactive Falloutxanalysis 2aRadioisotopesxanalysis 2aSoil Pollutants, Radioactivexanalysis 2aSpectrometry, Gamma 3aCanada 0aTokyo 0aIn-situ environmental radioactivity monitoring 0aFukushima nuclear accident 0aAmbient gamma dose-rate 0aInventory of fallout fission products in soil1 aKorpach, Ed1 aBerg, Rodney1 aUngar, Kurt0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2013 Nov., v. 125 p.93-98dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009300173300001400266506002800280520097200308592002801280506003701308650001101345650002201356650002101378650001601399650002101415650002701436650002601463650002901489650002301518650001501541650001801556650001801574650001101592650003001603650001701633650001701650650001301667653002601680653002701706653002101733653002101754700001401775700001801789700001801807700002401825773012701849856008301976852000902059655001202068IND60785158620221207125233.0170315e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078515862DNAL7 a10.23869/bphjbr.15.1.200982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugijanto, Noor Erma10aDaya antimikroba ekstrak Lecythophora sp. endofit Yang diisolasi dari Alyxia reinwardtii  ap. 37-44.  aResource is Open Access  aThe antimicrobial potential of two endophytic fungi isolated from Alyxia reinwardtii BL, towards selected bacteria (Staphylococcusaureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Bacillus subtilis FNCC 0059, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Salmonellatyphi) and fungi (Candida albicans) was tested using ethyl acetate, n-hexane and n-buthanol extracts of fungi cultivated under malt extract liquid fermentation.

The influence of two controlling factors (i.e. water content (11%, 35–50%, wet basis) and temperature (20–90°C and back to 20°C)) on water distribution and starch transformation was investigated. Quantitative analysis of 2D T1-T2 maps greatly facilitated the interpretation of T1 relaxation times, which have been interpreted rather narrowly in the literature when classically measured in one-dimension. Application of the new IR-FID-CPMG sequence allowed distinction between different proton pools with different T1 relaxation times, particularly when the starch gelatinization occurred. The quantification of each T1 component permitted to assign the short T1 to slow cross relaxation phenomena, highlighting proton chemical and/or diffusional exchanges between water and starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3agelatinization 3aheat 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3astarch 3atemperature 3awater content 3awheat 3awheat starch 0aWheat starch 0aWater distribution 0aTD-NMR 0a2D T1-T2 0aCross relaxation 0aRetrogradation 0aGelatinization1 aRondeau-Mouro, C.0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 214 p.412-422dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.07.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01652naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001600260520059500276592002800871650002000899650002100919650002400940650002100964700001900985700002301004700002201027700001701049700001901066773011501085856008201200990002301282852000901305655001201314IND60091153620221121122252.0141103e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009115362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.12.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreau, Julie10aSynthesis and characterization of oligonucleotide conjugates bearing electroactive labels  ap. 955-958.  aOxime bond formation has been applied to the preparation of oligonucleotides labeled with electrochemical ferrocene and viologen labels.

In addition, the reduction of pesticide applications after planting Bt crops also increases the severity of mirid bug outbreaks. Peristenus spretus is a parasitoid of mirid nymphs, but its sensitivity to Bt proteins is not known. In the current study, we developed a dietary exposure assay to assess the effects of Bt proteins (Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1F, Cry2Aa, and Cry2Ab) on P. spretus adults using a diet consisting of a 10% honey solution with or without Bt proteins at 400 µg g–¹ diet. The results showed that the survival and reproduction of P. spretus adults were reduced by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (a positive control) but were not affected by any of the five Bt proteins. The activities of digestive, detoxifying, and antioxidant enzymes in P. spretus were also unaffected by diets containing the Cry proteins, but they were significantly affected by the diet containing E-64. We then developed a tri-trophic bioassay to determine the effects of the five Bt proteins on P. spretus larvae and pupae. In this assay, A. lucorum nymphs fed an artificial diet containing Cry proteins were used as the hosts for P. spretus. The results of the tri-trophic assay indicated that neither the pupation rate nor the eclosion rate of the P. spretus parasitoids were significantly affected by the presence of high concentrations of Bt proteins in the parasitized A. lucorum nymphs. The overall results indicate that these two assays can be used to evaluate the toxicity of insecticidal compounds to P. spretus and that the tested Cry proteins are not toxic to P. spretus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeristenus 3aagriculture 3aartificial diets 3abioassays 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3adietary exposure 3aeclosion 3ahoney 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3apesticides 3apupation 3areproduction 3atoxicity 3aChina 0atransgenic crops 0aplant bugs 0aparasitic natural enemy 0aCry proteins 0anon-target risk assessment1 aLI, Yun-he1 aNIU, Lin-lin1 aChen, Lin,1 aLIANG, Ge-mei0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2022 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.1424-1435dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

A study was taken up to understand the seasonal changes of physical processes at the headland bound and compared with exposed beaches. The spatio-temporal morpho-sedimentary dynamics were carried out through beach profiles, sediment samples, and simulated wave climates across two complete annual cycle. The beach profile survey was carried out using RTK-GPS, wherein the GRADISTAT was used for analysing sediment samples. The seasonal wave climates were studied with the SWAN model coupled with WAVEWATCH III. Observation shows, the sediment environment at headland bound beach is strongly dominated by fine sand throughout the year, whereas the exposed beach is illustrated from fine to medium sand across seasonal scale. The seasonal change in beach morphology occurs considerably in the exposed beach than that compared to headland bound. Successively, the occurrence of shoreline retreat is shown maximum up to 20 m in at the exposed beach during the monsoon. Both the locations showed strong seasonal variation in the wave energy as well as direction, whereas the nearshore wave energy at exposed beach is comparatively high with an average of 8342 J/m² than the headland bound due to less deviation in the wave propagation. The analysis of seasonal wave pattern together with beach morpho-sedimentary processes exhibit the influence of wave conditions at the exposed beach when compared with headland bound beach and so the study implies for offset morphological changes and tailored management to protect the beaches from natural coastal hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3aclimate 3acoasts 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3asand 3aseasonal variation 3ashorelines 3asurveys 3awater power 3aIndia1 aKankara, R.

Oral administration of VR at 40mg/kg for 7days markedly reduced the ISO-induced increase in the levels of serum cardiac markers such as troponin-T, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase as well as cardiac lipid peroxidation with a parallel increase in the cellular antioxidants suggesting its cardio-protective and free radical scavenging potential, which was latter confirmed by in vitro study. Rats treated with test compound also improved the ISO-induced abnormal changes in ECG as well as in cardiac histology. A reduction in myocardial necrosis was further evidenced by the tri-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain in isolated test drug pretreated rats. These findings suggest the cardio-protective potential of the isolated alkaloid and possibly the beneficial action is mediated through its free radical scavenging property.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aalanine transaminase 3ablood serum 3acreatine 3adrugs 3afree radical scavengers 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3ahistology 3ain vitro studies 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3anecrosis 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atetrazolium 3atoxicity 3atroponin T1 aKar, Anand1 aSharma, Pratibha1 aŚarmā, Aśoka,0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 23, no. 4 p.959-962dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.12.0603Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009900174300002000273520122500293592002801518650001401546650002001560650001901580650001601599650001401615650001101629650001801640650002001658650000901678650001001687650001001697650002101707700003701728700002501765773014901790856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60583103220221120083205.0171008e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058310322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9973-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandian, Amith Kishore10aEmission analysis on the effect of nanoparticles on neat biodiesel in unmodified diesel engine  ap. 23273-23278.  aBiodiesels derived from the mahua seeds are established as a promising alternative for the diesel fuel owing to its non-edible nature and improved properties. TiO₂ nanoparticle in powder form is added to neat mahua oil biodiesel (BD100) to examine its effect on emission characteristics. TiO₂ nanoparticle is chosen as an additive owing to its catalytic effect, higher surface energy, and larger surface to volume ratio. TiO₂ nanoparticle with an average size of 60 nm was synthesized by sol-gel route. TiO₂ nanoparticles are added with mahua biodiesel (BD100) at 100 and 200 ppm. Mahua oil biodiesel doped with 100 and 200 ppm of TiO₂ nanoparticles are referred as BD100T100 and BD100T200. A constant speed diesel engine is employed for the experimental trail. Engine is fueled with diesel, BD100, BD100T100, and BD100T200, respectively. Experimental result confirmed that the modified fuels (BD100T200 and BD100T100) showed a significant reduction in all the emissions. Further, the addition of TiO₂ nanoparticle (200 ppm) to mahua biodiesel gave respective reduction of 9.3, 5.8, 6.6, and 2.7% in carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and smoke emissions when compared to neat mahua biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aenergy 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen oxides 3aoils 3aseeds 3asmoke 3atitanium dioxide1 aRamakrishnan, Ramesh Bapu Bathey1 aDevarajan, Yuvarajan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Oct., v. 24, no. 29 p.23273-23278dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9973-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007700166300001800243520047600261592002800737650003400765650002500799650002300824650002300847650001400870653001900884653002700903653001900930653001600949653003400965700001700999700002101016700002001037773011201057856008401169852000901253655001201262IND60599544220221118143524.0180702e20141105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059954422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.09.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yueting10aEfficient synthesis and antioxidant activity of coelenterazine analogues  ap. 6212-6215.  aA convenient and highly convergent method for the synthesis of new imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-based coelenterazine analogues is reported.

The parameters of the enzyme's kinetics, Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ, were directly determined from progress curves at only one concentration of the substrate. For comparison with the classical Michaelis–Menten analysis, the reaction progress was also monitored at various initial concentrations of 3.5 to 41.8mM. Using the Lambert W function the parameters Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ were fitted to obtain the experimental progress curve and resulted in Kₘ=28mM and Vₘₐₓ=13μM/s. The result is almost identical to an initial rate analysis that, however, costs much more time and experimental effort. The effect of product inhibition was also investigated. Furthermore, we analyzed a much more complex reaction, the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate into (+)-germacrene D by the enzyme germacrene D synthase, yielding Kₘ=379μM and kcₐₜ=0.04s⁻¹. The reaction involves an amphiphilic substrate forming micelles and a water insoluble product; using proper controls, the conversion can well be analyzed by the progress curve approach using the Lambert W function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aenzymatic reactions 3agermacrene 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asucrose1 aMeyer, Bernd1 aHackl, Thomas0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Mar., v. 1824, no. 3 p.443-449dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01300naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245013700167300001800304520022700322592002800549650001400577650002300591650002700614650002300641650002400664650001100688700001900699700002300718700001700741773013400758856007300892852000900965655001200974IND60658619220221119130659.0190826e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065861922DNAL7 a10.1039/c001350a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldmann, H.q(Herbert),10aSilver catalyzed cascade synthesis of alkaloid ring systems: concise total synthesis of fascaplysin, homofascaplysin C and analogues  ap. 4622-4624.  aA silver catalyzed and microwave assisted one-pot cascade synthesis provides efficient access to diverse alkaloid-inspired scaffold classes, and a concise and efficient total synthesis of homofascaplysin C and fascaplysin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3amicrowave treatment 3asilver1 aEberhardt, Luc1 aWittstein, Kathrin1 aKumar, Kamal0 tChemical communications.g2010 June 16, v. 46, no. 25 p.4622-4624dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c001350a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015500163300002000318520178900338592002802127596009202155596007002247596005902317596007802376596009202454650002502546650002302571650001902594650001402613650001302627650002102640700001702661700005202678773015602730856008302886852000902969655001202978IND60748840720221120204458.0220126e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074884072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13808-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Song14aThe hidden mediating role of innovation efficiency in coordinating development of economy and ecological environment: evidence from 283 Chinese cities  ap. 47668-47684.  aThe advancement of technological innovations may facilitate the coordinated development of the economy and ecological environment (EGE); however, few studies have noted the role of innovation efficiency (INEF) as a bridge between economic development and EGE. To fill in this gap, this paper adopts DMSP/OLS nighttime light data to measure the level of economic development and the improved data envelopment analysis model to measure INEF, establishing an index system to quantify EGE. Then we propose the panel threshold-mediating (PTM) model that combines the panel threshold model and the mediating effect model. On these bases, considering INEF as a mediator, we use this novel PTM model to empirically test the nonlinear relationship between economic development and EGE in 283 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2018. The results indicate that (1) while economic development can improve EGE, its positive impact on EGE differs with different INEF thresholds. A higher INEF threshold indicates a stronger positive effect of economic development on EGE. (2) For the entire sample, the mediating effect of INEF between economic development and EGE is not significant. However, after applying the PTM model, we found that the mediating effect of INEF was concealed by the sample population. (3) When INEF is lower than 0.2381, its complete mediating effect is verified. When INEF is higher than 0.2381, its mediating effect is not significant. On the contrary, economic development directly improves EGE. (4) Industrial agglomeration, the scale of government expenditure, residents’ education level, degree of opening up, and transport infrastructure are all conducive to EGE. These findings can help cities at different INEF levels to achieve coordinated development of economy and EGE.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020M680960cThe 68th batch of general funding of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aL20CJL001cYouth project of Liaoning social science planning fund  a42071154cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a18ZDA040cMajor Program of the Chinese National Social Science Foundation  a20YJA790010cMinistry of Education Humanities and Social Sciences Research Program Fund 3aeconomic development 3aeducational status 3ainfrastructure 3apollution 3aresearch 3athreshold models1 aWang, Jiexin1 aFan, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5350-18000 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 34 p.47668-47684dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13808-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012700168300001600295520141900311592002801730650001701758650001501775650001701790650000901807650002201816650001601838650001601854650001101870650002601881650001401907650001301921650001501934650001101949650000701960650002101967650001901988653001602007653001602023653002602039653002102065653001802086700002402104773013802128856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60595410220221121013707.0180602e20180321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059541022DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2017.13933872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeniz, Fatih12aA natural macroalgae consortium for biosorption of copper from aqueous solution: Optimization, modeling and design studies  ap. 362-368.  aIn this study, the capacity of a natural macroalgae consortium consisting of Chaetomorpha sp., Polysiphonia sp., Ulva sp. and Cystoseira sp. species for the removal of copper ions from aqueous environment was investigated at different operating conditions, such as solution pH, copper ion concentration and contact time. These environmental parameters affecting the biosorption process were optimized on the basis of batch experiments. The experimentally obtained data for the biosorption of copper ions onto the macroalgae-based biosorbent were modeled using the isotherm models of Freundlich, Langmuir, Sips and Dubinin–Radushkevich and the kinetic models of pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich and Weber and Morris. The pseudo-first-order and Sips equations were the most suitable models to describe the copper biosorption from aqueous solution. The thermodynamic data revealed the feasibility, spontaneity and physical nature of biosorption process. Based on the data of Sips isotherm model, the biosorption capacity of biosorbent for copper ions was calculated as 105.370 mg g⁻¹ under the optimum operating conditions. A single-stage batch biosorption system was developed to predict the real-scale-based copper removal performance of biosorbent. The results of this investigation showed the potential utility of macroalgae consortium for the biosorption of copper ions from aqueous medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetomorpha 3aCystoseira 3aPolysiphonia 3aUlva 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acopper 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3akinetics 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3athermodynamics 0aBiosorption 0acopper ions 0amacroalgae consortium 0aprocess modeling 0asystem design1 aErsanli, Elif Tezel0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Mar. 21, v. 20, no. 4 p.362-368dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.13933873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245014000152300001800292500002000310520120200330592002801532650001501560650001501575650002901590650001801619650002301637650001901660650002101679650000701700650002801707650001001735650001401745650002001759650001301779650002101792700001701813700001401830700001701844700001501861773012201876856007201998852000902070655001202079IND60520777920221118054245.0160524e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052077792DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.32962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tong10aBiological responses of Vicia faba seedlings to the imidazolium‐based ionic liquid 1‐hexyl‐3‐methylimidazolium chloride in soil  ap. 1502-1510.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough there are a few studies on the toxicity of ionic liquids (ILs), relatively little is known about their toxic effects on plants in soil. In the present study, the toxic effects of 1‐hexyl‐3‐methylimidazolium chloride ([Hmim]Cl) in the soil on Vicia faba seedlings and the influences of [Hmim]Cl on the physicochemical properties of the soil were studied. Organic matter content, pH, and conductivity of the tested soil were significantly altered at [Hmim]Cl concentrations greater than 1000 mg kg⁻¹. Moreover, shoot length, root length, dry weight, and pigment content of the V. faba seedlings were greatly inhibited when the [Hmim]Cl concentration was greater than 500 mg kg⁻¹. The roots were the most seriously affected organ and stopped growing at 3000 mg kg⁻¹. In addition, [Hmim]Cl caused an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species at [Hmim]Cl concentrations above 250 mg kg⁻¹ that resulted in lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress in the V. faba seedlings. The present study provides information that is useful for evaluation of the environmental safety of ILs in soil.

The antigenicity, pathogenicity and epidemiology of this virus have been unclear. Here we first used a recombinant baculovirus expression system to express the 13 and 111 N-terminus amino-acid-truncated DcHEV ORF2 protein in insect Tn5 cells, and we obtained two types of virus-like particles (VLPs) with densities of 1.300g/cm³ and 1.285g/cm³, respectively. The small VLPs (Dc4sVLPs) were estimated to be 24nm in diameter, and were assembled by a protein with the molecular mass 53kDa. The large VLPs (Dc3nVLPs and Dc4nVLPs) were 35nm in diameter, and were assembled by a 64-kDa protein. An antigenic analysis demonstrated that DcHEV was cross-reactive with G1, G3–G6, ferret and rat HEVs, and DcHEV showed a stronger cross-reactivity to G1 G3–G6 HEV than it did to rat and ferret HEV. In addition, the antibody against DcHEV-LPs neutralized G1 and G3 HEV in a cell culture system, suggesting that the serotypes of these HEVs are identical. We also found that the amino acid residue Met-358 affects the small DcHEV-LPs assembly.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthohepevirus A 3across reaction 3aBaculoviridae 3aantibodies 3acell culture 3aserotypes 3avirus-like particles 3aferrets 3aamino acids 3apathogenicity 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aviruses 3arats 3amolecular weight 3ainsects 3aUnited Arab Emirates 0aVLP 0aDromedary camel HEV 0aVirus-like particles 0aRecombinant baculovirus 0aInsect cells Tn5 0aHepatitis E virus1 aKataoka, Michiyo1 aLiu, Zheng1 aTakeda, Naokazu1 aWakita, Takaji1 aLi, Tian-Cheng0 tVirus research.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 210 p.8-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011800175300001600293520130700309592002801616650002501644650001601669650001301685650002001698650000901718650004101727650002101768650001901789650003001808650002101838653001901859653001901878653001701897653003001914653002301944700002101967700002701988700002002015700003202035773013702067856008502204852000902289655001202298IND60595410320221121013711.0180602e20180607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059541032DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2017.13933882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimizadeh, Maryam10aCoupling of bioaugmentation and phytoremediation to improve PCBs removal from a transformer oil-contaminated soil  ap. 658-665.  aThis study was carried out to assess the dissipation of 17 selected polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBᵢ) congeners in a transformer oil-contaminated soil using bioaugmentation with 2 PCB-degrading bacterial strains, i.e., Pseudomonas spp. S5 and Alcaligenes faecalis, assisted or not by the maize (Zea mays L.) plantation. After 5 and 10 weeks of treatment, the remaining concentrations of the target PCBᵢ congeners in the soil were extracted and measured using GC-MS. Results showed that the bacterial augmentation treatments with Pseudomonas spp. S5 and A. faecalis led to 21.4% and 20.4% reduction in the total concentration of the target PCBs (ΣPCBᵢ), respectively, compared to non-bioaugmented unplanted control soil. The ΣPCBᵢ decreased by 35.8% in the non-bioaugmented planted soil compared with the control. The greatest degradation of the PCB congeners was observed over a 10-week period in the soil inoculated with Pseudomonas spp. S5 and cultivated with maize. Under this treatment, the ΣPCBᵢ decreased from 357 to 119 ng g⁻¹ (66.7% lower) and from 1091 to 520 ng g⁻¹ (52.3% lower). Overall, the results suggested that the combined application of phytoremediation and bioaugmentation was an effective technique to remove PCBs and remediate transformer oil-contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes faecalis 3aPseudomonas 3aZea mays 3abioaugmentation 3acorn 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asoil inoculation 0aBioremediation 0abiostimulation 0ahydrocarbons 0apolychlorinated biphenyls 0asoil contamination1 aShirvani, Mehran1 aShariatmadari, Hossein1 aNikaeen, Mahnaz1 aLeili Mohebi Nozar, Seyedeh0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 June 7, v. 20, no. 7 p.658-665dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.13933883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014500174300001800319520174700337592002802084650002702112650003402139650001102173650000902184650001002193650001202203650001502215650001102230650001702241650002202258650002002280650002402300650001502324650002302339650002902362650002602391650001402417653001702431653001402448700002402462773012202486856008502608852000902693655001202702IND60549614420221119111105.0180829e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054961442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriis, R. Magnus N.10aAttenuation of transcriptional and signaling responses limits viability of ρ0Saccharomyces cerevisiae during periods of glucose deprivation  ap. 2563-2575.  aThe maintenance of viability during periods when a glycolytic carbon source is limited (or absent) is a major obstacle for cells whose mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been damaged or lost.We utilized genome wide transcriptional profiling and in gel mobility analyses to examine the transcriptional response and characterize defects in the phosphorylation dependent signaling events that occur during acute glucose starvation in ρ⁰ cells that lack mtDNA. Genetic and pharmacological interventions were employed to clarify the contribution of nutrient responsive kinases to regulation of the transcription factors that displayed abnormal phosphoregulation in ρ⁰ cells.The transcriptional response to glucose deprivation is dampened but not blocked in ρ⁰ cells. Genes regulated by the transcription factors Mig1, Msn2, Gat1, and Ume6 were noticeably affected and phosphorylation of these factors in response to nutrient depletion is abnormal in ρ⁰ cells. Regulation of the nutrient responsive kinases PKA and Snf1 remains normal in ρ⁰ cells. The phosphorylation defect results from ATP depletion and loss of the activity of kinases including GSK3β, Rim15, and Yak1. Interventions which rescue phosphoregulation of transcription factors bolster maintenance of viability in ρ⁰ cells during subsequent glucose deprivation.A subset of nutrient responsive kinases is especially sensitive to ATP levels and their misregulation may underlie regulatory defects presented by ρ⁰ cells.General significance: Abnormal regulation of mitochondrial function is implicated in numerous human disorders. This work illustrates that some signaling pathways are more sensitive than others to metabolic defects caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acarbon 3agels 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3astarvation 3atau-protein kinase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aviability 0aMitochondria 0aViability1 aSchultz, Michael C.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 Nov., v. 1860, no. 11 p.2563-2575dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245005000166300001600216520100300232592002801235650001601263650002501279650002601304650001301330650002401343650001001367700001601377773011001393856007401503852000901577655001201586IND60440213720221119063407.0151024e199805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044021372DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029788222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafenberg, Christophe10aLife cycle analysis of the newspaper le monde  ap. 131-144.  aOn behalf of the French press group Le MONDE, four newspapers have been examined in a Life Cycle Assessment study.

We surveyed the understory woody vegetation growing in 7-year-old stands of T. grandis and the native tree species Terminalia amazonia in a plantation in western Panama that was managed with both commercial timber and biodiversity conservation objectives. We predicted that if T. grandis suppressed forest regeneration then the understories of T. grandis stands would have a lower density of woody stems, smaller stems, and fewer species than stands of T. amazonia. None of our predictions were supported. Densities of woody stems were 0.56 ± 0.21 m⁻²(mean ± SE) and 0.64 ± 0.10 m⁻²in T. grandis and T. amazonia understories, respectively. Stem height structure was similar under both species, where stems <1 m height dominated. Understory species richness did not differ between the two species; in total, 27 and 30 woody species were sampled in T. grandis and T. amazonia stands, respectively. However, understory species composition differed between the two crop species. Overall, our results are inconsistent with the idea that T. grandis plantations suppress forest regeneration and suggest that the lack of woody vegetation in other T. grandis plantation understories may be attributable to management actions, such as understory thinning, rather than species effects of T. grandis. Further research is needed to compare T. grandis and native species for their effects on forest regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTectona grandis 3aTerminalia amazonia 3acrops 3aforest regeneration 3aindigenous species 3aplantations 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3astems 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avegetation 3awoody plants 3aPanama1 aDent, Daisy H.1 aDeago, José1 aWishnie, Mark H.0 tNew forests.g2015 Jan., v. 46, no. 1 p.157-165dSpringer-Verlagx0169-42867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-014-9448-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04029naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010700164500001900271520266600290592002802956650002202984650002003006650002103026650001403047650002103061650001803082650001703100650001703117650001403134650001603148650001203164650002403176650001903200650001603219650001103235650001603246700001903262700002303281700002003304700002103324773013603345856008103481852000903562655001203571IND60698190520221118031003.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069819052DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200030922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuyot, Erika10aComparing the impact of two types of bariatric surgery on food preferences: The BARIATASTE pilot study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUp to day, the most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. Nevertheless, weight regain may occur in almost 20% of the patients. Furthermore, nutritional complications such as protein malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies remain common. Clinical experience and scientific literature suggest changes in food preferences after bariatric surgery, which may contribute to weight loss and/or weight regain independently of the surgically-induced reduction of energy intake. Yet, there is inconsistency among the studies as they do not always use objective measures to assess food preferences and only few considered and compared the different types of surgical technics. Our objective was to study the impact of the type of bariatric surgery on the liking and wanting of consuming certain foods varying in composition and appearance. We conducted a cross-sectional clinical trial among 90 patients followed at the Integrated Center for Obesity/Hospital of Lyon. The patients were divided into three groups according to whether they had an unoperated severe obesity (OB), a sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or a gastric bypass (RYGB). We assessed food preferences using the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ), a behavioral computer task. Binge eating, impulsivity and food addiction were assessed with self-report questionnaires. Statistical analysis of food preferences included ANOVAs, post-hoc comparisons of groups two-by-two and linear regressions to adjust results for potential confounders. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were performed to determine food preference patterns and groups of individuals with similar food preferences. Our results showed a significant difference in liking scores, with the OB group having higher scores for high-fat savory (HFSA), high-fat sweet (HFSW) and low-fat sweet foods (LFSW) (p < 0.0001) relative to LSG and RYGB groups. Additionally, LSG had greater score of liking for HFSA than RYGB (p = 0.001). There was a high correlation between the binge eating score and the liking scores for HFSA, HFSW and LFSW (p < 0.001). Our study expands the knowledge regarding changes in food preferences after bariatric surgery and may help to better understand potential underlying mechanisms by comparing two different surgical technics. This pilot study will be followed by a prospective study of food preferences after bariatric surgery using the LFPQ, a buffet type food in an experimental restaurant and sensory measurements. Eventually, our project may contribute to modulate post-operative nutritional interventions in order to facilitate the adoption of a healthy diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3abariatric surgery 3aclinical trials 3acluster analysis 3acomputers 3aeating disorders 3aenergy intake 3afood choices 3ahealthy diet 3ahospitals 3akwashiorkor 3aobesity 3aprospective studies 3aquestionnaires 3arestaurants 3asavory 3aweight loss1 aIceta, Sylvain1 aNazare, Julie-Anne1 aDisse, Emmanuel1 aDougkas, Anestis0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

G.10aHow are Radicals (Re)Generated in Photochemical ATRP?  ap. 13303-13312.  aThe polymerization mechanism of photochemically mediated Cu-based atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was investigated using both experimental and kinetic modeling techniques. There are several distinct pathways that can lead to photochemical (re)generation of Cuᴵ activator species or formation of radicals. These (re)generation pathways include direct photochemical reduction of the Cuᴵᴵ complexes by excess free amine moieties and unimolecular reduction of the Cuᴵᴵ complex, similar to activators regenerated by electron-transfer (ARGET) ATRP processes. Another pathway is photochemical radical generation either directly from the alkyl halide, ligand, or via interaction of ligand with either monomer or with alkyl halides. These photochemical radical generation processes are similar to initiators for continuous activator regeneration (ICAR) ATRP processes. A series of model experiments, ATRP reactions, and kinetic simulations were performed to evaluate the contribution of these reactions to the photochemical ATRP process. The results of these studies indicate that the dominant radical (re)generation reaction is the photochemical reduction of Cuᴵᴵ complexes by free amines moieties (from amine containing ligands). The unimolecular reduction of the Cuᴵᴵ deactivator complex is not significant, however, there is some contribution from ICAR ATRP reactions involving the interaction of alkyl halides and ligand, ligand with monomer, and the photochemical cleavage of the alkyl halide. Therefore, the mechanism of photochemically mediated ATRP is consistent with a photochemical ARGET ATRP reaction dominating the radical (re)generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3aelectron transfer 3afree radicals 3ahalides 3aligands 3amodels 3apolymerization1 aKonkolewicz, Dominik1 aBernhard, Stefan1 aMatyjaszewski, K.q(Krzysztof),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 136, no. 38 p.13303-13312dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja506379s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245011700195300002000312506007600332520063700408592002801045506003701073650001201110650002101122650001301143650002001156700002901176700001801205700002501223773013501248856007501383852000901458655001201467IND60539948720221207061411.0160818e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053994872DNAL7 a10.1021/ja506497b2doi7 aPMC41836292pmcid7 a252086862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhuo10aIsotope Effects, Dynamic Matching, and Solvent Dynamics in a Wittig Reaction.

The isotope effects support a cycloaddition mechanism involving two sequential transition states associated with separate C–C and P–O bond formations. However, the betaine structure in between the two transition states is bypassed as an equilibrated intermediate in most trajectories. The role of the dynamics of solvent equilibration in the nature of mechanistic intermediates is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abetaine 3achemical bonding 3asolvents 3astable isotopes1 aNieves-Quinones, Yexenia1 aWaas, Jack R.1 aSingleton, Daniel A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 136, no. 38 p.13122-13125dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja506497b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04209naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016400168500001900332520263300351592002802984650001203012650001503024650001903039650001603058650001403074650002403088650002103112650002303133650000903156650001703165650001303182650001803195650001203213650001203225650004003237650001103277650002903288650001503317650000903332650001903341700002303360700002303383700002003406700002203426700001703448773013603465856008103601852000903682655001203691IND60698191920221118031322.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069819192DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200032372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoates, Alison.,13aAn almond-enriched diet improves biomarkers of cardiometabolic health and increases alertness without changing cognitive performance in older overweight adults  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLongitudinal studies report that regular nut consumption is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease and better cognitive function. Thus, nuts may improve cardiovascular and neurocognitive health – especially in ‘at-risk’ populations (e.g. overweight/obese). This study examined the effect of supplementing habitual diets of overweight/obese individuals for 12 weeks with either almonds or carbohydrate rich (CHO-rich) snack foods on biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic health, mood and cognitive performance. Participants (n = 151; overweight/obese, 50–80 years) were randomised to replace 15% energy intake with either almonds (Almond) or isocaloric CHO-rich snack foods (Comparator). Body weight, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, blood pressure (BP), arterial stiffness, mood and cognitive performance (memory, executive function, speed of processing) were measured at baseline and 12 weeks. One hundred and twenty eight participants (78F:50M, n = 63 almond, n = 65 control) completed the intervention (M ± SD: age 64 ± 8years, BMI 30.3 ± 3.6kg/m², stable medication use: 32% BP and 19% lipid lowering). Compared with the CHO-rich comparator foods, there were a number of significant improvements associated with almond consumption. These included reduced serum triglycerides (M ± SEM, almond: 1.30 ± 0.062 to 1.16 ± 0.062 mmol/L vs CHO-rich 1.13 ± 0.061 to 1.17 ± 0.061 mmol/L, p = 0.005 whole population). In those with cholesterol below the ATPIII cut point of < 6.2mmol/L (84% of sample), almond consumption reduced total cholesterol (almond: 5.12 ± 0.13 to 4.93 ± 0.12 mmol/L vs CHO-rich 5.24 ± 0.13 to 5.21 ± 0.11 mmol/L, p < 0.001) and LDL-cholesterol (almond: 3.03 ± 0.11 to 2.87 ± 0.11 mmol/L vs CHO-rich 2.98 ± 0.10 to 3.07 ± 0.10 mmol/L, p = 0.002).). Additionally in a non-BP medicated subgroup only (n = 87, 68% of sample), there was a reduction in systolic BP (almond: 130.73 ± 2.19 to 127.02 ± 2.19 mmHg vs control:128.63 ± 2.32 to 129.48 ± 2.32mmHg, p = 0.035; and improved self-rated alertness (almond 54.73 ± 2.32 to 58.64 ± 2.32 vs CHO-rich 61.75 ± 2.28 to 61.13 ± 2.28, p = 0.048). The inclusion of almonds in the diet has the ability to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health and mood in overweight/obese adults. The lack of change in cognitive performance may reflect the fact that the study population was cognitively high performing at baseline. Future research should be directed at examining the effects of this relatively simple, cost-effective nutritional intervention in populations at greater risk of cardiometabolic and cognitive decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3abiomarkers 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acoronary disease 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3adrug therapy 3aemotions 3aenergy intake 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amemory 3anutritional intervention 3aoverweight 3arisk 3arisk reduction1 aMorgillo, Samantha1 aYandell, Catherine1 aScholey, Andrew1 aBuckley, Jonathan1 aHill, Alison0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

During H. pylori infection, different kinds of inflammatory cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, eosinophils, T cells and B cells are accumulated into the stomach. The interactions between chemokines and their respective receptors recruit particular types of the leukocytes that ultimately determine the nature of immune response and therefore, have a main influence on the consequence of infection. The suitable production of chemokines especially in the early stages of H. pylori infection shapes appropriate immune responses that contribute to the H. pylori elimination. The unbalanced expression of the chemokines can contribute in the induction of inappropriate responses that result in the tissue damage or malignancy. Thus, chemokines and their receptors may be promising potential targets for designing the therapeutic strategies against various types H. pylori-related gastrointestinal disorders. In this review, a comprehensive explanation regarding the roles played by chemokines in H. pylori-mediated peptic ulcer, gastritis and gastric malignancies was provided while presenting the potential utilization of these chemoattractants as therapeutic elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aT-lymphocytes 3achemoattractants 3achemokines 3adendritic cells 3aeosinophils 3agastritis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alymphoma 3amacrophages 3amast cells 3aneutrophils 3apathogens 3apeptic ulcers 3areceptors 3astomach 3astomach neoplasms 3atherapeutics 0aHelicobacter pylori 0aChemokines 0aChemokine receptors1 aNemati, Maryam1 aJafarzadeh, Sara0 tLife sciences.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 231 p.116688-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1166883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013300156300002000289520170800309592002802017650001702045650001602062650001102078650002102089650001202110650002602122650002402148650000902172650001502181650001102196650001102207650001902218650001202237650001302249650001102262650000802273650000902281700001902290700002502309700001902334700002302353700001802376700002802394700002802422773013502450856007502585852000902660655001202669IND60539950320221121154811.0160818e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995032DNAL7 a10.1021/ja507297p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Yurina10aEnhanced Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution from Fe4S4-Based Biomimetic Chalcogels Containing M2+ (M = Pt, Zn, Co, Ni, Sn) Centers  ap. 13371-13380.  aNaturally abundant enzymes often feature active sites comprising transition metal cluster units that catalyze chemical processes and reduce small molecules as well as protons. We introduce a family of new chalcogenide aerogels (chalcogels), aiming to model the function of active sites and the structural features of a larger protective framework. New metal incorporated iron sulfur tin sulfide chalcogels referred to as ternary chalcogels and specifically the chalcogels M-ITS-cg3, fully integrate biological redox-active Fe₄S₄ clusters into a semiconducting porous framework by bridging them with Sn₄S₁₀ linking units. In the M-ITS-cg3 system we can tailor the electro- and photocatalytic properties of chalcogels through the control of spatial distance of redox-active Fe₄S₄ centers using additional linking metal ions, M²⁺ (Pt, Zn, Co, Ni, Sn). The presence of a third metal does not change the structural properties of the biomimetic chalcogels but modifies and even enhances their functional performance. M-ITS-cg3s exhibit electrocatalytic activity in proton reduction that arises from the Fe₄S₄ clusters but is tuned inductively by M²⁺. The metal ions alter the reduction potential of Fe₄S₄ in a favorable manner for photochemical hydrogen production. The Pt incorporated ITS-cg3 shows the greatest improvement in the overall hydrogen yield compared to the binary ITS-cg3. The ability to manipulate the properties of biomimetic chalcogels through synthetic control of the composition, while retaining both structural and functional properties, illustrates the chalcogels’ flexibility and potential in carrying out useful electrochemical and photochemical reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abiomimetics 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzymes 3afunctional properties 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3ametal ions 3amodels 3anickel 3aphotocatalysis 3aprotons 3asulfides 3asulfur 3atin 3azinc1 aYoung, Ryan M.1 aDouvalis, Alexios

The median concentration of ΣOPFRs was 2202 ng/l in the seawater from 2017. ΣAlkyl-OPFRs was the predominant constitution in the seawater with a median contribution of nearly 80%, and ΣCl-OPFRs was the major component in the sediment. Regarding BFRs, BDE-209 was the principal one in the sediment. The levels of TEP, TCEP and TBEP in sediments displayed significantly seasonal variations. The summer concentration of TEP was higher than that in both the spring and autumn, and concerning TCEP and TBEP, their lowest concentration occurred in summer. The concentration of ΣOPFRs experienced a rapid increasing during 2014–2016 due to more emissions of OPFRs. The ecological risk evaluation of OPFRs and BFRs suggested a moderate and high risk to the investigated marine region under the high exposure scenario, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3aexposure scenario 3amarine pollution 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3asediments 3aspring 3asummer 3aChina 0aOPFRs 0aBFRs 0aWater 0aSediment 0aTime1 aGan, Zhiwei1 aQu, Bing1 aChen, Sibei1 aDai, Yuanyuan1 aBao, Xiaoming0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Sept., v. 146 p.874-883dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.07.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008600164300002000250520172300270592002801993650002202021650001102043650001202054650002102066700002402087700002502111773013502136856007502271852000902346655001202355IND60539950820221121123414.0160818e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995082DNAL7 a10.1021/ja507564p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonovalov, Andrey
I.10aMechanism of Trifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with CuCF3 and the Ortho Effect  ap. 13410-13425.  aA combined experimental (radical clock, kinetic, Hammett) and computational (DFT, MM) study of the trifluoromethylation reaction of aryl halides with CuCF₃ reveals a nonradical mechanism involving Ar–X oxidative addition to the Cu(I) center as the rate determining step. The reaction is second order, first order in each reactant with ΔG⧧ ≈ 24 kcal/mol for PhI (computed ΔG⧧ = 21.9 kcal/mol). An abrupt change in the gradient on the Hammett plot of log(kR/kH) versus σₚ for 11 p-RC₆H₄I substrates produces two correlations (ρ = +0.69 and +1.83), which is temptingly suggestive of two different reaction pathways. Only one mechanism is operational, however, as advocated by a single linear correlation with σₚ– (ρ = +0.91), analysis of the experimental ρ values, close similarity of the transition states varying in R and displaying clear signs of −M interactions, and excellent reproduction of the plot by DFT. The long-known yet previously uncomprehended ortho effect has been quantified, for the first time, using the reaction of CuCF₃ with a series of o-RC₆H₄Br: R(kR/kH) = H (1) < Me (3.5) < MeO (4) < CN (20) < CHO (250) < CO₂Me (850) < NO₂ (4300) < Ac (7300) < CO₂H (150 000). With minor contributions from electronic factors, the ortho effect is largely determined by (i) the stabilizing coordination of the o-substituent to Cu in the transition state with the Cu···O distance varying directly with the barrier and (ii) the steric bulk of the o-substituent that raises the ground state free energy of the haloarene (Gᵒₒᵣₜₕₒ – GᵒH or Gᵒₒᵣₜₕₒ – Gᵒₚₐᵣₐ) by inflicting molecular strain and consequently weakening the Ar–X bond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acopper 3ahalides 3anitrogen dioxide1 aLishchynskyi, Anton1 aGrushin, Vladimir V.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 136, no. 38 p.13410-13425dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja507564p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04094naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167500001900234520286500253592002803118650001503146650002303161650001303184650001603197650000903213650002703222650001703249650002303266650001503289650002003304650000903324650001103333650002203344650001603366700002403382700002003406700002003426773013603446856008103582852000903663655001203672IND60698193220221118193510.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069819322DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200033652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogan, Danielle10aSalivary Biomarkers of Nutritional Status: a Systematic Review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFull nutritional assessments are currently complex and invasive. There is a need for a non-invasive, timely and cost-effective method to assess nutritional status. Evidence indicates the usefulness of saliva in diagnosing oral or systemic disorders. Saliva is suggested to be a reliable and non-invasive matrix in which to measure nutritional biomarkers. The aim of this work was to systematically review the evidence for salivary biomarkers as indicators of nutritional status. Studies identifying salivary biomarkers in relation to nutritional status or dietary intake outcomes were included. A search strategy combined terms “saliva” AND “biomarkers” AND “nutrition”. Four databases were searched, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus. All study designs conducted in humans of all ages, from all countries and settings were included. Non-English and animal studies were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias tool where applicable. (PROSPERO Registration Number:CRD42018107667) 6585 papers were identified, 4836 papers remained after removing duplicates, 4715 were irrelevant, 134 full-texts were assessed for eligibility and 64 papers included in the final analysis. A number of potential salivary biomarkers related to nutritional status were identified including: total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, ferritin and iron. Total protein levels in saliva in malnourished individuals were significantly different to controls in 7/10 studies (70%). In one study conducted in individuals with iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), total protein was significantly different to controls. Albumin levels in malnourished individuals were significantly different to controls in 5/8 studies (62.5%). Prealbumin and transferrin levels in malnourished individuals were significantly different to controls in 3/3 studies (100%). In one study conducted in malnourished individuals, salivary ferritin levels was significantly different to controls. Ferritin levels in individuals with IDA were significantly different to controls in 3/3 studies (100%). Iron levels in individuals with IDA were significantly different in 2/2 studies (100%). However, even within the studies above where significant differences existed, the direction of salivary biomarker differences was sometimes inconsistent. For example, total protein in malnourished individuals was significantly lower than controls in three studies, higher in three studies and one showed mixed findings. In addition, overall the quality of evidence available was very poor. Despite conflicting evidence in salivary nutritional biomarkers in individuals with malnutrition or IDA, saliva may be a useful non-invasive matrix to assess nutritional status. Further high quality research exploring the utility of these biomarkers is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acost effectiveness 3aferritin 3afood intake 3airon 3airon deficiency anemia 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3aprealbumin 3aprotein content 3arisk 3asaliva 3asystematic review 3atransferrin1 aWallace, Sara Megan1 aWoodside, Jayne1 aMcKenna, Gerald0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

C.10aStructurally Similar Triphenylphosphine-Stabilized Undecagolds, Au11(PPh3)7Cl3 and [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]Cl, Exhibit Distinct Ligand Exchange Pathways with Glutathione  ap. 13426-13435.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLigand exchange is frequently used to introduce new functional groups on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles or clusters while preserving the core size. For one of the smallest clusters, triphenylphosphine (TPP)-stabilized undecagold, there are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether core size is retained or significant growth occurs during exchange with thiol ligands. During an investigation of these differences in reactivity, two distinct forms of undecagold were isolated. The X-ray structures of the two forms, Au₁₁(PPh₃)₇Cl₃ and [Au₁₁(PPh₃)₈Cl₂]Cl, differ only in the number of TPP ligands bound to the core. Syntheses were developed to produce each of the two forms, and their spectroscopic features correlated with the structures. Ligand exchange on [Au₁₁(PPh₃)₈Cl₂]Cl yields only small clusters, whereas exchange on Au₁₁(PPh₃)₇Cl₃ (or mixtures of the two forms) yields the larger Au₂₅ cluster. The distinctive features in the optical spectra of the two forms made it possible to evaluate which of the cluster forms were used in the previously published papers and clarify the origin of the differences in reactivity that had been reported. The results confirm that reactions of clusters and nanoparticles may be influenced by small variations in the arrangement of ligands and suggest that the role of the ligand shell in stabilizing intermediates during ligand exchange may be essential to preventing particle growth or coalescence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3aglutathione 3aligands 3ananoparticles 3aspectral analysis 3athiols1 aZaikova, Tatiana O.1 aHutchison, James E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 136, no. 38 p.13426-13435dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja50756893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007100164500001900235520246900254592002802723650005302751650001502804650001402819650001602833650002102849650001802870650000902888650001602897650001702913650001402930650001102944650001402955650002402969650001702993650000903010700002003019700001903039700002003058773013603078856008103214852000903295655001203304IND60698193320221118193235.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069819332DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200033772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Niamh10aZinc as a risk factor for myopia: Can we accurately assess status?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMyopia is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the world. Its prevalence has risen drastically over recent decades, and it is estimated that close to half the world population will be myopic by 2050.The rise in myopia is lifestyle related. Myopia occurs as a consequence of excessive eye growth, which may be related to general growth. Diet, therefore, is a potential risk factor. A number of Asian studies have reported lower levels of zinc in myopic adolescents, when compared to controls. Currently, there are no reliable indicators of zinc status. This study explores the association between zinc status and myopia using a combination of zinc assessment methods. Participants from two different population-based studies were used. Data from 1,095 adolescents aged 12–19 years, from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study were used to examine the relationship between dietary zinc intake and myopia. Data from 304 subjects of similar age from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Study were used to examine the association between serum zinc levels and myopia using multivariate logistic regression. 43% (NHANES) and 84% (KNHANES) of subjects were found to be myopic. Mean dietary intake of zinc was lower among myopes relative to non-myopes, but not significantly. In multivariate logistic regression, dietary zinc was not significantly associated with myopia. Among Korean subjects mean serum zinc was found to be higher in non-myopes v. myopes (p = 0.809). Multiple logistic regression did not show any significant relationship between serum zinc and myopia, after adjustment for confounders. In contrast to previous studies, no relationship was found between lower dietary zinc intake or lower serum zinc, and myopia. Currently the BOND Zinc Expert Panel recommend plasma zinc concentration to assess zinc status, despite its extreme sensitivity to both internal and external factors like; inflammation, fasting, pregnancy, oral contraception and diurnal rhythm. Biological samples are very easily contaminated, meaning strict quality controls and procedures are required. These factors severely impact reliability, and thus, comparison between studies is challenging, particularly in the case of contrasting findings.As zinc is a vital micronutrient and an estimated one-third of the population are affected by zinc deficiency. A reliable biomarker of status is important, for clinical and research needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abiomarkers 3ablindness 3ablood serum 3acircadian rhythm 3acontraception 3aeyes 3afood intake 3ainflammation 3alifestyle 3amyopia 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3azinc1 aButler, John S.1 aFlitcroft, Ian1 aLoughman, James0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Activation of dendritic cells (DCs) is crucial to obtain effective and long-lasting anticancer T-cell mediated immunity. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of capsaicin-mediated cell death of bladder cancer cells on the activation of human monocyte-derived CD1a⁺ immature DCs.Immature DCs (generated from human peripheral blood-derived CD14⁺ monocytes cultured with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4) were cocultured with capsaicin (CPS)-induced apoptotic bladder cancer cells. DC activation was investigated using immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis for key surface molecules. In some experiments, CD91 was silenced in immature DCs.We found that capsaicin-mediated cancer cell apoptosis upregulates CD86 and CD83 expression on DCs, indicating the induction of DC activation. Moreover, silencing of CD91 (a common receptor for damage-associated molecular patterns, such as calreticulin and heat-shock protein-90/70) in immature DCs led to the inhibition of DC activation.Our data show that CPS-mediated cancer cell apoptosis activates DCs via CD91, suggesting CPS as an attractive candidate for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3acalreticulin 3acapsaicin 3acoculture 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3ainterleukin-4 3amonocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 0aCapsaicin 0aApoptosis 0aDendritic cells 0aCD91 0aBladder cancer1 aD’Eliseo, Donatella1 aCirone, Mara1 aDi Renzo, Livia1 aFaggioni, Alberto1 aSantoni, Angela1 aVelotti, Francesca0 tNutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.578-581dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094024004600143040001800189100002000207245010400227300001400331506007600345506003100421520151000452592002801962596007801990596012902068596006302197506003702260650001302297650002802310650001002338650001602348650001502364650001202379650001602391650003202407650001902439650001102458650001402469650002002483650002002503650001302523650001002536650002802546650002302574650001302597650000902610653000902619653001002628653000902638653001802647653001502665653001702680700001602697700001702713700001902730773009902749856009302848852000902941655001202950IND60646119020221207102007.0190725e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064611902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.05.0372chorus7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.05.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutovsky, Peter10aBoar semen improvement through sperm capacitation management, with emphasis on zinc ion homeostasis  ap. 50-55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCritical to fertilization success, sperm capacitation within the female oviductal sperm reservoir endows mammalian spermatozoa with hyperactivated motility and capacity to fertilize. An elaborate cascade of signaling events during capacitation guides the redistribution of sperm plasma membrane seminolipid and cholesterol, Ca-influx and increases tyrosine phosphorylation to promote hyperactivated motility. Such events result in the remodeling of the sperm acrosome, increased fluidity and fusability of the plasma membrane, shedding of surface-adsorbed seminal plasma proteins that glue sperm heads to the oviductal epithelium and ultimately the release of hyperactivated spermatozoa from the oviductal sperm reservoir. Discovered recently, the capacitation-induced sperm zinc ion efflux and resultant zinc signatures are reflective of sperm capacitation status and fertilizing ability, inspiring the retrospection of zinc ion functions in the physiology and fertility of boar sperm and that of other species. This review also highlights the merit of the domestic boar as a biomedical model for spermatology and fertilization research. Relevant to the quest for better fertility management in the livestock industries, the benefits of zinc ion supplementation through nutrition and direct addition to extended semen are discussed in the context of artificial insemination (AI). Ideas are shared on future technologies for zinc management in AI doses and research on the sperm zinc-interacting proteome.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Regional Development Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008530  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUniversity of Missouridhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000071650 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacrosome 3aartificial insemination 3aboars 3acholesterol 3aepithelium 3afemales 3ahomeostasis 3alivestock and meat industry 3amale fertility 3amodels 3anutrition 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aproteome 3asemen 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asperm capacitation 3atyrosine 3azinc 0aBoar 0aSperm 0aZinc 0aFertilization 0aProteasome 0aInsemination1 aKerns, Karl1 aZigo, Michal1 aZuidema, Dalen0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 137 p.50-55dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008800166300001800254520165600272592002801928650001701956650001401973650002001987650002902007650001402036650001602050650001502066651001302081651001702094700001902111700002502130773009802155856008302253852000902336655001202345IND60096062520221122064425.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Kakoli13aAn object-oriented approach to automated landform mapping: A case study of drumlins  ap. 1324-1336.  aThis paper details an automated object-oriented approach to mapping landforms from digital elevation models (DEMs), using the example of drumlins in the Chautauqua drumlin field in NW Pennsylvania and upstate New York. Object-oriented classification is highly desirable as it can identify specific shapes in datasets based on both the pixel values in a raster dataset and the contextual information between pixels and extracted objects. The methodology is built specifically for application to the USGS 30m resolution DEM data, which are freely available to the public and of sufficient resolution to map medium scale landforms. Using the raw DEM data, as well as derived aspect and slope, Definiens Developer (v.7) was used to perform multiresolution segmentation, followed by rule-based classification in order to extract individual polygons that represent drumlins. Drumlins obtained by automated extraction were visually and statistically compared to those identified via manual digitization. Detailed morphometric descriptive statistics such as means, ranges, and standard deviations were inspected and compared for length, width, elongation ratio, area, and perimeter. Although the manual and automated results were not always statistically identical, a more detailed comparison of just the drumlins identified by both procedures showed that the automated methods easily matched the manual digitization. Differences in the two methods related to mapping compound drumlins, and smaller and larger drumlins. The automated method generally identified more features in these categories than the manual method and thus outperformed the manual method.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputers 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3alandforms 3amorphometry 3astatistics 3aNew York 3aPennsylvania1 aWells, Neil A.1 aMunro-Stasiuk, Mandy0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1324-1336dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011200171300001600283500001500299520143400314592002801748650000901776650001801785650001901803650001601822650003101838650002801869650001401897650004301911650001101954650000901965650001001974650001201984650001301996650001902009650002702028650001902055650001502074650003202089650002302121650001402144653001002158653000902168653001602177653001102193653001702204653001902221700002402240700001802264700002102282700002102303700002302324700002002347700002002367700002502387773010002412856008102512852000902593655001202602IND60604796520221123024008.0180718e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060479652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Carolina P.10aSynergistic anti-tumor effects of melatonin and PUFAs from walnuts in a murine mammary adenocarcinoma model  ap. 570-577.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to determine the effects of some polyunsaturated fatty acids plus phytomelatonin from walnuts in the development of mammary gland adenocarcinoma.BALB/c mice were fed a semisynthetic diet supplemented with either 6% walnut oil and 8% walnut flour containing phytomelatonin (walnut diet: WD); or 6% corn oil plus commercial melatonin (melatonin diet: MD), or the control group (CD), which received only 6% of corn oil. Membrane fatty acids of tumor cells (TCs) were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography, cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) derivatives, and plasma melatonin by high-performance liquid chromatography; apoptosis and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by flow cytometry.TCs from the MD and WD mice showed significant decreases in linoleic acid compared with the CD group (P < 0.05). Significantly lower levels of LOX-[13(S)-HODE] were found in TCs from the MD and WD group than in CD (P < 0.0001). COX-[12(S)-HHT] was lower and 12 LOX-[12(S)-HETE] was higher in TCs from the MD group than form the WD and CD arms (P < 0.05). Plasma melatonin, apoptosis, tumor infiltration, and survival time were significantly lower in CD mice than in MD and WD mice (P < 0.05).This study shows that melatonin, along with polyunsaturated fatty acids, exerts a selective inhibition of some COX and LOX activities and has a synergistic anti-tumor effect on a mammary gland adenocarcinoma model.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3alinoleic acid 3aadenocarcinoma 3alymphocytes 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aantineoplastic activity 3amelatonin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3amice 3aflour 3awalnuts 3acorn oil 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostaglandin synthase 3amammary glands 3awalnut oil 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3agas chromatography 3aapoptosis 0aPUFAs 0aDiet 0aEicosanoids 0aCancer 0alipoxygenase 0aPhytomelatonin1 aLamarque, Alicia L.1 aComba, Andrea1 aBerra, María A.1 aSilva, Renata A.1 aLabuckas, Diana O.1 aDas, Undurti N.1 aEynard, Aldo R.1 aPasqualini, Maria E.0 tNutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.570-577dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005900166300001600225520179800241592002802039650001602067650002102083650002402104650001202128650001902140650001802159650001502177650003402192650001602226650001102242650002102253650001202274650001102286650001502297650001202312650001302324650001202337650001302349650002502362650001602387650001002403650001102413650000802424650001502432650001502447651001302462653002102475653002102496653000902517653001602526700002002542700001802562700001702580700002102597773010002618856008102718852000902799655001202808IND60604796920221123024047.0180718e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060479692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, Joana10aDietary patterns among 13-y-old Portuguese adolescents  ap. 148-154.  aThe aim of this study was to identify dietary patterns in 13-y-old adolescents and to evaluate their association with socioeconomic and behavioral factors.Data from 1489 adolescents born in 1990 and enrolled in schools of Porto, Portugal, in 2003–2004 (EPITeen study) were analyzed, after excluding those without information on the food frequency questionnaire and the outliers. The questionnaire items were grouped into 14 food groups and dietary patterns were identified by cluster analysis (k-means). Their association with participants' characteristics was computed using multinomial logistic regression.Four dietary patterns were identified. The pattern healthier (16.1%) was characterized by the highest consumption of seafood, soup, vegetables/legumes, fruit, and added fats. The dairy products pattern (29.7%) showed the highest consumption of dairies. The pattern fast food and sweets (14.2%) presented the highest intake of fast food, sweets and pastry, soft drinks and coffee or tea. The lower intake pattern (40%) was characterized by a lower consumption of the majority of food groups. A higher odds of belonging to the fast food and sweets pattern, compared with the lower intake pattern was found among adolescents spending more time watching TV on the weekends (>360 min: odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23–3.57) and among those consuming four to seven fried meals per week (OR, 3.96; 95% CI, 2.27–6.90). Adolescents with highly educated parents were less likely to belong to the fast food and sweets group.Unhealthier behaviors and lower socioeconomic position were the main factors associated with the unhealthier dietary pattern (fast food and sweets). This information should be considered in the development of health-promotion interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3acluster analysis 3aconfidence interval 3adairies 3adairy products 3aeating habits 3afast foods 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood groups 3afruits 3ahealth promotion 3alegumes 3alipids 3aodds ratio 3aparents 3apastries 3aschools 3aseafoods 3asocioeconomic status 3asoft drinks 3asoups 3asweets 3atea 3atelevision 3avegetables 3aPortugal 0aDietary patterns 0aCluster analysis 0aDiet 0aAdolescents1 aTeixeira, Joana1 aGaio, A.

Soils are spatial entities with fuzzy boundaries. Our study focuses on the uncertainty associated with class assignments when classifying such entities. We first present a framework of knowledge representation for categorizing spatial entities with fuzzy boundaries. Three knowledge discovery methods are discussed next for extracting knowledge from data sources. The methods were designed to maintain information for modeling the uncertainties associated with class assignments when using the extracted knowledge for classification. In a case study of knowledge discovery from an area-class soil map, all three methods were able to extract knowledge embedded in the map to classify soils at accuracies comparable to that of the original map. The methods were also able to capture membership gradations and helped to identify transitional zones and areas of potential problems on the source map when measures of uncertainties were mapped. Among the three methods compared, a fuzzy decision tree approach demonstrated the best performance in modeling the transitions between soil prototypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputers 3adecision support systems 3amodels 3aprototypes 3asoil 3asoil classification 3asoil map 3auncertainty1 aZhu, A-Xing0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1425-1436dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2010.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008900165300001800254520116800272592002801440650001301468650001401481650001401495650002801509650001201537650001301549650001101562650002301573650002301596650001601619650001801635651001701653700001701670773009801687856008301785852000901868655001201877IND60096063820221121064215.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPommier, A.10a“SIGMELTS”: A web portal for electrical conductivity calculations in geosciences  ap. 1450-1459.  aElectrical conductivity measurements in the laboratory are critical for interpreting geoelectric and magnetotelluric profiles of the Earth's crust and mantle. In order to facilitate access to the current database on electrical conductivity of geomaterials, we have developed a freely available web application (SIGMELTS) dedicated to the calculation of electrical properties. Based on a compilation of previous studies, SIGMELTS computes the electrical conductivity of silicate melts, carbonatites, minerals, fluids, and mantle materials as a function of different parameters, such as composition, temperature, pressure, water content, and oxygen fugacity. Calculations on two-phase mixtures are also implemented using existing mixing models for different geometries. An illustration of the use of SIGMELTS is provided, in which calculations are applied to the subduction zone-related volcanic zone in the Central Andes. Along with petrological considerations, field and laboratory electrical data allow discrimination between the different hypotheses regarding the formation and rise from depth of melts and fluids and quantification of their storage conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acomputers 3adatabases 3aelectrical conductivity 3amelting 3aminerals 3aoxygen 3astatistical models 3astorage conditions 3atemperature 3awater content 3aAndes region1 aLe-Trong, E.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1450-1459dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01535naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012600165300001800291520059900309592002800908650001400936650002000950650001100970650001200981700001600993700001601009700001801025773009801043856008301141852000901224655001201233IND60096063920221122044834.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yankui12aA 3D multiresolution lunar surface model using bicubic subdivision-surface wavelets, with interactive visualization tools  ap. 1460-1467.  aThe laser altimetry (LAM) dataset obtained by Chang'E-1 (CE-1) contains about 8.6 million points, and how to use it to model and visualize the lunar surface is a problem.

From daily data of precipitation and temperature, ArcE uses ArcObjects as the programming language to incorporate equations and hydrological boundary conditions, in order to calculate EA at monthly and yearly time steps. Because weather data are often missing, ArcE is programmed to use non-global models such as Hargreaves for potential evapotranspiration (EP) and Budyko for EA. In arid regions, where results from global and non-global models are expected to deviate, ArcE allows for the segregation of low-divergent areas suitable for interpolating EA from those that should be excluded for mapping the variable. In the semiarid Almanzora River basin, a heterogeneous region with contrasting climate in SE Spain, divergence in lowlands with a higher aridity index was about 15% with respect to an accurate estimate of EA from the Penman–Monteith equation. Evaluating EA is a first step for mapping the non-evaporative fraction of precipitation as the difference in P and EA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acomputers 3adry environmental conditions 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3ageographic information systems 3alowlands 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aSpain1 aAlcalá, Francisco J.1 aVallejos, Ángela1 aPulido Bosch, Antonio,0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1468-1475dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245011600178300001400294520144800308592002801756650002201784650001101806650002601817650001301843650001501856650001301871650002301884650001301907650001701920653002401937653001301961653002301974653002201997700001702019700001802036700001502054700001402069700001502083773011302098856009402211852000902305655001202314IND60646121020221120195353.0190830e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhongkai10aConversion of renewable vanillin into high performance polyimides via an asymmetric aromatic diamine derivation  ap. 67-76.  aIn this paper, a new asymmetric bio-based diamine MAAMB containing phenoxyl-benzyloxyl linkage and a pendent methoxyl group, was synthesized starting from the aromatic, lignin-derivative vanillin through three steps. Two series of polyimide (PI) films were prepared by condensing MAAMB or an analogous, symmetric diamine 1, 4, 4′-APB with four different dianhydride 6FDA, ODPA, BTDA, or BPDA, respectively, via classic two-step procedure. Comparative studies between the MAAMB-resulting PI series (APIs) and 1, 4, 4′-APB-resulting PI series (SPIs) reveal that the introduction of benzyl linkage and pendent methoxyl group in MAAMB imparts APIs with better solubility in organic solvents, higher optical transparence with 63.7–89.2% at 500 nm. Meanwhile, API series retain good thermal properties with Tg ranging in 241–262 °C, T5 ranging in 448–478 °C, and favorable mechanical properties with tensile strengths ranging in 82.2–92.7 MPa and tensile modulus ranging in 2.27–2.53 GPa. Additionally, APIs exhibit lower water absorption (0.71–1.01%) and surface energy (31.35–42.03 mN/m) than those (0.75–1.25%) and (34.06–44.35 mN/m) of the analogous SPIs. It indicates that the renewable vanillin could be employed to prepare bio-based polyimides with balanced comprehensive properties. This work presents a potential pathway of converting the renewable aromatic vanillin into high performance PI materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3aenergy 3amechanical properties 3amoieties 3asolubility 3asolvents 3athermal properties 3avanillin 3awater uptake 0aBio-based polyimide 0aVanillin 0aAsymmetric diamine 0aThermal stability1 aLi, Yongjian1 aZhu, Tangsong1 aXiong, Lei1 aLiu, Feng1 aQi, Haixia0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2019 Sept., v. 167 p.67-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010000168300001800268520113200286592002801418650001301446650001401459650002501473650002601498650001401524650002401538650001901562650002001581650001701601651001701618651001201635651001301647651001201660651000901672700002201681773009801703856008301801852000901884655001201893IND60096064420221122044932.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina, Martin12aA multinational SDI-based system to facilitate disaster risk management in the Andean Community  ap. 1501-1510.  aA useful strategy for improving disaster risk management is sharing spatial data across different technical organizations using shared information systems. However, the implementation of this type of system requires a large effort, so it is difficult to find fully implemented and sustainable information systems that facilitate sharing multinational spatial data about disasters, especially in developing countries. In this paper, we describe a pioneer system for sharing spatial information that we developed for the Andean Community. This system, called SIAPAD (Andean Information System for Disaster Prevention and Relief), integrates spatial information from 37 technical organizations in the Andean countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). SIAPAD was based on the concept of a thematic Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) and includes a web application, called GEORiesgo, which helps users to find relevant information with a knowledge-based system. In the paper, we describe the design and implementation of SIAPAD together with general conclusions and future directions which we learned as a result of this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acomputers 3adeveloping countries 3adisaster preparedness 3adisasters 3ainformation systems 3ainfrastructure 3arisk management 3aspatial data 3aAndes region 3aBolivia 3aColombia 3aEcuador 3aPeru1 aBayarri, Salvador0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1501-1510dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013400169300001800303520084700321592002801168650001401196650002001210650002601230773009801256856008301354852000901437655001201446IND60096064820221122115943.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCannon, Alex J.10aGEVcdn: An R package for nonstationary extreme value analysis by generalized extreme value conditional density estimation network  ap. 1532-1533.  aAn R package is developed for the Generalized Extreme Value conditional density estimation network (GEVcdn). Parameters in a GEV distribution are specified as a function of covariates using a probabilistic variant of the multilayer perceptron neural network. If the covariate is time or is dependent on time, then the GEVcdn model can be used to perform nonlinear, nonstationary extreme value analysis. Due to the flexibility of the neural network architecture, the model is capable of representing a wide range of nonstationary relationships, including those involving interactions between covariates. Model parameters are estimated by generalized maximum likelihood, an approach that is tailored to the analysis of hydroclimatological extremes. Functions are included to assist in the calculation of parameter uncertainty via bootstrapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aneural networks 3aparameter uncertainty0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1532-1533dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008700176300001600263520157200279592002801851650000801879650001501887650002201902650001801924650001001942650001701952650001601969650001901985650001502004650001502019650001002034650001302044650000902057650001302066653002402079653001302103653001302116653001502129653002302144700002002167700003002187700003102217700003002248700002302278700003302301700003102334700001702365700003602382773010002418856008102518852000902599655001202608IND60604798020221120085030.0180718e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060479802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllwanger, Joel Henrique10aSelenium reduces bradykinesia and DNA damage in a rat model of Parkinson's disease  ap. 359-365.  aThe aim of this study was to explore the effects of selenium (Se) on locomotor activity and DNA damage in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) induced by paraquat (PQ).Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group (n = 12), Se group (n = 12), PQ group (n = 12), and Se + PQ group (n = 12). PQ was administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg). Se was offered in the drinking water at a concentration of 11.18 μg/L. Locomotor activity was evaluated weekly using the narrow beam test. The comet assay was performed to assess the level of DNA damage in leukocytes and in brain cells.As expected, increased DNA damage was found in the PQ group compared with the control and Se groups (P < 0.001). Interestingly, coadministration of Se and PQ effectively prevented the harmful effects of the toxin in locomotor activity and at the molecular level, reducing bradykinesia (P < 0.01) and DNA damage in leukocytes compared with the PQ-only group (P < 0.001), whereas the levels of DNA damage were comparable to those found in the control and Se groups (P > 0.05). Using the comet assay to analyze brain cells, no differences were found between the groups with regard to damage index (P = 0.774), damage frequency (P = 0.817), or non-detectable cell nuclei (P = 0.481).In this experimental model of PQ-induced PD, the use of Se could contribute to the maintenance of locomotor activity and the integrity of leukocytes DNA. No changes in the levels of DNA damage in brain cells were observed between the experimental groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aParkinson disease 3aanimal models 3abrain 3acell nucleus 3acomet assay 3adrinking water 3aleukocytes 3alocomotion 3amales 3aparaquat 3arats 3aselenium 0aParkinson's disease 0aSelenium 0aParaquat 0aDNA damage 0aLocomotor activity1 aMolz, Patrícia1 aDallemole, Danieli Rosane1 aPereira dos Santos, Ariana1 aMüller, Talise Ellwanger1 aCappelletti, Lucas1 aGonçalves da Silva, Manoela1 aRech Franke, Silvia Isabel1 aPrá, Daniel1 aPêgas Henriques, João Antonio0 tNutrition.g2015 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.359-365dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245007300165300001600238520112800254592002801382650001501410650001501425650001301440650001301453650000901466650002101475650001901496650001101515650001501526650002201541650002301563653001301586653002201599653001601621653001901637653001201656653002001668700001201688700001701700773013501717856008701852852000901939655001201948IND60646121720221123015205.0190711e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Tao10aChitosan coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous mat for dye adsorption  ap. 919-925.  aChitosan is a promising natural-derived polymer for dye adsorption owing to its rich source, good biodegradablity and high adsorption capacity. However, electrospinning of pure chitosan nanofiber needs high concentration of acid solution and the electrospinning productivity is very low due to its high degree of hydrogen bonding and polycationic nature. To solve the problem, the chitosan coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous mat (CPNM) was successfully prepared via a two-step fabrication process of polyacrylonitrile electrospinning and a subsequent chitosan coating. The chitosan was homogeneously adhered onto the PAN nanofibers, which improved the hydrophilicity and adsorption capacity of Acid Blue-113 significantly. The adsorption of Acid Blue-113 on CPNM fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetics model well, and the maximum adsorption capacity of CPNM calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model was 1708 mg/g with the average fiber diameter of 189 nm. The CPNM demonstrate the virtue of simple fabrication process, high adsorption capacity and good reusability, which is a promising adsorbent for dye removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achitosan 3acoatings 3adyes 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3ananofibers 3apolyacrylonitrile 3asorption isotherms 0aChitosan 0aPolyacrylonitrile 0aNanofibrous 0aDye adsorption 0aCoating 0aElectrospinning1 aYan, Xu1 aWang, Xuejun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 135 p.919-925dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168300001600282520214300298592002802441650001702469650002402486650001102510650001302521650001602534650001402550650001702564650001902581650001302600650002002613650001902633650001202652650002902664650002402693650001302717650002102730650001902751650001502770653002102785653001402806653001902820653001202839700002202851700002102873773010002894856008102994852000903075655001203084IND60604798620221120120148.0180718e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060479862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegerová, Petra10aEarly nutritional support and physiotherapy improved long-term self-sufficiency in acutely ill older patients  ap. 166-170.  aAn acute disease is regularly associated with inflammation, decreased food intake, and low physical activity; the consequence is loss of muscle mass. However, the restoration of muscle tissue is problematic, especially in older patients. Loss of muscle mass leads to further decrease of physical activity which leads, together with recurring disease, to the progressive muscle mass loss accompanied by loss of self-sufficiency. Early nutrition support and physical activity could reverse this situation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether an active approach based on early nutritional therapy and exercise would influence the development of sarcopenia and impaired self-sufficiency during acute illness.Two hundred patients >78 y were admitted to a hospital internal medicine department and participated in a prospective, randomized controlled study. The patients were randomized to a control group receiving standard treatment (n = 100) or to an intervention group (n = 100). The intervention consisted of nutritional supplements (600 kcal, 20 g/d protein) added to a standard diet and a simultaneous intensive rehabilitation program. The tolerance of supplements and their influence on spontaneous food intake, self-sufficiency, muscle strength, and body composition were evaluated during the study period. The patients were then regularly monitored for 1 y post-discharge.The provision of nutritional supplements together with early rehabilitation led to increased total energy and protein intake while the intake of standard hospital food was not reduced. The loss of lean body mass and a decrease in self-sufficiency were apparent at discharge from the hospital and 3 mo thereafter in the control group. Nutritional supplementation and the rehabilitation program in the study group prevented these alterations. A positive effect of nutritional intervention and exercise during the hospital stay was apparent at 6 mo post-discharge.The early nutritional intervention together with early rehabilitation preserves muscle mass and independence in ill older patients hospitalized because of acute disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute course 3adietary supplements 3aenergy 3aexercise 3afood intake 3ahospitals 3ainflammation 3alean body mass 3amedicine 3amuscle strength 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional support 3apatients 3aphysical therapy 3aprotein intake 3asarcopenia 0aSelf-sufficiency 0aNutrition 0aLean body mass 0aElderly1 aDědková, Zuzana1 aSobotka, Luboš,0 tNutrition.g2015 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.166-170dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008700172300001800259520216800277592002802445650001402473650001602487650001102503650001902514650001402533650002502547650001402572651001202586700002802598700002202626700002102648700001802669773009802687856008302785852000902868655001202877IND60096065720221122115925.0141104e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2010.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatcharashvili, T.10aNon-extensive statistical analysis of seismicity in the area of Javakheti, Georgia  ap. 1627-1632.  aThe distribution of earthquake magnitudes in the Javakheti highlands was analyzed using a non-extensive statistical approach. The earthquakes occurring from 1960 to 2008 in this seismically active area of Southern Caucasus were investigated. The seismic catalog was studied using different threshold magnitude values. Analyses of the whole time period of observations as well as of sub-catalogs of consecutive 10-year span time windows were performed. In every case non-extensive parameter q and value a, the physical quantity characterizing energy density, were calculated from the modified frequency–magnitude relationship. According to our analysis the magnitude sequence in the Javakheti area for the whole period of observation is characterized by a non-extensivity parameter q=1.81, in the upper limit of values reported elsewhere. While calculated non-extensivity parameters for consecutive 10-year windows fall within the range 1.6–1.7 reported worldwide. A significant increase of parameter q was identified in those 10-year sub-catalogs that included the strongest earthquakes within the period of observation. We suppose that this increase may be related to a more correlated behavior within the system of ‘fault fragments’ when a strong earthquake strikes or immediately after; during aftershock activity. Concurrently, smaller values of non-extensivity parameters qᵢ, found during seismically relatively quiet times, could be associated to the decreased correlations within the system during the earthquake generation stage, under an essentially decreased tectonic stress. The behavior of the energy density characteristic a almost mirrors the variation of parameter q: increases for seismically quiet periods in the Javakheti area and decreases in periods when strong earthquakes occur. We suggest that decreases of energy density characteristic a may point to a prevalent contribution of large size fragments to fragment–asperity interaction under the influence of a rapidly released stress, as opposed to relatively quiet periods when accumulated stress energy is supposedly released through the relative movement of smaller fragments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aearthquakes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahighlands 3astatistical analysis 3atectonics 3aGeorgia1 aChelidze, Tamaz Lukich,1 aJavakhishvili, Z.1 aJorjiashvili, N.1 aFra Paleo, U.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Oct., v. 37, no. 10 p.1627-1632dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2010.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014600174300001600320520140500336592002801741650001301769650001201782650002101794650002201815650000901837650001601846650002201862650002001884650002201904650001301926650002101939650001801960650001801978650002601996650002102022650001502043650001702058650001702075650001802092650001302110650001902123650002702142650001002169650001702179653001602196653004002212653002602252700002502278700002202303700002602325700002102351773013502372856008702507852000902594655001202603IND60646122220221122160015.0190711e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomene-López, D.10aComparative study on properties of starch films obtained from potato, corn and wheat using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate as plasticizer  ap. 845-854.  aStarch films are gaining attention as substitutes of synthetic polymers due to their biodegradability and low cost. Some ionic liquids have been postulated as alternatives to glycerol, one of the best starch plasticizers, due to their great capacity to form hydrogen bonds with starch and hence great ability of preventing starch retrogradation and increasing film stability. In this work, [emim+][Ac−]-plasticized starch films were prepared from potato, corn and wheat starch. The effect of starch molecular structure in terms of granular composition (amylose and phosphate monoester contents) and molecular weight (Mw) on film properties was evaluated. Potato starch films were the most amorphous because of the higher Mw and phosphate monoester content of potato starch, both contributing to a lower rearrangement of the starch chains making the crystallization process difficult. In contrast, corn and wheat starches lead to more crystalline films because of their lower Mw, which may imply higher mobility and crystal growth rate, and lower phosphate monoester content. This more crystalline structure could be the responsible of their better mechanical properties. [emim+][Ac−] can be considered suitable for manufacturing starch films showing corn and wheat starch films similar properties to synthetic low-density polyethylene, but involving a simple and environmentally-friendly process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aamylose 3abiodegradability 3acomparative study 3acorn 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3afilms (materials) 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3aphosphates 3aplasticizers 3apolyethylene 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aretrogradation 3asustainable technology 3awheat 3awheat starch 0aStarch film 0a1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate 0aMechanical properties1 aDelgado-Marín, J.J.1 aMartin-Gullon, I.1 aGarcía-Quesada, J.C.1 aMontalbán, M.G.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 135 p.845-854dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017600164300001600340520172000356592002802076650001502104650000902119650002002128650001002148650001202158650002002170650001302190650001202203650001102215650001602226650002102242650000902263650003002272650001502302650002902317650003102346653002902377653001202406653002302418653004302441653002502484700001702509700002202526700001902548773010002567856008102667852000902748655001202757IND60604799220221120105103.0180718e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060479922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInoue, Seiya10aInduction of histone H3K4 methylation at the promoter, enhancer, and transcribed regions of the Si and Sglt1 genes in rat jejunum in response to a high-starch/low-fat diet  ap. 366-372.  aHistone methylation patterns are associated with various aspects of biology, including transcriptional regulation. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) leads to transcriptional activation through recruitment of transcription activation complexes onto target genes; in contrast, methylation of histone H3K9, or histone H4K20, leads to transcriptional inactivation attracting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). It is not yet known whether jejunal induction of sucrase-isomaltase (Si) and sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (Sglt1) genes by intake of a high-starch/low-fat diet in rats is regulated by coordinated changes of these histone methylation events. In the present study, we investigated whether these histone modifications at the promoter, enhancer, and transcribed regions of Si and Sglt1 genes in rat jejunum are affected by consumption of a high-starch/low-fat diet.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using antibodies against methylated-histone H3K4, H3K9, H4K20, and HP1 were performed at various regions associated with the Si and Sglt1 genes in jejunum of rats fed a high-starch/low-fat diet or a low-starch/high-fat diet for 7 d.Feeding rats the high-starch/low-fat diet induced mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3K4 on the promoter and transcribed regions of the Si and Sglt1 genes. In contrast, methylation of histones H3K9 and H4K20, and binding of HP1 at these gene regions, were not affected by the high-starch/low-fat diet.These observations suggest that induction of Si and Sglt1 gene expression in rat jejunum by a high-starch/low-fat diet intake is positively associated with histone H3K4 methylation, but not with histone H3K9/H4K20 methylation, or with binding of HP1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3adiet 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3ajejunum 3alysine 3amethylation 3aprecipitin tests 3arats 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3asymporters 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 0aHistone H3K4 methylation 0aJejunum 0aSucrase-isomaltase 0aSodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 0aDietary carbohydrate1 aHonma, Kazue1 aMochizuki, Kazuki1 aGoda, Toshinao0 tNutrition.g2015 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.366-372dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011900171300001800290520120800308592002801516650002001544650002901564650002101593650001501614650001301629650001801642650002301660650001001683650001601693650001101709650001801720650001101738650001501749650001801764650000701782650003301789650001301822650002201835650001501857653001801872653001601890653001301906653002701919653001501946653003301961700002101994700001702015700002602032700002402058700001902082700002102101773013702122856008702259852000902346655001202355IND60646123420221120095802.0190711e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbid, Sharjeel10aEnhanced antibacterial activity of PEO-chitosan nanofibers with potential application in burn infection management  ap. 1222-1236.  aChitosan (CS) is a well-known biological macromolecule having numerous applications due to its exceptional properties especially in the form of nanofibers. The antibacterial activity is compromised when co-polymers are added to electrospun CS but, the reproducibility can be enhanced which is key to commercialization. We have tried to enhance the antibacterial activity of chitosan based nanofibers with the addition of Zinc oxide (ZO) nanoparticles and ciprofloxacin (model drug) at very low concentrations. The rheology of solutions was studied along with the process parameters for the optimization of nanofibers using response surface methodology. Nanofibers having diameter of 116 nm with a SD of only 21 nm were optimized. ZO loaded nanofibers showed better thermal stability. Different drug release models were fitted to drug release profile. The release was pH dependent best followed by Zero order and Hixson Crowell release models. Good antibacterial activity and non-toxicity was observed against human dermal fibroblast and keratinocytes cell lines (>82.5%) which justifies its potential to eliminate or prevent infection in burn wounds with less side effects due to low amount of drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantibacterial properties 3aburns (injuries) 3acell lines 3achitosan 3aciprofloxacin 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3akeratinocytes 3amodels 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3arheology 3athermal stability 3azinc oxide 0aAntibacterial 0aBurn wounds 0aChitosan 0aDrug release modelling 0aNanofibers 0aResponse surface methodology1 aHussain, Tanveer1 aNazir, Ahsan1 aSharifi, Abdul Zahir,1 aRamakrishna, Seeram1 aHameed, Misbah1 aKhenoussi, Nabyl0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 135 p.1222-1236dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014500168300001800313520099000331592002801321650002401349650002501373650001201398650002101410650002101431650002001452650002001472650002501492650001601517650001401533653001001547653000801557653001201565653000701577653000801584653000901592653000801601653001001609653002001619653001901639653001501658653002101673700001801694700001401712700001601726700002001742700001901762700001601781773013701797856008701934852000902021655001202030IND60646123920221120105126.0190711e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.05.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haiping10aEffect of ultrasound-assisted extraction on physicochemical properties and TLR2-affinity binding of the polysaccharides from Pholiota nameko  ap. 1020-1027.  aThe effect of the ultrasonic treatment on the physicochemical properties, oil-holding capacities, foaming capacities, and TLR2-affinity of the polysaccharides from Pholiota nameko (PNPS), was evaluated. Compared with the protein content of PNPS before ultrasonic treatment, the protein content of PNPS all presented a decrease under different ultrasonic conditions. The viscosity of PNPS showed a decrease when the ultrasonic intensity was strong enough, as well as the molecular weight. The oil-holding capacity and the foaming capacity of PNPS showed a continuous increasing trend with the increase of the ultrasonic treatment time under a set ultrasonic power of 400 W. Further, the ultrasonic operation could induce the decrease of the affinity binding between PNPS and the receptor proteins TLR2. These data confirmed that applying the ultrasonic treatment could obtain PNPS with high carbohydrate contents, low viscosity and low TLR2-affinity under proper ultrasonic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPholiota microspora 3aToll-like receptor 2 3afoaming 3afoaming capacity 3amolecular weight 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein content 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity 0aBMDCs 0aDCs 0aimBMDCs 0aKD 0aLPS 0aPNPS 0aTLR 0aHPGPC 0aPholiota Nameko 0aPolysaccharide 0aUltrasound 0aPhysicochemistry1 aTao, Yongqing1 aZhao, Pei1 aZhi, Dexian1 aGao, Xiaoxiayue1 aZhao, Xiaojuan1 aLi, Mengjia0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 135 p.1020-1027dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.05.1773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245016200170300001800332520184800350592002802198650001302226650002202239650001402261650001402275650003502289650001602324650002402340650001602364650001102380650002002391651001102411700002202422700001902444700001902463700001602482700001902498700002302517700001802540700002102558773009802579856008302677852000902760655001202769IND60096068420221122115937.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009606842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChesnaux, Romain10aBuilding a geodatabase for mapping hydrogeological features and 3D modeling of groundwater systems: Application to the Saguenay–Lac-St.-Jean region, Canada  ap. 1870-1882.  aUnderstanding and managing groundwater resources require the integration of a large amount of high-quality data from a variety of sources. Due to the limitations in accessing information related to groundwater and subsurface conditions, the gathering of available existing information is of crucial importance when conducting a successful hydrogeological study. Here, we present an approach for the development of an exhaustive and comprehensive groundwater database through (1) the gathering of relevant sources of information relating to groundwater, and (2) the application of a quality control process in order to screen the data for accuracy and quality. This hydrogeological database is then implemented within a GIS (geographic information system) framework coupled to a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) as a personal geodatabase (ESRI format) GIS technology. Once established, the spatial database allows a user to request the relevant data required for a specific hydrogeological study. In addition, stratigraphic data stored within the spatial database may be utilized for constructing 3D subsurface hydrostructural models. In order to achieve this objective, the software Arc Hydro Groundwater combined with the ArcGIS spatial database is shown to be appropriate for the 3D structural representation of aquifers (groundwater reservoirs). The innovative contribution of this approach in building 3D hydrostructural subsurface models from a spatial database resides in simplifying the required step-by-step processes by considering a unified compatible combination of “RDBMS–ArcGIS–Arc Hydro Groundwater” technologies. The proposed methodology is illustrated using data from an ongoing project aimed at developing an inventory of the groundwater resources of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region, Quebec (Canada).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adatabases 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3ainformation sources 3ainventories 3amodels 3aquality control 3aQuebec1 aLambert, Mélanie1 aWalter, Julien1 aFillastre, Ugo1 aHay, Murray1 aRouleau, Alain1 aDaigneault, Réal,1 aMoisan, Annie1 aGermaneau, Denis0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Nov., v. 37, no. 11 p.1870-1882dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009400164300001600258520089800274592002801172650001601200650002601216650001401242650002501256650001301281650002401294650001701318650001301335650001401348650001901362650002101381653001401402653002901416653001701445653000801462653002101470700001801491700002101509700002401530773010001554856008101654852000901735655001201744IND60604800620221119124306.0180718e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakao, Junko10aOmega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia during the second trimester  ap. 409-412.  aSerum triacylglycerol (TG) levels increase during pregnancy.

Despite its significant anticancer effects, some adverse effects create obstacles to treatment. The main toxicity of gemcitabine is myelosuppression, which not only reduces patient quality of life, but also hinders further anticancer treatment. In this respect, immunotherapy can address these drawbacks because of its ability to enhance the patient's immune system. To improve immune system function, yeast-derived β-glucans, which are well-known biologic response modifiers, were administered to gemcitabine-treated mice. The in vivo experiment revealed that orally administered yeast (1 → 3)-(1 → 6)-β-d-glucan effectively alleviated myelosuppression associated with gemcitabine-induced pancytopenia. Moreover, analysis of myelopoiesis-related cytokine expression through real-time PCR demonstrated that β-glucan treatment significantly upregulated hematopoietic responses in gemcitabine-treated mice. Furthermore, orally administered β-glucan significantly induced the expression of IFN-γ and IL-2 in splenocytes of gemcitabine-treated mice. It also restored the cytotoxicity of splenocytes against YAC-1 in gemcitabine-treated mice and displayed a positive effect on gemcitabine-damaged bone marrow tissue. In conclusion, yeast β-glucans have the potential to be used as adjuvants for alleviating chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression in patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain vivo studies 3aadjuvants 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterferon-gamma 3aimmunotherapy 3aoral administration 3aneoplasms 3adrugs 3ainterleukin-2 3abone marrow 3asplenocytes 3apatients 3aquality of life 3agene expression regulation 3acytotoxicity 3ayeasts 3aantineoplastic activity 3amice 3abeta-glucans 3aadverse effects 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0adrug therapy 0aHematopoiesis 0aGemcitabine 0aImmunosuppression 0aInsoluble yeast β-glucan1 aShin, Hocheol1 aSong, Youngju1 aKang, Hee1 aYeom, Chang-Hwan1 aLee, Sukchan1 aChoi, Youn Seon0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 136 p.1169-1175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012300168300001600291520141500307592002801722650002201750650001301772650001101785650002201796650001301818650002001831650002601851650001201877650001501889650001801904650000701922650001801929650002001947650003301967650001902000650002302019650001602042650003702058653001302095653002502108653002502133653002102158653001902179700001702198700001602215700001602231700002202247773013502269856008702404852000902491655001202500IND60646125120221120075315.0190711e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.05.2092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaghrib, F.10aSynthesis of silver nanoparticles assisted by chitosan and its application to catalyze the reduction of 4-nitroaniline  ap. 752-759.  aThis paper reports on the fabrication of material comprised of chitosan stabilized silver nanoparticles on the carbon paste and its electro-catalytic reduction toward 4-nitroaniline. The synthesized material was obtained when AgNO3 was mixed with chitosan as a stabilizing agent and NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The developed Chitosan-AgNPs has been confirmed using UV–Vis spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared spectroscopy. The synthesized chitosan-Ag NPs exhibit particle size around 51 nm. To build a voltammetric sensor (Chitosan-Ag NPs/CPE), a carbon paste electrode has immersed in the liquid suspension of chitosan-Ag NPs, thus, it could be employed for electro-catalytic reduction of 4-NA in 0.1 M Britton-Robinson buffer solution (B-R, pH 2). Therefore, the reduction over-potential of 4-NA shifted from −752.26 mV at CPE to −304 mV at chitosan-Ag NPs/CPE, and then showing a surface controlled process with the catalytic rate constant (Kcat) of 0.125 × 10−3 M−1 s−1 and a coefficient of diffusion (D) of 2.20 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 with an enhanced current response. Under optimized conditions, the electro-catalytic reduction peak current of 4-NA increased linearly with increasing of 4-NA concentration over the range of 1 μM to 0.5 mM (R2 = 0.9866) with a detection limit of 0.86 μM (3 × Sb/P).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantimony 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aliquids 3ananosilver 3anitroanilines 3apH 3aparticle size 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver nitrate 3asodium borohydride 3astabilizers 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aChitosan 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aVoltammetric sensors 0aElectrocatalysis 0a4-nitroaniline1 aAjermoun, N.1 aBakasse, M.1 aLahrich, S.1 aEl Mhammedi, M.A.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Aug. 15, v. 135 p.752-759dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.05.2093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012800169300001600297520130500313592002801618650002401646650002501670650002501695650002201720650001501742650002501757650001401782650001801796650001601814650002501830650001501855650001701870651001001887651001301897651001101910653002101921653002501942653001401967700001801981773013501999856008702134852000902221655001202230IND60646125420221120075128.0190711e20190815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.05.2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Gyōen,10aCharacterization of the complete mitochondrial genome of Chinese Triops granarius and implications for species delimitation  ap. 734-744.  aThe mt genome of T. granarius (15.121 bp), containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) and one control region, present the typical pattern of phyllopod mt genomes from the perspective of gene content and order. All PCGs initiate with standard start codon of ATN and share the complete stop codon of TAA or TAG, whereas nd1 initiates with GTG, nd2 terminates with AGA and nd4 terminates with a single T.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a non-soy legume-enriched diet on inflammatory biomarkers and serum adiponectin levels among first-degree relatives of these patients.Twenty-six participants (14 women and 12 men) with a family history of diabetes were recruited to this randomized, crossover study. Participants were randomly assigned to a legume-enriched or a habitual diet for 6 wk that was separated by a 2-wk washout. The inflammatory markers—high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and serum levels of adiponectin—were measured at the beginning and the end of each intervention period according to the standard protocol.Energy intake of participants was not statistically different between the two diets (1821.5 ± 100.11 versus 1788.2 ± 92.68 kcal/d, respectively). After consumption of a legume diet, percent change of hs-CRP reduced significantly compared with consumption of a habitual diet (−4.86% ± 1.86% versus 3.55% ± 1.97%, P = 0.002) and among the women in the study (−12.96% ± 1.96% versus 3.24% ± 2.65%, P = 0.004). The percent change of other inflammatory markers and serum concentrations of adiponectin were not significantly different between the two diet groups.The results of this study showed that a legume-enriched diet significantly reduced the hs-CRP concentrations in first-degree relatives of patients with diabetes after 6 wk of intervention compared with a habitual diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadiponectin 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3across-over studies 3adiabetes 3adiet 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alegumes 3amen 3apatients 3arisk 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awomen 0aLegume 0aInflammatory markers 0aAdiponectin 0aAt risk for diabetes 0aClinical trial1 aEsmaillzadeh, Ahmad1 aFaghihimani, Elham1 aAzadbakht, Leila0 tNutrition.g2015 Mar., v. 31, no. 3 p.459-465dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011500167300001800282520202800300592002802328650001402356650001202370650002202382650001902404650001502423650002002438650002402458650001502482650003302497651001002530700002002540700001802560700001602578700001302594700001302607700001702620773009802637856008302735852000902818655001202827IND60096070120221119013243.0141104e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gongwen10aMineral potential targeting and resource assessment based on 3D geological modeling in Luanchuan region, China  ap. 1976-1988.  aIn this paper, we used 3D modeling and nonlinear methods (fractal, multifractal, and probabilistic neural networks (PNN)) for regional mineral potential mapping and quantitative assessment for porphyry and skarn-type Mo deposits and hydrothermal vein-type Pb–Zn–Ag deposits in the Luanchuan region, China. A 3D geological model was constructed from various geological maps, cross sections, boreholes, and gravity and magnetic data. Geological features associated with mineralization were extracted using the 3D geological model and metallogenic models of porphyry and skarn-type Mo and Pb–Zn–Ag deposits. The multifractal method, principal component analysis, and power spectrum–area method were used to separate regional variability from local variability in the geochemical data. A 2.5D forward modeling of gravity and magnetic data was carried out to define the geometry, depth, and physical properties of geological bodies at depth. 3D visualization of the results assisted in understanding the spatial relations between the deposits and the other geological bodies (e.g., igneous intrusions). The PNN method was applied to represent and integrate multiple anomalies for mineral potential modeling. The concentration–area fractal method was used to classify the PNN mineral potential model. Three levels (ground surface and two subsurface horizontal planes) of mineral potential models were evaluated for undiscovered Mo and Pb–Zn–Ag deposits. Validation of the results shows that 3D modeling was useful for not only accurately extracting geological features but also for predicting potential mineral targets and evaluating mineral resources. The mineral potential targets identified consist of eight Mo potential targets and 15 Pb–Zn–Ag potential targets. Based on grade–tonnage data from the known Mo and Pb–Zn–Ag deposits and the results of 3D modeling, estimated potential resources of each of these types of deposits are 10.8 and 153.1Mt (Pb+Zn is 152.9Mt and Ag is 0.92Mt), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3agravity 3amineral resources 3amineralization 3amolybdenum 3aneural networks 3aphysical properties 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aChina1 aZhang, Shouting1 aYan, Changhai1 aSong, Yaowu1 aSun, Yue1 aLi, Dong1 aXu, Fengming0 tComputers & geosciences.g2011 Dec., v. 37, no. 12 p.1976-1988dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245012300163300001400286520165400300592002801954650001501982650001401997650002002011650002602031650001902057650003502076650001602111650001502127700001602142700002202158700001802180700001602198773009302214856008302307852000902390655001202399IND60096070220221119013330.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkgun, A.13aAn easy-to-use MATLAB program (MamLand) for the assessment of landslide susceptibility using a Mamdani fuzzy algorithm  ap. 23-34.  aIn this study, landslide susceptibility mapping using a completely expert opinion-based approach was applied for the Sinop (northern Turkey) region and its close vicinity. For this purpose, an easy-to-use program, “MamLand,” was developed for the construction of a Mamdani fuzzy inference system and employed in MATLAB. Using this newly developed program, it is possible to construct a landslide susceptibility map based on expert opinion. In this study, seven conditioning parameters characterising topographical, geological, and environmental conditions were included in the FIS. A landslide inventory dataset including 351 landslide locations was obtained for the study area. After completing the data production stage of the study, the data were processed using a soft computing approach, i.e., a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system. In this system, only landslide conditioning data were assessed, and landslide inventory data were not included in the assessment approach. Thus, a file depicting the landslide susceptibility degrees for the study area was produced using the Mamdani FIS. These degrees were then exported into a GIS environment, and a landslide susceptibility map was produced and assessed in point of statistical interpretation. For this purpose, the obtained landslide susceptibility map and the landslide inventory data were compared, and an area under curve (AUC) obtained from receiver operating characteristics (ROC) assessment was carried out. From this assessment, the AUC value was found to be 0.855, indicating that this landslide susceptibility map, which was produced in a data-independent manner, was successful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aexpert opinion 3ageographic information systems 3ainventories 3alandslides1 aSezer, E.A.1 aNefeslioglu, H.A.1 aGokceoglu, C.1 aPradhan, B.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.23-34dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245012400173520160800297592002801905650000801933650001801941650001001959650002801969650001501997650002102012650001302033650001302046650001902059650001102078650001502089650001702104650001202121650002302133650001702156650001202173650002102185650000902206650001902215650001102234650002302245653002502268653003102293653002602324653001702350653001902367653002602386700002002412700002502432700002002457700001802477700001702495700001902512700002202531700001902553773009402572856009102666852000902757655001202766IND60646125920221121061348.0190620e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1192272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYip, Hon-Kan10aCerebro- and renoprotective activities through platelet-derived biomaterials against cerebrorenal syndrome in rat model  aThough the cross-induction of either acute kidney (AKI) injury to ischemic stroke (IS) or IS to AKI might not be encountered in the early stages of cerebrorenal syndrome (CRS), both pathologies coexist in late stages. Therefore, we firstly established a late stage CRS rat model by simultaneous induction of both diseases, and further, cerebro and reno-protective activities of human platelet-rich plasma (hPRP), a blood-derived tissue engineering biomaterial, were tested in this pathology. hPRP was administrated via left common carotid artery and abdominal aorta 2 h post-sham procedure in Sprague-Dawley rats. Circulatory inflammatory markers (TNF-α/MPO/IL-6/Ly6G/CD11b/c), histopathologic cerebro and renal changes and oxidative stress were determined. Inflammation, infarct size, brain-associated inflammatory/DNA and mitochondrial damage and oxidative-stress with reduced neurons and neurological function were manifested in CRS group compared to other groups. CRS group also demonstrated declined renal function, accelerated renal collagen deposition, fibrosis and compromised glomerular podocyte components (podocin/ZO-1/fibronectin/synaptopodin). However, hPRP simultaneously suppressed all the inflammatory, cerebral and renal pathologic characteristics. hPRP also inhibited the expression of brain-associated inflammatory/DNA/mitochondrial damage and oxidative-stress biomarkers. These findings imply that hPRP may effectively exert cerebro- and renoprotective activities in late stage CRS through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-DNA and anti-mitochochondrial damaging activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal models 3aaorta 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomarkers 3acarotid arteries 3acollagen 3afibrosis 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ainfarction 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3arenal function 3astroke 3atissue engineering 0aPlatelet-rich plasma 0aBlood-derived biomaterials 0aCerebrorenal syndrome 0aInflammation 0aRenal function 0aNeurological function1 aChen, Kuan-Hung1 aDubey, Navneet Kumar1 aSun, Cheuk-Kwan1 aDeng, Yue-Hua1 aSu, Chun-Wei1 aLuo, Wenzheng,1 aCheng, Hsin-Chung1 aDeng, Win-Ping0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Sept., v. 214 p.119227-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1192273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04380naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001200166245007100178300001600249500001500265520235600280592002802636650001002664650001702674650001802691650003202709650001502741650001702756650002602773650001302799650001002812650002402822650001802846650004002864650003002904650002102934650001302955650002402968650001202992650002103004650002003025650001903045650003403064650002103098650002103119650003203140650001503172650003903187650003803226650002603264650001103290650001603301650003303317650001403350653001703364700001803381700002203399700001803421700002203439700001803461773011303479856008103592852000903673655001203682IND50068726220221118091236.0141111e20130916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006872622DNAL7 a238765952pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLau, C.10aEffect of Chinese herbs on CYP3A4 activity and expression in vitro  ap. 543-549.  a2019-12-06  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has become more popular among cancer patients in the Western world, who often use Chinese herbs as adjuvant therapy to reduce the adverse effects of conventional chemotherapy. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between Chinese herbs and anticancer drugs can occur and have dramatic consequences for these patients. Currently, only a few possible PK interactions between Chinese herbs and conventional Western drugs have been documented. AIM OF THE STUDY: Since the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) contributes to most of the PK interactions with (anticancer) drugs, the effect of four Chinese herbs (Oldenlandia diffusa, Codonopsis tangshen, Rehmannia glutinosa and Astragalus propinquus) on the activity and expression of CYP3A4 was investigated in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol and water–ethanol extracts of the four Chinese herbs were prepared from raw material. CYP3A4 inhibition was assessed by the use of Supersomes™ in a fluorescence assay. Furthermore, CYP3A4 induction was evaluated in a human pregnane X receptor (hPXR)-mediated CYP3A4 reporter gene assay and a quantitative real time PCR assay, both in human colon adenocarcinoma-derived LS180 cells (LS180). RESULTS: Extracts of Oldenlandia diffusa, Codonopsis tangshen, Rehmannia glutinosa and Astragalus propinquus inhibited CYP3A4 in human CYP3A4 Supersomes™ (IC₅₀ values: 17–83µg/mL). Oldenlandia diffusa and Rehmannia glutinosa significantly induced PXR-mediated CYP3A4 (p<0.001). Oldenlandia diffusa also significantly induced CYP3A4 mRNA levels (p<0.001 at 250µg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant use of Oldenlandia diffusa and Rehmannia glutinosa could result in induction of CYP3A4, leading to a reduced efficacy of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic window. Because of the possible enhanced toxicity caused by CYP3A4 inhibition, clinical effects of CYP3A4 inhibition by Astragalus propinquus and Codonopsis tangshen must also be taken into account. In conclusion, herb–drug interactions between Chinese herbs and various CYP3A4 substrates can occur. Further research to investigate the clinical relevance of the interactions caused by Oldenlandia diffusa, Codonopsis tangshen, Rehmannia glutinosa and Astragalus propinquus is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aherbs 3adrug therapy 3araw materials 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aAstragalus 3afluorescence 3aantineoplastic agents 3apatients 3acolon 3aRehmannia glutinosa 3amessenger RNA 3aCodonopsis pilosula subsp. tangshen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acytochrome P-450 3atoxicity 3aOldenlandia diffusa 3aethanol 3apharmacokinetics 3aadverse effects 3areporter genes 3aOriental traditional medicine 2aAstragalus Plant 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aCodonopsis 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP3Axmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbal 2aHumans 2aOldenlandia 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRehmannia 0achemotherapy1 aMooiman, K.D.1 aMaas-Bakker, R.F.1 aBeijnen, J.H.1 aSchellens, J.H.M.1 aMeijerman, I.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Sept. 16, v. 149, no. 2 p.543-549dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008900164300001600253520107300269592002801342650002501370650001801395650001901413650001601432650001201448650001201460650002001472650001401492650001301506650000901519650001201528650002901540650001501569650001701584650001301601653001601614653001701630653001301647653001501660653001501675653001501690700002001705700001601725773010001741856008101841852000901922655001201931IND60604802120221117215235.0180718e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaftel, Lior10aElevated milk β-carotene and lycopene after carrot and tomato paste supplementation  ap. 443-445.  aTo measure concentrations of β-carotene and lycopene in the breast milk of healthy, well-nourished, lactating women supplemented with fresh carrot or tomato paste.Twelve women were given fresh carrot paste and another 14 were given fresh tomato paste once a day for 3 d with a high-lipid-content meal.

The adsorption equilibrium was reached within 2 min and adsorption capacity was as high as 102.9 mg g−1 for Cu (II) and 73.9 mg g−1 for Zn (II). Ionic strength showed adverse effect on adsorption capacity, however, TOCNFs with higher carboxymethyl content were less influenced due to their resistance to aggregation. Copper adsorption exhibited strong selectivity over the tested common cations. The adsorptions of Cu (II) and Zn (II) onto TOCNF were endothermic but spontaneous processes, and the binding was driven by entropy increase. A combined interaction mechanism, including ion exchange, coordination and accumulation, was proposed based on the study. All the findings confirmed the great potential of TOCNF application in water purification and reclamation approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aadverse effects 3acations 3acellulose nanofibers 3acopper 3aendothermy 3aentropy 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3awater purification 3azinc 0aHeavy metal 0aCellulose nanofibers 0aAdsorption 0aWater purification1 aMessele, Selamawit Ashagre1 aBoluk, Yaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1837-65271 aGamal El-Din, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6869-14590 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 221 p.231-241dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.05.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011000165300001300275520129700288592002801585650001401613650002101627650001901648650001301667700001701680700001901697700001801716700001401734700001401748773008501762856008301847852000901930655001201939IND60096072020221119012910.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Soohee10aDevelopment of a hashing-based data structure for the fast retrieval of 3D terrestrial laser scanned data  ap. 1-10.  aThe volume of point cloud data obtained by 3-dimensional terrestrial laser scanners has grown very large as a result of scanner enhancements and application extensions. Quick point querying is therefore essential for efficient point cloud processing, and several data structures are applicable for that purpose. Octree, for example, is utilized in similar approaches and is considered a good candidate. This paper introduces hashing-based virtual grid (HVG), both as a competitor for octree and an improvement on the 3-dimensional virtual grid (3DVG). Whereas 3DVG is defined as a 3-dimensional array, HVG substitutes hashes for 3DVG's vertical indices. The performance of HVG was evaluated against those of octree and 3DVG by a point-querying operation. The selected operation finds neighboring points residing within a given radius for every individual point in the point cloud. HVG proved its balancing aspects throughout the operation, showing reasonable performance and memory efficiency. 3DVG, while its performance was excellent, required a significantly larger amount of memory. In summary, HVG is a suitable alternative to octree, and is expected to be effectively utilized as a base data structure for any application dealing with a massive amount of 3-dimensional point cloud data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3adigital database 3adigital images 3ascanners1 aKim, Sangmin1 aHoon Jung, Jae1 aKim, Changjae1 aYu, Kiyun1 aHeo, Joon0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Feb., v. 39 p.1-10dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04559naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008700170300001600257520269100273592002802964650001902992650001303011650002103024650002003045650001303065650001703078650002603095650002403121650002203145650001703167650002303184650001803207650002403225650001403249650001403263650001203277650001403289650002903303650002303332650001203355650002403367650001303391650001403404650001903418650002203437650002003459650001703479650001503496650001303511650003203524650001603556653001103572653001403583653002503597653001603622653002103638700001703659700001903676773010003695856008103795852000903876655001203885IND60604803320221117220443.0180718e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPappalardo, Giulia10aEicosapentaenoic acid in cancer improves body composition and modulates metabolism  ap. 549-555.  aThe objective of this review article is to present the most recent intervention studies with EPA on nutritional outcomes in cancer patients, e.g. nutritional status, weight & lean body mass.For this purpose a PubMed® and MedLine® search of the published literature up to and including January 2014 that contained the keywords: cancer, sarcopenia, EPA, ω-3 fatty acids, weight, intervention trial, muscle mass was conducted. The collected data was summarized and written in text format and in tables that contained: study design, patient' population, sample size, statistical significance and results of the intervention. The paper will cover malignancy, body composition, intervention with EPA, physiological mechanisms of action of EPA, effect of EPA on weight and body composition, future research.In cancer patients deterioration of muscle mass can be present regardless of body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI). Thus, sarcopenia in cancer patients with excessive fat mass (FM), entitled sarcopenic obesity, has gained greater relevance in clinical practice; it can negatively influence patients' functional status, tolerance to treatments & disease prognosis. The search for an effective nutritional intervention that improves body composition (preservation of muscle mass and muscle quality) is of utmost importance for clinicians and patients. The improvement of muscle quality is an even more recent area of interest because it has probable implications in patients' prognosis. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been identified as a promising nutrient with the wide clinical benefits. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain EPA potential benefits on body composition: inhibition of catabolic stimuli by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines production and enhancing insulin sensitivity that induces protein synthesis; also, EPA may attenuate deterioration of nutritional status resulting from antineoplastic therapies by improving calorie and protein intake as well.Indeed, cancer-related sarcopenia/cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by inflammation, anorexia, weight loss, and muscle/adipose tissue loss mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, e.g. TNF-α and IL-6, resulting in increased chemotherapy toxicity, costs, morbidity and mortality. With this review we found that EPA can reduce inflammation and has the potential to modulate nutritional status/body composition. In view of the modest survival benefits of chemotherapy/radiotherapy in some cancers, important issues for physicians are to optimize well-being, Quality of Life via nutritional status and adequate body composition. Thus, improvement in nutritional status is a central outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aanorexia 3abody composition 3abody mass index 3acachexia 3adrug therapy 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aexperimental design 3afunctional status 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3amechanism of action 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amuscles 3aneoplasms 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprotein intake 3aprotein synthesis 3aquality of life 3aradiotherapy 3asarcopenia 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight loss 0aCancer 0aNutrition 0aEicosapentanoic acid 0aMuscle mass 0aBody composition1 aAlmeida, Ana1 aRavasco, Paula0 tNutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.549-555dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245006800177300001600245520101700261592002801278650000901306650001201315650002301327650001901350650001201369650001401381650001301395650002201408650002401430653002201454653002301476653002401499653003001523773010001553856008101653852000901734655001201743IND60604803720221117220433.0180718e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2014.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozzetti, F.q(Federico),10aTailoring the nutritional regimen in the elderly cancer patient  ap. 612-614.  aOur knowledge of the macronutrient requirement of elderly cancer patient is still incomplete and mainly relies on studies of elderly (healthy) people and populations of cancer patients including both adult and elderly subjects. Patients with minor nutritional deterioration do not require any specific nutritional regimen, but cachectic patients do. Total energy expenditure can be unchanged or lower in advanced weight-losing patients (when compared with matched healthy controls) because the higher resting metabolic expenditure can be offset by reduced physical activity, and it approximates to 25-28 Kcal/kg/d. Protein requirement is probably 1.5 g amino acid (AA)/kg/d or more, especially if the goal is increased lean body mass. However, the final balance depends not only on the quantity of AA but also their quality: diets including a high percentage of essential AA and especially of branched-chain ones and leucine in particular, are advocated. Total fluid load should be prudent, around 25-30 ml/kg/d.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aelderly 3aenergy expenditure 3alean body mass 3aleucine 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aprotein requirement 0aWater requirement 0aEnergy requirement 0aProtein requirement 0aMacronutrient requirement0 tNutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.612-614dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2014.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245008700172300001600259520110900275592002801384650001701412650000901429650001401438650001401452650001401466650001601480651002201496700002001518700002101538773008801559856008301647852000901730655001201739IND60096073220221119013055.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollock, Daniel W.10a3D exploratory analysis of descriptive lithology records using regular expressions  ap. 111-119.  aThis paper presents an interactive approach for analyzing a database of descriptive lithology records to locate a specific lithology feature in three-dimensional space. The method uses a regular expression to search individual lithology records, assigning a match score to indicate the relative strength of a search result. Spatial analysis of the resulting match scores generates a three-dimensional representation of the search results, which indicates the likely locations of the lithology feature. The method enables direct analysis of lithology descriptions, which are often characterized by inconsistencies in terminology, accuracy, level of detail, and spatial distribution. Using regular expressions, the approach circumvents the need for manual interpretation and classification of lithology records. The method was applied to a case study area in Western Australia to delineate the extent of three lithology features (clay, calcareous sediments, and iron-rich sediments). The approach is generally applicable for layered lithology features that are regularly documented in a lithology database.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclay 3acomputers 3adatabases 3asediments 3aterminology 3aWestern Australia1 aBarron, Olga V.1 aDonn, Michael J.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Feb., v. 39 p.111-119dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245015200181300001600333520158800349592002801937650001601965650002801981650002102009650003702030650003902067650002302106650001902129650002502148650001602173650006402189650006702253650005002320650003502370650005802405650003202463650001602495650002502511650002902536650004502565650001702610650003002627700002202657700001502679700002502694700002202719700002102741700002502762773011302787856008102900852000902981655001202990IND50068726420221118091203.0141111e20130916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006872642DNAL7 a238922032pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoyo, Mack10aConservation strategy for Pelargonium sidoides DC: Phenolic profile and pharmacological activity of acclimatized plants derived from tissue culture  ap. 557-561.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pelargonium sidoides DC (Geraniaceae), a popular medicinal plant used in folk medicine in the treatment of respiratory-related infections has gained international prominence due to its usage in several herbal formulations. This has led to high demand and the subsequent decimation of wild populations. AIM OF THE STUDY: Using plant tissue culture techniques, Pelargonium sidoides plants were cloned in vitro, acclimatized under greenhouse conditions and evaluated for their phytochemical content and pharmacological activity. METHODS: Phenolic content in extracts of in vitro-derived, greenhouse-acclimatized and wild Pelargonium sidoides plants were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts against bacterial and fungal strains were evaluated. RESULTS: Similarities in phenolic profiles were identified confirming the chemical signatures that characterize Pelargonium sidoides plants. Extracts of greenhouse-acclimatized and wild plants exhibited comparable antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study highlights the potential of integrating plant tissue culture technologies in conservation strategies of medicinal plants. In particular, the results strongly suggest the feasibility of both large-scale cultivation and plant part substitution as alternative solutions to the current destructive overharvesting practices of wild Pelargonium sidoides populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelargonium 3afree radical scavengers 3amedicinal plants 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aphenolic compounds 3atissue culture 3atraditional medicine 3awild plants 2aAcids, Carbocyclicxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxmetabolism 2aCandida albicansxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPelargonium 2aPicratesxmetabolism 2aPlant Components, Aerial 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Tubers 2aTissue Culture Techniques1 aAremu, Adeyemi O.1 aGruz, Jiri1 aŠubrtová, Michaela1 aSzüčová, Lucie1 aDoležal, Karel,1 aVan Staden, Johannes0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Sept. 16, v. 149, no. 2 p.557-561dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005300169300001600222520125100238592002801489650001301517650001501530650001401545650001601559650001201575650000901587650002501596650003101621650001501652650001401667650001301681650002001694650002001714653001001734653001101744653001201755653001301767653002301780700002001803773010001823856008101923852000902004655001202013IND60604804020221117215358.0180718e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2015.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViganò, Antonio,14aThe elderly patient with cancer: A holistic view  ap. 587-589.  aThe elderly cancer patient (ECP) population is a heterogeneous group, ranging from competent, active, and fit individuals to those who are frail and cognitively impaired. A continuum exists from an increased vulnerability to stressors that results from the usual decreases in physiologic reserves (=aging) to the deregulation of multiple physiologic systems (=frailty). The ability or inability of carrying out activities of daily living is both a cause and an effect of frailty and may exacerbate the clinical manifestations of comorbidities. Cachexia is one of the most important comorbid conditions in ECPs, which can directly impair their quality of life, their ability to tolerate tumor-directed treatments, and their ability to respond to rehabilitation. Gait speed, handgrip strength, and cognitive tests along with simple laboratory tests to rule out the presence of increased inflammatory state and/or a particular hormonal deficiency may guide interventions and allow for monitoring of clinical outcomes over time. An organized social network, collaborative support from the team of caregivers and sufficient home care services comprise a comprehensive care approach that guarantees successful treatment outcomes for the ECP population.  aPublisher supplied data 3acachexia 3acaregivers 3acognition 3acomorbidity 3aelderly 3agait 3ahome health services 3alaboratory experimentation 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aquality of life 3asocial networks 0aAging 0aCancer 0aFrailty 0aCachexia 0aComprehensive care1 aMorais, Jose A.0 tNutrition.g2015 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.587-589dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2015.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245006700165300001600232520117800248592002801426650004101454650001401495650002701509650001501536650001101551650001401562650001501576650001901591650001501610651001301625700002501638700002501663773008801688856008301776852000901859655001201868IND60096074020221119013401.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPai, Naresh10aField_SWAT: A tool for mapping SWAT output to field boundaries  ap. 175-184.  aThe Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological/water quality model divides a watershed into hydrological response units (HRUs) based on unique land cover, soil type, and slope. HRUs are a set of discontinuous land masses that are spatially located in the watershed but their responses are not tied to any particular field. Field_SWAT, a simple graphical user interface (GUI)-driven tool, was developed to map SWAT simulations from the HRU layer to a user-defined field boundaries layer. This stand-alone tool ingests spatial and nonspatial SWAT outputs and helps in visualizing them at the field scale using four different aggregation methods. The tool was applied for mapping the SWAT model's annual runoff and sediment outputs from 218 HRUs to 89 individual field boundaries in an agriculturally dominated watershed in Northeast Arkansas. The area-weighted spatial aggregation method resulted in a most suitable mapping between HRU and field outputs. This research demonstrates that Field_SWAT could potentially be a useful tool for field-scale targeting of conservation practices and communicating model outputs to watershed managers and interested stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acomputers 3aconservation practices 3aland cover 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil types 3auser interface 3awatersheds 3aArkansas1 aSaraswat, Dharmendra1 aSrinivasan, Raghavan0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Mar., v. 40 p.175-184dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001100191245012500202300001600327506007600343520175300419592002802172506003702200650001402237650001102251650002302262650002102285650001402306650002802320650002802348650001502376650001402391650002202405650001502427650001402442650001702456650001402473651001002487653002202497653002102519653003702540653003602577700001402613700001302627700001402640700001302654700001202667700001202679700001102691773013802702856008402840852000902924655001202933IND60604804320221207124554.0180718e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2014.07.0062doi7 aPMC43020642pmcid7 a251597282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, T.10aNontraditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and visceral adiposity index among different body size phenotypes  ap. 100-107.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIncreased cardiovascular disease and mortality risk in metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals remain highly controversial. Several studies suggested risk while others do not. The traditional cardiovascular risk factors may be insufficient to demonstrate the complete range of metabolic abnormalities in MHO individuals. Hence, we aimed to compare the prevalence of elevated lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B, and uric acid (UA) levels, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio, and visceral adiposity index (VAI) scores, and low apolipoprotein A1 levels among 6 body size phenotypes (normal weight with and without metabolic abnormalities, overweight with and without metabolic abnormalities, and obese with or without metabolic abnormalities).We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 7765 Chinese adults using data from the nationwide China Health and Nutrition Survey 2009. MHO persons had intermediate prevalence of elevated apolipoprotein B and UA levels, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and VAI scores, and low apolipoprotein A1 levels between metabolically healthy normal-weight (MHNW) and metabolically abnormal obese individuals (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Elevated apolipoprotein B and UA concentrations, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio, and VAI scores were all strongly associated with the MHO phenotype (all P < 0.01).Prevalence of elevated apolipoprotein B and UA levels, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and VAI scores, and low levels of apolipoprotein A1 was higher among MHO persons than among MHNW individuals. The elevated levels of the nontraditional risk factors and VAI scores in MHO persons could contribute to the increased cardiovascular disease risk observed in long-term studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3aadults 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3aapolipoprotein B 3abody size 3acardiovascular diseases 3across-sectional studies 3ametabolism 3amortality 3anutrition surveys 3aoverweight 3aphenotype 3arisk factors 3auric acid 3aChina 0aApolipoprotein A1 0aApolipoprotein B 0aMetabolically abnormal and obese 0aMetabolically healthy but obese1 aZhang, J.1 aYuan, G.1 aZhang, M.1 aZhou, X.1 aLiu, Z.1 aSun, X.1 aYu, X.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2015 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.100-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2014.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165500001900293520249400312592002802806650001102834650001802845650001402863650002302877650001302900650001902913650001802932650001602950650001202966650001102978650001002989650001202999650001003011650001203021650001503033650001603048700001803064700001603082700001803098700002103116773013603137856008103273852000903354655001203363IND60698171520221119163234.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069817152DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200011962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarhat, Grace13aAn Investigation into the Effects of Stevia on food intake, satiety and blood glucose levels in adults: a small-scale study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNon-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are suggested to reduce sugar and energy content of diet, but there is growing evidence that they can exacerbate obesity and diabetes through increasing appetite and energy intake. Stevia (stevioside extract), a natural sweetener, is being increasingly consumed, yet limited studies have looked at their effects on satiety and energy intake. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of preloads of stevia on food intake, satiety and postprandial blood glucose levels when compared to water and sugar. Thirty participants (10 males/20 females; 26 ± 10.5 years; BMI: 23.44 ± 3.42 Kg/m²) took part in a three-arm single-blinded crossover trial. On separate test days, they received three different preloads (300 ml) containing water, sugar (60g) and stevia (1g) followed by an ad-libitum pizza lunch after 30 minutes. Breakfast was standardized. Blood glucose samples were collected before preload and lunch, and then at 30-minute intervals until 120 min post lunch. Volunteers recorded their feelings of satiety and hunger on visual analogue scales (VAS) before preload and after meal intake. A one-day diet diary was collected for each test day. Data was analysed using repeated measures ANOVA (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Despite the difference in energy content between preloads, there were no significant differences in energy intake at lunch between the three interventions (F (2, 56) = 0.25, p = 0.78). Furthermore, participants did not compensate by consuming more energy during the day after the stevia preload (1660 ± 584 Kcal) compared to sugar preload (1770 ± 763 Kcal, p = 0.82). There were no significant differences in VAS scores between stevia and sugar preloads, but participants scored significantly higher rates of hunger (before and after lunch) and desire to eat (before lunch) following water preload (p < 0.05). No significant differences between water, sugar and stevia were noted for postprandial glucose levels (120 min post lunch) when adjusted from baseline (F (2, 58) = 2.56, p = 0.09). Area under the curve (AUC) for glucose did not differ between water and stevia (p = 0.2). Results are in line with several clinical trials showing that the consumption of sweeteners does not lead to an increase in hunger and energy intake, and could therefore present a useful strategy to assist with weight loss. Further studies looking at long-term effects of stevia on weight regulation are needed to support these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia 3ablood glucose 3abreakfast 3across-over studies 3adiabetes 3aenergy content 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aglucose 3ahunger 3alunch 3aobesity 3apizza 3asatiety 3astevioside 3aweight loss1 aMoore, Lauren1 aMoya, Inaki1 aHall, Lindsay1 aBerset, Victoria0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Materials and Methods: Children aged 1.5–18 years old (N = 2564) and adults aged 19 years or older (N = 2705) from the NDNS 2012/13–2015/16 were included in the study. The average of four-day food diary data was used for analysis. Yogurt included all food items from the yogurt, fromage frais and dairy dessert food group, excluding dairy dessert products. Participants were classified as yogurt eaters if they reported consumption of yogurt at least once during the four days. Percentage contribution of yogurt to daily intake of nutrients in yogurt eaters was calculated. Multiple linear regression analyses for surveys were used to compare differences in energy and nutrient intake between yogurt eaters and non-eaters, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Energy intake was also adjusted for in nutrient data analysis. Results: The prevalence of yogurt consumption was 53% in children and 39% in adults. The daily intake of yogurt was 105 g and 132 g, respectively. Yogurt is an important source of calcium and riboflavin in children and adults, as well as vitamin D in children, accounting for over 15% of daily intake of these nutrients. Compared to non-eaters, yogurt eaters had significantly higher energy intake in both children and adults; they also had significantly higher intake of protein, fiber, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, folate, riboflavin, thiamin, and vitamin C, as well as significantly lower intake of sodium. Child yogurt eaters also had significantly higher intake of vitamin A and vitamin B12, and lower intake of total fat, whereas adult yogurt eaters had significantly higher intake of carbohydrate, iron, zinc, vitamin D and vitamin E, compared to non-eaters. Both yogurt eaters in children and adults had higher intake of total sugar; nonetheless, non-milk extrinsic sugar intake did not differ by yogurt consumption status in children, and it was significantly lower in adult yogurt eaters. Saturated fat intake did not differ by yogurt consumption status in children and adults. Discussion: Yogurt is an important dietary source of several nutrients in the United Kingdom. Its consumption was positively associated with intake of total energy and many nutrients to encourage, but not positively associated with intake of sodium, total fat, saturated fat, and non-milk extrinsic sugar in both children and adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3achildren 3adesserts 3adietary surveys 3aenergy intake 3afat intake 3afolic acid 3afood groups 3afood records 3airon 3amagnesium 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3ariboflavin 3asaturated fats 3asodium 3athiamin 3avitamin A 3avitamin B12 3avitamin E 3ayogurt 3azinc 3aUnited Kingdom1 aSmith, Jessica1 aJain, Neha1 aVanage, Vipra1 aSharma, Mitesh1 aHolschuh, Norton1 aAgler, Anne Hermetet0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Until now, there were no data available about the chemical structure of cell wall polysaccharides found in cashew apple. In this work, its pectic polysaccharides have been characterized through monosaccharide composition, HPSEC, methylation and 13C and 1H/13C HSQC-DEPT-NMR analyses. Highly methyl esterified homogalacturonan with a DE of 76% mixed with arabinogalactan were found. This latter was purified and presented a highly branched type II arabinogalactan (AG II) and small amounts of a type I rhamnogalacturonan in which the AG II could be anchored. These findings about the chemical structure of cashew apple pectins could contribute to develop future nutritional, biotechnological and pharmacological uses for this industrial waste from the cashew nut production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aapples 3aarabinogalactans 3acarbon 3acashew fruit 3acashew nuts 3acell walls 3achemical structure 3aesterification 3aindustrial wastes 3amethylation 3apeduncle 3apolygalacturonic acid 3astable isotopes 3atrees 3aBrazil 0aCashew apple 0aPolysaccharides 0aPectins 0aArabinogalactan1 aCantu-Jungles, Thaisa Moro1 aIacomini, Marcello1 aCordeiro, Lucimara M.C.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 483 p.107752-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2019.1077523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245015200166300002000318520132500338592002801663650001601691650001201707650001101719650002601730650001301756650001301769650002601782650000901808650001201817650001201829650001401841650001401855650001301869650001501882650001101897650001501908700002201923700002301945700001801968700002001986700002402006700002002030700001802050700002302068700002702091700002402118700002002142700002102162773013402183856007502317852000902392655001202401IND60539926720170628000000.0160817e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053992672DNAL7 a10.1021/ja506230r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapelewski, Matthew
T.10aM2(m-dobdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Metal–Organic Frameworks Exhibiting Increased Charge Density and Enhanced H2 Binding at the Open Metal Sites  ap. 12119-12129.  aThe well-known frameworks of the type M₂(dobdc) (dobdc⁴– = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) have numerous potential applications in gas storage and separations, owing to their exceptionally high concentration of coordinatively unsaturated metal surface sites, which can interact strongly with small gas molecules such as H₂. Employing a related meta-functionalized linker that is readily obtained from resorcinol, we now report a family of structural isomers of this framework, M₂(m-dobdc) (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; m-dobdc⁴– = 4,6-dioxido-1,3-benzenedicarboxylate), featuring exposed M²⁺ cation sites with a higher apparent charge density. The regioisomeric linker alters the symmetry of the ligand field at the metal sites, leading to increases of 0.4–1.5 kJ/mol in the H₂ binding enthalpies relative to M₂(dobdc). A variety of techniques, including powder X-ray and neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, infrared spectroscopy, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, are applied in elucidating how these subtle structural and electronic differences give rise to such increases. Importantly, similar enhancements can be anticipated for the gas storage and separation properties of this new family of robust and potentially inexpensive metal–organic frameworks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acations 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3aenthalpy 3ahydrogen 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airon 3aisomers 3aligands 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aneutrons 3anew family 3anickel 3aresorcinol1 aGeier, Stephen J.1 aHudson, Matthew R.1 aStück, David1 aMason, Jarad A.1 aNelson, Jocienne N.1 aXiao, Dianne J.1 aHulvey, Zeric1 aGilmour, Elizabeth1 aFitzGerald, Stephen

However, its extensive application is limited due to relative unfavorable nanostructure and low surface reactivity. Herein, a hierarchical core-branch electrode material composed of Zn substituted nickel cobalt sulfides nanosheets branched on the NiCo₂S₄ nanotube arrays combining with conductive carbon cloth (denoted as CC/NiCo₂S₄@Zn–Ni–Co–S NSAs) is successfully fabricated as excellent cathode for asymmetric supercapacitors. Remarkably, the integration of componental and structural advantages endows the as-prepared CC/NiCo₂S₄@Zn–Ni–Co–S electrode with better electrochemical performance including ultrahigh specific capacitance (1201 C g⁻¹/2668 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹), excellent rate capability (704 C g⁻¹/1564 F g⁻¹ at 50 A g⁻¹) and remarkable cycling stability. More importantly, the assembled CC/NiCo₂S₄@Zn–Ni–Co–S//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor operates in a high voltage window of 1.7 V with a superior energy density of 60.2 W h kg⁻¹ at power density of 849.9 W kg⁻¹ and long-term cycling stability with 91.2% retention after 10 000 cycles.

LIBRE is the first large multicenter RCT to test the effect of these lifestyle factors on the incidence of breast cancer in women at risk because of BRCA mutations⁽¹⁾. LIBRE also offers to unravel underlying mechanisms such as the role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) for beneficial effects of such lifestyle interventions. Methods: We examined the effect of the lifestyle intervention on the production of SCFA measured in feces by gas chromatography. From the ongoing LIBRE trial we included all complete datasets (171 women; mean age 44 ± 11 years). Both women with and without previous breast cancer diagnosis were recruited (diseased; non-diseased). The participants were randomized into an intervention group (IG) trained for MedD and physical activity, and a usual care control group (CG). Adherence to the MedD was assessed at baseline and after 3 months (V1) using the validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) and the EPIC food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Results: At baseline there was no difference in SCFA levels between the groups. In the IG the MEDAS score increased substantially by 2.5 points (p < 0.001), in the CG only mildly by 0.4 points (p < 0.05). Correspondingly, the intake of fibers increased solely in the IG. In the course of the study the amount of caproic acid decreased in the control group (p < 0.001). At V1 non-diseased women showed higher amounts of acetic acid (p = 0.042), n-butyric acid (p = 0.023), n-valeric acid (p = 0.018) and iso-valeric acid (p = 0.031). There were several correlations between the intake of different fibers and fecal SCFA. For example, the sum of poly- and oligosaccharides correlated with acetic acid (p = 0.001; r = 0.316), propionic acid (p = 0.034; r = 0,251), n-butyric acid (p = 0.010; r = 0.316) and iso-valeric acid (p = 0.012; r = 0.306). There was no correlation between the MEDAS and SCFA. Discussion: A lifestyle change towards a MedD and increased physical activity did not change the levels of SCFA in feces, although an increase of fiber intake was documented in the IG. To further analyze SCFA metabolism in this target population, gut microbiota composition and function (metabolites) are currently analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aacetic acid 3abreast neoplasms 3adata collection 3afeces 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agas chromatography 3ahexanoic acid 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alifestyle 3ametabolites 3aoligosaccharides 3aphysical activity 3apropionic acid 3arisk1 aBeutel, Jacqueline1 aKogel, Marie1 aBasrai, Maryam1 aWalter, Jens1 aLaville, Martine1 aNeyrinck, Audrey M.1 aDelzenne, Nathalie M.1 aKiechle, Marion1 aBischoff, S.

Here, employing first principle calculations, we introduce a feasible approach to realize an efficient graphene based p-n junction (PNJ) which is composed of non-covalently physisorbed tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) molecules onto an armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR). We show that compared to conventional graphene based p-n systems, our suggested PNJ exhibits low threshold voltage (Vth), large current-voltage ratio, and almost no sensitivity to conformational variations. Using a simple model, we also provide a theoretical background to explain the rectifying behavior of the suggested PNJ and show that tuning the distance between p and n doped regions modifies the current-voltage ratio. Our study indicates that the perfect diode behavior along with stability under various practical conditions makes our proposed PNJ a promising building block to fabricate next generation graphene based nanosize transistors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adiodes 3aelectric potential difference 3agraphene 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3atransistors1 aLee, Geunsik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2477-99901 aKim, Kwang S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6929-53590 tCarbon.g2019 Nov., v. 153 p.525-530dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245007900210300001600289520149700305592002801802650002301830650002401853650001901877650001301896650001901909650001601928650002401944650001201968650001301980700002801993773008702021856008502108852000902193655001202202IND60654317720221120044310.0210603e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065431772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Siddharth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5725-006810aNon-equilibrium processing of ferromagnetic heavily reduced graphene oxide  ap. 663-673.  aDiscovery of ferromagnetism with simultaneous bandgap opening in graphene[1] provides an attractive platform towards multifunctional spintronic devices. However, device integration of graphene and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is hindered by scalability and high temperature required for reducing GO. In this paper, we present a nonequilibrium approach for direct laser writing heavily reduced GO films by melting amorphous carbon in ambient conditions. Nanosecond laser irradiation melts carbon, which regrows into rGO in low undercooling conditions. These rGO films exhibit room-temperature ferromagnetism with a high saturation magnetization of 7.0 emu/g and 40 Oe coercivity. The intrinsic ferromagnetic ordering triggers a broad negative magnetoresistance (MR) cusp from 20 to 50 K. An anomalous crossover from weak localization (WL) to weak antilocalization (WAL) is observed below 5 K, suggesting a substantial enhancement in spin-orbit coupling strength, opening a new route to access topological states in rGO. The rGO films exhibit 12.6 cm²/Vs electron mobility with n-type carrier concentration of 1.2 × 10²¹/cc. Raman spectroscopy and temperature-dependent transport investigations in rGO suggest low-disorder, following 2D Mott variable range hopping (VRH) mechanism with a bandgap of ∼0.22 eV and 3 nm localization length. These findings open a definitive pathway for tuning electrical and magnetic properties in graphene-based materials with laser-writing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aferromagnetism 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3amagnetic properties 3amelting 3atopology1 aNarayan, J.q(Jagdish),0 tCarbon.g2019 Nov., v. 153 p.663-673dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012200165300001600287520116100303592002801464650001401492650001101506650001301517650002101530650002101551650001101572650001901583650001001602650001301612650001201625650001901637650001801656653002901674653001601703653003501719653001201754653002101766700001101787700001701798700001401815700001601829700001501845700001401860773008701874856008501961852000902046655001202055IND60654317820221120061338.0210603e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065431782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Cong10aUltrahigh-energy-density fluorinated calcinated macadamia nut shell cathodes for lithium/fluorinated carbon batteries  ap. 783-791.  aLithium/fluorinated carbon (Li/CFₓ) batteries are widely applied in various industries because of the high energy densities of CFₓ compounds. However, incompatibility between high degrees of fluorination and the electrochemical activity of C–F bonds limits further improvements of the energy densities of CFₓ cathodes. Here, calcined macadamia nut shell is fluorinated with F₂ gas below 300 °C. The products deliver specific capacities exceeding 900 mAh g⁻¹, associated with discharge potentials exceeding 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li⁺). The product fluorinated at 280 °C achieves an unprecedented maximum energy density of 2585 W h kg⁻¹, surpassing the present maximum theoretical energy density of commercial (CF)ₙ (2185 W h kg⁻¹). Its electrochemical properties presumably originate from the complete destruction of the periodic crystalline lattice in the basal plane, which substantially alters the electron distribution within the C–F bonds. This study presents a new approach for designing exceptionally high-energy-density CFₓ compounds for lithium primary batteries using an accessible and inexpensive raw material.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acathodes 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahulls 3aindustry 3alithium 3amacadamia nuts 3araw materials 0aUltrahigh energy density 0aFluorinated 0aCalcinated macadamia nut shell 0aCathode 0aLi/CFx batteries1 aLi, Yu1 aYao, Fengnan1 aFu, Haoyu1 aZhou, Rixin1 aFeng, Yiyu1 aFeng, Wei0 tCarbon.g2019 Nov., v. 153 p.783-791dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009000156300002000246520114800266592002801414650003701442650001201479650001801491650000901509650001901518650001401537650001101551650002401562650003401586650002201620700002601642700002701668700002201695700002301717700001901740773013401759856007501893852000901968655001201977IND60539927420221122004020.0160817e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053992742DNAL7 a10.1021/ja506647p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaba, Tomasz10aFormation of Highly Ordered Self-Assembled Monolayers of Alkynes on Au(111) Substrate  ap. 11918-11921.  aSelf-assembled monolayers (SAMs), prepared by reaction of terminal n-alkynes (HCC(CH₂)ₙCH₃, n = 5, 7, 9, and 11) with Au(111) at 60 °C were characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angles of water. In contrast to previous spectroscopic studies of this type of SAMs, these combined microscopic and spectroscopic experiments confirm formation of highly ordered SAMs having packing densities and molecular chain orientations very similar to those of alkanethiolates on Au(111). Physical properties, hydrophobicity, high surface order, and packing density, also suggest that SAMs of alkynes are similar to SAMs of alkanethiols. The formation of high-quality SAMs from alkynes requires careful preparation and manipulation of reactants in an oxygen-free environment; trace quantities of O₂ lead to oxidized contaminants and disordered surface films. The oxidation process occurs during formation of the SAM by oxidation of the −CC– group (most likely catalyzed by the gold substrate in the presence of O₂).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkynes 3acontact angle 3agold 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphysical properties 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3aspectral analysis1 aNoworolska, Agnieszka1 aBowers, Carleen

Here, we report a one-step and facile approach to synthesize graphene based materials from coal under ambient conditions via direct CO₂ laser scribing. The obtained laser scribed graphene from coal (C-LSG) has been well characterized, showing good electrical conductivity (12 Ω/square), high electrochemical sensitivity and ionic storage properties. These properties make C-LSG a multifunctional material for applications in Joule heating, electrochemical dopamine sensing, and supercapacitors. Moreover, when electrochemically deposited with FeNi hydroxide, the hybridized FeNi/C-LSG shows impressive electrocatalysis performance toward oxygen evolution reaction. As such, this direct laser scribing of coal into graphene based materials can not only potentially expands new business opportunities by adding coal into the value-chain of industries that usually do not use coal as the starting materials in their manufacturing processes but also brings down the cost of the graphene based materials, which would make their deployment in various field more economically attractive.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3acoal 3acost effectiveness 3adopamine 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3aheat 3amanufacturing 3aoxygen production 3asupply chain 3avalue-added products 0aCoal 0aLaser scribing graphene 0aJoule heater 0aDopamine sensing 0aSupercapacitors 0aElectrocatalysis1 aXie, Yunchao1 aZhang, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3823-77941 aLin, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4675-25290 tCarbon.g2019 Nov., v. 153 p.585-591dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0703Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle04463naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166500001900302520291000321592002803231650000803259650001403267650001103281650001203292650002803304650002003332650002803352650002803380650001303408650001903421650001703440650003403457650003803491650001603529650001703545650001403562650001203576650002203588650001903610650000903629650001103638650003503649700002203684700002503706773013603731856008103867852000903948655001203957IND60698173120221119164924.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069817312DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200013542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolton, Juliet10aPhysical Activity Attenuates Increased Obesity Risk Associated with the High-Risk Genotype of the FTO Gene in a UK Adult Population  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aObesity is an international epidemic. Worldwide, 1.9 billion adults are overweight, and 650 million adults are obese. Obesity has many chronic comorbidities, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity's cause is positive energy balance involving environmental and biological factors. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) suggest that the A/T expression of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) rs9939609 within the Fat-Mass and Obesity-Associated (FTO) gene significantly influences adiposity. The high-risk A allele is associated with increased Body Mass Index (BMI) (0.36kg/m² per A allele) and a preference for increased fat and protein intake. FTO encodes for 2-oxoglutarate-dependant-nucleic-acid-demethylase, which is involved in energy homeostasis and lipolysis. Previous studies show that a high physical activity level (PAL) attenuates the increased BMI risks associated with the high-risk allele. However, results have been contradictory. This study aims to elucidate the links between FTO SNP rs9939609, PAL, BMI and food preference. An observational cross-sectional study including 37 UK adults was performed. Participant height, weight and body fat% (BF%) (using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) were measured. A food frequency questionnaire was completed, a saliva sample was collected for DNA analysis and PAL was assessed using participants active hours. A two-way MANOVA was performed to determine differences in BMI and BF% between FTO rs9939609 genotypes and PALs. A Chi-squared test was performed to determine potential genotype associations with food preference. Participant BMI was significantly higher in AA participants compared to AT (3.99kg/m² ± 1.69, p = 0.027) and TT (3.7kg/m² ± 1.73, p = 0.043) participants. Participant BMI was higher in low PAL participants compared to medium PAL participants (4.62kg/m² ± 1.35, p = 0.002). Genotype did not significantly influence participant BF% (p = 0.281). A combination of PAL and genotype was significantly associated with BMI and BF% (p = 0.009). BMI was significantly increased in AA participants compared to TT participants (7.15kg/m² ± 2.68, p = 0.013) and AT participants (8.15kg/m² ± 2.77, p = 0.007) with low PAL. This difference was not seen as PAL increased. No significant associations were found between genotype and food preference (p = 0.717). This study suggests that combining genotype and PAL significantly influences BMI and BF%. Participants homozygous for the risk allele AA with low PAL have significantly higher BMI than AT/TT participants with low PAL. However, the obesogenic effects of the risk genotype are diminished as PAL increases. This suggests that PAL attenuates genetic predisposition for obesity associated with the FTO rs9939609 A allele. These results may be applied in obesity intervention programmes particularly for encouragement of genetically predisposed individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadiposity 3aadults 3aalleles 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3aenergy balance 3afood choices 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agenetic predisposition to disease 3ahomeostasis 3ahomozygosity 3alipolysis 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aprotein intake 3arisk 3asaliva 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aGraham, Catherine1 aMavrommatis, Yiannis0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Here, we expand this study with eight additional potentials: AIREBO, REBO2-S, Erhart/Albe, ABOP, GAP, Tersoff-S, Tersoff/Nordlund and Tersoff with modified cutoff. Using molecular dynamics we produce and anneal amorphous carbon structures of different densities. Characterization using coordination analysis, ring statistics, radial distribution functions and diffraction intensity show that no two potentials give the same result. To address this lack of transferability, we have developed a web application tool, www.carbonpotentials.org which collates all carbon potentials and enables real-time and equivalent comparison. Unlike a traditional publication that is frozen in time, the tool is expandable and can accommodate new potentials and data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acarbon 3amolecular dynamics 3astatistics1 aAghajamali, Alireza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0932-05131 aJones, Jake L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3198-06411 aLim, Daniel J.1 aLópez, María J.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7698-93271 aSuarez-Martinez, Irene1 aMarks, Nigel A.0 tCarbon.g2019 Dec., v. 155 p.624-634dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245005600173300001400229520228100243592002802524650001202552650001302564650000802577650001502585650002602600650001302626650001502639653001602654653002002670653002002690653002802710653001402738700002202752700002202774700002102796773010102817856008802918852000903006655001203015IND60654319420221118214548.0200628e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065431942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, Mihaela10aBedrock mega-grooves in glaciated terrain: A review  ap. 57-79.  aBedrock mega-grooves are assemblages of straight and parallel troughs eroded in bedrock, typically over 1000 m in length; most sites occur within the limits of the Last Glacial Maximum, both on- and off-shore. In this paper, we review the current understanding of these important yet enigmatic landforms and propose a framework for their future research. Mega-grooves are important to our understanding of ice sheet dynamics, ice–bedrock interactions and bedrock landscape evolution in glaciated areas. The overall straightness of mega-grooves across the landscape, their parallel alignment to palaeo-ice flow direction, and occurrence below the general land-surface level, has led to their unanimous interpretation as landforms of subglacial erosion. Scenarios proposed for mega-groove formation focus on either glacier ice or subglacial meltwater as the principal agent of erosion, yet none offers a comprehensive explanation. At locations where mega-grooves occur along lines of structural geology, their location, formation and morphology were largely controlled by the bedrock characteristics. Where no underlying structural control is apparent, mega-grooves were likely initiated through glacial abrasion, and subsequently modified through a range of erosional processes, potentially involving multiple morphogenetic agencies and feedbacks operating between bedrock topography and basal ice flow. In the absence of absolute dates, morphostratigraphic analyses suggest mega-groove survival through multiple glacial cycles. No specific ice-flow characteristics have been identified as a condition for bedrock grooving, but it has been suggested that some bedrock mega-grooves are related to ice streaming, which deserves further study. An initial analysis of bedrock grooves with seemingly similar morphology at a range of scales hints at a bedrock – groove landform size continuum, which could be a useful framework for exploring process - landform relationships. Future research could usefully focus on quantitative analysis of mega-groove morphology, augmented with detailed field analysis of landform relationships to bedrock structure and lithology, and thereby potentially provide further insight into the age and glaciological significance of these landforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3aglaciers 3aice 3alandscapes 3aquantitative analysis 3asnowmelt 3atopography 0aMega-groove 0aGlacial erosion 0aBedrock geology 0aLandform size continuum 0aMeltwater1 aEvans, David J.A.1 aRoberts, David H.1 aStokes, Chris R.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Oct., v. 185 p.57-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245006500163300002000228520156400248592002801812650002101840650002101861650003601882650002401918650001901942650004401961650002102005650001302026650003302039650001302072650001602085650001202101700001902113700001802132700002502150700002602175700002702201700001802228700001602246700002402262773013502286856007502421852000902496655001202505IND60539929220221121222240.0160817e20140903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053992922DNAL7 a10.1021/ja505141j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilinski, Gerard
J.10aStitched α-Helical Peptides via Bis Ring-Closing Metathesis  ap. 12314-12322.  aConformationally stabilized α-helical peptides are capable of inhibiting disease-relevant intracellular or extracellular protein–protein interactions in vivo. We have previously reported that the employment of ring-closing metathesis to introduce a single all-hydrocarbon staple along one face of an α-helical peptide greatly increases α-helical content, binding affinity to a target protein, cell penetration through active transport, and resistance to proteolytic degradation. In an effort to improve upon this technology for stabilizing a peptide in a bioactive α-helical conformation, we report the discovery of an efficient and selective bis ring-closing metathesis reaction leading to peptides bearing multiple contiguous staples connected by a central spiro ring junction. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, NMR, and computational analyses have been used to investigate the conformation of these “stitched” peptides, which are shown to exhibit remarkable thermal stabilities. Likewise, trypsin proteolysis assays confirm the achievement of a structural rigidity unmatched by peptides bearing a single staple. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal microscopy assays demonstrate that stitched peptides display superior cell penetrating ability compared to their stapled counterparts, suggesting that this technology may be useful not only in the context of enhancing the drug-like properties of α-helical peptides but also in producing potent agents for the intracellular delivery of proteins and oligonucleotides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive transport 3abinding capacity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aconfocal microscopy 3aflow cytometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligonucleotides 3apeptides 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3atrypsin1 aKim, Young-Woo1 aHong, Jooyeon1 aKutchukian, Peter

However, their geological evolution is only poorly constrained due to restricted exposure of the Precambrian rocks, which were extensively overprinted mainly by Paleozoic tectonic, metamorphic and magmatic events. In the present study, in situ zircon U–Pb age and Hf isotopic data of 64 Paleozoic and early Mesozoic (from 499 to 217 Ma) as well as 14 Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic (from 1555 to 871 Ma) granitic samples from four major arc terranes of the Beishan orogen (southernmost CAOB) were compiled in order to assess the nature of their crustal basement as well as the subsequent Paleozoic tectonic evolution. Zircon εHf(t) values and calculated Hf model ages are similar for all arc terranes with Hf model age peaks at approximately 1.0–0.8 Ga and 2.0–1.8 Ga. We suggest that all of these Paleozoic arc terranes formed on a single, uniform Precambrian continental terrane. Furthermore, this continental terrane shows typical characteristics of Mesoproterozoic (~1.4 Ga) juvenile crustal growth, which may have been part of an extensive Mesoproterozoic continental terrane, now tectonically fragmented and located over a distance of more than a thousand kilometers in the southern CAOB. Among the cratons bordering the CAOB, Baltica displays most similarities with this continental terrane, while a Mesoproterozoic correlation with the Tarim Craton is rather questionable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesoproterozoic era 3aMesozoic era 3aNeoproterozoic era 3aPaleozoic era 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3arocks 3atectonics 3azircon 3aChina 0aZircon Hf–O isotope 0aMesoproterozoic crustal growth 0aBeishan orogen 0aSouthern Central Asian Orogenic Belt 0aGranitoids1 aKlemd, Reiner1 aYan, Li-Li1 aZhang, Ze-Ming0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Oct., v. 185 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04112naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013700175300001600312520243800328592002802766650001802794650002002812650001902832650001202851650001702863650002102880650001302901650001402914650001502928650001102943650001702954650000902971650002202980650000903002650001603011650001903027650001103046653002303057653002503080653002203105653002303127653002203150653004403172653002903216653002803245700001803273700001803291700002003309700001703329773010303346856008803449852000903537655001203546IND60654320520221118230250.0200628e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065432052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzanti, Eduardo10aDiagenetic control on mineralogical suites in sand, silt, and mud (Cenozoic Nile Delta): Implications for provenance reconstructions  ap. 122-139.  aThis Nile Delta case study provides quantitative information on a process that we must understand and consider in full before attempting provenance interpretation of ancient clastic wedges. Petrographic and heavy-mineral data on partly lithified sand, silt, and mud samples cored from the up to 8.5 km-thick post-Eocene succession of the offshore Nile Delta document systematic unidirectional trends. With increasing age and burial depth, quartz increases at the expense of feldspars and especially of mafic volcanic rock fragments. Heavy-mineral concentration decreases drastically, transparent heavy minerals represent progressively lower percentages of the heavy fraction, and zircon, tourmaline, rutile, apatite, monazite, and Cr-spinel relatively increase at the expense mainly of amphibole in Pliocene sediments and of epidote in Miocene sediments. Recent studies have shown that the entire succession of the Nile Delta was deposited by a long drainage system connected with the Ethiopian volcanic highlands similar to the modern Nile since the lower Oligocene. The original mineralogy should thus have resembled that of modern Delta sand much more closely than the present quartzose residue containing only chemically durable heavy minerals. Stratigraphic compositional trends, although controlled by a complex interplay of different factors, document a selective exponential decay of non-durable species through the cored succession that explains up to 95% of the observed mineralogical variability. Our calculations suggest that heavy minerals may not represent >20% of the original assemblage in sediments buried less than ~1.5 km, >5% in sediments buried between 1.5 and 2.5 km, and >1% for sediments buried >4.5 km. No remarkable difference is detected in the intensity of mineral dissolution in mud, silt, and sand samples, which argues against the widely held idea that unstable minerals are prone to be preserved better in finer-grained and therefore presumably less permeable layers. Intrastratal dissolution, acting through long periods of time at the progressively higher temperatures reached during burial, can modify very drastically the relative abundance of detrital components in sedimentary rocks. Failure to recognize such a fundamental diagenetic bias leads to grossly mistaken paleogeographic reconstructions, as documented paradigmatically by previous provenance studies of ancient Nile sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3aapatite 3acase studies 3adrainage systems 3afeldspar 3ahighlands 3aprovenance 3aquartz 3ariver deltas 3asand 3asedimentary rocks 3asilt 3atemperature 3avolcanic rocks 3azircon 0aNile paleodrainage 0aStratigraphic trends 0aBurial diagenesis 0aGrain-size control 0aQuartz durability 0aTransparent-heavy-mineral concentration 0aIntrastratal dissolution 0aDiagenetic minerofacies1 aAndò, Sergio1 aLimonta, Mara1 aFielding, Laura1 aNajman, Yani0 tEarth-science reviews.g2018 Oct., v. 185 p.122-139dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03753naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010900167500001900276520227000295592002802565650004102593650001402634650002802648650001802676650001502694650001402709650001802723650001402741650001402755650002402769650001802793650002302811650002202834700001902856700002302875700002402898700002302922700001602945700002502961700002102986700002303007700001503030773013603045856008103181852000903262655001203271IND60698175320221119164615.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069817532DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200015732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ding Ding10aTea Flavonoids and Risk of Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is increasing evidence that both black and green tea are beneficial for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of tea flavonoids on cardiovascular (CVD) and all-cause mortality outcomes.Searches across five databases including PubMed and Embase were conducted through November 2018 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies reporting cardiovascular and all-cause mortality outcomes. Two investigators independently conducted abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias (ROB) assessments using the Nutrition Evidence Library Bias Assessment Tool (NEL BAT). Mixed-effects dose-response meta-regression and standard random-effects meta-analyses for outcomes with ≥ 4 studies were performed. 0 RCTs and 38 prospective cohort studies were included in the systematic review. NEL BAT scores ranged from 0–15 (0 being the lowest risk). Our linear meta-regression model showed that each cup increase in daily tea consumption (about 280 mg and 338 mg of total flavonoids for black and green tea, respectively) was associated with 3–4% lower risk of CVD mortality (predicted adjusted RR = 0.96; CI 0.93–0.99 for green tea and RR = 0.97; CI 0.94–0.99 for black tea). Furthermore, eachcup increase in daily tea consumption was associated a 2% lower risk of all-cause mortality (predicted adjusted relative risk (RR) = 0.98; 95% CI 0.97–0.99 for black tea and RR = 0.98; CI 0.96–0.99 for green tea, respectively). Two studies reported multivariable Cox regression analysis results for the relationship between black tea intake and risks of all-cause mortality outcomes. The results from these two studies were combined with our linear meta-regression result in a random-effects model meta-analysis and showed that each cup increase in daily black tea consumption was associated with an average of 3% lower risk of all-cause mortality (pooled adjusted RR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.87- 1.00) with large heterogeneity (I² = 81.4%; p = 0.005). Current evidence indicates that increased tea consumption may reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in a dose-response manner.

The presence of children has been shown to modify adult dietary practices and daily timing of eating occasions, and that the arrival of a child in the household is perceived by parents to be related to changes in their dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, no epidemiological study has evaluated the impact by a longitudinal approach. The objective of our study was to assess the effect of the birth of a first child in a household on dietary intake and weight of adults over a 7-year follow-up period. This study was conducted in 3955 adults included in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study between 2009 and 2010. At baseline and every year, dietary intakes were assessed using 24 h records. In this sample, 185 individuals experienced the birth of a first child in their household during the 7 years of follow-up. Changes in weight, assessed by self-administered questionnaire each year, were analyzed only in women (n = 115). Repeated measures of dietary intake and weight were analysed using mixed models adjusted for sex, age, education level and energy with random effects of time and period (before and after birth of the child) to assess changes following the life event. The birth of a first child in the household was associated with a decrease in the score of adherence to French recommendations (PNNS score, β [95% CI] = -0.45 [-0.74; -0.16]), in intakes of fruits and vegetables, meat and processed meat, and vitamin C (respectively, β = -0.30 [-0.43; -0.17]); β = -0.20 [-0.32; -0.17]); β = -0.54 [0.88; -0.19])). The birth of a first child in the household was also associated with an increase in intakes of saturated fatty acids and sodium (respectively, β = 1.49 [0.51, 2.45]); β = 0.31 [0.20; 0.43])). The birth of a first child was associated with weight gain in women (β = 1.70 [1.07, 2.33]). Our study has shown that the birth of a first child in the household was associated with rather unhealthy dietary changes. These results could be used to guide public health interventions by focusing on this specific life transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aascorbic acid 3achildren 3acohort studies 3aeducational status 3aenergy 3afood intake 3aparenting 3aprocessed meat 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3asodium 3aweight gain1 aRollet, Pascaline1 aHassen, Wendy Si1 aTichit, Christine1 aLampuré, Aurélie1 aHercberg, Serge1 aTouvier, Mathilde1 aCastetbon, Katia0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

In contrast, engineering mononuclear nonheme iron enzymes is lagging, even though these enzymes belong to a large class that catalyzes quite diverse reactions. Herein we report spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies of Fe(II)-M121E azurin (Az), by replacing the axial Met121 and Cu(II) in wild-type azurin (wtAz) with Glu and Fe(II), respectively. In contrast to the redox inactive Fe(II)-wtAz, the Fe(II)-M121EAz mutant can be readily oxidized by Na₂IrCl₆, and interestingly, the protein exhibits superoxide scavenging activity. Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies, along with X-ray structural comparisons, revealed similarities and differences between Fe(II)-M121EAz, Fe(II)-wtAz, and superoxide reductase (SOR) and allowed design of the second generation mutant, Fe(II)-M121EM44KAz, that exhibits increased superoxide scavenging activity by 2 orders of magnitude. This finding demonstrates the importance of noncovalent secondary coordination sphere interactions in fine-tuning enzymatic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3acopper 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aengineering 3aenzyme activity 3aheme 3airon 3amutants 3asuperoxide reductase1 aMeier, Katlyn

It is plausible a range of exposures in early life may be involved in this predisposition, which may extend to “healthy” populations in Western populations. We examined the association between a number of early life factors with the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, in early adulthood of a healthy German population. We studied term participants (n = 265) of the DONALD Study, with a bilateral sonographic measurement of the IMT in young adulthood (18–40 years) and data on early life factors (maternal and paternal age at child birth, birth weight (including appropriateness of birth weight- for gestational age), gestational weight gain and full breastfeeding (breastfeeding > 17weeks). Sonographic IMT measurements were performed on the left and right common carotid artery using a minimum of 4 measurements. Mean IMT values were obtained averaging the measurements from both sides, an overall average obtained from 8 and 16 measurement of both sides was used for this analysis. Information on gestation and birth were abstracted from the “Mutterpass”, maternal and paternal age at birth were inquired at study entry and breastfeeding information was assessed prospectively. Prospective association between early life factors and IMT were analyzed using multivariable linear regression models, considering age at IMT measurement, physician taking the measurement, in addition: birth year, first born status, maternal and paternal educational status, maternal overweight, presence of smokers in the household tested for potential confounding. Mean adult IMT was 0.56mm ± 0.03, range: 0.41mm-0.78 mm. Maternal age at child birth was of prospective relevance for IMT in young adulthood, however, this association was sex specific: Increased maternal age at child birth was independently associated with an increased IMT among female offspring during young adulthood (β 0.029, SE 0.009) mm/decade, P = 0.003) only, this was not mediated by adult waist circumference. None of the remaining early life factors showed relevance for adult IMT levels among males and females in early adulthood. This study suggests that advanced maternal age at child birth is of prospective relevance for IMT levels in younger adulthood in a healthy Western population. This association appears to be sex specific, with maternal age at child birth positively associated with IMT in females in early adulthood only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3aatherosclerosis 3abirth weight 3abreast feeding 3acarotid arteries 3achildbirth 3aeducational status 3afemales 3agestational age 3aoverweight 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3awaist circumference 3aweight gain 3ayoung adults1 aPenczynski, Katharina1 aRemer, Thomas1 aBuyken, Anette0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

In particular, it is proposed that protonation of (OC)₃Fe(pdt)Ni(dppe) (1; pdt²– = –S(CH₂)₃S–; dppe = Ph₂P(CH₂)₂PPh₂) occurs at the Fe site of the two-electron mixed-valence Fe(0)Ni(II) species, not the Fe(I)-Ni(I) bond for the homovalence isomer of 1. The new pathway, which may have implications for protonation of other complexes and clusters, was uncovered through studies on the homologous series L(OC)₂Fe(pdt)M(dppe), where M = Ni, Pd (2), and Pt (3) and L = CO, PCy₃. Similar to 1, complexes 2 and 3 undergo both protonation and 1e– oxidation to afford well-characterized hydrides ([2H]⁺ and [3H]⁺) and mixed-valence derivatives ([2]⁺ and [3]⁺), respectively. Whereas the Pd site is tetrahedral in 2, the Pt site is square-planar in 3, indicating that this complex is best described as Fe(0)Pt(II). In view of the results on 2 and 3, the potential energy surface of 1 was reinvestigated with density functional theory. These calculations revealed the existence of an energetically accessible and more basic Fe(0)Ni(II) isomer with a square-planar Ni site.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenergy 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3ahydrides 3airon 3aisomerization 3aisomers 3amethodology 3amodels 3anickel 3aoxidation1 aSchilter, David1 aHammes-Schiffer, Sharon1 aRauchfuss, Thomas B.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 03, v. 136, no. 35 p.12385-12395dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja505783z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166500001900272520241800291592002802709650001302737650002002750650001502770650002402785650002802809650002702837650001202864650002002876650001702896650001202913650002002925650002502945650001702970650002602987651001303013700002903026700001803055700002203073700002103095700002003116700002303136700001903159700001803178700001803196700003303214773013603247856008103383852000903464655001203473IND60698176620221122221502.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069817662DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200017062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorreia, Flora10aBMI, waist-to-height ratio and body fat mass in older adults: results from the Pronutrisenior project  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNear 20% of the Portuguese population is aged 65 years or above, a value similar to most developed countries. This older adult population also suffers from obesity and obesity-related pathologies. The environment encompasses a set of obesity determinants and knowing the associations between the environment and obesity may help health professionals and caregivers to provide for the older adults. In this study, we aimed to relate anthropometric measures with socio-demographic data in older adults. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Pronutrisenior project, collected in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal. The sample consists of 456 older adults, aged 65 to 92 years without cognitive impairment. The sample consisted of older adults living at their homes. Socio-demographic, clinical, geographical, and anthropometric data was collected. The statistical analysis used IBM-SPSS-22.0 and consisted on descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations and UniANOVA. Significantly results (p < 0.05) are reported. These older adults were mostly females (54.2%) with a mean age of 73.8 years (sd = 6.3), mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.1kg/m² (sd = 4.8), mean waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) of 0.623 (sd = 0.073) and mean percentage of body fat mass (%BFM) of 40.7% (sd = 8.9%) for females and 30.2% (sd = 8.5%) for males. BMI, WHtR and %BFM were positively correlated. In this sample of older adults, higher values of these measures were associated to being female, younger, less educated; to having articular pains and respiratory problems, and not having insomnia, hypertension, chewing problems nor hearing problems; to drink more liquids but not consuming dairy products daily; to not take nutritional supplements but to take more medicines; to be without somebody to talk to and to be more dependent; and to live in a house without stairs to climb and to live near other older adults, and in a more urbanized area with streets with steeper slopes. In this sample of older adults, obesity is related with health characteristics and those are related with socio-demographic and geographical characteristics of the area of residence. Besides the identification of risk factors for the older adult population, this information may help designing health care policies that takes in consideration the physical and geographical characteristics of the neighbourhood of the area of residence of the older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3acaregivers 3acognitive disorders 3across-sectional studies 3adescriptive statistics 3afemales 3ahealth services 3ahypertension 3aobesity 3asleep disorders 3astatistical analysis 3aurbanization 3awaist-to-height ratio 3aPortugal1 aOliveira, Bruno M.

None have evaluated potential mediating mechanisms.To evaluate associations between (1) UNGD and antenatal anxiety and depression and (2) antenatal anxiety and depression and preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and reduced term birth weight, (3) stochastic direct and indirect effects of UNGD on preterm birth and term birth weight operating through antenatal anxiety and depression, and (4) effect modification by family-level socioeconomic status.This retrospective cohort study included mothers without prevalent anxiety or depression at time of conception, who delivered at Geisinger in Pennsylvania between January 2009–January 2013. We assembled phase-specific UNGD activity data from public sources. Mothers were categorized as exposed (quartile 4) or unexposed (quartiles 1–3) based on average daily inverse distance-squared UNGD activity metric between conception and the week prior to anxiety or depression (cases) or the pregnancy-average daily metric (non-cases). We estimated associations with a doubly robust estimator (targeted minimum loss-based estimation) and adjusted for potential individual- and community-level confounding variables.Analyses included 8,371 births to 7,715 mothers, 12.2% of whom had antenatal anxiety or depression. We found 4.3 additional cases of antenatal anxiety or depression per 100 women (95% CI: 1.5, 7.0) under the scenario where all mothers lived in the highest quartile of UNGD activity versus quartiles 1–3. The risk difference appeared larger among mothers receiving Medical Assistance (indicator of low family income) compared to those who did not, 5.6 (95% CI: 0.5, 10.6) versus 2.9 (95% CI: -0.7, 6.5) additional cases of antenatal anxiety or depression per 100 women. We found no relationship between antenatal anxiety or depression and adverse birth outcomes and no mediation effect either overall or when stratifying by Medical Assistance.We observed a relationship between UNGD activity and antenatal anxiety and depression, which did not mediate the overall association between UNGD activity and adverse birth outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanxiety 3abirth weight 3acohort studies 3aconception 3ahousehold income 3amothers 3anatural gas 3apregnancy 3apregnancy complications 3apremature birth 3arisk 3awomen 3aPennsylvania 0aHydraulic fracking 0aMaternal health 0aAnxiety 0aDepressive disorder 0aSocial class1 aGoin, Dana E.1 aRudolph, Kara E.1 aSchwartz, Brian S.1 aMercer, Dione1 aElser, Holly1 aEisen, Ellen A.1 aMorello-Frosch, Rachel0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Oct., v. 177 p.108598-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1085983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013200166500001900298520250600317592002802823650002002851650001602871650001102887650001902898650002102917650001802938650001402956650001702970650000902987650001202996650002303008650001603031700003203047700002103079773013603100856008103236852000903317655001203326IND60698177120221122224658.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069817712DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200017552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuxton, Carrie10aDaily consumption of 100% orange juice does not increase body weight in adults: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is convincing evidence that sugar-sweetened beverages increase the risk of body weight (BW) gain and higher body mass index. In contrast, observational studies on regular consumption of 100% fruit juice provide conflicting results, with most indicating a neutral impact on BW and body mass index, while others suggest positive or even inverse associations. The lack of agreement may be due to confounding factors, or studies incorrectly grouping sugar-sweetened juice drinks with 100% fruit juice, which by law does not contain added sugars. Intervention studies provide an opportunity to investigate the short-to-medium term impact of daily 100% orange juice (OJ) on BW. From 17 available studies (none of which individually reported statistically significant BW gain following OJ consumption), 6 randomised controlled trials in adults (n = 236) were selected for a meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were an OJ intervention group and a non-OJ control group. Comparison with a control group was essential as some were weight loss studies with additional BW loss components, and for consistency this comparison between groups was used for all studies. The meta-analysis focussed on the differences in BW change between OJ and control arms of each study. Where the standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) of the change was not reported and could not be obtained from the authors, it was imputed by using the mean SD from studies where it was available. The combined effect estimate was obtained from a random effects model using the DerSimonian-Laird estimator. Cochran's Q statistic was used to test for study heterogeneity. The resulting forest plot revealed no statistically significant change in BW following OJ intakes of 250–500 ml per day for 4 to 12 weeks (which would theoretically provide 102–205 kcal on average). The Q statistic was 10.6 (I² = 53%, p = 0.059) while the combined effect estimate was -0.34 kg (95% CI -1.11, 0.43). Interestingly, a similar finding was noted in a meta-analysis (Onakpoya et al. 2017) investigating BW change and daily grapefruit juice consumption from 3 intervention studies (n = 233); mean difference -0.45 kg [95% CI:-1.06 to 0.16; I² = 53%]. In conclusion, daily consumption of OJ does not appear to have an adverse impact on BW. This may be due to dietary energy compensation (conscious or unconscious) or a satiety effect linked with the low glycemic index of OJ (GI = 50). Onakpoya I et al.

Obesity and overweight are public health problems and need to be addressed from a community perspective. The reason for exploring this problem in this study was that South Africa has one of the highest rates of overweight and obesity in the world among urban and rural black women. The objective was to investigate the eating and lifestyle habits of overweight and obese female teenagers in Thulamela Local Municipality, Limpopo province, South Africa. This was an exploratory, descriptive study conducted amongst 125 female teenagers aged 13 to 18 years from rural schools in Thulamela Local Municipality. Eating and lifestyle habits, physical activity, meaning of healthy and unhealthy dietary habits, weight, height and body mass index were measured. A hundred and twenty-five questionnaires were completed and data were gathered on the demographics, anthropometry, social and lifestyle habits, nutrition-related problems, dietary patterns and dietary history of the participants. The BMI revealed that 34.4% were of normal weight, 39.2% overweight and 26.4 obese. Seventy percent of the respondents actively consumed meals in a day, 83% consumed starchy snacks, whilst 72% of the respondents carried lunchboxes to school. Regarding lifestyle habits, 88% of the respondents slept more hours than recommended (8 hours) while 88% performed sedentary activities and 66% did physical activities such as walking.

Oxidative addition to the bis-pyridine Au(I) cation, [Au(4-DMAP)₂]⁺, using a series of dicationic I(III) oxidants of the general form [PhI(L)₂]²⁺ (L = pyridine, 4-DMAP, 4-cyanopyridine) allows ready access to homoleptic and pseudo-homoleptic Au(III) complexes [Au(4-DMAP)₂(L)₂]³⁺. The facile oxidative addition of Au(I) species additionally demonstrates the efficacy of PhI(L)₂]²⁺ reagents as halide-free oxidants for Au(I). Comparisons are made via attempts to oxidize NHC-Au(I)Cl, where introduction of the chloride anion results in complex mixtures via ligand and chloride exchange, demonstrating the advantage of using the pyridine-based homoleptic compounds. The new Au(III) trications show intriguing reactivity with water, yielding dinuclear oxo-bridged and rare terminal Au(III)−OH complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3achlorides 3agold 3aligands 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apyridines1 aPell, Thomas P.1 aStringer, Bradley D.1 aHogan, Conor

Instead, triangular boron lattices with hexagonal vacancies have been predicted to be stable. A recent experimental and computational study showed that the B₃₆ cluster has a planar C₆ᵥ structure with a central hexagonal hole, providing the first experimental evidence for the viability of atom-thin boron sheets with hexagonal vacancies, dubbed borophene. Here we report a boron cluster with a double-hexagonal vacancy as a new and more flexible structural motif for borophene. Photoelectron spectrum of B₃₅– displays a simple pattern with certain similarity to that of B₃₆–. Global minimum searches find that both B₃₅– and B₃₅ possess planar hexagonal structures, similar to that of B₃₆, except a missing interior B atom that creates a double-hexagonal vacancy. The closed-shell B₃₅– is found to exhibit triple π aromaticity with 11 delocalized π bonds, analogous to benzo(g,h,i)perylene (C₂₂H₁₂). The B₃₅ cluster can be used to build atom-thin boron sheets with various hexagonal hole densities, providing further experimental evidence for the viability of borophene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3aviability1 aChen, Qiang1 aTian, Wen-Juan1 aBai, Hui1 aZhao, Ya-Fan1 aHu, Han-Shi1 aLi, Jun1 aZhai, Hua-Jin1 aLi, Si-Dian1 aWang, Lai-Sheng0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 03, v. 136, no. 35 p.12257-12260dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja507235s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010700169500001900276520250500295592002802800650002502828650002502853650001702878650002002895650001602915650001402931650001302945650001502958650004702973650001603020650002103036650001103057650002303068650001903091650002103110650001603131650002503147650001603172700001903188700002503207700002003232700002003252773013603272856008103408852000903489655001203498IND60698178420221121100804.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069817842DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200018832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiović, Nikolina10aStability of blueberry polyphenols subjected to in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBlueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum, L.) are a valuable source of health-promoting bioactive compounds, particularly polyphenols. The beneficial effects of polyphenols on health depend not only on food sources but also on their stability, which can vary depending on the post-harvest processing methods, the matrix in which they are incorporated, and endogenous factors such as microbiota and digestive enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of high-intensity ultrasound treatment on in vitro gastrointestinal stability of the total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of blueberries. Blueberry puree was treated with high-intensity ultrasound using different amplitudes (30, 45 and 60μm) and treatment times (3, 6 and 9 min), and a part of sample was used as a control (untreated sample). Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity (by DPPH and FRAP methods) were determined prior to and after two-phase in vitro digestion process (gastric and duodenal) using human gastrointestinal enzymes. The results showed a high stability of total blueberry polyphenols and antioxidant activity during simulated gastric digestion step, both in untreated and ultrasound treated samples. The use of high-intensity ultrasound had a significant effect on the stability of polyphenols and their antioxidant activity after simulated digestion in duodenum. Significant increase in polyphenol content after duodenal digestion step was determined in three ultrasound treated samples with longer treatment time (6 and 9 minutes), and only sample with significant reduction of TPC was untreated sample. Modification of the food matrix as a result of cavitation from ultrasound treatment may be the reason for higher stability of polyphenol during in vitro digestion. After in vitro digestion blueberry polyphenols still possessed antioxidant activity that may be directly related to their beneficial effects on health. The highest antioxidant activity measured with DPPH and FRAP method was determined for sample treated with maximum amplitude (60μm) and longest time (9 minutes). Determination of the stability of phenolic compounds is important as it affects their bioavailability for uptake as well as their possible beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial tissue such as reduction of oxidative stress and cancer prevention. Our results showed that ultrasound treatment can preserve the blueberry phenolics and their antioxidant characteristics after in vitro digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3ablueberries 3adigestion 3aduodenum 3aepithelium 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3afood matrix 3ahealth promotion 3ahumans 3ain vitro digestion 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aBilušić, Tea1 aRežek Jambrak, Anet1 aKrešić, Greta1 aMarkić, Joško0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

This reaction proceeds through the formation of an “ortho ester” intermediate via oxidation of 1,3-diol benzylidene acetal by dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) and the subsequent proton transfer catalyzed by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). The mechanism and origins of enantioselectivity of this reaction are identified using DFT calculations. The oxidation by DMDO is rate-determining, and the phosphoric acid significantly accelerates the proton transfer; the attractive interactions between the benzylidene part of the substrate and the 2,4,6-triisopropyl group of CPA are the key to high enantioselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenantiomers 3aoxidation 3aphosphoric acid 3astandard operating procedures1 aLiang, Yong1 aCao, Kou-Sen1 aZou, Lufeng1 aLin, Xing-Bang1 aYang, Hui1 aHouk, K.

The approach relies on perdeuteration, amide ²H/¹H exchange, high magnetic fields, and high-spinning frequencies (ωᵣ/2π ≥ 60 kHz) and yields high-quality NMR data, enabling the use of automated analysis. The method is validated with five examples of proteins in different condensed states, including two microcrystalline proteins, a sedimented virus capsid, and two membrane-embedded systems. In comparison to contemporary ¹³C/¹⁵N-based methods, this approach facilitates and accelerates the MAS NMR assignment process, shortening the spectral acquisition times and enabling the use of unsupervised state-of-the-art computational data analysis protocols originally developed for solution NMR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acapsid 3amagnetic fields 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3astandard operating procedures 3aviruses1 aPell, Andrew J.1 aRetel, Joren S.1 aAndreas, Loren B.1 aJaudzems, Kristaps1 aFranks, W.

All samples were detected for the total concentrations of six heavy metals. Available factions and main soil properties were also analyzed. The results showed that Cd, Ni, Pb and Zn in both soil had moderate accumulation and these elements in corresponding grains exceeded their standard values to some extent. Most of these metals had higher concentrations in the eastern and central regions in both crop grains and the corresponding soils, which were related to the strong human activities in this region. In particular, the distribution of Cd in both soils and crops exhibited the most significant spatial correlation, whereas Cr had opposite trends. These elements in wheat and rice grains was related to different influencing factors and varied with different heavy metals. Cross-correlograms further quantitated the spatial influencing factors of elements in soils and various organs on crop gains. Cd prediction models for rice and wheat grains were stimulated based on nonedible organs and soil properties with a maximum r2 of 0.748.

Experiments repeated over space and time revealed significant positive effects of Zoanthidea colonization on metrics of host condition and indicated that the outcome of these symbioses can shift from mutualism to parasitism when transplanted to novel habitats. Although the precise mechanisms of the symbioses remain obscured and most of the species associations have not been examined, these experiments demonstrate an example where relationship outcomes are more conserved across their evolutionary history than host associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoral reefs 3ahosts 3amutualism 3aparasitism 3aspace and time 3asymbionts0 tMarine biology.g2012 July, v. 159, no. 7 p.1429-1438dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-1919-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006800173500001900241520186200260592002802122650002802150650002102178650002002199650002302219650002402242650002302266650001202289650002202301650002402323650002302347650001602370700001802386773013602404856008102540852000902621655001202630IND60698180320221122224629.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069818032DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200020742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBebnowicz, Aleksandra10aAssessment of nutritional status of selected military personnel  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProblem of overweight and obesity is more and more common in nowadays. Prevalence of overweight and obesity could have long-range consequences in case of organisation where good health and physical efficiency are requested for personnel to perform their professional roles effectively. Many times soldiers need to maintain very high levels of physical activity to perform their duties and to complete demanding missions, which have a huge physical exertion. Because of that soldiers should stay in an excellent health and stamina. A total of 355 men soldiers from units with diverse specialisation underwent the examination. The most common criterions to estimate abdominal obesity are waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio. The evaluation was based on determination of body composition measuring fat tissue percentage and antrophometric indexes: weight, height, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference (WC). Soldiers were classified to abdominal obesity according to WHR (WHR > 1) and WC (WC > 94). The amount of fat tissue was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Soldiers were aged 34,56 ± 7,07 years. Median weight and height were respectively 86,04 ± 11,92 kg and 179,14 ± 6,02 cm. 160 soldiers (45%) had a waist circumference higher than 94 cm. The waist-to-hip ratio was higher than 1 for 19% of soldiers. Conducted bioelectrical impedance analysis showed that for 46% of soldiers percentage of fat tissue exceeded 20%. The results showed that the problem of overweight and obesity exists also in military populations. In many cases it is connected with incorrect nutritional behaviours. Soldiers require more proactive approach, because the potentially deleterious health outcomes connected with weight gain may have a negative influence on their work. The biggest effort should be put on a proper nutritional education.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody composition 3ahuman resources 3amilitary personnel 3anutrition education 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3awaist circumference 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3aweight gain1 aNowosad, Adam0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Recently, obesity or HFD induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) could promote alteration of iron metabolism. Disorder of iron metabolism have been linked to unnormal metabolism of glucose and lipid. Herein, we investigated the effect of impaired iron homeostasis on hepatic IR, focusing on ferritinophagy. Male C57/6J mice were administered with HFD (60% energy from fat) or LFD (10% energy from fat) for 10 weeks (n = 10), and Palmitic acid (PA)-insulin treated HepG2 cells were also established. Hepatic IR as evidenced by increased hepatic steatosis and decreased of p-AKT (48%, p < 0.0005), p-GSK-3β (34%, p < 0.05) in the liver of HFD mice. In addition, decreased iron level and expression NCOA4, as well as increased up-regulation of IRE1α and EIF2α were observed in HFD liver. By using desferrioxamine (DFO) and ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), we examined iron level on IRE1α and EIF2α. And glucose uptake assay shown that FAC supplementation, and ERS inhibitors of 4-PBA and STF could improve the glucose uptake of HepG2 cells in the presence of PA. Furthermore, we evaluated the glucose uptake of HepG2 cells incubated with adenovirus which mediated overexpression of NCOA4, FAC, 4-PBA (ERS inhibitor) or STF (IRE1 inhibitor). Taken together, deficiency of iron induced by impaired ferritinophagy induced hepatic IR, partly by aggravating hepatic ERS, especially IRE1 signal pathway in vivo and vitro. These findings provide evidence and new insight for therapeutic strategy of iron deficiency in NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aammonium 3acitrates 3adeferoxamine 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aenergy 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3airon 3airon absorption 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3apalmitic acid 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Shanshan1 aZeng, Hongmei1 aLiu, Jingjing1 aLi, Dan1 aChen, Li1 aGao, Chao1 aYao, Ping0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Therefore, quantifying and controlling the influence of water in activity, selectivity, and catalyst deactivation is essential for advancing this technology. Here, we report a kinetic study of the cyclopentanone self-condensation over functionalized MCM-41 catalysts with varying acid densities and in the presence of controlled amounts of water. It is observed that small amounts of water enhance the activity of these catalysts. A detailed analysis of the experimental data indicates that the rate limiting step is the enol formed via protonation and tautomerization of a cyclopentanone molecule attacks the electrophilic carbon of a second carbonyl. On catalyst with high density of sulfonic acid groups, the best fitting of the experimental data is obtained with a kinetic model in which the CC bond forming step mostly occurs with the second carbonyl molecule adsorbed (and polarized) by an adjacent acid site (Langmuir-Hinshelwood, L-H). By contrast, at a lower density of sulfonic acid groups, the number of active sites with enough proximity greatly decreases and the CC bond forming occurs with the second carbonyl in the liquid phase (Eley-Rideal, E-R). In this case, it is observed that when water is added to the reaction mixture, the best description of the kinetics switches from E-R to L-H. Evidently, the water can help bridging active sites remotely located on the surface, extending the polarizing effect of the second acid site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aactive sites 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenols 3akinetics 3aliquids 3aprotonation 3asulfonic acids 3atautomerization 0aAldol condensation 0aCyclopentanone 0aFunctionalization 0aWater 0aAcid catalyst1 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8246-14221 aChen, Banghao1 aResasco, Daniel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5342-06210 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Sept., v. 377 p.245-254dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163500001900274520255200293592002802845650002202873650002102895650001402916650001702930650002502947650002402972650001602996650001403012650002203026650001803048650001603066650001203082650002303094650003003117650001003147650002103157650001603178650003103194650001203225650002003237650001503257650002203272650001003294650001103304700001703315700001503332700001703347700001403364773013603378856008103514852000903595655001203604IND60698180720221122214050.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069818072DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200021162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMengdai, Xu10aYeast beta-Glucan effects on gut microbiota for regulating insulin signaling system on alzheimer's disease  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for dementia in adults. The main pathological alterations are extracellular senile plaque deposits, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal apoptosis. Recent researches indicated that T2D is closely with AD by insulin resistance in central nerves system progression. Nevertheless, the pathological mechanism remains unclear and treatment is limited. β-glucan extracted from yeast, as a dietary fiber with high bioactivity, edible, good taste and easy-obtainable, have been showed abilities such as anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. Based on this, β-glucan can reduce insulin resistance and maintain gut microbiota thereby alleviating lesions of early AD. In this study, we used 36 male wild-type C57BL/6J mice were divided to 3 groups (control (C) mice injected i.c.v. with 0.9% saline as a vehicle, mice injected i.c.v. with Aβ₁–₄₂ (Aβ₁–₄₂ group), mice injected with Aβ₁–₄₂ and soluble yeast β-glucan 100 mg/kg body weight by oral gavage daily (o.g.) for 5 wks (Aβ₁–₄₂ + Glu)). H&E method was detected for structure of hippocampus. Morris water maze test was performed to assess the cognitive performance of Aβ-infusion mice. The microbiota composition was analyzed by 16sRNA sequencing. The levels of inflammatory were measured in hippocampal and plasma by Meso-scale Discovery (MSD). Western blot was performed to detect the level of protein in insulin signaling pathway. One-way ANNOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls was applied for the data analysis through SPSS software version 22.0. As demonstrated by H&E sections, β-glucan reduced neuron damage in AD mice hippocampus. Decreased the levels of Aβ and phosphorylation of Tau protein expression in hippocampus (P < 0.05) and ameliorated insulin resistance (p-IRS-1) in hippocampus (P < 0.05). According by results from MSD and Western-blot that showed TNF-α (P < 0.05), phosphorylated JNK (P < 0.01) and Tau were up-regulated in AD but β-glucan group decreased. In addition, the abundance of beneficial bacteria in β-glucan mice is increased (g_Alistipes, g_Rikeenella and g_Saccharibecteria genera incerae sedies). Summary, this study illustrated that β-glucan regulated insulin signaling for ameliorating learning and memory deficit in AD. Due to β-glucan can not pass Blood-Brain-Barrier, we hypothesized that β-glucan could regulates gut microbiota by metabolites for ameliorating neuron damage. Our study provides new ideas for the prevention of AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abeta-glucans 3abioactive properties 3ablood-brain barrier 3abody weight 3acognition 3acomputer software 3adietary fiber 3ahippocampus 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amales 3amemory disorders 3ametabolites 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aphosphorylation 3aprebiotics 3aprotein synthesis 3ataste 3ayeasts1 aXiaoxing, Mo1 aHao, Huang1 aLiegang, Liu1 aWei, Yang0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Compared to fruits, vegetables are in general less well accepted. Since most of the Finnish 4–6-year-olds attend pre-schools, they are an ideal setting for promoting vegetable consumption. However, early educators in the pre-schools need engaging methods for food education. The aim of this project is to develop a mobile application that can be used in pre-schools to improve vegetable acceptance among pre-schoolers. An additional aim of the application is to increase self-regulation skills, i.e., we aimed to build the application in a way that, instead of immediate reward and impulsivity encourages self-regulation and delayed gratification. We organized workshops in three pre-schools in order to collect ideas and experiences from pre-schoolers and early childhood professionals. Based on the workshops, a Finnish educational game company NordicEdu designed the first version of the prototype. A multi-professional team with expertise in early childhood education and pre-schoolers’ health behaviours commented the prototype, which was then updated and uploaded to application stores. The prototype consisted of two sections: a teacher-led ‘Learn’ section that encourages a group of children to share their knowledge and feelings about vegetables and fruits with each other and mini-games as well as physical exercises that can be played in a group. The application also allows the group to record which vegetables they have tasted. The feasibility of the prototype was tested in the three pre-schools. We collected feedback from the early childhood professionals and children with video-recordings and interviews. Based on the feasibility tests, the children enjoyed using the application and they also gave positive feedback about the visual identity of the application. However, the early childhood professionals thought that the application could be a bit more challenging. Additional contents as well as tasks requiring more self-regulation and patience were also hoped for. In 2019, the prototype will be further developed into a full demo. Additional vegetables will be added to the ‘Learn’ sections and organized into seasons. The application will be accompanied by a teacher's guide containing more information about the vegetables and fruits.

The first-excited singlet state of MMb (¹MMb) undergoes ns-time scale reductive ET quenching by Fe²⁺cyt b₅ as well as ns-time scale oxidative ET quenching by Fe³⁺cyt b₅, both processes involving an ensemble of structures that do not interconvert on this time scale. Despite a large disparity in driving force favoring photooxidation of ¹MMb relative to photoreduction (δ(−ΔG⁰) ≈ 0.4 eV, M = Mg; ≈ 0.2 eV, M = Zn), for each M the average rate constants for the two reactions are the same within error, ¹kf > 10⁸ s–¹. This surprising observation is explained by considering the driving-force dependence of the Franck–Condon factor in the Marcus equation. The triplet state of the myoglobin (³MMb) created by intersystem crossing from ¹MMb likewise undergoes reductive ET quenching by Fe²⁺cyt b₅ as well as oxidative ET quenching by Fe³⁺cyt b₅. As with singlet ET, the rate constants for oxidative ET quenching and reductive ET quenching on the triplet time scale are the same within error, ³kf ≈ 10⁵ s–¹, but here the equivalence is attributable to gating by intracomplex conversion among a conformational ensemble.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aequations 3amagnesium 3amutation 3amyoglobin 3aphotooxidation 3azinc1 aYoung, Ryan M.1 aSmeigh, Amanda L.1 aWasielewski, Michael

Here, a MT gene from Oryza sativa, OsMT2c, was isolated and characterized, encoding a type 2 MT, and observed expression in the roots, leaf sheathes, and leaves, but only weak expression in seeds. OsMT2c was upregulated by copper (Cu) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatments. Excessive Cu elicited a rapid and sustained production and release of H2O2 in rice, and exogenous H2O2 scavengers N,N′-dimethylthiourea (DMTU) and ascorbic acid (Asc) decreased H2O2 production and OsMT2c expression. Furthermore, the expression of OsMT2c increased in the osapx2 mutant in which the H2O2 levels were higher than in wild-type (WT) plants. These results showed that Cu increased MT2c expression through the production and accumulation of Cu-induced H2O2 in O. sativa. In addition, the transgenic OsMT2c-overexpressing Arabidopsis displayed improved tolerance to Cu stress and exhibited increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability compared to WT and empty-vector (Ev) seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3aascorbic acid 3acopper 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3ametallothionein 3amutants 3arice 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astress tolerance 0aAPX 0aAsc 0aCaMV 35s 0aCu 0aCys 0aDAB 0aDMTU 0aEv 0aGFP 0aGUS 0aH2O2 0aMTs 0a4-MUG 0aMV 0aNADPH 0aRT-PCR 0aROS 0aWT 0aCopper stress 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aROS scavenging 0aTransgenic Arabidopsis1 aShi, Xiaoting1 aQian, Meng1 aZheng, Luqing1 aLian, Chunlan1 aXia, Yan1 aShen, Zhenguo0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Aug. 30, v. 294 p.99-108dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.03.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013300169300001400302520151000316592002801826650002401854650002501878650001901903650002201922650002801944650001001972650001801982653002402000653001902024653001902043653001802062700001502080700001402095700001402109700001702123700001702140700001802157700001802175700001602193773009902209856008502308852000902393655001202402IND60604786320221118055000.0180718e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060478632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2015.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingqiu10aAssociation between HLA-Ⅱgene polymorphism and Helicobacter pylori infection in Asian and European population: A meta-analysis  ap. 15-26.  aIt is generally considered that HLA-Ⅱ genes contribute to the Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and disease development process.To perform a meta-analysis to explore the relationship between HLA-Ⅱgene polymorphism and host susceptibility to Hp infection.Relevant cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies were identified by searching Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CBM up to July 2014.

Here we reported the trend in gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations at LABS between April 2006 and December 2016, before the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force in 2017. Previous research indicated nighttime (0–8 am) data collected at LABS are better representative of regional influence. Therefore, only nighttime GEM data were used for trend analysis. A significant decreasing trend in GEM at a rate of −1.5% yr−1 (−0.022 ng m−3 yr−1, p < 0.01) was found, comparable to the decreasing trends observed in Europe, North America, South Africa, and over the North Atlantic Ocean. Five major GEM source regions to the LABS were identified, including northern Indochina Peninsula, China, Northeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and South China Sea. Significant decreasing trends in GEM were found for air masses coming from northern Indochina Peninsula (−0.042 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.6% yr−1, p < 0.01), China (−0.041 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.4% yr−1, p < 0.01), Northeast Asia (−0.031 ng m−3 yr−1, −2.0% yr−1, p < 0.05), and the Pacific Ocean (−0.022 ng m−3 yr−1, −1.7% yr−1, p < 0.05). Decreasing GEM trend (−0.020 ng m−3 yr−1, −1.5% yr−1), but insignificant (p > 0.05), was also found for air masses coming from South China Sea. The decreasing trends observed with air from the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea indicated declining background GEM concentrations in Northern Hemisphere. Decrease in GEM concentrations at the LABS was in agreement with the reduction in atmospheric Hg export from the East Asia continent caused by changes in Hg emission quantity and speciation, and temporal and spatial distribution in emission sources that have been suggested by recent research. Additionally, changes in the frequency distribution of air mass origins and transport paths may also contribute to the changes in GEM concentrations at LABS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adata collection 3afrequency distribution 3amercury 3atemporal variation 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aChina 3aEurope 3aIndochina 3aNorth America 3aPacific Ocean 3aSouth Africa 3aSouth China Sea 3aTaiwan 0aAtmospheric mercury 0aTrend 0aMountain 0aExport 0aEast Asia1 aSheu, Guey-Rong1 aLin, Da-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1203-00901 aLin, Neng-Huei0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 686 p.1049-1056dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009300180300001400273520170800287592002801995650002602023650002102049650001602070650002002086650003802106650001702144650001002161650001402171650004802185650001402233650001402247650001402261650001302275650003002288650001702318650001502335650001402350653002602364653001702390653000902407653000902416653001602425653001102441700001902452700003102471700002802502700002502530700001702555700001602572700002302588700001802611700003502629773010002664856008502764852000902849655001202858IND60604786520221118055034.0180718e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060478652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2015.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImani Fooladi, Abbas Ali14aThe distribution of pathogenic and toxigenic genes among MRSA and MSSA clinical isolates  ap. 60-66.  aStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is considered as a notorious nosocomial pathogen among hospitalized patients and community-dwelling subjects. Its increasing morbidity and mortality is believed to be due to antibiotic resistance. However, the data concerning molecular properties of infecting strains are few.In this study, a total of 192 S. aureus strains, including 88 (45.8%) meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and 104 (54.2%) meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were recovered from clinical samples. The prevalence of subtypes containing staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SSCmec), staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) and exfoliative toxin was assessed by PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern and vancomycin resistance of each isolate were evaluated by disk diffusion method and micro-dilution method, respectively.9 (2.3%) strains required MIC > 2 mg/l of vancomycin, which significantly increased among multi drug resistant (MDR), MRSA and SCCmec type III strains (p < 0.05). 171 (89%), 140 (72.91%), 7 (3.6), 78 (48.6%), 5 (2.6%), 151 (78.64%), 129 (67.18%), 178 (92.7%) and 15 (7.8%) of 192 isolates harbored mecA, entA, entB, entC, entD, entE, eta, etb and tsst-1 genes, respectively. 31 (16.14%), 5 (2.6%), 95 (49.48%) and 7 (3.64%) of 192 isolates carried SCCmec type I, II, III and IV, respectively. We found a significantly higher rate of MRSA and resistance to all tested antibiotics, except to penicillin G, kanamycin and linezolide among the SCCmec type III class (p < 0.05).According to our findings, MSSA isolates should be taken as seriously as MRSA strains due to the potential presence of broad spectrum virulence factor genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abenzylpenicillin 3achromosomes 3across infection 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3akanamycin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseptic shock 3avancomycin 3avirulence 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aSuperantigen 0aMRSA 0aMSSA 0aEntorotoxin 0aSCCmec1 aAshrafi, Elnaz1 aTazandareh, Shafie Gorbani1 aKoosha, Roohollah Zarei1 aRad, Hamid Sedighian1 aAmin, Mohsen1 aSoori, Mina1 aLarki, Reza Abbasi1 aChoopani, Ali1 aHosseini, Hamideh Mahmoodzadeh0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2015 Apr., v. 81 p.60-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2015.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011700166300001600283520104300299592002801342650001001370650001901380650004401399650002201443650001501465650001501480650001501495650002201510650000701532650001401539650002301553650002101576653001101597653003401608653003301642653001401675700001601689700001501705700001301720773010001733856008501833852000901918655001201927IND60546440020221121064154.0160903e20150830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054644002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.03.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Yulun10aEnhanced Fenton-like degradation of refractory organic compounds by surface complex formation of LaFeO3 and H2O2  ap. 195-200.  aNanoscale LaFeO3 was prepared via sol–gel method and characterized by XRD, FTIR and N2 adsorption/desorption experiment. The results indicated that, LaFeO3 had a typical perovskite structure with a BET area of 8.5m2/g. LaFeO3 exhibited excellent Fenton activity and stability for the degradation of pharmaceuticals and herbicides in water, as demonstrated with sulfamethoxazole, phenazone, phenytoin, acyclovir and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2-chlorophenol. Among them, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) could be completely removed in LaFeO3–H2O2 system after reaction for 120min at neutral pH. Based on the ATR–FTIR analysis, the surface complex of LaFeO3 and H2O2 was formed, which was important and essential for the enhanced Fenton reaction by accelerating the cycle of Fe3+/Fe2+. Hence, more OH and O2−/HO2− were then produced in LaFeO3–H2O2 system, resulting in more efficient removal of refractory organic compounds. Based on the surface interaction of LaFeO3 and H2O2, a heterogeneous Fenton reaction mechanism was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3a2-chlorophenol 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aantipyrine 3adesorption 3ahydrogen peroxide 3apH 3aphenytoin 3asol-gel processing 3asulfamethoxazole 0aLaFeO3 0aHeterogeneous Fenton reaction 0aRefractory organic compounds 0aMechanism1 aZhang, Lili1 aLi, Yu-You1 aHu, Jun,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Aug. 30, v. 294 p.195-200dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.03.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008600172300001800258520146400276592002801740650001501768650001101783650001101794650001201805650002601817650001301843650001301856650001101869650001601880650001801896650001501914651001001929653002001939653002201959653001201981700001501993700001502008700001702023700001502040700001502055700001502070700001702085700001802102700005502120773012102175856008802296852000902384655001202393IND60646108620221123015314.0200117e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064610862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yingzeng10aBarium isotopic fractionation in latosol developed from strongly weathered basalt  ap. 1295-1304.  aWeathering is a key process in the transfer of material from continents to the hydrosphere. A latosol profile in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, South China, formed through intense weathering of basalt, was studied to improve understanding of Ba isotopic fractionation during basalt weathering. Profile horizons were grouped into Ba-depleted and Ba-enriched layers (D- and E-layers, respectively) according to the mass fraction of Ba lost or gained from the weathered profile relative to bedrock. δ¹³⁷/¹³⁴Ba values in the soil profile ranged from −0.22‰ to +0.02‰, lower than those of the parent basaltic rock (0.03‰ ± 0.03‰). In the D-layers, Ba isotopic fractionation can be explained by Rayleigh fractionation, implying that heavy Ba isotopes are preferentially leached. The Rayleigh fractionation model is not applicable to the E-layers because they preferentially acquired isotopically light Ba isotopes during weathering. Results indicate a net loss of heavy Ba isotopes during strong weathering of basalt due to the precipitation of FeMn (oxyhydr)oxides and adsorption on secondary minerals. A mass-balance model indicates that the average δ¹³⁷/¹³⁴Ba value of materials leached from the weathered profile is ~0.08‰, slightly higher than that of the bedrock. This suggests a loss of heavy Ba isotopes into the hydrosphere during weathering of basalt, consistent with the enrichment of heavy Ba isotopes in river waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abarium 3abasalt 3abedrock 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3aminerals 3amodels 3ariver water 3asoil profiles 3aweathering 3aChina 0aBarium isotopes 0aBasalt weathering 0aLatosol1 aZeng, Zhen1 aZhou, Chen1 aNan, Xiaoyun1 aYu, Huimin1 aLü, Ying,1 aLi, Wangye1 aGou, Wenxian1 aCheng, Wenhan1 aHuang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1885-33110 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 687 p.1295-1304dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245014400168300001600312520136300328592002801691650004401719650002201763650003701785650001501822650001501837650001501852650003101867650001101898650003701909650000901946650001401955650001101969650000701980650003301987650002302020650002502043650001902068653002802087653001802115653001202133653001502145653002002160700001402180700001802194700001502212700001202227700001202239700005202251773011902303856008802422852000902510655001202519IND60646108820221123024424.0190801e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064610882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin10aSynthesis of amino-functionalized magnetic aerobic granular sludge-biochar for Pb(II) removal: Adsorption performance and mechanism studies  ap. 681-689.  aIn the present study, a novel amino-functionalized magnetic aerobic granular sludge-biochar (NH2-M-AGS) was successfully fabricated through magnetization and functional modification and applied for Pb(II) sorption. The composite was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Zeta potential analysis, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effects of adsorbent dosage, pH value, contact time and initial metal concentration on the adsorption of Pb(II) were investigated by using batch equilibrium experiments. It was concluded that the pseudo-second-order model was better to describe adsorption kinetic of Pb(II) onto NH2-M-AGS. The Langmuir model was more accorded with the experimental data, and the maximum adsorption capacity of Pb(II) was 127.0 mg/g. A possible adsorption mechanism could be mainly caused by surface complexation, electrostatic attraction and precipitation. In five adsorption-desorption cycles, the desorption efficiency of Pb(II) exhibited a slight decline and still reached at 88.14%. Furthermore, the good reproducibility indicated that NH2-M-AGS could be used a desirable, economic and recyclable adsorbent in practical metal-contaminated wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3alead 3amagnetism 3amodels 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater treatment 3azeta potential 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aMagnetization 0aBiochar 0aAdsorption 0aReproducibility1 aWei, Dong1 aZhang, Xinwen1 aFan, Dawei1 aSun, Xu1 aDu, Bin1 aWei, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3034-80460 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 685 p.681-689dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245012500208300001600333520184000349592002802189650001802217650001602235650001302251650001002264650001002274650003102284650001302315650002602328650001302354650001502367650004302382650001802425650001102443650001802454650001402472650001802486650001302504650001602517650001202533650001202545651001202557653001302569653001202582653001002594653001102604700002102615700002102636700002102657700001902678773011902697856008802816852000902904655001202913IND60646109020221122040138.0190809e20191010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064610902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLusa, Merja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5709-775310aMicrobial communities in a former pilot-scale uranium mine in Eastern Finland – Association with radium immobilization  ap. 619-640.  aThe bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities were characterized in 17 top soil organic and mineral layer samples and in top sediment samples of the Paukkajanvaara area, a former pilot-scale uranium mine, located in Eno, Eastern Finland, using amplicon sequencing and qPCR. Soil and sediment samples were in addition analyzed for radium (226Ra), sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−) and phosphate (PO43−) concentrations. New bacterial strains, representing Pseudomonas spp., were isolated from the mine and reference area and used in laboratory experiments on uptake and leaching of radium (Ra). The effect of these strains on the sulfate leaching from the soil samples was also tested in vitro. Between 6 × 106 and 5 × 108 copies g−1 DW (dry weight) of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, 5 × 105–1 × 108 copies g−1 DW archaeal 16S rRNA genes and 1 × 105–1 × 108 copies g−1 DW fungal 5.8S rRNA genes were detected in the samples. A total of 814, 54 and 167 bacterial, archaeal and fungal genera, respectively, were identified. Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota and Mortiriella were the dominant bacterial, archaeal and fungal phyla, respectively. All tested Pseudomonas spp. strains isolates from Paukkajanvaara removed Ra from the solution, but the amount of removed Ra depended on incubation conditions (temperature, time and nutrient broth). The highest removal of Ra (5320 L/kg DW) was observed by the Pseudomonas sp. strain T5-6-I at 37 °C. All Pseudomonas spp. strains decreased the release of Ra from soil with an average of 23% while simultaneously increasing the concentration of SO42− in the solution by 11%. As Pseudomonas spp. were frequent in both the sequence data and the cultures, these bacteria may play an important role in the immobilization of Ra in the Paukkajanvaara mine area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuryarchaeota 3aPseudomonas 3abacteria 3afungi 3agenes 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaching 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asoil sampling 3asulfates 3atemperature 3atopsoil 3auranium 3aFinland 0aBacteria 0aArchaea 0aFungi 0aRadium1 aKnuutinen, Jenna1 aLindgren, Marcus1 aVirkanen, Juhani1 aBomberg, Malin0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 686 p.619-640dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.4323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169300001400275520149100289592002801780650002401808650001501832650001701847650001301864650001501877650001001892650001601902650002101918650001601939650001401955650002501969650002201994650001202016653002102028653002602049653001902075653002702094700002002121700002302141700001602164700002202180700002102202773009902223856008502322852000902407655001202416IND60604787120221118054844.0180718e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060478712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNisa, Humeera10aFungal endophytes as prolific source of phytochemicals and other bioactive natural products: A review  ap. 50-59.  aEndophytic fungi are those that live internally in apparently healthy and asymptomatic hosts. Endophytic fungi appear to be ubiquitous; indeed, no study has yet shown the existence of a plant species without endophytes. High species diversity is another characteristic of endophytic mycobiota which is depicted by the fact that it is quite common for endophyte surveys to find assemblages consisting of more than 30 fungal species per host plant species. Medicinal plants had been used to isolate and characterize directly the bioactive metabolites. However, the discovery of fungal endophytes inside these plants with capacity to produce the same compounds shifted the focus of new drug sources from plants to fungi. Bioactive natural products from endophytic fungi, isolated from different plant species, are attracting considerable attention from natural product chemists and biologists alike which is clearly depicted by the steady increase of publications devoted to this topic during the recent years. This review will highlight the chemical potential of endophytic fungi with focus on the detection of pharmaceutically valuable plant constituents as products of fungal biosynthesis. In addition, it will cover newly discovered endophytic fungi and also new bioactive metabolites reported in recent years from fungal endophytes. It summarizes the up-to-date and comprehensive information on bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi by having done a thorough survey of literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3abiologists 3abiosynthesis 3achemists 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ahost plants 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolites 3amycobiota 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 0aEndophytic fungi 0aBioactive metabolites 0aPhytochemicals 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aKamili, Azra N.1 aNawchoo, Irshad A.1 aShafi, Sana1 aShameem, Nowsheen1 aBandh, Suhaib A.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2015 May, v. 82 p.50-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010800172300001200280520117600292592002801468650002501496650002401521650001201545650001901557650001901576650001101595650002001606650001701626650002001643650001801663653002401681653002501705653001501730700001601745700001801761700001601779700001601795700001301811700001501824773010801839856008501947852000902032655001202041IND60604787220221118054836.0180718e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060478722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2015.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiaoqiang10aTrichophyton rubrum conidia modulate the expression and transport of Toll-like receptor 2 in HaCaT cell  ap. 1-5.  aTrichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) represents the most important agent of dermatophytosis in humans. T. rubrum infection causes slight inflammation, and tends to be chronic and recurrent. It is suggested that T. rubrum can modulate the innate immune responses of host cells, which result in the failure of host cells to recognize T. rubrum and initiate effective immune responses. In this study we show how T. rubrum conidia modulate the expression and transport of Toll-like receptor 2 in HaCaT cell. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the surface and total expression of Toll-like receptor 2 were upregulated at the very early stage when keratinocytes were exposed to T. rubrum conidia regardless of the dose, and the upregulation of surface TLR2 was much more significant than that of total TLR2. Moreover, TLR2 expression was suppressed after upregulation in the initial stage of T. rubrum exposure, and the decrease of total TLR2 was earlier than that of surface TLR2. Our results suggest that in the early stage, TLR2 of keratinocytes were upregulated and transported to the cell surface. After then, the expression of TLR2 was suppressed by T. rubrum conidia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aTrichophyton rubrum 3aconidia 3adermatomycoses 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3akeratinocytes 0aTrichophyton rubrum 0aToll-like receptor 2 0aHaCaT cell1 aYi, Jinling1 aYin, Songchao1 aLi, Meirong1 aYe, Congxiu1 aLai, Wei1 aChen, Jian0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2015 June,  July, v. 83-84 p.1-5dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245010000197300001800297500002000315520159600335592002801931596006901959596006902028596006902097650001702166650001502183650001402198650001702212650001502229650000902244650002502253650001302278650001302291650001102304651001002315700001902325700005202344700005602396700001702452700001602469773013102485856007702616852000902693655001202702IND60789672520221119142555.0220822e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078967252DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0136712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xunchi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4372-363414aThe Remobilization and Removal of Fe in Estuary—A Case Study in the Changjiang Estuary, China  ap. 2539-2553.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDissolved iron (dFe) delivered by rivers plays a vital role in supporting primary productivity in coastal ecosystems. River‐borne Fe is generally removed in estuaries due to the salt‐induced flocculation. However, effects of the river mouth bar area on the variations of dFe concentration are frequently overlooked. Here we show the results of quasi‐synchronous observation conducted in three water channels in the mouth bar area of the Changjiang Estuary during both spring and neap tides in July 2014. dFe showed high spatial variation, from 2.63 to 690 nM, with higher values commonly found in the inner study area. An episode of significant Fe remobilization was observed in the inner mouth bar before the removal in the subsequent fresh‐saline water mixing process. Averaged dFe concentration increased from 45.2 ± 22.9 nM at Xuliujing to 188 ± 185 nM in the inner salinity (S) ≤ 1 water, then decreased to 10.3 ± 9.53 nM in the outer S > 1 water. Budget calculations revealed that the Changjiang input was the largest terrestrial source for dFe, while desorption from particles was the main reason for dFe enhancement in the study area. The entire mouth bar area was identified as a net sink for dFe, whereas, its S ≤ 1 and S > 1 zones were a source and a sink, respectively. We suggest that the mouth bar area diversifies the biogeochemical behavior of Fe in the estuary and enhances Fe output flux. Our study offers a new insight for better understanding the behavior of Fe and other particle‐reactive elements in large dynamic estuaries.  aPublisher supplied data  a41476065cNational Natural Science Foundation Committee of China  a41530960cNational Natural Science Foundation Committee of China  a41021064cNational Natural Science Foundation Committee of China 3acase studies 3adesorption 3aestuaries 3aflocculation 3ageophysics 3airon 3aprimary productivity 3aresearch 3asalinity 3aspring 3aChina1 aZhang, Ruifeng1 aWu, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7141-621X1 aShu, Ken'ei,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8828-93521 aBao, Daoyang1 aZhang, Jing0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Apr., v. 123, no. 4 p.2539-2553dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0136713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013400157300002000291520139500311592002801706650001101734650001301745650001701758650002101775650001701796650001601813650001101829650001401840650002201854650001401876650002101890700001801911700001701929700002001946700001701966700001301983700001701996700002102013700001502034700001402049700002102063773014402084856007502228852000902303655001202312IND60778934620221120165646.0220603e20220531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077893462DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta00425a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xuguang10aHigh-performance fully-stretchable solid-state lithium-ion battery with a nanowire-network configuration and crosslinked hydrogel  ap. 11562-11573.  aStretchable batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for supplying power to wearable electronics and implantable medical systems. Recently, several research studies on flexible liquid-state batteries have been carried out, but the fabrication of high-performance stretchable solid-state batteries as steady and safe power sources is still a technical challenge. Here, a fully stretchable solid-state lithium-ion battery (FSSLIB) is produced by assembling all-intrinsically-stretchable aneroid components (current collector, anode/cathode, electrolyte), which were realized using crumpled-structured nanowires (NWs) and crosslink hydrogels. Both wrinkled NW interconnected with active material islands and hydrogel electrolytes with robust electrode interfaces endow the battery with electrochemical stability during large-scale stretching deformations. The assembled FSSLIB can achieve a 100% stretched state with a specific capacity of 119 mA h g⁻¹ and a 91.6% conservation rate after being subjected to tensile strain 250 times. The designed structure, dexterously utilizing the intrinsic mechanical and electrical properties of NWs and hydrogels, can effectively improve the device's tensile and storage capacity to afford the development of a material that has future potential for use in large-strain wearable and implantable energy electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3ahydrogels 3alithium batteries 3ananowires 3atensile strength1 aTan, Dongchen1 aGuo, Qinglei1 aZhang, Tianpeng1 aHu, Fangyuan1 aSun, Nan1 aHuang, Jijie1 aFang, Chengcheng1 aJi, Ruonan1 aBi, Sheng1 aJiang, Chengming0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 May 31, v. 10, no. 21 p.11562-11573dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta00425a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009300169500001900262520154700281592002801828650001901856650002101875650002201896650001701918650001101935650001701946650000901963650001501972653001501987653002402002653002002026700001702046773009002063856008502153852000902238655001202247IND60695418720221120205552.0201104e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1177882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiss, Anton A.10aRethinking energy use in distillation processes for a more sustainable chemical industry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe need for greater sustainability for the production of fuels and chemicals has spurred significant research to rethink energy use in the chemical industry, and eventually substitute fossil fuel sources by renewable sources. Nowadays, the chemical industry is responsible for about one third of the total energy used - and the associated CO₂ emissions - in the industrial sector. Among the energy intensive operations, distillation alone is responsible for about 40% of the energy used in the chemical industry, but there is clearly much room for improvement. This paper aims to provide an informative perspective on the current energy use in the chemical industry, with a focus on distillation – the undisputed king of industrial separation processes – and potential improvements for a more sustainable future. There is clearly an increasing need and scope for advanced distillation technologies (e.g. reactive distillation, dividing-wall columns, thermal coupling, cyclic distillation, heat pump assisted distillation, and heat integrated distillation columns) that can significantly reduce the energy usage and the carbon footprint of modern chemical plants. However, these advanced distillation technologies must be considered, along with conventional distillation operations, in the context of the process as a whole. Based on the overview provided, several challenges and opportunities for research directions are highlighted towards rethinking the energy use in distillation processes, for a more sustainable chemical industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3achemical industry 3adistillation 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3aheat pumps 0aEnergy use 0aProcess integration 0aElectrification1 aSmith, Robin0 tEnergy.g2020 July 15, v. 203 p.117788-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1177883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007500156300001600231520108100247592002801328650002301356650005201379650001001431650001001441650002001451650001201471650001301483650001501496650001201511653001301523653001601536653002201552653001501574700002201589700002101611773013701632856007501769852000901844655001201853IND60795345720221120224046.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534572DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.RF-2352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKose, Senol14aThe measures to be taken against Covid-19 in food industries: A review  ap. 379-382.  aThe COVID-19 epidemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, turned into a worldwide pandemic and caused death of about 5 million people worldwide. The virus is not proven to be transmitted to humans through foodstuffs, especially from packaged foods. However, it is possible for SARS-CoV-2, which is spread from personnel to food surfaces or food products, to cause illness in humans. It is of great importance that all employees who come into contact with food comply with the mask, distance and hygiene rules and are vaccinated quickly. Fruits and vegetables should be washed with plenty of water and cooked foods should be consumed after being cooked well over 60°C. In addition, it is of great importance to ensure the cleaning, sanitation, good hygiene practices and active packaging in all workplaces from the farm to the fork. In this study, general characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 virus, spread of COVID-19 through foods and prevention of this spread, precautions to be taken against COVID-19 in food businesses and disinfectants that should be used were provided in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adeath 3afarms 3ahuman resources 3ahygiene 3apandemic 3asanitation 3aviruses 0aCOVID-19 0aFood safety 0aFoodborne viruses 0aSARS-CoV-21 aKose, Yagmur Erim1 aAltun, İbrahim,0 tAgricultural reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.379-382dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2002x0976-07417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.RF-2353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009900164300001800263520115900281592002801440650001901468650001801487650002201505650001301527650002101540650001301561650001301574650001701587700001601604700005801620773017001678856008001848852000901928655001201937IND60684384920221120084800.0200219e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068438492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b061522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiangfei10aPorphyrin-Based Triazine Polymers and Their Derived Porous Carbons for Efficient CO₂ Capture  ap. 3205-3212.  aN-containing porous organic polymers and derived porous carbons are promising for CO₂ capture, while their simple fabrication still remains a challenge. Herein, the porphyrin-based triazine polymers were simply constructed from tetraphenylporphyrin and cyanuric chloride according to one-pot Scholl coupling reaction and Friedel–Crafts reaction. The as-fabricated polymers had the maximum CO₂ uptake of 173 mg/g and high CO₂/N₂ selectivity (IAST: 59.35) at 273 K and 1.0 bar. After KOH-activated carbonization, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (1004–3238 m²/g), micropore area (798–1434 m²/g), pore volume (0.54–1.76 cm³/g), micropore volume (0.41–1.02 cm³/g), and ultra-micropore volume (up to 0.29 cm³/g) were significantly improved, indicative of their outstanding CO₂ uptakes (171–282 mg/g). The ultramicropore volume with a pore size of less than 1.2 nm and N content were proven to be the vital factors for CO₂ capture. The synthetic strategy provides a simple and effective approach for the synthesis of the porphyrin-based triazine polymers, and the derived porous carbons were efficient for CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonization 3acyanuric chloride 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apolymers 3aporosity 3asurface area1 aWang, Lizhi1 aHuang, Jianhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3838-06220 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Jan. 22, v. 59, no. 7 p.3205-3212dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b061523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245008800177300001800265520078600283592002801069650002201097650003701119650002101156650001301177650000901190650002101199650001201220650001001232650002101242650003701263700001901300700001801319700002001337773008401357856008901441852000901530655001201539IND60095880420221116154755.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009588042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayak, Ganesh Ch.10aNovel approach for the selective dispersion of MWCNTs in the Nylon/SAN blend system  ap. 1242-1251.  aMultiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were coated with TiO₂ by sol gel process.

The predominant growing areas are lacking with high yielding varieties and adopting poor crop husbandry. Therefore, the present study was focused on assessing the genetic variability among the diverse genotypes for their biometrical traits. Thirty genotypes of fenugreek were sown in randomized block design with three replications during rabi season 2019–20. Presence of wide spectrum of variability among the genotypes for all the biometrical traits under study was evident. High GCV and PCV (>20), heritability in broad sense (>60) coupled with high genetic advance as percentage of mean (>20%) was observed for proline content in leaves (mg/g) at 60 days after sowing (DAS) and physiological maturity, seed yield per plant, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, crude protein content and test weight suggesting that these characters are genetically governed by additive gene action and can be improved through selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive gene effects 3abiometry 3acrude protein 3afenugreek 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aplant cultural practices 3aproline 3aseed yield 0aEnvironments 0aGenetic advance 0aVariability1 aMaurya, I.B.1 aSingh, Bhuri1 aKavita, A.1 aChopra, Rahul0 tAgricultural reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.383-388dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2002x0976-07417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.R-23023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245017600163300001800339500002000357520112200377592002801499596006301527650001601590650002201606650001801628650001701646650001201663650001801675650002201693650001601715650001601731650001401747650001501761650001301776650004401789700001801833700001301851700001801864700001401882700001801896700005801914773013401972856007902106852000902185655001202194IND60785880720221116210455.0220729e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078588072DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2021010162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaowei10aIdentification of metabolites of Ginkgolide B in vivo and in vitro using ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography‐quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry  ap. 2458-2477.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGinkgolide B is a dietary diterpene with multiple pharmacological activities. However, current research on ginkgolide B is not comprehensive. The current study analyzed the metabolic profile of ginkgolide B in vivo and in vitro using ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry. To detect and identify the different metabolites in ginkgolide B, a novel data processing method was used as an assistant tool. A total of 53 different metabolites of ginkgolide B (38 phase I metabolites and 15 phase II metabolites) were detected relative to blank samples. The biotransformation route of ginkgolide B was identified as oxidation, dehydroxylation, hydrogenation, decarbonylation, demethylation, sulfate conjugation, glucose conjugation, methylation, and acetylation. The current study demonstrated a method for rapidly detecting and identifying metabolites and provided useful information to further characterize the pharmacology and mechanism of ginkgolide B. A method for the analysis of other diterpene metabolic components in vivo and in vitro was also established.  aPublisher supplied data  a81473180cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aacetylation 3abiotransformation 3ademethylation 3aditerpenoids 3aglucose 3ahydrogenation 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3aoxidation 3aseparation 3asulfates 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aDiao, Xinpeng1 aLi, Luya1 aZhang, Yuqian1 aLiao, Man1 aZhang, Guohua1 aZhang, Lantong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4031-66350 tJournal of separation science.g2022 July, v. 45, no. 14 p.2458-2477dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2021010163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012200154300002000276520150300296592002801799650003001827650002001857650001101877650001701888650001201905650002201917700001801939700001501957700001601972700001701988773012502005856007402130852000902204655001202213IND60747866020221119015027.0210820e20210813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786602DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra04558j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kai10aUrea-doped carbon dots as fluorescent switches for the selective detection of iodide ions and their mechanistic study  ap. 27645-27652.  aA facile and green strategy for the fabrication of fluorescent urea-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) has been explored. Significantly, the fluorescent N-CDs could recognize iodide ions (I⁻) with high selectivity, and their photoluminescence could be efficiently quenched by the addition of I⁻. The sensitivity analysis for I⁻ indicated a linear relationship in the range from 12.5 to 587 μM with the detection limit as low as 0.47 μM. Furthermore, the I⁻ induced fluorescence (FL) quenching mechanism was investigated employing a combination of techniques, including UV-vis/fluorescence spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, TEM and time-resolved fluorescence decay measurements. The DFT calculation results demonstrated that the amino- and amide groups of N-CDs play a significant role in iodide recognition through the formation of multiple N–H⋯I⁻, C–H⋯I⁻ and C(O)N–H⋯I⁻ interactions with I⁻. The TEM experiment confirmed the aggregation process when I⁻ was added to the N-CDs solution. Moreover, the radiative decay rate of N-CDs, which was first measured and reported the kinetic behaviors of the FL-quenching process, decreased from 3.30 × 10⁷ s⁻¹ to 1.95 × 10⁷ s⁻¹ after the coordination with I⁻ ions. The reduced lifetime demonstrated that the excited energy dissipation led to a dynamic quenching process. Therefore, such carbon materials can function as effective fluorescent switches for the selective detection of I⁻ ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aiodides 3aphotoluminescence1 aGeng, Cuihuan1 aWang, Fang1 aZhao, Yajun1 aRu, Zongling0 tRSC advances.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 11, no. 44 p.27645-27652dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra04558j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012100156300001600277520140800293592002801701650003501729650002601764650001001790650001101800650002601811650001001837650001101847650001201858650002101870650001901891650000901910650001301919651001001932653002401942653003401966653000802000653003902008700001802047700001702065773013702082856007502219852000902294655001202303IND60795346020221121015534.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534602DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.R-21492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadav, C.N.10aAssessment of hydrocyanic acid (HCN) content during different stages of growth in Johnson Grass (Sorghum helepensis)  ap. 394-397.  aJohnson grass (Sorghum helepensis) is not a cultivated fodder crop but it is a wild variety seen on farm bunds after rainfall in which Sorghum vulgare (Gundrijowar) fodder crops were cultivated in kharif season in Saurashtra region of Gujarat state. At different stages of growth, Johnson grass contains cyanogenic glycosides of varying level which liberate hydrocyanic acid in rumen when it consumed by ruminant animals due to rumen microflora (Toxic level of HCN is 20 mg/100gm dry matter). The current study aimed to estimate varying levels of HCN in Johnson grass to keep dairy farmers informed of safe level of HCN for harvesting. An investigation was carried out at Cattle Breeding Farm, Junagadh Agricultural University, Junagadh, Gujarat for three consecutive years 2013–2015 in kharif season. Non-cultivated (Sorghum helepensis) fodder samples were collected for quantitative HCN concentration from farm bunds nearby eight sown plots of Gundrijowar (Sorghum vulgare) from 15 DAS and sampling were continued at fortnightly intervals till the plots exhibit 25% flowering stage. Result of obtained data in present study revealed that concentration of HCN in Johnson grass in kharif season decreased significantly (p<0.05) on attaining 25% flowering stage during the year 2013, 2014 and 2015. It was concluded that Green Johnson grass can be fed to ruminant animals safely at 25% flowering stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. bicolor 3aagricultural colleges 3abunds 3acattle 3acyanogenic glycosides 3afarms 3aforage 3agrasses 3ahydrogen cyanide 3amicroorganisms 3arain 3atoxicity 3aIndia 0aDAS (Day of sowing) 0aGundrijowar (Sorghum vulgare) 0aHCN 0aJohnson grass (Sorghum helepensis)1 aMakwana, R.B.1 aParikh, S.S.0 tAgricultural reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.394-397dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2002x0976-07417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.R-21493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245009200198300001800290506007600308520031200384592002800696506003700724650001000761650001600771650002100787650001900808650002000827650001100847650001300858650002600871700002200897700001900919700001700938700002500955700002400980773013301004856007401137852000901211655001201220IND60617492720221207071105.0181025e20180529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749272DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01499j2doi7 aPMC59727372pmcid7 a297618072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jianfeng10aPhotochemical reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide using sulfite and ferrocyanide  ap. 5566-5569.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotoredox cycling during UV irradiation of ferrocyanide ([Feᴵᴵ(CN)₆]⁴⁻) in the presence of stoichiometric sulfite (SO₃²⁻) is shown to be an extremely effective way to drive the reductive homologation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to simple sugars and precursors of hydroxy acids and amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3aamino acids 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aphotochemistry 3aredox reactions 3asugars 3asulfites 3aultraviolet radiation1 aRitson, Dougal J.1 aRanjan, Sukrit1 aTodd, Zoe R.1 aSasselov, Dimitar D.1 aSutherland, John D.0 tChemical communications.g2018 May 29, v. 54, no. 44 p.5566-5569dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc01499j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01266naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012900155300001800284520021900302592002800521650001200549650002300561650001900584650001900603650001100622700001700633700001300650700001700663700001500680700001800695773013200713856007400845852000900919655001200928IND60617492820221119013002.0181025e20180508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749282DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01513a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fujian10aIn situ formation of nano-CdSe as a photocatalyst: cadmium ion-enhanced photochemical vapour generation directly from Se(vi)  ap. 4874-4877.  aCadmium ion-enhanced photochemical vapour generation directly from Se(vi) has for the first time been reported here, and the key mechanism of the in situ formation of nano-CdSe as a photocatalyst has been revealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achemical reactions 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotochemistry 3avapors1 aZou, Zhirong1 aHe, Juan1 aLi, Mengtian1 aXu, Kailai1 aHou, Xiandeng0 tChemical communications.g2018 May 8, v. 54, no. 38 p.4874-4877dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc01513a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04252naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006600164300001800230520248800248592002802736596007402764650004402838650002202882650003702904650000802941650001502949650001102964650001402975650001402989650001803003650002203021650001803043650001503061650002003076650002103096650001203117650001303129650000903142650001603151650001303167650004403180650001103224650002003235650001503255650001603270650002403286650002203310650002103332650000903353650001603362700005403378700001603432773011003448856008303558852000903641655001203650IND60776583920221121100547.0220507e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077658392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04558-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinfeng10aDurable phosphorus/nitrogen flame retardant for cotton fabric  ap. 4725-4751.  aA new phosphorus/nitrogen flame retardant (FR) containing reactive –P–O⁻NH₄⁺ groups was synthesized from glycerol, phosphoric acid, and urea.

The structure of the FR was determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, and ³¹P NMR). The effects of FR treatment on the flame retardancy, durability, and thermal stability of cotton fabrics were systematically investigated by measuring limiting oxygen index (LOI) and performing UL-94 vertical burning, cone calorimetry (CONE), thermogravimetric (TG), and differential scanning calorimetry tests. In addition, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, FT-IR, and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry studies verified that FR molecules were grafted onto cotton fabrics. X-ray diffraction showed that FR did not affect their crystal structure. The treated cotton fabric with a weight gain of 25.3% exhibited an LOI of 40.5%, which was significantly higher than that obtained for the untreated cotton (17.0%); additionally, the treated cotton showed good self-extinguishing properties during the UL-94 vertical burning test. Furthermore, the results of CONE analysis indicated that the peak heat release rate of the untreated cotton reduced from 171.1 to 15.1 kW/m² after FR treatment, and its total heat release decreased from 6.3 to 1.1 MJ/m². TG data revealed that FR finishing reduced the initial thermal degradation temperature of the untreated cotton under heating conditions to 225.9 and 221.8 °C in N₂ and air atmospheres, respectively, while the whiteness and mechanical properties of the treated cotton remained in the usable range. Analysis of the flame retardation mechanism of the FR showed that the dense phosphorus/nitrogen char layer that formed in the condensed phase effectively hindered the release of heat and diffusion of flammable volatile substances. This study provides new insights into the design and manufacturing of environmentally friendly FR-treated cotton fabrics with excellent flame retardancy and durability.  aPublisher supplied data  a20130206070GXcjilin scientific and technological development program 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aanhydrides 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3acotton fabric 3acrystal structure 3adicyandiamide 3adurability 3afire prevention 3aflame retardants 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3aheat 3alint cotton 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aphosphoric acid 3aphosphorus 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aurea 3aweight gain1 aJiang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9703-62901 aLiu, Maolin0 tCellulose.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 8 p.4725-4751dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04558-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01474naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011400154300001800268520041600286592002800702650000800730650002300738650001900761650000900780650001700789650002000806700001600826700001700842700001600859700001400875700001900889773013300908856007401041852000901115655001201124IND60617492920221119012952.0181025e20180529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749292DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01515e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Qiang10aZeolitic imidazolate framework-8 film coated stainless steel meshes for highly efficient oil/water separation  ap. 5530-5533.  aHighly compact ZIF-8 film coated stainless steel meshes (ZFCMs) are simply fabricated via the seeding method.

Therefore, we examined ethnic variations in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, iIFG, iIGT, IFG + IGT, and the associated risk factors in Asian Indians in Chennai, India, and Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the United States.Cross-sectional analyses, using representative samples of 4867 Asian Indians aged 20–74 years from Chennai, India, in the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South-Asia study (CARRS) (2010–2011) and 6512 US Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics aged 20–74 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2007–2012).The age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes was highest in Asian Indians (men: 28.4, 95% CI: 25.9, 31.0; women: 30.6, 95% CI, 27.5, 33.9) and lowest in Caucasians (men: 12.2, 95% CI, 10.3, 14.4, women: 9.5, 95% CI, 7.9, 11.5). Asian Indians had the lowest prediabetes prevalence (men: 19.0, 95% CI, 17.2, 20.8; women: 27.2, 95% CI, 22.8, 32.1) and Caucasians had the highest (men; 46.5, 95% CI, 43.5, 49.6, women: 34.4, 95% CI, 31.7, 37.3). However, there were differences in prediabetes prevalence by gender and prediabetes state. The inclusion of HOMA-β in standardized polytomous logistic regression models resulted in a greater odds of diabetes in Blacks and Hispanics compared to Asian Indians.The high prevalence of diabetes in Asian Indians may be due to innate susceptibilities for β-cell dysfunction in this high risk population.  aPublisher supplied data 0aType 2 diabetes 0aEthnicity 0aAsian Indian1 aMohan, V.1 aPradeepa, R.1 aDeepa, M.1 aAnjana, R.M.1 aMehta, N.K.1 aGregg, E.W.1 aNarayan, K.M.0 tJournal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology.g2016 June, v. 4 p.19-27dElsevier Inc.x2214-62377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcte.2016.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017700169300001800346520107300364536009901437592002801536596002801564650001701592650003101609650001101640650002101651650001501672650001801687650001201705650002901717650001701746650001101763650001801774650001801792650001301810650002501823650001501848653002301863653002401886653001001910653002301920700002001943700001801963700002501981700002502006773012602031856008502157852000902242655001202251IND60743082120221118130050.0210707e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074308212DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16663852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagiera, Anna10aLipophilic extracts from leaves, inflorescences and fruits of Prunus padus L. as potential sources of corosolic, ursolic and oleanolic acids with anti-inflammatory activity  ap. 2263-2268.  aChloroform extracts from leaves, inflorescences and fruits of Prunus padus were analysed for anti-inflammatory activity and accumulation of corosolic (CA), ursolic (UA) and oleanolic (OA) acids. The analytes were identified and quantified by GC-MS and UHPLC-PDA. Their total levels depend on plant material type and harvesting time, and varied from 0.25 mg/g DW in fruits, through 0.76–1.09 mg/g DW in flowers, to 1.41–4.54 mg/g DW in leaves. Significant variation in the leaf analytes contents was observed during vegetation with the peak amounts in autumn, which indicated the optimal harvesting season. The plant extracts inhibited pro-inflammatory enzymes (lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase) in a concentration-dependent manner, and their activity parameters correlated with the levels and activity of pure triterpene acids, especially CA and UA. The results of the comparison with the positive controls (heparin, indomethacin, dexamethasone) might partly support the application of P. padus in anti-inflammatory therapies, reported by traditional medicine.  aThis work was supported by the Medical University of Lodz [grant No. 503/3-022-01/503-31-001].  aPublisher supplied data  a503/3-022-01/503-31-001 3aPrunus padus 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aautumn 3achemical species 3achloroform 3adexamethasone 3aheparin 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3aindomethacin 3aleaves 3alipophilicity 3alipoxygenases 3aresearch 3atraditional medicine 3avegetation 0aPrunus padus Linne 0alipophilic extracts 0aGC-MS 0aseasonal variation1 aMarchelak, Anna1 aMichel, Piotr1 aOwczarek, Aleksandra1 aOlszewska, Monika A.0 tNatural product research.g2021 June 15, v. 35, no. 13 p.2263-2268dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2019.16663853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245007000165300001600235520201700251592002802268650001302296650002602309650002502335650001902360650001202379650002202391650001202413650001002425650002402435650001302459650002002472650002702492650002402519650002202543650001502565650002602580650000902606650002002615650001602635650001902651650001502670653001602685653002302701653002602724653001102750700001702761700001802778773014302796856007402939852000903013655001203022IND60795346420221121015719.0221004e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534642DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.D-3702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDayananda, L.P.S.S.K.13aAn IoT based Low-cost Weather Monitoring System for Smart Farming  ap. 393-399.  aWeather monitoring is an important aspect of crop cultivation for reducing economic loss while increasing productivity. Weather is the combination of current meteorological components, such as temperature, wind direction and speed, amount and kind of precipitation, sunshine hours and so on. The weather defines a time span ranging from a few hours to several days. The periodic or continuous surveillance or the analysis of the status of the atmosphere and the climate, including parameters such as temperature, moisture, wind velocity and barometric pressure, is known as weather monitoring. Because of the increased usage of the internet, weather monitoring has been upgraded to smart weather monitoring. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the new technology that can help with many precision farming operations. Smart weather monitoring is one of the precision agriculture technologies that use sensors to monitor correct weather. The main objective of the research is to design a smart weather monitoring and real-time alert system to overcome the issue of monitoring weather conditions in agricultural farms in order for farmers to make better decisions. Different sensors were used in this study to detect temperature and humidity, pressure, rain, light intensity, CO₂ level, wind speed and direction in an agricultural farm and real time clock sensor was used to measured real time weather data. The major component of this system was an Arduino Uno microcontroller and the system ran according to a program written in the Arduino Uno software. This is a low-cost smart weather monitoring system. This system's output unit were a liquid crystal display and a GSM900A module. The weather data was displayed on a liquid crystal display and the GSM900A module was used to send the data to a mobile phone. This smart weather station was used to monitor real-time weather conditions while sending weather information to the farmer's mobile phone, allowing him to make better decisions to increase yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagricultural sciences 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3afarmers 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3ahumidity 3alight intensity 3aliquid crystal display 3ameteorological data 3amobile telephones 3amonitoring 3aprecision agriculture 3arain 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awind direction 3awind speed 0aArduino Uno 0aInternet of Things 0aSmart weather station 0aSensor1 aNarmilan, A.1 aPirapuraj, P.0 tAgricultural science digest.g2022 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.393-399dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2003x0976-05477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.D-3703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010000168520136800268592002801636650001401664650001901678650001801697650001701715650001201732650001401744650001901758650001201777650002501789650002401814650001601838650001201854650001101866650001201877650001301889650002001902650002001922650002801942650002001970653001301990653002102003653000902024653001002033653002002043653000902063653000902072653001002081653001002091653000702101653000802108653000702116700001902123700005802142700001802200700001802218700005802236700001802294700001502312700001802327700005602345773009402401856008502495852000902580655001202589IND60684216720221123035008.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068421672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1531782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Eun-Bin10aAcacetin enhances glucose uptake through insulin-independent GLUT4 translocation in L6 myotubes  aLowering blood glucose levels by increasing glucose uptake in insulin target tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, is one strategy to discover and develop antidiabetic drugs from natural products used as traditional medicines.Our goal was to reveal the mechanism and activity of acacetin (5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone), one of the major compounds in Agastache rugose, in stimulating glucose uptake in muscle cells.To determine whether acacetin promotes GLUT4-dependent glucose uptake in cultured L6 skeletal muscle cells, we performed a [¹⁴C] 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake assay after treating differentiated L6-GLUT4myc cells with acacetin.Acacetin dose-dependently increased 2-DG uptake by enhancing GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Our results revealed that acacetin activated the CaMKII-AMPK pathway by increasing intracellular calcium concentrations. We also found that aPKCλ/ζ phosphorylation and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were involved in acacetin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Moreover, acacetin-activated AMPK inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation and increased 2-DG uptake in HepG2 cells.Taken together, these results suggest that acacetin might be useful as an antidiabetic functional ingredient.

The preload method involves the ingestion of a smaller amount of a macronutrient composition half an hour before regular meals. The hypothesis was that preload treatment will reduce postprandial glycemia in gestational diabetes.Sixty-six diagnosed cases of gestational diabetes were randomly selected from gynecology and obstetrics outpatient clinic at Xinqiao Hospital in Chongqing. The patients were divided into an intervention group (33 cases) and a control group (33 cases), according to odd–even numbers of the random cases. The intervention group was treated with a macro-nutrient preload given 0.5 h before regular meals and the control group was given a comparative treatment consisting of a milk powder with similar energy content. The two groups were studied until delivery and the measured parameters included fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG), delivery mode and neonatal birth weight.The two groups showed no differences in FBG or 2h-PBG before the nutritional intervention. FBG and 2h-PBG after intervention and before delivery were significantly lower in the intervention group, treated with the macro nutrient preload compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Changes in FBG and 2h-PBG before and after the intervention were investigated and the difference in the intervention group was significantly greater than corresponding values in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The neonatal birth weight and delivery mode was not significantly different (P > 0.05).A macro-nutrient composition, used as a preload, is effective in controlling FBG and PBG of gestational diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGestational diabetes 0aPostprandial blood glucose 0aNutrition therapy 0aPreload1 aXu, Jing1 aZhu, Wenyi1 aFan, Rong1 aBai, Qian1 aHuang, Chen1 aLiu, Jun1 aLi, Zhen1 aSederholm, Magnus1 aNorstedt, Gunnar1 aWang, Jian0 tJournal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology.g2016 Sept., v. 5 p.36-41dElsevier Inc.x2214-62377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcte.2016.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245005000154300001800204520085300222592002801075650001401103650002301117650002301140773013301163856007401296852000901370655001201379IND60617493020221119012950.0181025e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749302DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01516c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZi, Guofu10aRecent developments in actinide metallacycles  ap. 7412-7430.  aAll-carbon metallacycles of the d-transition metals have received widespread attention over the past three decades because of their exceptional intrinsic reactivity. However, in recent years, significant progress has also been made in the synthesis and characterization of actinide metallacyclopropenes, metallacyclopentadienes, and metallacyclocumulenes (metallacyclopentatrienes). Such actinide metallacycles are of interest because of their unique structural properties, their potential application in novel group transfer reactions and catalysis, as well as their ability to engage the 5f orbitals in metal–ligand bonding. This short review summarizes the latest developments in this area focusing on all-carbon actinide metallacycles, i.e., metallacyclopropenes, metallacyclopentadienes, and metallacyclocumulenes (metallacyclopentatrienes).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactinides 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions0 tChemical communications.g2018 July 3, v. 54, no. 54 p.7412-7430dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc01516c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01351naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010400161300001800265520038400283592002800667650002100695650001700716650002500733650001300758700002100771700002200792700001800814773013400832856007400966852000901040655001201049IND60617493120221119013116.0181025e20180619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749312DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01517a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanGelder, L.

In an effort to make this technique more industrially feasible, an amine salt is added to the rinsing steps of a chitosan/sodium hexametaphosphate (CH/PSP) multilayered system to help facilitate thicker growing films with self-extinguishing capability and fewer processing steps. Cotton fabric coated with CH/PSP is rinsed in water baths containing tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane [THAM] and compared to control samples rinsed with deionized water. Only 10 bilayers of the CH/PSP system rinsed with THAM are required to achieve self-extinguishing behavior and pass a vertical flame test, while 15 bilayers of the control system are needed to achieve similar results.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acotton fabric 3aflame retardants 3asodium1 aEberle, Bailey1 aBellevergue, Etienne1 aGrunlan, Jaime1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5241-97410 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 59, no. 7 p.2689-2695dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b063593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012100206300001800327520145100345592002801796596006501824650001201889650002401901650001401925650002701939650001801966650001901984650001902003650001102022650001902033650002902052650001602081700002402097700005902121700006302180700006202243700006102305773011002366856008302476852000902559655001202568IND60776584520221120121056.0220507e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077658452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04562-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaliha, Maisha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8075-005214aThe effect of pulp type on the performance of microfibrillar lignocellulosic bismuth-based active packaging material  ap. 4599-4611.  aThe study aims to investigate the effect of the different lignocellulosic pulp on the composite properties for active packaging application. Microfibrillated cellulose from bleached and unbleached Kraft and thermomechanical pulp (TMP) having different cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractive content were used as the matrix phase with antimicrobial bis-phosphinato bismuth complex as the dispersed phase. The Kraft pulp has thinner fibres as observed in the SEM images and have higher aspect ratio (EMT 109–157) compared to TMP (EMT 43–51). So, it is more easily fibrillated resulting in a strong close network and therefore resulting in low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and high tensile index (20–91 g/m².day and 59–78 Nm/g respectively) compared to the TMP ones (153–261 g/m².day and 35–43 Nm/g respectively). While the physical dimension of the fibres controls the mechanical and barrier properties, the leaching and antibacterial performance is related to the bonding of the complex with the matrix. The high hydrophilicity of the bleached kraft pulp results in a weak bond with the hydrophobic bismuth complex, easing its release to kill the surrounding microbial population and thus resulting in larger zones of inhibition against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, bleached kraft pulp was found to be the most suitable with promising barrier, mechanical and antibacterial properties.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPP1139844cThe National Health and Medical Research Council 3abismuth 3ableached kraft pulp 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3athermomechanical pulping 3awater vapor1 aBrammananth, Rajini1 aCoppel, Ross L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4476-91241 aWerrett, Melissa V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6811-45041 aAndrews, Philip C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3971-73111 aBatchelor, Warren1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6880-77650 tCellulose.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 8 p.4599-4611dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04562-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01694naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014400174300001300318520065600331592002800987650001401015650002801029650002001057653003201077653002201109653003101131653003001162773010401192856008701296852000901383655001201392IND60535351820221120134954.0190402e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053535182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaff, Richard L.10aApplication of the iterative solution method with Schur complement reduction to mixed finite elements based in a tetrahedral discretization  ap. 9-17.  aThe iterative solution method for mixed finite element methods is applied to a 3-D domain partitioned with tetrahedral elements.

In this study, headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and olfactometry (GC–MS–O) analyses were used to characterize the aroma-active profiles of the fruits from three different bayberry cultivars. The aim was to differentiate the bayberry cultivars by their aroma. Fifty-five volatile components, composed of aldehydes (10), alcohols (9), esters (8), terpenes (17), and others (11), were identified by optimized HS-SPME/GC–MS. Meanwhile, 36 aroma-active compounds were detected by olfactometry using detection frequency analysis (DFA). Hexanal (grass-like), (E)-2-hexenal (green), nonanal (fruit, flower), 1-hexanol (flower), and isocaryophillene (wood) were identified in all three cultivars. Further principal component analysis (PCA) of the active aromas revealed their contributions to the odor differences among the bayberry cultivar groups. The BQ bayberry was characterized by having a stronger “herb” odor, which is mainly caused by benzoic acid and methyl ester. DK bayberry had a stronger “grass” odor, which is mainly caused by 2,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene, while FHZ bayberry had a stronger “pine” odor, which is caused mainly by α-pinene. The GC–MS–O and electronic nose techniques, when combined with PCA, could be used to successfully distinguish between different bayberry cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorella rubra 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalpha-pinene 3abenzoic acid 3acultivars 3aelectronic nose 3aesters 3aflavor 3aflowers 3afruits 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aodors 3aolfactometry 3aprincipal component analysis 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile compounds 3aChina 0aBayberry (Myrica rubra) 0aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry–olfactometry (GC–MS–O) 0aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) 0aE-nose 0aAroma-active1 aChen, Jianle1 aChen, Shiguo1 aWu, Dan1 aLiu, Donghong1 aYe, Xingqian0 tFood research international.g2015 June, v. 72 p.8-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245020000166300001800366500002000384520150800404592002801912650005201940650001201992650002102004650001702025650001302042650001502055650001502070650003002085650001602115700005702131700002102188700006202209773013402271856007902405852000902484655001202493IND60785881620221116205742.0220729e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078588162DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2022001782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaraya, Roshdy E.10aHighly sensitive high‐performance thin‐layer chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of molnupiravir, favipiravir, and ritonavir in pure forms and pharmaceutical formulations  ap. 2582-2590.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFavipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir have been recently approved as the first oral antivirals for treatment of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral infections. Their combination was reported in several clinical studies, alternatively, to enhance the viral eradication and improve patient's recovery times and rates. Being all orally administered, therefore, the development of new sensitive and validated methodologies for their simultaneous determination is a necessitate. In the proposed research, a sensitive, selective, and simple high‐performance thin layer chromatography method was developed and validated for determination of favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir. Silica gel 60F254 thin layer chromatography plates were used as stationary phase for this separation using mobile phase composed of methylene chloride:ethyl acetate:methanol:25% ammonia (6:3:4:1, v/v/v/v). Densitometric detection was performed at wavelength 289 nm. Peaks of favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir were resolved at retention factors 0.22, 0.42, and 0.63, respectively. The proposed method was found linear within the specified ranges of 3.75–100.00 μg/mL for molnupiravir and favipiravir, and 2.75–100.00 μg/mL for ritonavir. Limits of detection were found to be 1.12, 1.21, and 0.89 μg/mL for favipiravir, molnupiravir, and ritonavir, respectively. This is the first method to be reported for the simultaneous determination of the cited three antiviral drugs. The method was assessed on novel greenness metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aammonia 3aantiviral agents 3adensitometry 3apatients 3aseparation 3asilica gel 3athin layer chromatography 3awavelengths1 aDeeb, Sami El1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6417-47371 aSalman, Baher I.1 aIbrahim, Adel Ehab1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7421-12200 tJournal of separation science.g2022 July, v. 45, no. 14 p.2582-2590dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2022001783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007700155245011200232520178700344592002802131650001302159650001502172650001302187650001502200650001902215650001902234650001702253650001902270650002002289650001702309650002102326650002002347650002002367653002902387653002302416653002602439653002602465653003602491700002802527700002902555700004402584700001702628700002702645700002202672700003602694773009102730856009002821852000902911655001202920IND60782067420221121221531.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Caique Prado Machado de1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5176-721510aConverting recycled membranes into photocatalytic membranes using greener TiO2-GRAPHENE oxide nanomaterials  aDespite the widespread use of membrane separation processes for water treatment, operation costs and fouling still restrict their application. Costs can be overcome by recycled membranes whereas fouling can be mitigated by membrane modification. In this work, the performance of recycled reverse osmosis membranes modified by greener titanium dioxide (TiO₂) and graphene oxide (GO) in different modification routes were investigated and compared. The use of recycled membranes as a support acted more than a strategy for costs reduction, but also as an alternative for solid waste reduction. Low adhesion of nanoparticulate materials to the membrane surfaces were verified in depositions by self-assembly, whereas filtration and modification with dopamine generated membranes with well adhered and homogeneous layers. Considering the stability, permeability, and rejection efficiency of dyes as model substrates, the membranes modified with the aid of dopamine-TiO₂-GO were the most promising. The nanomaterials increased the membrane hydrophilicity and formed a hydrated layer that repels the organic contaminants and reduces fouling. Besides membrane rejection, adsorption (contribution: ∼10%) and photocatalysis (contribution: ∼20%) were additional mechanisms for pollutants removal by the modified membranes. The photocatalytic membrane modified with dopamine-TiO₂-GO was furthermore evaluated for the removal of six different pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), noticing gains in terms of removal efficiency (up to 95.7%) and fouling mitigation for the modified membrane compared to the original membranes. The photocatalytic activity still contributed to a simultaneous degradation of PhACs avoiding the generation of a concentrated stream for further disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3adopamine 3afiltration 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3apermeability 3aphotocatalysis 3areverse osmosis 3asolid wastes 3atitanium dioxide 3awaste reduction 3awater treatment 0aPhotocatalytic membranes 0aRecycled membranes 0aEmerging contaminants 0aMembrane modification 0aTitanium dioxide-graphene oxide1 aMoreira, Victor Rezende1 aLebron, Yuri Abner Rocha1 aVasconcelos, Cláudia Karina Barbosa de1 aKoch, Konrad1 aViana, Marcelo Machado1 aDrewes, Jörg E.,1 aAmaral, Míriam Cristina Santos0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135591-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014800169300001800317520148900335592002801824650000901852650001401861650002201875650002801897650001001925650001301935650001901948650001501967650001301982650001401995700002402009700001802033700002502051700006402076773011002140856008302250852000902333655001202342IND60776584720221120121133.0220507e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077658472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04570-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharaf, Samar S.10aAntibacterial and wound healing properties of cellulose acetate electrospun nanofibers loaded with bioactive glass nanoparticles; in-vivo study  ap. 4565-4577.  aBioactive glasses (BGs) have gained great attention owing to their versatile biological properties. Combining BG nanoparticles (BGNPs) with polymeric nanofibers produced nanocomposites of great performance in various biomedical applications especially in regenerative medicine. In this study, a novel nanocomposite nanofibrous system was developed and optimized from cellulose acetate (CA) electrospun nanofibers containing different concentrations of BGNPs. Morphology, IR and elemental analysis of the prepared electrospun nanofibers were determined using SEM, FT-IR and EDX respectively. Electrical conductivity and viscosity were also studied. Antibacterial properties were then investigated using agar well diffusion method. Moreover, biological wound healing capabilities for the prepared nanofiber dressing were assessed using in-vivo diabetic rat model with induced wounds. The fully characterized CA electrospun uniform nanofiber (100–200 nm) with incorporated BGNPs exhibited broad range of antimicrobial activity against gram negative and positive bacteria. The BGNP loaded CA nanofiber accelerated wound closure efficiently by the 10th day. The remaining wound areas for treated rats were 95.7 ± 1.8, 36.4 ± 3.2, 6.3 ± 1.5 and 0.8 ± 0.9 on 1st, 5th, 10th and 15th days respectively. Therefore, the newly prepared BGNP CA nanocomposite nanofiber could be used as a promising antibacterial and wound healing dressing for rapid and efficient recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3aelectrical conductivity 3aglass 3amedicine 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3aviscosity1 aEl-Shafei, Amira M.1 aRefaie, Rakia1 aGibriel, Abdullah A.1 aAbdel-Sattar, Raghda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1700-66390 tCellulose.g2022 May, v. 29, no. 8 p.4565-4577dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04570-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245011700206300001800323500002000341520157500361592002801936596005301964596005302017650002302070650002202093650001602115650001402131650001502145650001902160650001302179700006202192700002102254773013102275856007702406852000902483655001202492IND60789673920221119140746.0220822e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078967392DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0133882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamann, Madeleine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5437-733810aGeneration and Propagation of Nonlinear Internal Waves in Sheared Currents Over the Washington Continental Shelf  ap. 2381-2400.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe generation, propagation, and dissipation of nonlinear internal waves (NLIW) in sheared background currents is examined using 7 days of shipboard microstructure surveys and two moorings on the continental shelf offshore of Washington state. Surveys near the hypothesized generation region show semi‐diurnal (D2) energy flux is onshore and that the ratio of energy flux to group speed times energy (F/cgE) increases sharply at the shelf break, suggesting that the incident D2 internal tide is partially reflected and partially transmitted. NLIW appear at an inshore mooring at the leading edge of the onshore phase of the baroclinic tide, consistent with nonlinear transformation of the shoaling internal tide as their generation mechanism. Of the D2 energy flux observed at the eastern extent of the generation region (133 ± 18 Wm⁻¹), approximately 30% goes into the NLIW observed inshore (36 ± 11 Wm⁻¹). Inshore of the moorings, 7 waves are tracked into shallow (30‐40 m) water, where a vertically sheared, southward current becomes strong. As train‐like waves propagate onshore, wave amplitudes of 25‐30 m and energies of 5 MJ decrease to 12 m and 10 kJ, respectively. The observed direction of propagation rotates from 30° N of E to ∼30° S of E in the strongly sheared region. Linear ray tracing using the Taylor‐Goldstein equation to incorporate parallel shear effects accounts for only a small portion of the observed rotation, suggesting that three‐dimensionality of the wave crests and the background currents is important here.  aPublisher supplied data  aN00014‐15‐1‐2284cOffice of Naval Research  aN00014‐13‐1‐0390cOffice of Naval Research 3aWashington (state) 3acontinental shelf 3aenergy flow 3aequations 3ageophysics 3amicrostructure 3aresearch1 aAlford, Matthew H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6318-07371 aMickett, John B.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Apr., v. 123, no. 4 p.2381-2400dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0133883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245014200188520156000330592002801890650001801918650002701936650003201963650001201995650001802007650001602025650001202041650002302053650001202076650001202088650001202100650001502112650002302127650001102150650002102161650001502182650001402197650002802211650001402239650002602253650001502279650001102294650001302305653002702318653002302345653002002368653002102388653002502409700003902434700002802473700003002501700002502531700003302556700002702589700002802616700001802644700002002662700003702682773012102719856008502840852000902925655001202934IND60782067520221121221453.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1051672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertonceli, Maria Aparecida Aride10aRotenoids from Clitoria fairchildiana R.

Howard is a non-domesticated Fabacea, native from the Amazonian Forest whose seeds are exquisitely refractory to insect predation. Secondary metabolites from these seeds were fractionated by different organic solvents and the CH₂Cl₂ fraction (CFD – Clitoria fairchildiana dichloromethane fraction), as the most toxic to 3rd instar Aedes aegypti larvae (LC₅₀ 180 PPM), was subjected to silica gel chromatography, eluted with a gradient of CH₂Cl₂: MeOH and sub fractioned in nine fractions (CFD1 - CFD9). All obtained fractions were tested in their toxicity to the insect larvae. Two rotenoids, a 11α-O-β-D-glucopyranosylrotenoid and a 6-deoxyclitoriacetal 11-O-n-glucopyranoside, were identified in the mixture of CFD 7.4 and CFD 7.5, and they were toxic (LC₅₀ 120 PPM) to 3rd instar Ae. aegypti larvae, leading to exoskeleton changes, cuticular detachment and perforations in larval thorax and abdomen. These C. fairchildiana rotenoids interfered with the acidification process of cell vesicles in larvae midgut and caused inhibition of 55% of V-ATPases activity of larvae treated with 80 PPM of the compounds, when compared to control larvae. The rotenoids also led to a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in treated larvae, especially in the hindgut region of larvae intestines, indicating a triggering of an oxidative stress process to these insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aClitoria fairchildiana 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aabdomen 3aacidification 3aexoskeleton 3aforests 3agel chromatography 3ahindgut 3ainsects 3ainstars 3ametabolism 3amethylene chloride 3amidgut 3aoxidative stress 3apesticides 3apredation 3areactive oxygen species 3arotenoids 3asecondary metabolites 3asilica gel 3athorax 3atoxicity 0aGlucopyranosylrotenoid 0aButterfly pea tree 0aDengue mosquito 0aOxidative stress 0aV H+-ATPase activity1 aOliveira, Antônia Elenir Amâncio1 ade Souza Passos, Michel1 aVieira, Ivo José Curcino1 aBraz-Filho, Raimundo1 aLemos, Francisco José Alves1 aMartins, Brunna Xavier1 aFaçanha, Arnoldo Rocha1 aPireda, Saulo1 ada Cunha, Maura1 aFernandes, Kátia Valevski Sales0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Aug., v. 186 p.105167-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1051673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245007300214300001200287520109400299592002801393650002001421650002201441650002401463650000901487650001101496650001801507650001601525650001601541650001201557650001501569650001801584650001001602651002101612653003201633653002101665653001101686653001901697653001801716653002401734700001701758700002201775773008801797856008601885852000901971655001201980IND60525916220221118041710.0190402e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052591622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2015.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemirdöğen, Alper1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9729-877910aFood vs. fiber: An analysis of agricultural support policy in Turkey  ap. 1-8.  aThe present study evaluates the effects of agricultural policies on farm land allocation. The analysis is applied to Turkey, a country where a persistent gap between rural income and urban income has motivated governments to enact policies that support farm income. This paper evaluates two sets of policy instruments: output support, which increases farm revenue from specific crops, and input support which subsidizes particular farm inputs. It also investigates the effects of agricultural policy on farmers’ incentive to produce fiber (cotton) versus food (corn and other foods). Using farm-level data from two regions of Turkey, the analysis finds that input supports have had stronger effects on land allocation than output supports. It also shows the presence of significant substitution effects across crops, with the subsidizing of cotton having a significant negative effect on the incentive to grow food crops. This provides useful insights into the economic tradeoff between food and fiber in the design of agricultural policy, and its effects on a country’s food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural policy 3acorn 3acotton 3adietary fiber 3afarm income 3afarm inputs 3afarmers 3afood crops 3afood security 3afoods 3aTurkey (country) 0aAgricultural support policy 0aAcreage response 0aTurkey 0aOutput support 0aInput support 0aSubstitution effect1 aOlhan, Emine1 aChavas, Jean-Paul0 tFood policy.g2016 May, v. 61 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2015.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245029800164300001600462520162000478592002802098650002002126650001302146650001202159650002002171650001402191650001302205650001202218650002302230650002102253650001002274650001302284650001102297650001002308650001602318650000902334650002302343650001002366650001202376650002302388653002702411653001402438653001102452653001302463700002002476700001502496700001802511700002002529773013702549856008202686852000902768655001202777IND60622115120221117175057.0181123e199908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062211512DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013299005004052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruna, J.M.10aEfecto del uso combinado de la Pronasa E y de un extracto fúngico (Mucor racemosus forma sphaerosporus) en la maduración de embutidos crudos curados / Effect of the combined use of Pronase E and a fungal extract (Mucor racemosus forma sphaerosporus) on the ripening of dry fermented sausages  ap. 327-337.  aThe effect of the addition of 600 units of Pronase E/kg of sausage mixture and/or a fungal extract (Mucor racemosus forma sphaerosporus) at two different concentrations (1.75 and 17.5 mg protein/kg sausage mixture) on dry fermented sausages was evaluated. The only addition of protease to sau sages led to an increase in the content of free amino acids and biogenic amines. When the protease and the fungal extract were added together at high concentration (17.5 mg protein/kg sausage mix ture), a decrease in the free amino acid content and a slight increase in the ammonia content were observed, together with a clear increase in the concentration of several volatile compounds, such as 2- and 3-methylbutanal, 2-methylpropanal and 2- and 3-methyl-1-butanol. The addition of the fungal extract only at high concentration (17.5 mg protein/kg sausage mixture) or the combined protease and fungal extract at low concentration (1.75 mg protein/kg sausage mixture), produced slight physi cochemical modifications compared with the corresponding controls. All sausages with Pronase E showed a clear modification of texture, with a marked decrease of hardness, adhesiveness, springi ness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, cutting force and cutting work. Sensory analysis of the different batches of sausages showed that the combined addition of Pronase E (600 units/kg of sau sage mixture) and the Mucor racemosus forma sphaerosporus extract at high concentration (17.5 mg protein/kg of sausage mixture) improved the odor, taste, texture and, in consequence, the global acceptability in relation to the control batch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMucor racemosus 3aadhesion 3aammonia 3abiogenic amines 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acutting 3afermented sausages 3afree amino acids 3afungi 3ahardness 3amixing 3aodors 3aproteinases 3asage 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atexture 3avolatile compounds 0adry fermented sausages 0aproteases 0amoulds 0aripening1 aFernández, M.,1 aHierro, E.1 ade la Hoz, L.1 aOrdóñez, J.A.0 tFood science and technology international.g1999 Aug., v. 5, no. 4 p.327-337dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013299005004053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012700165300002000292520158100312592002801893596005901921650001801980650001701998650001302015650002102028650001902049650002302068650001402091650001402105650001302119650001302132700001902145700001802164700005702182773015602239856008202395852000902477655001202486IND60747573020221121031322.0210815e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074757302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12472-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhengxin10aResearch on the discrepant inhibition mechanism of microcystin-LR disinfectant by-products target to protein phosphatase 1  ap. 45586-45595.  aThe secondary contamination for microcystin disinfection by-products (MC-DBPs) is of concern due to the residual toxic structure similar to their original toxins. To evaluate the toxicity of MC-DBPs, the discrepant inhibition mechanisms target to protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) were evaluated. Five typical MCLR-DBPs related to the oxidation of Adda⁵ were identified as C₄₉H₇₅N₁₀O₁₃Cl (+1Cl1OH, P1/P2), C₃₄H₅₄N₁₀O₁₂ (+2OH, P3/P4), and C₄₉H₇₆N₁₀O₁₄ (P5). Toxicity inhibition experiment on PP1 showed that the toxicity was in the sequence of MCLR > P3 > P1 > P4 > P2 > P5. Base on MOE molecular simulation, the discrepant inhibition mechanisms for MCLR and MCLR-DBPs target to PP1 were further clarified. The combination of MCLR/MCLR-DBPs to PP1 was mainly restrained by residues Adda⁵ and Arg⁴. Above key sites promoted the binding of MCLR/MCLR-DBPs to PP1 through the hydrogen bonds (H₂O ← Adda⁵, Tyr₁₃₄ → Adda⁵, H₂O ← Arg⁴, Tyr₁₃₄ → Arg⁴, Glu₂₇₅ ← Arg⁴), ionic bonds (Asp₁₉₇–Adda⁵, Glu₂₇₅–Arg⁴, Asp₂₂₀ → Arg⁴), and H-pi bonds (Trp₂₀₆ ↔ Adda⁵, Ser₁₂₉ ↔ Adda⁵). The oxidation of Adda⁵ also affected Mdha⁷ participated ionic bond Glu₂₇₅–Mdha⁷ and Glu⁶ participated hydrogen bond H₂O → Glu⁶. Besides, the “integral hydrogen bonds and ionic bonds” between toxin and PP1 also had important effects on the toxin toxicity. In this way, the inhibition of “Adda⁵ destroyed” MC-DBPs target to PP1 was regulated.  aPublisher supplied data  a21876103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3amicrocystin-LR 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxidation 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity1 aWang, Xiaoning1 aZhang, Shuhan1 aZong, Wansong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1027-14640 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 33 p.45586-45595dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12472-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245013600156300001600292520143100308592002801739650001601767650001101783650002101794650001301815650001501828650001401843650000901857650000901866650001101875650001001886700001601896700001301912700001801925700001401943700001701957700001501974773013101989856007802120852000902198655001202207IND60765409520221121003507.0220904e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076540952DNAL7 a10.17221/693/2019-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fa10aEffect of long-term differentiated fertilisation regimes on greenhouse gas emissions from a subtropical rice-wheat cropping system  ap. 167-174.  aA field campaign was conducted using six treatments under the summer rice-winter wheat cultivation system to evaluate the response of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to long-term differentiated fertilisation regimes. The treatments included control, phosphorus plus potassium, nitrogen only, nitrogen plus phosphorus (NP), nitrogen plus potassium, and NP plus potassium (NPK). Compared to the control, mineral fertilisation increased CH<sub>4</sub> emissions during the rice season by 69% to 175%. Phosphorus amendment also enhanced seasonal CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 21% to 34% when compared with the treatments without receiving P, while combined use of P and potassium suppressed seasonal N<sub>2</sub>O emission to the same level of control. Net CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from the dried fallow and wheat seasons and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the flooding rice season dominated annual budgets of individual GHGs. All of the soils under different treatments were net sources of global warming and the overall net global warming potential ranged from 9 799 to 14 178 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq/ha/year with CO<sub>2</sub> emission contributing 52% to 76%, CH<sub>4</sub> contributing 20% to 40% and N<sub>2</sub>O occupying the rest. The annual maximum grain yields and minimum GHG intensity was observed at the NPK treatment, suggesting it to be the environmental-friendly optimum fertilisation regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afallow 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arice 3asoil 3asummer 3awheat1 aMu, Zhijian1 aGuo, Tao1 aHuang, Aiying1 aLin, Xiao1 aShi, Xiaojun1 aNi, Jiupai0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 66, no. 4 p.167-174dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/693/2019-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245008000176300001600256520111000272592002801382650002901410650000801439650002401447650002501471650001201496650002301508650001801531650001601549650001201565650002601577650002001603650001301623650001501636650002001651650003701671653001101708653001801719653002801737653002001765700006401785700001701849700005801866700001801924773013001942856009002072852000902162655001202171IND60628357020221121041902.0210114e20190302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062835702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStulić, Višnja10aProteomic analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae response to plasma treatment  ap. 171-183.  aFood safety is one of the main issues for the food industry. Regarding the increased reports of food-associated infections new non-thermal technologies are rapidly developing and improving. The aim of this research was to define the inactivation, recovery and stress response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 204508 cells after the treatment by high voltage gas phase plasma and liquid phase plasma discharges in bubbles. Variations of the plasma frequency (60, 90 and 120 Hz), input gas (air or argon) and processing time (5 and 10 min) have been used to define plasma effects on S. cerevisiae cells. Complete inactivation's by liquid plasma in bubbles were determined as well as recovery of treated samples. Transmission electron microscopy figures showed cells with the normal cell shape and intact inner and outer membrane after the plasma treatments. Proteomic analyses indicated overexpressed proteins which contributed in cell defense mechanisms to overcome stress conditions. S. cerevisiae ATCC 204508 cells were under the stress, but with the proven ability to recover its metabolic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aair 3aargon (noble gases) 3abiochemical pathways 3abubbles 3adefense mechanisms 3afood industry 3afood safety 3aliquids 3anonthermal processing 3aprocessing time 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3astress response 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aPlasma 0aS. cerevisiae 0aYeast cell inactivation 0aStress response1 aVukušić, Tomislava1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8014-41241 aButorac, Ana1 aPopović, Dean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3906-34821 aHerceg, Zoran0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Mar. 02, v. 292 p.171-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245017900172300001600351520174400367592002802111650001902139650002302158650001202181650001602193650002802209650001002237650002402247650001402271650001602285650001002301650001802311650002302329650000802352650001702360650002202377650001702399650001202416650001702428650001802445650001602463650001302479653003002492653001602522653001602538653001902554653002502573653001802598700002302616700001402639773011402653856008302767852000902850655001202859IND60688771820221118011315.0201025e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068877182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulsen Nautrup, B.14aThe effect of immunization against gonadotropin-releasing factor in market gilts: Meta-analyses of parameters relevant for pig producers, pork packers and retailers/consumers  ap. 159-172.  aThe vaccine against gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF), Improvac®, has recently emerged as an option for rearing market gilts up to heavier harvest weights. Improvac's® temporary suppression of the ovarian function and gonadal hormones results in greater feed intake and better welfare from avoidance of sexual behavioral problems.Based on 22 published articles, our meta-analysis has quantified the effect of immunizing gilts against GnRF on parameters relevant for pig producers, pork packers and retailers/consumers. The meta-analyses included growth performance and final harvest parameters, general carcass traits and yield of valuable meat, meat and fat quality parameters. Primary analyses considered studies without ractopamine, subgroup and additional analyses assessed the impact of co-variates.From the perspective of pig producers, primary analyses showed that immunized (IM) gilts have significantly (P < 0.001) increased average daily gain (+45.1 g/day) and daily feed intake (+0.19 kg/day), higher final live weight (+4.0 kg) and more backfat (+2.8 mm). From the perspective of the pork packers, IM gilts have heavier carcasses (+3.2 kg; P < 0.001), whereas dressing percentage is similar. IM gilts are less lean (−1.5% units; P < 0.001) and have 0.21% units more intramuscular fat (P = 0.001). The yield of ham, shoulder, and loin is similar, whereas the yield of belly is significantly higher (+0.28 kg; P < 0.001). There are no differences in meat quality parameters (color, pH₂₄, and drip loss) between IM gilts and untreated gilts, whereas a lower iodine value in IM gilts indicates an improved fat quality. Further subgroup and additional analyses confirmed the validity of our meta-analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abody weight 3acarcass characteristics 3acolor 3adressing percentage 3adrip loss 3afeed intake 3agilts 3agonadotropins 3agrowth performance 3aham 3aimmunization 3aintramuscular fat 3aiodine value 3amarkets 3ameat quality 3ameta-analysis 3aractopamine 3avaccines 0aImmunization against GnRF 0aFemale pigs 0aPerformance 0aCarcass traits 0aMeat characteristics 0aMeta-analysis1 aVan Vlaenderen, I.1 aMah, C.K.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 Aug., v. 131 p.159-172dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011200166520124300278592002801521650000801549650000801557650003201565650001501597650002201612650001001634650001201644700002801656700002601684700003201710773012201742856007401864852000901938655001201947IND60757972520221119055019.0211125e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075797252DNAL7 a10.3390/v131123042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberemok, Volodymyr V.10aTop Three Strategies of ss(+)RNA Plant Viruses: Great Opportunists and Ecosystem Tuners with a Small Genome  ass(+)RNA viruses represent the dominant group of plant viruses. They owe their evolutionary superiority to the large number of mutations that occur during replication, courtesy of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Natural selection rewards successful viral subtypes, whose effective tuning of the ecosystem regulates the interactions between its participants. Thus, ss(+)RNA viruses act as shuttles for the functionally important genes of the participants in symbiotic relationships within the ecosystem, of which the most common ecological triad is “plant–virus–insect”. Due to their short life cycle and large number of offspring, RNA viruses act as skillful tuners of the ecosystem, which benefits both viruses and the system as a whole. A fundamental understanding of this aspect of the role played by viruses in the ecosystem makes it possible to apply this knowledge to the creation of DNA insecticides. In fact, since the genes that viruses are involved in transferring are functionally important for both insects and plants, silencing these genes (for example, in insects) can be used to regulate the pest population. RNA viruses are increasingly treated not as micropathogens but as necessary regulators of ecosystem balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aecosystems 3anatural selection 3apests 3aprogeny1 aPuzanova, Yelizaveta V.1 aKubyshkin, Anatoly V.1 aKamenetsky-Goldstein, Rina 0 tViruses.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131123043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013000173300001800303520095600321592002801277650002301305650002001328650001201348650001801360650001501378650001001393650001801403650001201421650001301433650002501446650001501471650001401486650001901500651002401519653001801543653001201561653001201573700002101585700002401606700002201630773011201652856005101764852000901815655001201824IND50086038920221123031338.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008603892DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2011.5808192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSweeney, Daniel W.10aNitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium effects on grain sorghum production and stalk rot following alfalfa and birdsfoot trefoil  ap. 1330-1340.  aGrain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)], grown on the often infertile claypan soils of the eastern Great Plains, requires attention to soil fertility. Experimental objectives were to determine the effects of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertility levels, N application, and legume residual on grain sorghum production and stalk rot. Following alfalfa and birdsfoot trefoil, first-year sorghum yield was 7 Mg ha⁻¹ and not affected by N fertilizer. In subsequent years, yield increases due to N were less than 20%. Sorghum yield increased at low P and K rates, especially with nitrogen (N) fertilization and was greater following birdsfoot trefoil than following alfalfa. In 1995 when fertilized with N, lodging and stalk rot severity were increased by P and reduced by K. In 1996, stalk rot severity was reduced by K fertilization. Grain sorghum, grown after legume crops, required minimal levels of P and K, especially when N fertilizer was added.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLotus corniculatus 3aSorghum bicolor 3aalfalfa 3aclaypan soils 3acrop yield 3acrops 3agrain sorghum 3alodging 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3aGreat Plains region 0afertilization 0alegumes 0adisease1 aMoyer, Joseph L.1 aJardine, Douglas J.1 aWhitney, David A.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 June 1, v. 34, no. 9 p.1330-1340dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2011.580819  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003900155245013500194300001400329520156800343592002801911650004401939650002601983650002402009650001102033650003802044650001002082650001802092650001302110650001802123650001002141650001102151650001502162650002802177650002502205650002002230650001602250650002402266650002102290650001902311653001802330653002002348653002202368653002202390700003202412700002302444773012802467856009002595852000902685655001202694IND60628357120221121063917.0190318e20190316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062835712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinilla, Cristian Mauricio Barreto10aAntifungal properties of phosphatidylcholine-oleic acid liposomes encapsulating garlic against environmental fungal in wheat bread  ap. 72-78.  aLiposomes have gained great interest in the food and pharmaceutical industry as colloidal carriers of bioactive compounds. In this work, liposomes of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and oleic acid (OA) encapsulating garlic extract (GE) were developed to determine its aptitude as antifungal agent in wheat bread. The influence of GE on the properties of liposomes were followed by determination of size, Zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared patterns (FTIR), morphology, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) techniques. The produced PC-OA-GE liposomes showed spherical morphology with narrow size distribution, entrapment efficiency of 79.7% and zeta potential of −27.9 mV. In vitro antifungal test showed noticeable inhibitory activities for free and encapsulated GE against selected fungal strains. TGA analysis revealed that the presence of OA and GE in the formulation retards the liposomal thermal decomposition, as compared with the pure PC liposomes and the DSC enthalpy and main transition temperature variation in PC-OA-GE liposomes suggested a strong heat-induced rigidifying effect that could be attributed to the presence of garlic polysaccharides in the liposome surface, observed by FTIR. In the in situ test, the bread formulations with free or liposome-encapsulated GE (0.65 mL/100 g of dough) were microbiologically more stable as compared with the controls, showing mold inhibition for five days. Therefore, liposomes formulated with OA and GE showed potential as natural antifungal agent in bakery products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantifungal properties 3abioactive compounds 3abreads 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adough 3aencapsulation 3aenthalpy 3afood industry 3afungi 3agarlic 3aoleic acid 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential 0aAntimicrobial 0aBiopreservative 0aNatural compounds 0aNanobiotechnology1 aThys, Roberta Cruz Silveira1 aBrandelli, Adriano0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Mar. 16, v. 293 p.72-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04226naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003000180245012400210300001800334506007600352520168100428592002802109506003702137650002202174650002302196650001202219650002202231650002202253650001302275650001502288650001702303653003302320653001902353653001702372653001202389653001602401653002502417653001402442700001802456700001602474700001902490700002702509700002002536700002202556700002002578700002102598700001702619700001702636700001802653700002102671700002302692700001602715700002102731700001802752700002402770700001802794700001802812700002202830700002202852700001702874700002102891700001702912700001702929700001902946700002102965700002402986700002003010700002203030700002203052700001903074700001803093700002603111700002103137773011803158856007503276852000903351655001203360IND60567941420221207073116.0170501e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056794142DNAL7 a10.1021/pr201071t2doi7 aPMC32721022pmcid7 a220538642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinsinger, Christopher R.10aRecommendations for Mass Spectrometry Data Quality Metrics for Open Access Data (Corollary to the Amsterdam Principles)  ap. 1412-1419.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolicies supporting the rapid and open sharing of proteomic data are being implemented by the leading journals in the field. The proteomics community is taking steps to ensure that data are made publicly accessible and are of high quality, a challenging task that requires the development and deployment of methods for measuring and documenting data quality metrics. On September 18, 2010, the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened the “International Workshop on Proteomic Data Quality Metrics” in Sydney, Australia, to identify and address issues facing the development and use of such methods for open access proteomics data. The stakeholders at the workshop enumerated the key principles underlying a framework for data quality assessment in mass spectrometry data that will meet the needs of the research community, journals, funding agencies, and data repositories. Attendees discussed and agreed up on two primary needs for the wide use of quality metrics: (1) an evolving list of comprehensive quality metrics and (2) standards accompanied by software analytics. Attendees stressed the importance of increased education and training programs to promote reliable protocols in proteomics. This workshop report explores the historic precedents, key discussions, and necessary next steps to enhance the quality of open access data.By agreement, this article is published simultaneously in the Journal of Proteome Research, Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, Proteomics, and Proteomics Clinical Applications as a public service to the research community. The peer review process was a coordinated effort conducted by a panel of referees selected by the journals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3aeducation programs 3afunding 3aissues and policy 3amass spectrometry 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3astakeholders 0aselected reaction monitoring 0abioinformatics 0adata quality 0ametrics 0aopen access 0aAmsterdam Principles 0astandards1 aApffel, James1 aBaker, Mark1 aBian, Xiaopeng1 aBorchers, Christoph H.1 aBradshaw, Ralph1 aBrusniak, Mi-Youn1 aChan, Daniel W.1 aDeutsch, Eric W.1 aDomon, Bruno1 aGorman, Jeff1 aGrimm, Rudolf1 aHancock, William1 aHermjakob, Henning1 aHorn, David1 aHunter, Christie1 aKolar, Patrik1 aKraus, Hans-Joachim1 aLangen, Hanno1 aLinding, Rune1 aMoritz, Robert L.1 aOmenn, Gilbert S.1 aOrlando, Ron1 aPandey, Akhilesh1 aPing, Peipei1 aRahbar, Amir1 aRivers, Robert1 aSeymour, Sean L.1 aSimpson, Richard J.1 aSlotta, Douglas1 aSmith, Richard D.1 aStein, Stephen E.1 aTabb, David L.1 aTagle, Danilo1 aYates, John R.,cIII,1 aRodriguez, Henry0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2012 Feb. 03, v. 11, no. 2 p.1412-1419dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fpr201071t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010300163520122000266592002801486650002501514650003201539650001101571650001601582650001001598650001301608650001001621650002601631650001601657700002201673700002301695700002601718700002701744700002501771700002701796773012201823856007401945852000902019655001202028IND60757972620221119055017.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075797262DNAL7 a10.3390/v131123052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostygov, Alexei Y.10aAnalyses of Leishmania-LRV Co-Phylogenetic Patterns and Evolutionary Variability of Viral Proteins  aLeishmania spp. are important pathogens causing a vector-borne disease with a broad range of clinical manifestations from self-healing ulcers to the life-threatening visceral forms. Presence of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) confers survival advantage to these parasites by suppressing anti-leishmanial immunity in the vertebrate host. The two viral species, LRV1 and LRV2 infect species of the subgenera Viannia and Leishmania, respectively. In this work we investigated co-phylogenetic patterns of leishmaniae and their viruses on a small scale (LRV2 in L. major) and demonstrated their predominant coevolution, occasionally broken by intraspecific host switches. Our analysis of the two viral genes, encoding the capsid and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), revealed them to be under the pressure of purifying selection, which was considerably stronger for the former gene across the whole tree. The selective pressure also differs between the LRV clades and correlates with the frequency of interspecific host switches. In addition, using experimental (capsid) and predicted (RDRP) models we demonstrated that the evolutionary variability across the structure is strikingly different in these two viral proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania RNA virus 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3acapsid 3acoevolution 3agenes 3aimmunity 3atrees 3avector-borne diseases 3avertebrates1 aGrybchuk, Danyil 1 aKleschenko, Yulia 1 aChistyakov, Daniil S.1 aLukashev, Alexander N.1 aGerasimov, Evgeny S.1 aYurchenko, Vyacheslav 0 tViruses.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131123053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04038naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010800171520246000279592002802739650000802767650001302775650001402788650002102802650001502823650001502838650002402853650001702877650001702894650001502911650001602926650003002942650001502972650002902987653001603016653001503032653001703047653001803064653002503082700001503107700002403122700002103146700002503167700001803192700002303210700002503233700001803258700002103276773010603297856008403403852000903487655001203496IND60780615020221119193359.0220706e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078061502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2022.1046602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Nelson C.10aUnveiling the mechanism of action of nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds using a multi-omics approach  aThe 2020 global cancer registry has ranked breast cancer (BCa) as the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Increasing resistance and significant side effects continue to limit the efficacy of anti-BCa drugs, hence the need to identify new drug targets and to develop novel compounds to overcome these limitations. Nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds are becoming increasingly popular since they often provide a relatively safe and effective alternative. In this study, we employed multi-omics techniques to gain insights into the relevant mechanism of action of two recently identified new nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds (SIMR3066 and SIMR3058). Discovery proteomics analysis combined with LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on compound-treated vs DMSO-treated (control) MCF-7 cells. Downstream protein functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the responsive proteins were functionally associated with antigen processing and neutrophil degranulation, RNA catabolism and protein folding as well as cytoplasmic vesicle lumen and mitochondrial matrix formation. Consistent with the proteomics findings, metabolomic pathway analysis suggested that the differentially abundant compounds indicated altered metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, metabolomics-based enriched-for-action pathway analysis showed that the two compounds associate with mercaptopurine, thioguanine and azathioprine related pathways. Lastly, integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis revealed that treatment of BCa with SIMR3066 disrupts several signaling pathways including p53-mediated apoptosis and the circadian entertainment pathway. Overall, the multi-omics approach we used in this study indicated that it is a powerful tool in probing the mechanism of action of lead drug candidates. In this study we adopted a multi-omics (proteomics and metabolomics) strategy to learn more about the molecular mechanisms of action of nature-inspired potential anticancer drugs. Following treatment with SIMR3066 or SIMR3058, the integration of these multi-omics data sets revealed which biological pathways are altered in BCa cells. This study demonstrates that combining proteomics with metabolomics is a powerful method to investigate the mechanism of action of potential anticancer lead drug candidates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acatabolism 3aglycolysis 3amechanism of action 3ametabolomics 3amitochondria 3amultiomics 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aproteomics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0aMulti-omics 0aProteomics 0aMetabolomics 0aBreast Cancer 0aAnticancer compounds1 aAli, Amjad1 aSrinivasulu, Vunnam1 aSharaf, Basma M.1 aGiddey, Alexander D.1 aOkendo, Javan1 aAl-Hroub, Hamza M.1 aSemreen, Mohammad H.1 aHamad, Mawieh1 aAl-Tel, Taleb H.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 265 p.104660-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2022.1046603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003400155245009700189300001400286520141800300592002801718650002501746650002301771650001601794650001501810650000901825650002001834650001901854650001101873650002601884650002501910650002601935653002501961653002901986653003302015653001802048700002302066700002602089700003902115773012702154856009002281852000902371655001202380IND60628357220221121152612.0190326e20190502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062835722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenezes, Natielle Maria Costa10aEffect of soluble solids concentration on Neosartorya fischeri inactivation using UV-C light  ap. 43-47.  aAscospores of Neosartorya fischeri are heat-resistant and can survive thermal commercial treatments normally applied to the juices, as apple juice. Non-thermal processing of food such as exposure to ultraviolet light (UV-C) is reported to induce minimal quality changes while reduces microbial load. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect at different soluble solids concentration (12, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 °Brix) on N. fischeri ascospores inactivation in apple juice, using UV-C light intensity (38 W/m2). Weibull model was fitted to experimental data. Then, a secondary model was used to describe how the inactivation kinetic parameters varied with the changes in soluble solids concentration. Results showed that the UV-C light had influence on N. fischeri ascospores inactivation in apple juice even at the highest soluble solids concentrations used, reaching approximately 4 log reductions at all concentrations used. The inactivation parameters, obtained by Weibull model, were δ (dose for the first decimal reduction) and p (the shape factor). Exponential model was chosen to describe the influence of soluble solids concentration on δ and p parameters. It can be concluded that UV-C light is a promising treatment with a drastic impact on the loads of N. fischeri, especially when low soluble solids concentration is used and a model was obtained to describe Brix effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fischeri 3aWeibull statistics 3aapple juice 3aascospores 3abrix 3alight intensity 3amicrobial load 3amodels 3anonthermal processing 3atotal soluble solids 3aultraviolet radiation 0aNeosartorya fischeri 0aUltraviolet light (UV-C) 0aSoluble solids concentration 0aWeibull model1 aTremarin, Andréia1 aJunior, Agenor Furigo1 ade Aragão, Glaúcia Maria Falcão0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 May 02, v. 296 p.43-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012000163520132000283592002801603650002301631650000801654650005201662650002301714650002001737650001601757650001401773650001601787650001701803700002501820700002201845700002401867700002601891700002701917773012201944856007402066852000902140655001202149IND60757972720221119055242.0211125e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075797272DNAL7 a10.3390/v131121082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, João H. C.10aDirect RNA Sequencing Reveals SARS-CoV-2 m6A Sites and Possible Differential DRACH Motif Methylation among Variants  aThe causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, has a 29,903 bases positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. RNAs exhibit about 150 modified bases that are essential for proper function. Among internal modified bases, the N⁶-methyladenosine, or m6A, is the most frequent, and is implicated in SARS-CoV-2 immune response evasion. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is RNA, almost all genomes sequenced thus far are, in fact, reverse transcribed complementary DNAs. This process reduces the true complexity of these viral genomes because the incorporation of dNTPs hides RNA base modifications. Here, we present an initial exploration of Nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the m6A residues in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, ORF10 and the 3′-untranslated region. We identified fifteen m6A methylated positions, of which, six are in ORF N. Additionally, because m6A is associated with the DRACH motif, we compared its distribution in major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Although DRACH is highly conserved among variants, we show that variants Beta and Eta have a fourth position C > U change in DRACH at 28,884b that could affect methylation. This is the first report of direct RNA sequencing of a Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 sample coupled with the identification of modified bases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aetiological agents 3aimmune response 3amethylation 3ananopores 3anucleobases 3aviral genome1 aMaricato, Juliana T.1 aBraconi, Carla T.1 aAntoneli, Fernando 1 aJanini, Luiz Mario R.1 aBriones, Marcelo R.

Isolated microspore culture (IMC) can accelerate plant homozygosity instead of self-pollinations. However, the application of IMC in cut flower ornamental kale was rare since its low rate of embryogenesis. It is proved that histone acetylation might affect the gene expression in microspores and led to the transformation of microspores from pollen development pathway to embryogenesis. In this paper, microspores, derived from three varieties of cut flower ornamental kale, Crane Bicolor (CB), Crane Pink (CP) and Crane Feather Queen (CFQ), were treated with histone deacetylation inhibitor (HDACI) trichostatin A (TSA). Results revealed that the appropriate concentration of TSA was 10 nM for CB with obtaining 5.39 embryos per bud, while for CP and CFQ was 5 nM with acquiring 10.89 and 16.99 embryos per bud, respectively. TSA treatment also reduced the embryonic mortality, of which 10 nM TSA treatments CB was the optimal and the embryonic mortality decreased to 25.01%. The double haploid (DH) proportion of regenerated plants reached 37.3%. These results contribute to improving the technology for IMC in cut flower ornamental kale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. sabellica 3aacetylation 3acultivars 3acut flowers 3adoubled haploids 3aembryogenesis 3aembryonic mortality 3agene expression 3ahistones 3ahomozygosity 3akale 3aplantlets 3apollen1 aSong, Gengxing 1 aZhao, Yonghui 1 aFang, Bing 1 aLiu, Zhiyong 1 aRen, Jie 1 aFeng, Hui 0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80907903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005500165300001800220520115700238592002801395650001201423650001301435650002001448650001101468650002301479650001501502650001701517650001201534650001001546650002501556650001301581650001701594650000901611653000901620653002901629653002201658653002101680653001701701700001501718700001301733700001501746700001301761700001401774773011201788856005101900852000901951655001201960IND50086039220221123031343.0140412e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008603922DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2011.5808792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, A.Q.10aEffect of zinc on cadmium toxicity in winter wheat  ap. 1372-1385.  aThis nutrient solution experiment investigated the effects of zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) on winter wheat growth and enzymatic activity. Twelve nutrient solution treatments were prepared of four zinc levels (0, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg L⁻¹) and three cadmium levels (0, 5 and 50 mg L⁻¹). Cadmium concentrations ≥5 mg L⁻¹ decreased plant growth, superoxide dismutase activity, and leaf and stem zinc concentrations, but increased plant cadmium concentrations, proline content, and peroxidase and catalase activities. Root activity and zinc concentration were highest in the 5 mg L⁻¹ treatment and lowest in the 50 mg L⁻¹ treatment. Zinc concentrations ≥5 mg L⁻¹ inhibited plant growth, but increased proline content and cadmium concentration in stems and leaves. Low levels of zinc (0.5 mg L⁻¹) increased cadmium-induced toxicity in wheat plants but high levels of zinc (50 mg L⁻¹) reduced. In conclusion, these results indicated that the addition of zinc alleviated cadmium toxicity if the zinc/cadmium ratio was >10/1. Additional study needs to be done to quantify zinc content before zinc is supplied to alleviate cadmium toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aproline 3astems 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3awinter wheat 3azinc 0azinc 0acadmium-induced toxicity 0agrowth inhibition 0aoxidative stress 0awinter wheat1 aTian, X.H.1 aLu, W.H.1 aGale, W.J.1 aLu, X.C.1 aCao, Y.X.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 June 1, v. 34, no. 9 p.1372-1385dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2011.580879  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245018400182300001400366520122600380592002801606650001901634650001601653650001601669650002201685650001601707650001301723650001101736650001701747650001701764650001701781650002301798650001201821650001601833650001701849650004401866650000701910650001801917650001101935650002301946650001301969650001701982650001901999650000902018653000702027653000902034653001102043653000802054653000802062653000802070653000802078653000802086653000802094653000902102653000802111653000702119653000802126653001702134653001902151653001602170700002602186700001902212700001702231700002202248700002402270773012802294856009002422852000902512655001202521IND60628357420221121120953.0190318e20190316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062835742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJääskeläinen, Elina10aMetabolomics and bacterial diversity of packaged yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and salmon (Salmo salar) show fish species-specific spoilage development during chilled storage  ap. 44-52.  aMicrobial (colony counts, 16S rRNA gene amplification), chemical (pH, 1H NMR spectroscopy) and sensory changes in raw Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) and tuna (Thunnus albacares) fillets stored under vacuum at 3 °C were evaluated over a period of 12 days. Both species of fish are globally important and among the ten most consumed fishes in the world. Although the sensory analyses showed a decrease in the quality of both fish species, only the salmon fillets were considered spoiled at the end of the storage period. In salmon, trimethylamine was the main spoilage product and bacterial colony counts reached an average of 7.3 log10 cfu/g. The concentration of glucose decreased and the concentration of organic acids increased during storage revealing glucose fermentation. Photobacterium was the dominating genus in the salmon studied. In the tuna studied, the bacterial colony counts reached only an average of 4.6 log10 cfu/g. The dominating bacteria in tuna were Pseudomonas spp. Glucose levels did not decrease, suggesting that amino acids and lactate most likely acted as carbon sources for bacteria in tuna. In conclusion, the study revealed that salmon was clearly a more perishable fish than tuna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhotobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aSalmo salar 3aThunnus albacares 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acold storage 3afermentation 3afish fillets 3agene amplification 3aglucose 3alactic acid 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aribosomal RNA 3asalmon 3asensory evaluation 3aspoilage 3astorage time 3atrimethylamine 3atuna 0aAQ 0aFIDs 0a1H NMR 0aIMP 0aLAB 0aMAP 0aOTU 0aSSO 0aTMA 0aTMAO 0aTSP 0aVP 0aWSE 0aFish quality 0aPhotobacterium 0aPseudomonas1 aJakobsen, Louise M.A.1 aHultman, Jenni1 aEggers, Nina1 aBertram, Hanne C.1 aBjörkroth, Johanna0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Mar. 16, v. 293 p.44-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008500172300001400257520172100271592002801992650001702020650001402037650001302051650001902064650002402083650001902107650001802126650003402144650002202178650001702200650001302217650001502230650002402245650001702269650001002286650001502296651001302311653001702324653002402341653002402365653001102389653001902400653002102419700002102440700001702461700002502478773009102503856008102594852000902675655001202684IND60611164520221123015553.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061116452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2016.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, Maria João10aWeight following birth and childhood dietary intake: A prospective cohort study  ap. 58-64.  aUnhealthy childhood dietary habits track through life and are independent and modifiable risk factors for disease. Therefore, it is essential to understand the factors involved. We aimed to evaluate the associations of birthweight (BW) and newborn weight change (NWC) during the first 96 h of life and childhood longitudinal weight trajectories with dietary intake at age 4.As part of the Generation XXI birth cohort (G21), children were recruited in 2005 and 2006 at all public units providing obstetrical and neonatal care in Porto, Portugal. Information was collected by face-to-face interview and abstracted from clinical records. At age 4, weight measurements recorded from birth to current age were abstracted and weight trajectories estimated. Food frequency questionnaires were applied, and three dietary patterns (DPs) were identified: “Energy-dense food (EDF)+Dairy,” “Lower in Healthy Food,” and “Healthier.” Logistic regression models were used to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (OR [95% CI]) in a sample of 775 children.Children with higher BW were less frequently in the “EDF+Dairy” DP (0.94 [0.89–0.98] per 100 g increase in BW). Children with higher NWC had lower odds of eating fruit ≥3/d (0.93 [0.87–0.99] per 1% increase in NWC). Children with higher weight during childhood had higher odds of belonging to the “EDF+Dairy” DP (1.90 [1.04–3.47]) and lower odds of eating vegetable soup ≥2/d (0.56 [0.34–0.91]). Children showing catch-up grow in the first year of life had higher odds of eating dairy products ≥3/d (3.76 [1.31–10.80]).The way that children grow during childhood played a major role on dietary intake at age 4.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3achildhood 3achildren 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adairy products 3aeating habits 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruit consumption 3ahealthy diet 3aneonates 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asoups 3avegetables 3aPortugal 0aBirth weight 0aNewborn weight loss 0aWeight trajectories 0aWeight 0aDietary intake 0aDietary patterns1 aDurão, Catarina1 aLopes, Carla1 aSantos, Ana Cristina0 tNutrition.g2017 Jan., v. 33 p.58-64dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245008500179520187900264592002802143650002602171650002602197650001602223650002302239650002302262650000902285650001802294650002402312650001302336650001702349650001302366650001402379650001502393650001802408650001702426650003502443650001502478650001802493653002002511653000802531653001102539653001702550653000902567653001602576700001902592700001902611700002002630700002002650773009602670856008502766852000902851655001202860IND60780615420221119193210.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078061542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2022.1009672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundaray, Jitendra Kumar10aAquaculture omics: An update on the current status of research and data analysis  aAquaculture is the fast-growing agricultural sector and has the ability to meet the growing demand for protein nutritional security for future population. In future aquaculture is going to be the major source of fish proteins as capture fisheries reached at its maximum. However, several challenges need to overcome such as lack of genetically improved strains/varieties, lack of species-specific feed/functional feed, round the year availability of quality fish seed, pollution of ecosystems and increased frequencies of disease occurrence etc. In recent years, the continuous development of high throughput sequencing technology has revolutionized the biological sciences and provided necessary tools. Application of ‘omics’ in aquaculture research have been successfully used to resolve several productive and reproductive issues and thus ensure its sustainability and profitability. To date, high quality draft genomes of over fifty fish species have been generated and successfully used to develop large number of single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs), marker panels and other genomic resources etc in several aquaculture species. Similarly, transcriptome profiling and miRNAs analysis have been used in aquaculture research to identify key transcripts and expression analysis of candidate genes/miRNAs involved in reproduction, immunity, growth, development, stress toxicology and disease. Metagenome analysis emerged as a promising scientific tool to analyze the complex genomes contained within microbial communities. Metagenomics has been successfully used in the aquaculture sector to identify novel and potential pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes, microbial roles in microcosms, microbial communities forming biofloc, probiotics etc. In the current review, we discussed application of high-throughput technologies (NGS) in the aquaculture sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3abiofloc technology 3adisease occurrence 3afish 3afood security 3agenetic improvement 3aimmunity 3ametagenomics 3amicroRNA 3apollution 3aprobiotics 3aprofitability 3areproduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atoxicology 3atranscriptome 0aTranscriptomics 0aNGS 0amiRNAs 0aMetagenomics 0aSNPs 0aAquaculture1 aDixit, Sangita1 aRather, Ashraf1 aRasal, Kiran D.1 aSahoo, Lakshman0 tMarine genomics.g2022 Aug., v. 64 p.100967-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12137x1874-77877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2022.1009673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04053naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010600163300001800269520215500287592002802442650001502470650001202485650002102497650001202518650001202530650001102542650001602553650001102569650001702580650002202597650002302619650001602642650002002658650001302678650002102691650001402712650001402726650002402740650000702764650001502771650001702786650001402803650001202817650001302829650001402842650002002856650001902876650002002895650001302915650000902928650000902937651001702946653002002963653002202983653001103005653001003016653001103026653001103037653002503048653002003073700002003093700001403113700001903127773011303146856005103259852000903310655001203319IND50086039520221120191234.0140412e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008603952DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2011.5851992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, P.10aEffect of soil amendment with alfalfa powders and distillers grains on nutrition and growth of canola  ap. 1403-1417.  aTwo pot experiments were carried out under controlled environment conditions in the growth chamber to assess the potential use of alfalfa powders and distiller grains as organic fertilizers. Two types of dehydrated alfalfa powders (one with canola meal protein extraction by-product and one without) and two types of distiller grains (dried distillers grain with distillation solubles added and wet distillers grain without solubles) from wheat-based ethanol production were evaluated. Four different nitrogen (N)-based amendment application rates (0, 100, 200 and 400 kg N ha⁻¹) were used along with urea applications made at the same N rates to a Brown Chernozem (Aridic Haploboroll) loamy textured soil collected from south-central Saskatchewan, Canada. Canola biomass yield, N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd) uptake were measured along with soil properties including pH, salinity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus and extractable nutrients and cadmium before and after canola growth in each of the treatments. Application of alfalfa powder and distiller grain amendments resulted in significant canola biomass yield increases along with increased N, P, and K uptake compared to the unfertilized control. However, only a portion of the N added (∼30% to 50%) in the organic amendments was rendered available over the five week duration of the experiments. Amendments that had higher N content and lower carbon (C):N ratios such as dried distillers grain with solubles resulted in greater canola N uptake. Reduced germination and emergence of canola seedlings was observed at high rates of addition of distillers grain (400 kg N ha⁻¹), the reason for which is unclear but may be due to a localized salt or toxicity effect of the amendment. The amendment with alfalfa powders and distiller grains resulted in small increases in residual soil nutrients. Effects on pH, salinity, organic carbon and extractable metals tended to be small and often not significant. Alfalfa powders and distillers grains appear to be quite effective in supplying nutrients, especially N, for plant growth over the short-term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aalfalfa 3aapplication rate 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acanola 3acanola meal 3acarbon 3adistillation 3adistillers grains 3aethanol production 3agermination 3agrowth chambers 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aorganic fertilizers 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3apowders 3asalinity 3aseedlings 3asoil amendments 3asoil nutrients 3asoil properties 3atoxicity 3aurea 3azinc 3aSaskatchewan 0aalfalfa powders 0adistillers grains 0acanola 0ayield 0auptake 0asoil N 0aP and K availability 0asoil parameters1 aSchoenau, J.

The following heritabilities were estimated (first number: Large White, second number: Landrace): 0.10 &plusmn; 0.004 and 0.09 &plusmn; 0.007 for total number born; 0.09 &plusmn; 0.005 and 0.07 &plusmn; 0.008 for number weaned; 0.39 &plusmn; 0.004 and 0.36 &plusmn; 0.009 for lean meat content; 0.21 &plusmn; 0.004 and 0.18 &plusmn; 0.006 for daily gain. The highest genetic correlation (approximately 0.85 in both breeds) was estimated between both litter size traits. In Czech Landrace, all remaining genetic correlations were < 0.20 in their absolute value. Negative correlations of approximately ‑0.25 were estimated in Czech Large White between daily gain and both reproduction traits. All remaining correlations in Czech Large White were also < 0.20 in their absolute value. The estimated non-zero correlations between production and reproduction traits are, besides of other arguments, one reason to recommend a joint genetic evaluation of production and reproduction traits. If more than one litter trait is included in the genetic evaluation, repeatability models should be used instead of separate treating the first and the second and subsequent litters; this is because of the high correlations among litter size traits which are expected to cause numerical problems if multi-parity models are used. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aanimal models 3aaverage daily gain 3agenetic correlation 3alandraces 3alean meat 3alitter size1 aWolf, J.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 58, no. 9 p.429-436dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6943-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013400173300001400307520183000321592002802151650002102179650002402200650001202224650001202236650002002248650001502268650001802283650001502301650001302316650002102329650001202350650001402362650001102376650000702387650001302394650002302407650002102430650000902451650001102460650001902471650001702490650001702507650001102524650001002535650002002545651002802565651001102593773010102604856004802705852000902753655001202762IND50073069520221121100954.0140215e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007306952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-013-0418-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietrzykowski, Marcin10aSoil quality index as a tool for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) monoculture conversion planning on afforested, reclaimed mine land  ap. 63-74.  aIn Central Europe, a large portion of post-mining sites were afforested with Scots pine, which is characterized by good adaptability and a tolerance for poor habitat at the beginning of forest ecosystem development. Conversion of monoculture on mine sites into more biodiverse mixed hardwood forests, especially on more fertile deposits, can be an emerging need in this part of Europe in next decades. The ability to classify the forests at these post-mining sites will facilitate proper species selection as well as the management and formation of the developed ecosystem’s stability. This work describes the guidelines that can be followed to assess reclaimed mine soil (RMS) quality, using the mine soil quality index (MSQI) and a classification of developed forest sites as a basis of tree-stand species selection and conversion of pine monocultures. The research was conducted on four post-mining facilities (lignite, hard coal, sulphur, and sand pit mining areas) on different RMS substrates dominant in Central Europe. Soil quality assessment takes into account the following features of the soil: texture soil nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, Na, P); acidity (pH KCl); and Cₒᵣg-to-Nₜ ratio in the initial organic horizon. An analysis was conducted of classification systems using the MSQI validation correlation (at p =0.05) with vegetation features affected by succession: aboveground biomass of forest floor and ecological indicators of vascular plants (calculated on the basis of Ellenberg’s (2009) system). Eventually, in the analysed data set, the MSQI ranged from 0.270 for soils on quaternary sands to 0.720 for a mix of quaternary loamy sands with neogene clays. Potential forest habitat types and the role of the pine in the next generation of tree stands on different RMS parent rock substrate were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aaboveground biomass 3aacidity 3acalcium 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aforest litter 3aguidelines 3ahabitats 3ahardwood forests 3alignite 3amagnesium 3amining 3apH 3aplanning 3apotassium chloride 3aquaternary soils 3asand 3asodium 3asoil nutrients 3asoil quality 3asoil texture 3asulfur 3atrees 3avascular plants 3aCentral European region 3aEurope0 tJournal of forestry research.g2014 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.63-74dSpringer-Verlagx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-013-0418-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245012100187300001600308520112200324592002801446650002601474650001601500650000901516650002001525650001401545650001801559650001101577650001701588650002201605650001701627650002801644653002301672653003401695653002501729653001801754653002201772653001601794700002501810700001801835700002501853700002301878700002701901700003501928773009201963856008602055852000902141655001202150IND60525917120221118041831.0190402e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052591712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThilsted, Shakuntala Haraksingh10aSustaining healthy diets: The role of capture fisheries and aquaculture for improving nutrition in the post-2015 era  ap. 126-131.  aThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda makes achieving food security and ending malnutrition a global priority. Within this framework, the importance of fisheries in local and global food systems and its contribution to nutrition and health, particularly for the poor are overlooked and undervalued. This paper reviews current fish production and consumption from capture fisheries and aquaculture, highlights opportunities for enhancing healthy diets and outlines key multi-sectoral policy solutions. Mirroring the call for a diversification of agricultural research and investment beyond a few staple grains, it is anticipated that productivity gains for a few farmed aquatic species will not suffice. Capture fisheries and aquaculture have a complementary role to play in increasing fish availability and access, and must be promoted in ways that support measurable nutrition and health gains. This paper argues that the lack of a nutrition-sensitive policy focus on capture fisheries and aquaculture represents an untapped opportunity that must be realised for ensuring sustainable healthy diets for all.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural research 3aaquaculture 3afish 3afish production 3afisheries 3afood security 3agrains 3ahealthy diet 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3asustainable development 0aFisheries policies 0aNutrition-sensitive fisheries 0aDiverse food systems 0aHealthy diets 0aCapture fisheries 0aAquaculture1 aThorne-Lyman, Andrew1 aWebb, Patrick1 aBogard, Jessica Rose1 aSubasinghe, Rohana1 aPhillips, Michael John1 aAllison, E.

While the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which was established in 2008, introduced regulatory, institutional, and organizational innovations in the coffee market, informal norms and conventions remain the primary institutions governing transactions in the local markets. Based on a choice experiment, we found that for coffee farmers the characteristics of the traders are more important than the price offered when anchoring their transactions into personal relationships. This can be explained as the institutional response of farsighted calculative farmers to poorly organized coffee markets and to lacking credit and insurance markets. Contrary to the concept of embeddedness, which claims that economic transactions are embedded into social relationships, social relationships are observed to be embedded into economic relationships. One of the perverse effects of these personal relationship-based transactions is that farmers are insufficiently incentivized to maintain and improve coffee quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommodity exchange 3acredit 3afarmers 3ainsurance 3aprices 3aEthiopia 0aCoffee markets 0aChoice experiment 0aInstitutional economics 0aTransactions 0aSmallholder farmers 0aSocial capital1 aSpeelman, Stijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7692-34591 aHuylenbroeck, Guido van,0 tFood policy.g2016 May, v. 61 p.92-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001200143245010200155300001600257520100700273592002801280650002301308650001901331650001301350650001601363650002301379650001801402650001501420650000901435650001101444650000901455650002501464650000901489700001801498700001501516700001801531700002801549700002001577700001601597700001601613773013101629856007801760852000901838655001201847IND60765410420221116210935.0220422e20130119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076541042DNAL7 a10.17221/696/2012-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsh, C.10aFractionation and distribution of risk elements in soil profiles at a Czech shooting range &nbsp;  ap. 121-129.  aThe fractionation and vertical distribution of risk elements in soil profiles at a shooting range characterized by alkaline soil were studied. High loading rates of lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb) were observed in the upper 30 cm of soil. Copper (Cu) contents are elevated compared to control soil but do not exceed guideline limits for agricultural soil. Zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni) did not occur in excessive levels; however, easily mobilizable Zn fraction was higher in surface samples, whereas Ni appears to be relatively immobile. Pb and Cu loading in surface soils can be identified as fraction distributions are easily distinguished from those of non-polluted soils. At the firing line Cu, Sb and Zn are most abundant whereas Ni and Pb are concentrated at the target zone. S equential extraction procedures proved effective for the monitoring of shooting range soils. However, data should be backed by other scenario dependent analyses to confirm the environmental fate of shooting range contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aalkaline soils 3aantimony 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental fate 3afractionation 3aguidelines 3alead 3anickel 3arisk 3aspatial distribution 3azinc1 aTejnecký, V.1 aŠebek, O.1 aNěmeček, K.1 aŽahourová-Dubová, L.1 aBakardjieva, S.1 aDrahota, P.1 aDrábek, O.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 59, no. 3 p.121-129dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/696/2012-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01004naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245007700182300001600259520022400275592002800499650002000527650001100547650001000558773011600568856005700684852000900741655001200750IND50070035220221122034539.0131021e199011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007003522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.1990.tb00361.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElson‐Harris, M.

The regiospecificity of LOX from Myxococcus xanthus, a gram-negative bacterium, was investigated. The enzyme catalyzed oxygenation at the n-9 position in C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to form 12S- and 14S-hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), respectively, and oxygenation at the n-6 position in C18 PUFAs to form 13-HFAs. The 12S-form products of C20 and C22 PUFAs by M. xanthus LOX is the first report of bacterial LOXs. The residues involved in regiospecificity were determined to be Thr397, Ala461, and Ile664 by analyzing amino acid alignment and a homology model based on human arachidonate 15-LOX with a sequence identity of 25%. Among these variants, the regiospecificity of the T397Y variant for C20 and C22 PUFAs was changed. This may be because of the reduced size of the substrate-binding pocket by substitution of the smaller Thr to the larger Tyr residue. The T397Y variant catalyzed oxygenation at the n-6 position in C20 and C22 PUFAs to form 15- and 17-hydroperoxy fatty acids, respectively. However, the oxygenation position of T397Y for C18 PUFAs was not changed. The discovery of bacterial LOX with novel regiospecificity will facilitate the biosynthesis of regiospecific‑oxygenated signaling compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aMyxococcus xanthus 3aamino acids 3aarachidonic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acell growth 3agrowth and development 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alipoxygenases 3amodels 3aoxylipins 3apathogenesis 3aregioselectivity 3asequence analysis 0aLOX 0aPUFA 0aHpFA 0aHFA 0aLA 0aALA 0aGLA 0aARA 0aEPA 0aDHA 0aHODE 0aHOTrE 0aHOTrEγ 0aHETE 0aHEPE 0aHDOHE 0aLB 0aEPPS 0aPIPES 0aCHES 0aPDB 0aLipoxygenase 0aRegiospecificity 0aOxygenation 0aBacterium 0aMyxococcus xanthus 0aArachidonic acid1 aHong, Seung-Hye1 aOh, Deok-Kun0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Aug., v. 1863, no. 8 p.823-833dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011600171520188000287592002802167650000802195650001102203650001202214650001402226650002302240650001502263650002702278650001402305650001302319650001802332650002402350650001702374650001102391650001002402650001002412650000902422700002102431773012702452856008502579852000902664655001202673IND60794213320221121041518.0220922e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079421332DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae80907972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsysy, Mokhles 10aAir-Pruning Containers Modify Root and Scion Growth and Alter Resource Allocation of Bench-Grafted Apple Plants  aThe profitability of modern apple orchard plantings depends largely on how rapidly the costs of planting are returned. Tree establishment and growth in the formative years are often can be limited by transplant shock associated with bare-root trees. In this experiment, we examined the effect of two planting systems, air-pruning containers, and field-grown liners, on above- and below-ground growth and development during the first year in the nursery. M9 ‘Nic 29’ bench grafts for three apple cultivars of different vigor classes, ‘Fuji’ (high vigor), ‘Gala’ (moderate vigor), and ‘Honeycrisp’ (low vigor). We hypothesized that air root-pruning containers would alter rooting distribution compared to field-grown liners by increasing fine root production, and this, in turn, would result in improved resource allocation and greater biomass partitioned to above-ground organs. Bench grafts were divided evenly between a field-grown liner bed (for bare root production) and an air-pruning container system. Air-pruning containers produced trees with significantly more root tips and greater total root length per tree than field-grown liners. Importantly, air-pruning containers resulted in a marked and significant increase in roots < 0.4 mm in diameter; however, field-grown liners produced trees had significantly more roots with diameters > 1.5 mm and, thus, significantly greater root dry matter content (DMC). Above-ground parameters (scion length, DMC of wood and leaves, and individual leaf area and DMC) were significantly increased for plants in air-pruning containers. Generally, the growth benefits from air-pruning containers were less pronounced in ‘Gala’ compared to ‘Honeycrisp’ or ‘Fuji’. The percentage of total DMC partitioned to the canopies of air-pruning containerized trees was significantly greater than field-grown liners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aapples 3abiomass 3acultivars 3adry matter content 3afine roots 3agrowth and development 3aleaf area 3aorchards 3aprofitability 3aresource allocation 3aroot pruning 3ascions 3atrees 3avigor 3awood1 aEinhorn, Todd C.0 tHorticulturae.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae80907973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245011600209300002000325520090700345592002801252650002301280650002401303650001701327650001301344650001301357650001401370650002301384650001601407650001301423700005801436773013801494856008001632852000901712655001201721IND60606118420221118024840.0180724e20180309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060611842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b008522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Boehn, Bernhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3722-576710aChemical Wave Patterns and Oxide Redistribution during Methanol Oxidation on a V-Oxide Promoted Rh(110) Surface  ap. 12694-12703.  aChemical wave patterns and the formation of macroscopic vanadium oxide islands have been investigated in the 10–⁴ mbar range during catalytic methanol oxidation on ultrathin VOₓ films (θV ≤ 1 monolayer equivalent) supported on Rh(110). At temperatures around 800 K, wave fragments traveling along the [11̅0] direction and oxidation/reduction fronts exhibiting different front geometries are observed with photoemission electron microscopy. At ≈1000 K, a redistribution of VOₓ leads to the growth of macroscopic oxide islands under reaction conditions. On these macroscopic V-oxide islands chemical waves including traveling wave fragments propagate. Under conditions close to equistability of oxidized and reduced phase, a dendritic growth of the V-oxide islands is observed. In contrast to Rh(111)/VOₓ, almost no catalytic activity in formaldehyde production is found on Rh(110)/VOₓ.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron microscopy 3aformaldehyde 3ageometry 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature 3avanadium1 aImbihl, Ronald1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5155-72500 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 09, v. 122, no. 24 p.12694-12703dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b008523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245010500175300001400280520202600294592002802320650002502348650002602373650002502399650001402424650001902438650002002457650001002477650001002487650004502497650003102542650001502573650003102588650001402619650001502633650001002648650001302658650001202671650001002683653002402693653002302717653002402740700002702764700002002791700002102811700003202832773012802864856009002992852000903082655001203091IND60628358120221121062940.0190318e20190316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062835812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomma, Stefania10aAlternaria species associated to wheat black point identified through a multilocus sequence approach  ap. 34-43.  aBlack point is one of the most important wheat disease and its incidence is increasing worldwide due to climate change too. Among the fungal genera that can cause black point, Alternaria is one of the predominant genus, often associated with mycotoxin contamination. The correct identification is the baseline for prevention and control of the disease. Taxonomy of the genus Alternaria is not completely clear yet, since its species can be differentiated for few morphological traits and, in some cases, also molecular phylogeny is not very effective in establishing species boundaries. In this study, one-hundred sixty-four strains, isolated from wheat kernels affected by black point sampled worldwide, were analyzed in order to assess their identity. Sequences of elongation factor, β-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and allergen alt-a1 genes were used to identify the variability of this population and their phylogenetic relationships. Isolates were grouped in two main clades: the Alternaria section, including A. alternata, A. tenuissima and A. arborescens species, and the Infectoriae section, that includes the two species A. infectoria and A. triticina. Comparison of isolates according with their area of isolation did not show a correlation between phylogeny and geographic origin. Indeed, the isolates grouped on the base of only their phylogenetic relationship. Due to the data arisen by our study, we strongly recommend a multilocus sequence approach to define Alternaria species, based on common genes and procedures to be unanimously shared by scientific community dealing with Alternaria genus. Moreover, we suggest that A. alternata, A. tenuissima, A. turkisafria and A. limoniasperae species would be merged in the defined species A. alternata. Finally we recommend to consider a taxonomic re-evaluation of the Infectoriae section that, for the morphology, sexuality, genetic and mycotoxin profile of the species included, could be defined as different fungal genus from Alternaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAlternaria tenuissima 3aAlternaria triticina 3aallergens 3aclimate change 3adisease control 3afungi 3agenes 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amultilocus sequence typing 3amycotoxins 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3aprovenance 3aseeds 3ataxonomy 3atubulin 3awheat 0aAlternaria taxonomy 0aAlternaria section 0aInfectoriae section1 aAmatulli, Maria Teresa1 aMasiello, Mario1 aMoretti, Antonio1 aLogrieco, Antonio Francesco0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Mar. 16, v. 293 p.34-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163300001400286520167900300592002801979650001602007650001202023650002002035650002502055650001902080650001302099650002402112653002002136653001702156653002702173653002802200653001802228700001902246700001902265700002402284700001702308773009002325856008102415852000902496655001202505IND60611165120221122225051.0180830e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061116512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2016.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizzi, Anna10aReal-time image-guided nasogastric feeding tube placement: A case series using Kangaroo with IRIS Technology in an ICU  ap. 48-52.  aPulmonary misplacement during the blind insertion of enteral feeding tubes is frequent, particularly in ventilated and neurologically impaired patients. This is probably the first clinical study using the Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS technology (IRIS) which incorporates a camera designed to provide anatomic landmark visualization during insertion. The study aim was to evaluate IRIS performance during bedside gastric placement.This is the first prospective study to collect data on the use of IRIS. Twenty consecutive unconscious patients requiring enteral nutrition were recruited at a single center. IRIS placement was considered complete when a clear image of the gastric mucosa appeared. Correct placement was confirmed using a contrast-enhanced abdominal X-ray. To evaluate the device performance over time, the camera was activated every other day up to 17 d postplacement.In 7 (35%) patients, the trachea was initially visualized, requiring a second placement attempt with the same tube. The IRIS camera allowed recognition of the gastric mucosa in 18 (90%) patients. The esophagogastric junction was identified in one patient, while in a second patient the quality of visualization was poor. Contrast-enhanced X-ray confirmed the gastric placement of IRIS in all patients. IRIS allowed identification of gastric mucosa in 14 (70%) patients 3 d after placement. Performance progressively declined with time (P = 0.006, chi-square for trend).IRIS placement could have spared X-ray confirmation in almost all patients and prevented misplacement into the airway in about one third. Visualization quality needs to be improved, particularly after the first week.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acameras 3aenteral feeding 3aesophageal sphincter 3agastric mucosa 3apatients 3aprospective studies 0aEnteral feeding 0aFeeding tube 0aPulmonary misplacement 0aCritically ill patients 0aComplications1 aCozzi, Silvano1 aBeretta, Luigi1 aGreco, Massimiliano1 aBraga, Marco0 tNutrition.g2017 May, v. 37 p.48-52dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245009400212300001800306506007600324520065200400592002801052506003701080650001001117650001401127650001001141650001301151650001401164650001401178650001201192650001701204650001401221650003201235653000901267653000801276653001101284653000801295653001101303653000801314653002201322653001601344653001601360653002501376653002201401700001801423700001801441773011001459856008601569852000901655655001201664IND60539273420221207090829.0190215e20140825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053927342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0462doi7 aPMC41584182pmcid7 a249112092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeniskyte, Urte10aTumour necrosis factor alpha-induced neuronal loss is mediated by microglial phagocytosis  ap. 2952-2956.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, expressed in many brain pathologies and associated with neuronal loss. We show here that addition of TNF-α to neuronal–glial co-cultures increases microglial proliferation and phagocytosis, and results in neuronal loss that is prevented by eliminating microglia. Blocking microglial phagocytosis by inhibiting phagocytic vitronectin and P2Y6 receptors, or genetically removing opsonin MFG-E8, prevented TNF-α induced loss of live neurons. Thus TNF-α appears to induce neuronal loss via microglial activation and phagocytosis of neurons, causing neuronal death by phagoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acoculture 3adeath 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aphagocytosis 3areceptors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0acRGD 0aLPS 0aMFG-E8 0aMRS 0aTNF-α 0aVNR 0aNeuroinflammation 0aPhagoptosis 0aLactadherin 0aVitronectin receptor 0aNeurodegeneration1 aVilalta, Anna1 aBrown, Guy C.0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Aug. 25, v. 588, no. 17 p.2952-2956dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245009600218300001600314520143900330592002801769650002001797650001001817650001201827650001001839650002101849650001501870650002201885650001501907650001001922650001101932650002401943650000901967650002201976650001501998651001502013653001602028653003302044653002202077653003002099653003402129700001702163700002102180700002302201700001802224773009202242856008602334852000902420655001202429IND60525917620221118041707.0190402e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052591762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchreinemachers, Pepijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-317910aFarmer training in off-season vegetables: Effects on income and pesticide use in Bangladesh  ap. 132-140.  aThe cultivation of crops outside the regular cropping calendar when supply is low and prices are high can give farmers better profits and consumers more choice. However, off-season production may increase pesticide risk if crops are more affected by pests and diseases and farmers do not handle pesticides correctly. This study quantified the effect of training in off-season tomato production on the income and pesticide use of smallholder vegetable farmers in southwestern Bangladesh. The study uses farm-level data from 94 trained and 151 non-trained farm households and applies propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. For the average smallholder vegetable farmer, training increased net household income by about 48%. We found that 31% of the trained farm households who had initially adopted the technology continued its use in the second year, but farm households who discontinued using the technology also experienced significant income gains from the training. There was a significant increase in pesticide use (+56%) and although there was an improvement in pesticide handling practices, trained farmers may have been more exposed to pesticide health risk. The policy implication is that while off-season vegetable production can create dramatic income improvements, it is important to emphasize safe and sustainable pest management methods as part of policies promoting it.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3acrops 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3apesticides 3apests 3aprices 3aprofits and margins 3arisk 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3aBangladesh 0aAgriculture 0aAgricultural diversification 0aImpact evaluation 0aPropensity score matching 0aInverse probability weighting1 aWu, Mei-huey1 aUddin, Md.

We studied the impact of silver sulfate (Ag₂SO₄) and silver nitrate (AgNO₃) on biomass of wheat seedlings, the rhizosphere proteins and uptake of nutrients and trace elements. Most part of Ag was accumulated in roots. Concentrations of Ag in leaves remained the same as in control plants. Both treatments (Ag₂SO₄ and AgNO₃) affected biomass of the seedlings. Plant biomass was decreased more after treatment with AgNO₃. Both Ag₂SO₄ and AgNO₃ reduced leaf concentrations of sodium and barium and root concentrations of calcium. Over time (three days), protein concentration in the rhizosphere of control plants and plants treated with AgNO₃ increased, whereas treatment with Ag₂SO₄ reduced concentration of the rhizosphere proteins. In soil treated with Ag₂SO₄ only low-molecular-weight proteins were found. In the control soil and in soil treated with AgNO₃ we also observed polydisperse fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarium 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3acalcium 3aleaves 3anutrient uptake 3aproteins 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asodium 3asoil 3atrace elements 3awheat 0asilver 0awheat seedlings 0anutrients 0atrace elements 0asoil proteins1 aVenäläinen, Salla1 aHartikainen, Helinä1 aSurgik, Marina1 aTimofeev, Sergey0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 July 1, v. 34, no. 10 p.1497-1506dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2011.585206  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014600155300001800301500002000319520195000339592002802289650002202317650002102339650001402360650002302374650001102397650001902408650001202427650002202439650000902461650000702470650003302477650001602510650001502526700001602541700001402557700001702571700001702588700001802605700001702623773015002640856007302790852000902863655001202872IND60587394520221119215611.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739452DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.51842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xinyan10aSynthesis of a Fe/AC Fenton‐like catalyst and heterogeneous catalysis in decolorization of Sunset Yellow by pulsed high‐voltage discharge  ap. 1970-1979.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A new Fe/AC heterogeneous Fenton‐like catalyst was prepared using a dipping–sintering method. The prepared catalyst was characterized by X‐ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The decolorization of Sunset Yellow was conducted in a self‐designed pulsed high‐voltage discharge system by the catalysis of the prepared heterogeneous catalyst. Effects of preparation conditions of catalyst (carrier material, sintering temperature and dipping time) and operating conditions (catalyst dosage, pH and treatment method) on decolorization efficiency were investigated. RESULTS: Spherical activated carbon (AC) was selected as the carrier material and the optimal dipping time and sintering temperature were 8 h and 350 °C, respectively. The efficiency of decolorization of Sunset Yellow was above 90% after 30 min of a pulsed high‐voltage discharge process with 5 g heterogeneous catalyst and at pH 2.00. The utilization of copper mesh not only enhanced the decolorization of Sunset Yellow but also facilitated the reusability of the prepared heterogeneous catalyst. The efficiency of decolorization of Sunset Yellow with prepared Fe/AC heterogeneous Fenton‐like catalyst (5 g) was even a little higher than that with homogeneous catalyst (1.635 mmol L⁻¹ Fe²⁺). The decolorization efficiency remained above 90% after ten recycles of the catalyst, indicating that the prepared heterogeneous catalyst has good stability and reusability. In addition, a possible catalytic mechanism for the decolorization reaction in a pulsed high‐voltage discharge system with prepared Fe/AC heterogeneous Fenton‐like catalyst was proposed by determination of H₂O₂ and ·OH concentrations in deionized water. CONCLUSIONS: The prepared Fe/AC heterogeneous Fenton‐like catalyst efficiently degrades Sunset Yellow wastewater in a pulsed high‐voltage discharge system. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3adecolorization 3adipping 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aMa, Yuepeng1 aLiu, Ying1 aYang, Zemeng1 aLi, Qunsheng1 aZhou, Zhiyong1 aRen, Zhongqi0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 92, no. 8 p.1970-1979dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.51843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03713naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245009900198500002000297520220400317592002802521596005402549596004702603650001702650650001202667650001702679650001402696650001102710650001402721650002202735650003402757650001202791650002502803650001502828650001302843650002402856650001802880700002002898700002402918700001502942700002302957700005902980773012003039856007503159852000903234655001203243IND60785878720221120032045.0220729e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078587872DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.138972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManlik, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0924-376812aA stochastic model for estimating sustainable limits to wildlife mortality in a changing world  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman‐caused mortality of wildlife is a pervasive threat to biodiversity. Assessing the population‐level impact of fisheries bycatch and other human‐caused mortality of wildlife has typically relied upon deterministic methods. However, population declines are often accelerated by stochastic factors that are not accounted for in such conventional methods. Building on the widely applied potential biological removal (PBR) equation, we devised a new population modeling approach for estimating sustainable limits to human‐caused mortality and applied it in a case study of bottlenose dolphins affected by capture in an Australian demersal otter trawl fishery. Our approach, termed sustainable anthropogenic mortality in stochastic environments (SAMSE), incorporates environmental and demographic stochasticity, including the dependency of offspring on their mothers. The SAMSE limit is the maximum number of individuals that can be removed without causing negative stochastic population growth. We calculated a PBR of 16.2 dolphins per year based on the best abundance estimate available. In contrast, the SAMSE model indicated that only 2.3–8.0 dolphins could be removed annually without causing a population decline in a stochastic environment. These results suggest that reported bycatch rates are unsustainable in the long term, unless reproductive rates are consistently higher than average. The difference between the deterministic PBR calculation and the SAMSE limits showed that deterministic approaches may underestimate the true impact of human‐caused mortality of wildlife. This highlights the importance of integrating stochasticity when evaluating the impact of bycatch or other human‐caused mortality on wildlife, such as hunting, lethal control measures, and wind turbine collisions. Although population viability analysis (PVA) has been used to evaluate the impact of human‐caused mortality, SAMSE represents a novel PVA framework that incorporates stochasticity for estimating acceptable levels of human‐caused mortality. It offers a broadly applicable, stochastic addition to the demographic toolbox to evaluate the impact of human‐caused mortality on wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data  aG00003007cUnited Arab Emirates University (UAEU)  aG00003007cUnited Arab Emirates University 3abiodiversity 3abycatch 3acase studies 3aequations 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3apopulation viability analysis 3aprogeny 3astochastic processes 3atrawl nets 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3awind turbines1 aLacy, Robert C.1 aSherwin, William B.1 aFinn, Hugh1 aLoneragan, Neil R.1 aAllen, Simon J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2260-81430 tConservation biology.g2022 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.e13897-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.138973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010800171300001600279520104800295592002801343650001301371650002901384650002301413650002601436650001701462650002401479650002801503650001701531650001301548653002001561653002401581653001701605653002401622653002501646653001301671700001901684773013601703856008501839852000901924655001201933IND60743079820221118130330.0210707e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074307982DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2021.19179362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaroń, Anita,10aAntimicrobial properties of nanoparticles in the context of advantages and potential risks of their use  ap. 680-693.  aThe popularity of nanotechnology results from the possibility of obtaining materials that have better chemical, electrical, thermal, mechanical, or optical properties. Nano-sized materials are characterized by an increased surface area, which improves their chemical reactivity and mobility. Due to their enhanced reactivity and appropriately small size, some nanoparticles are used as antimicrobial and antifungal agents. Nanoparticles exhibit antimicrobial potential through multifaceted mechanisms. The adhesion of nanoparticles to microbial cells, and reactive oxygen species, and their penetration inside the cells, have been recognized as the most prominent modes of antimicrobial action. This review presents the mechanism of action of nanometals and oxide nanoparticles used as antimicrobials and the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to the toxic effects of nanoparticles. The article presents methods of forming microorganism resistance to the toxic effects of nanoparticles and the negative impact of nanoparticles on human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantimicrobial properties 3achemical reactions 3aenvironmental science 3ahuman health 3amechanism of action 3areactive oxygen species 3asurface area 3atoxicity 0aMetal particles 0ananosized particles 0ametal oxides 0abiocidal activities 0abacterial resistance 0aexposure1 aDługosz, Olga0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2021 June 30, v. 56, no. 6 p.680-693dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2126x1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2021.19179363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245015900175520162700334592002801961650001201989650001202001650001802013650001602031650000902047650001402056653003402070653002502104653001802129653001902147700001802166700002602184700001702210700005702227700001302284700001802297700001702315773009102332856009002423852000902513655001202522IND60782064520221121234104.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Peicheng10aSelenium–sulfur functionalized biochar as amendment for mercury-contaminated soil: High effective immobilization and inhibition of mercury re-activation  aThe contamination of soils by mercury (Hg) seriously threatens the local ecological environment and public health. S-functionalized amendments are common remediation technology, yet, Hg re-activation often occurs in the commonly used immobilization remediation by S-functionalized amendments, resulting in an unsatisfactory remediation effect. In this study, a novel FeS–Se functionalized biochar composite (FeS-Se-BC) amendment was prepared and applied for the efficient remediation of Hg-polluted soil. An immobilization efficiency of 99.62% and 99.22% for H₂O-extractable Hg and TCLP solution-extractable Hg was achieved with the application of FeS-Se-BC₍₀.₀₅₎ after 180 d. The analyses of XPS, Hg-TPD, SEM-EDS demonstrated that excellent remediation performance by FeS-Se-BC resulted from the synergistic effect of FeS and Se to form HgS and HgSe concurrently. In comparison to the treatments of biochar and FeS-functionalized biochar (FeS-BC), FeS-Se-BC promoted the transformation of exchangeable, carbonate-bound, and Fe–Mn oxides-bound Hg fractions into organic material-bound, and residual fractions, effectively reducing the risk of Hg-contaminated soil from a highly dangerous level to a low risk. Furthermore, the introduction of Se clearly inhibited the re-activation of Hg and reduced the release of Hg by 81.12% compared to FeS-BC when the ratio of S²⁻ to Hg was 5: 1 due to the formation of extremely stable HgSe. These results suggest that FeS-Se-BC has good potential for remediation of Hg-polluted soils which provides a new inhibitory idea for Hg re-activation after immobilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3amercury 3apublic health 3aremediation 3arisk 3asynergism 0aFeS-Se functionalized biochar 0aHg-contaminated soil 0aRe-activation 0aImmobilization1 aYang, Weichun1 aJohnson, Varney Edwin1 aSi, Mengying1 aZhao, Feiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5457-67321 aLiao, Qi1 aSu, Changqing1 aYang, Zhihui0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135552-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245008000205300001600285500002000301520088500321592002801206650002301234650002501257650002301282650002601305650001301331650000901344650001001353650002101363650001101384650001501395650001401410650001401424650001801438650001701456650002501473650001301498651001101511700006901522700006601591700006101657700006701718700007201785773012601857856007401983852000902057655001202066IND60776581120221120095442.0220507e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077658112DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.129272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres‐Castro, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8295-010010aMolecular confirmation of Rickettsia parkeri in humans from Southern Mexico  ap. 382-386.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman tick‐borne rickettsioses are caused by Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia massiliae, Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia philipi and Rickettsia rickettsii in the American continent.

Its accuracy relies on the validity of several assumptions, notably (i) a steady state ocean circulation, (ii) a prescribed age tracer saturation history, e.g., a constant 100% saturation, (iii) a prescribed constant degree of mixing in the ocean, (iv) a constant surface ocean air‐sea CO₂ disequilibrium with time, and (v) that preformed alkalinity can be sufficiently estimated by salinity or salinity and temperature. Here, these assumptions are evaluated using simulated “model‐truth” of Cant. The results give the IG‐TTD method a range of uncertainty from 7.8% to 13.6% (11.4 Pg C to 19.8 Pg C) due to above assumptions, which is about half of the uncertainty derived in previous model studies. Assumptions (ii), (iv) and (iii) are the three largest sources of uncertainties, accounting for 5.5%, 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively, while assumptions (i) and (v) only contribute about 0.6% and 0.7%. Regionally, the Southern Ocean contributes the largest uncertainty, of 7.8%, while the North Atlantic contributes about 1.3%. Our findings demonstrate that spatial‐dependency of Δ/Γ, and temporal changes in tracer saturation and air‐sea CO₂ disequilibrium have strong compensating effect on the estimated Cₐₙₜ. The values of these parameters should be quantified to reduce the uncertainty of IG‐TTD; this is increasingly important under a changing ocean climate.  aPublisher supplied data  a229791cVENTILATE  a239965cORGANIC  a229756cSNACS  cNorwegian Metacenter for Computational Science  ann2980kcNorStore  ans9045kcNorStore  ans1002kcNorStore 3aalkalinity 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3achlorofluorocarbons 3aclimate 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asulfur hexafluoride 3atemperature 3auncertainty1 aTjiputra, Jerry1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4600-24531 aLangehaug, Helene R.1 aJeansson, Emil1 aGao, Yongqi1 aSchwinger, Jörg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7525-68821 aOlsen, Are1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1696-91420 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.1777-1800dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0135043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001400190245016700204300001400371520160700385592002801992653004602020653000902066653001002075653000802085653003002093653002702123700001602150700001402166700003302180700003002213700001302243700001702256700003002273700001702303700001802320700001902338700001802357700002602375700001802401700001402419700001602433700001702449773010402466856008302570852000902653655001202662IND60530745420221119004500.0160721e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053074542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgmr.2016.03.0042doi7 aPMC48404312pmcid7 a271441262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiara, E.10aDifficulties in recognition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency on the basis of clinical and biochemical features. The role of next-generation sequencing  ap. 70-76.  aPyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) defect is a well-known cause of mitochondrial disorders (MD) with at least six responsible genes (PDHA1, PDHB, DLAT, DLD, PDHX, PDP1). The aim of this work was to assess the diagnostic value of biochemical methods in recognition of PDHc defect in Polish patients with suspicion of MD.In the first step, Western blot of the E1α subunit was performed on 86 archive muscle bioptates with suspicion of MD. In the second step, Sanger PDHA1 sequencing was performed in 21 cases with low E1α expression. In the third step, 7 patients with negative results of PDHA1 sequencing were subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES). This protocol revealed 4 patients with PDHA1 and one with DLD mutations. Four additional probands were diagnosed outside the protocol (WES or Sanger sequencing).The molecular characterization of PDHc defect was conducted in a total of 9 probands: 5 according to and 4 off the protocol. Additionally, two affected relatives were recognized by a family study. Altogether we identified seven different PDHA1 changes, including two novel variants [c.464T>C (p.Met155Thr) and c.856_859dupACTT (p.Arg288Leufs*10)] and one DLD variant.The lactate response to glucose load in the PDHA1 subset was compared to a subset of non PDHc-related MD. Opposite responses were observed, with an increase of 23% and decrease of 27%, respectively.The results show that determining lactate response to glucose load and muscle E1α expression may contribute to distinguishing PDHc-related and other MD, however, WES is becoming the method of choice for MD diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency 0aPDHc 0aPDHA1 0aDLD 0aNovel pathogenic variants 0aWhole-exome sequencing1 aRokicki, D.1 aHalat, P.1 aKarkucińska-Więckowska, A.1 aPiekutowska-Abramczuk, D.1 aMayr, J.1 aTrubicka, J.1 aSzymańska-Dębińska, T.1 aPronicki, M.1 aPajdowska, M.1 aDudzińska, M.1 aGiżewska, M.1 aKrajewska-Walasek, M.1 aKsiążyk, J.1 aSperl, W.1 aPłoski, R.1 aPronicka, E.0 tMolecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports.g2016 June, v. 7 p.70-76dElsevier Inc.x2214-42697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgmr.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245016700205520098200372592002801354650001701382650002101399650002001420650001601440650003401456650001501490650001501505650001401520650001001534650000801544653001301552653001401565653001801579653002401597653003001621653003501651700001301686700001301699700001401712700001701726700001601743773010001759856008701859852000901946655001201955IND60695416920221120113246.0200614e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3763-118310aPrediction, evaluation, confirmation, and elimination of matrix effects for lateral flow test strip based rapid and on-site detection of aflatoxin B1 in tea soups  aMycotoxin contaminations of tea have been considered serious problems.

In this work, we have carefully predicted, evaluated, and confirmed the matrix effects in tea that have an undesired influence on the detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in tea soups by lateral flow test strips (LFTS). After pretreatment of tea samples by simple dilution to change the acidic tea soups to alkaline environments, the matrix effects can be completely eliminated and the reliability of AFB1 analysis in tea soups can be effectively guaranteed. AFB1 contaminated samples of different tea soups can be accurately measured with detection limits down to 0.05 ppb. As the first pioneering report to study the matrix effects on AFB1 monitoring in tea soups by LFTS, we definitely expect this work to further widen the application of LFTS for hazard screening in food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaflatoxin B1 3achemical species 3adetection limit 3afood safety 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3ascreening 3asoups 3atea 0aTea soup 0aMycotoxin 0aMatrix effect 0aAflatoxin B1 (AFB1) 0aGold nanoparticles (GNPs) 0aLateral flow test strip (LFTS)1 aCai, Fen1 aWu, Qian1 aWu, Yuhan1 aYao, Bangben1 aXu, Jianguo0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 328 p.127081-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1270813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011200175520168200287592002801969650001501997650001602012650001202028650001402040650002702054650001402081650000702095650001402102650002102116650001702137650001602154650001302170650001502183653001602198653002902214653003302243653003402276653002002310700005602330773009102386856009002477852000902567655001202576IND60782064720221121234046.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Shengquan10aFeCl3-activated biochar catalyst for heterogeneous Fenton oxidation of antibiotic sulfamethoxazole in water  aOne-step FeCl₃-mediated pyrolysis/activation was developed for preparation of bermudagrass (BG)-derived FeCl₃-activated biochars (FA-BCs) from bermudagrass (BG) as a heterogenous Fenton catalyst for heterogeneous Fenton oxidation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in water. The FA-BC prepared at the FeCl₃ to BG mass ratio of 2 (FA-BC) exhibited higher adsorption and Fenton oxidation of SMX than other mass ratios of the FeCl₃ to BG. FA-BC presented the great surface area (835 m²/g) and high SMX adsorption capacity (195 mg SMX/g BC), which was higher than various BCs in the previous studies. Additionally, the surface of FA-BC was attached with Fe₂O₃, Fe⁰, and Fe₃O₄ after the FeCl₃ activation. Under the optimal conditions for Fenton reaction (SMX concentration, 100 mg/L; loading of FA-BC, 0.1 g/L; dose of H₂O₂, 200 mg/L; temperature, 20 °C; pH 3; reaction time, 12 h), SMX and COD removal efficiencies reached 99.94% and 65.19%, respectively. Increasing reaction temperature from 20 to 50 °C significantly improved the SMX oxidation rate from 0.46 to 1.04 h⁻¹. The HO· radicals were proved to play a major role during the Fenton oxidation of SMX. In addition, the SMX solution treated by Fenton oxidation showed much less toxicity than the initial SMX solution. Additionally, the reusability tests of FA-BC indicated that 89.58% removal efficiency for SMX was still achieved after 3 cycles of Fenton oxidation under the optimal conditions. Furthermore, FA-BC can also efficiently remove SMX from the dairy wastewater. Therefore, FA-BC showed a high potential to eliminate aqueous SMX through adsorption and heterogeneous Fenton oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3abiochar 3acatalysts 3achemical oxygen demand 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyrolysis 3asulfamethoxazole 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aAntibiotics 0aIron-impregnated biochar 0aAdvanced oxidation processes 0aHeterogeneous Fenton catalyst 0aWater treatment1 aKan, Eunsung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6298-60960 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135554-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011000154300001600264500002000280520067000300592002800970650001200998650001001010650001901020650002601039650001501065650002001080650002701100650001301127650003501140700001901175700002201194700002201216700002301238700001901261700001801280773011501298856007401413852000901487655001201496IND60587394820221119215922.0180319e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739482DNAL7 a10.1111/age.125522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, M.

Copy number variation was recently reported for the avian beta‐defensin 7 gene (AvBD7) between the highly inbred Leghorn and Fayoumi lines. Here, we examined copy number variants in 35 different chicken breeds and found that 31 of them have at least the same representation of the duplicated AvBD7 allele. We also found haplotypes upstream of the AvBD6 regions that are strongly linked to the AvBD7 duplication. We observed a strong linkage disequilibrium spanning of the upstream region of the AvBD6 gene, with two SNPs being flanking markers to detect duplication of the AvBD7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abirds 3achicken breeds 3acopy number variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainnate immunity 3alinkage disequilibrium 3apeptides 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aRomanov, M.

Climatic change, deforestation, globalization, trade agreements, close association and genetic selection in links with environmental, vector, reservoir and potential susceptible hosts' parameters have led to emergence of atypical human trypanosomosis (a‐HT). Poor recording of such neglected tropical disease, low awareness in health professions and farming community has approached a serious intimidation for mankind. Reports of animal Trypanosoma species are now gradually increasing in humans, and lack of any compiled literature has diluted the issue. In the present review, global reports of livestock and rodent trypanosomes reported from human beings are assembled and discrepancies with the available literature are discussed along with morphological features of Trypanosoma species. We have described 21 human cases from the published information. Majority of cases 10 (47%) are due to T. lewisi, followed by 5 (24%) cases of T. evansi, 4 (19%) cases of T. brucei and 1 (5%) case each of T. vivax and T. congolense. Indian subcontinent witnessed 13 cases of a‐HT, of which 9 cases are reported from India, which includes 7 cases of T. lewisi and 2 cases of T. evansi. Apart from, a‐HT case reports, epidemiological investigation and treatment aspects are also discussed. An attempt has been made to provide an overview of the current situation of atypical human trypanosomosis caused by salivarian animal Trypanosoma globally. The probable role of Trypanosoma lytic factors (TLF) present in normal human serum (NHS) in providing innate immunity against salivarian animal Trypanosoma species and the existing paradox in medical science after the finding on intact functional apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) in Vietnam T. evansi Type A case is also discussed to provide an update on all aspects of a‐HT. Insufficient data and poor reporting in Asian and African countries are the major hurdle resulting in under‐reporting of a‐HT, which is a potential emerging threat. Therefore, concerted efforts must be directed to address attentiveness, preparedness and regular surveillance in suspected areas with training of field technicians, medical health professionals and veterinarians. Enhancing a one health approach is specifically important in case of trypanosomosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOne Health initiative 3ablood serum 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic selection 3aglobalization 3ahost specificity 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arodents 3atropical diseases 3atrypanosomiasis 3azoonoses 3aIndia 3aVietnam1 aGupta, Snehil1 aBhutia, Wangchuk Dorjee1 aVaid, Rajesh Kumar1 aKumar, Sanjay0 tZoonoses and public health.g2022 June, v. 69, no. 4 p.259-276dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58703x1863-19597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.129453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010200155300002000257520173500277592002802012650002202040650001202062650001202074650002702086650002002113650001902133650001702152650001302169650001902182650002002201650001102221650002102232650001902253650002502272700001302297700001402310700001402324700001502338773012502353856007402478852000902552655001202561IND60747864020221119014728.0210820e20210810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786402DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra03286k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Yuqiu10aStudy on COD and nitrogen removal efficiency of domestic sewage by hybrid carrier biofilm reactor  ap. 27322-27332.  aA moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) is a kind of commonly used biological sewage treatment process. A carrier, the core of MBBR, could directly affect the treatment efficiency of MBBR. In this experiment, a hybrid carrier composed of an MBBR carrier and fluidized bed porous carrier was innovatively utilized to treat low-concentration simulated domestic sewage through an MBBR reactor to investigate the effects of different hydraulic retention times (HRT) and different carrier dose ratios on the reactor performance. The results indicated that when the volume ratio of the carrier dosage was 5% : 20% when the reactor HRT was 5 h, the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (CODCᵣ) were optimal, which were 96.5%, 60.9% and 91.5%, respectively. The ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and CODCᵣ concentrations of the effluent were 1.04 mg L⁻¹, 12.20 mg L⁻¹ and 29.02 mg L⁻¹, respectively. Furthermore, the total biomass concentration in the hybrid carrier biofilm reactor (HCBR) was 3790.35 mg L⁻¹, which also reached the highest value. As the experiment progressed, the concentrations of protein, polysaccharide and soluble microbial products (SMP) were reduced to 7.68 mg L⁻¹, 11.10 mg L⁻¹ and 18.08 mg L⁻¹, respectively. This was basically consistent with the results of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum. The results showed that the combined-carrier biofilm reactor could reduce the volumetric filling rate, improving the removal capability of organic matter and the denitrification efficiency. This study provided technical support for the composite carrier biofilm wastewater treatment technology, and also had a good prospect of application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3afluidized beds 3afluorescence 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apolysaccharides 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater treatment1 aLiu, Mei1 aTan, Xiao1 aHou, Siyu1 aYang, Ping0 tRSC advances.g2021 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 44 p.27322-27332dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra03286k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245016100166300001400327520076900341592002801110650002301138650001401161650001901175650001701194650000901211650001401220650002101234650001401255650001301269650001401282650003301296650001301329651001201342651001001354653001501364653001601379653001101395653001801406700001401424700001501438700001601453700001601469700001801485700001801503773013301521856008401654852000901738655001201747IND60535349120221120170408.0200607e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053534912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndree, K.B.10aDiplectanum sciaenae (Van Beneden & Hesse, 1863) (Monogenea) infecting meagre, Argyrosomus regius (Asso, 1801) broodstock in Catalonia, Spain.

Noteworthy, it contains high amounts of bioaccessible and bioavailable compounds with well documented biological activity. Here, we estimated the effect of OS-supplementation and gastrointestinal processing of wheat bread on its potential anticancer activity and ability to modify activity of lipoxygenase (LOX), xanthine oxidase (XO), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Gastrointestinal processing releases XO and LOX inhibitors and CAT activators from supplemented bread. Most importantly, synergism between these compounds derived from bread and OS was found. Gastrointestinally adsorbed 3% OS-supplemented bread extract exerted a considerably stronger cytostatic and anti-invasive effect on gastric cancer AGS cells than its gastrointestinally digested and buffer masticated counterparts. These effects only partly correlated with the phenolic content of the extracts and their antioxidative activities. Gastrointestinal digestion and adsorption slightly influence the bioactivity of non-supplemented bread extracts. However, the activity of gastrointestinally adsorbed, OS-supplemented wheat bread extract switched from cytostatic and anti-invasive to cytoprotective upon DMSO extraction. These data directly show a complex network of synergetic and antagonistic effects of single phenolic compounds from onion skin and wheat bread. They indicate that the bioactivity of phenolic compounds and potentially beneficial effects of wheat bread fortification with onion skin may be regulated by subtle interactions between OS and bread phenolic compounds, and food matrix. They are modulated by gastrointestinal processing. These findings may open perspectives for the introduction of onion skin into wheat bread supplementation which would increase its pro-healthy properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3awastes 3axanthine oxidase 3agastrointestinal system 3acatalase 3astomach neoplasms 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aantineoplastic activity 3afood matrix 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aphenolic compounds 3adigestion 3araw materials 3asuperoxide dismutase 3abulbs 3aonions 3awheat 3abreads 3asynergism 3aantioxidant activity 3aadsorption 0aOnion skin 0alipoxygenase 0aBread supplementation 0aAntiradical potential 0aBioavailability 0aStomach cancer 0aPhenolic compounds1 aKaszuba, Kinga1 aPiwowarczyk, Katarzyna1 aŚwieca, Michał1 aDziki, Dariusz1 aCzyż, Jarosław0 tFood research international.g2015 July, v. 73 p.97-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245008800157300001800245520047900263592002800742650001400770650001400784650002300798650002500821650003100846650001100877650002100888700002100909700001900930700001900949773013300968856007401101852000901175655001201184IND60617491020221119012915.0181025e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061749102DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01443d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKano, Taichi10aCatalyst-controlled diastereoselectivity reversal in the formation of dihydropyrans  ap. 3496-3499.  aAn enantioselective synthesis of cis-dihydropyrans as the formal HDA reaction products was achieved through the catalyst-controlled anti-selective conjugate addition of aldehydes to β,γ-unsaturated α-keto esters.

Substantial improvements in location accuracy were observed and early detection of damage onset was seen to outperform TSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aalgorithms 3acomposite materials1 aPullin, R.1 aHolford, K.M.0 tComposites.g2012 June, v. 43, no. 6 p.856-863dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001400157245012400171300001500295520131800310592002801628650002201656650002501678650001901703650001501722650001801737650002101755650002001776650002601796650002101822650002201843650001501865650001601880650002401896650002001920650000901940650001201949650005001961650001802011650002502029650000902054650003602063650003402099650007102133650002402204650002602228650000902254650002502263650003202288650003802320700001402358700001602372700001502388700001302403700001502416700001802431700001502449700001502464700001702479700001802496773010302514856003902617852000902656655001202665IND50072178920221118193821.0140123e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007217892DNAL7 a246053652pmid7 a10.1002/pca.24712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yucui10aCharacterisation of the Metabolism of Pogostone In Vitro and In Vivo Using Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry  ap. 97-105.  aINTRODUCTION: Pogostone possesses potent anti‐bacterial and anti‐fungal activities and has been used for the quality control of essential oil of Pogostemon cablin. Pogostone is easily absorbed after oral administration but its metabolism in mammals remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic profile of pogostone in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: High‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC–MS) techniques were employed. Orbitrap MS and ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were utilised to analyse the metabolism of pogostone by virtue of the high sensitivity and high selectivity in the measurement. In vitro experiment was carried out using rat liver microsomes while the in vivo study was conducted on rats, which were orally administered with pogostone (80 mg/kg). RESULTS: In total, three mono‐hydroxylated, one di‐hydroxylated, one mono‐oxygenated, one di‐oxygenated metabolite, one hydrolysis and one hydroxy conjugated metabolites were found. In addition hydroxylation was demonstrated to be a major metabolic pathway of pogostone. CONCLUSION: LC–MS was demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the metabolite identification of pogostone. The tentative identification of metabolites provides an insight for the metabolic clues of pogostone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPogostemon cablin 3abiochemical pathways 3aessential oils 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxylation 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver microsomes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3aquality control 3arats 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aHydroxylation 2aLamiaceaexchemistry 2aMale 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMicrosomes, Liverxmetabolism 2aOils, Volatilexanalysisxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods1 aSu, Ziren1 aLin, Shuhai1 aLi, Chuwen1 aZhao, Ya1 aGao, Xiang1 aLai, Yongquan1 aWu, Xiaoli1 aWu, Hanzhi1 aCai, Zongwei1 aLai, Xiaoping0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2014 Mar., v. 25, no. 2 p.97-105dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.2471  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013000156300002000286520125300306592002801559650000801587650001601595650001501611650002001626650002001646650001701666650001801683650001501701650002601716650001401742650001801756650001501774700001501789700001401804700001801818700001901836700001201855700001801867773012501885856007402010852000902084655001202093IND60747864120221119014610.0210820e20210813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786412DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra03420k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruike10aHigh-throughput immunosensor chip coupled with a fluorescent DNA dendrimer for ultrasensitive detection of cardiac troponin T  ap. 27523-27529.  aA novel fluorescence (FL) imaging platform was established for ultrasensitive and rapid detection of cardiac troponin T (cTnT), based on a high-throughput immunosensor chip and a DNA dendrimer capped with a large number of fluorescent dyes (FDD@Cy5). Through an enzyme-free and step-by-step strategy, FDD@Cy5 was self-assembled facilely. After the formation of a sandwich immunocomplex and biotin–streptavidin conjugation, FDD@Cy5 could be captured on the chip. FL signals emerged from Cy5 under external light and the enrichment of Cy5 on the dendrimer led to signal amplification. A FL image containing 90 spots could be collected instantaneously by laser confocal scanning microscopy and the brightness of all the spots corresponded to the concentrations of target cTnT. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor chip coupled with FDD@Cy5 exhibited an excellent detection limit of 0.10 pg L⁻¹, a wide linear range from 0.20 pg L⁻¹ to 2.0 ng L⁻¹, a sample consumption down to 3.0 μL and a maximum throughput of 45 tests per h. The proposed approach was also applied to cTnT quantitation in serum samples with acceptable accuracy, providing a new avenue for early diagnosis and the prognosis evaluation of acute myocardial infarction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood serum 3adendrimers 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3afluorescence 3aimmunosensors 3amicroscopy 3amyocardial infarction 3aprognosis 3arapid methods 3atroponin T1 aZong, Chen1 aLi, Gairu1 aWang, Junhong1 aKong, Tiantian1 aLi, Fei1 aChang, Junmin0 tRSC advances.g2021 Aug. 13, v. 11, no. 44 p.27523-27529dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra03420k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012000168300001600288520149700304592002801801650001301829650002301842650002601865650002101891650002201912650001801934650001801952650001601970650001001986650002001996650001002016650001002026650001102036653001802047653003702065653004002102700001502142700001702157773013702174856008702311852000902398655001202407IND60795343920221121123138.0221004e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534392DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-181X.2022.00034.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakau, M.V.10aNutritive value of mixed napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum)- Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) silage for ruminants  ap. 433-448.  aThe objectives of the study were to determine the chemical composition, ruminal degradability, and apparent digestibility of mixed Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) (PP) -Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) (LL) silages. Freshly cut Napier and Leucaena were harvested and mixed at 70:30; 50:50; 30:70 ensiled for six weeks. The chemical composition of the fresh forages and the silages were determined using the AOAC (1990) procedures. Dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) ruminal degradability were determined by nylon bag technique using three rumen cannulated Bonsmara steers for periods of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours. DM and CP ruminal degradability kinetics were described by fitting the data on the model P= a+b (1-e⁻ᶜᵗ) using the neway computer program where a is the rapidly degradable fraction, b is the slowly degradable fraction and c is the outflow rate. Hay supplemented with 25% mixed PP: LL silages was fed to three castrated male Pedi sheep to evaluate apparent digestibility coefficient and N retention. The fresh cut PP had more CP, Fat, and ash, with less OM. Leucaena was richer in most nutrients than Napier. The study indicated the 50:50 silage was the optimal mix to maximize the overall nutritive value. The DM and CP disappearance constants a, b and c were similar for all silages. PP: LL mixing ratio did not affect the DM and CP degradability kinetics of the silages. There was no effect on total dietary intake, apparent digestibility and N retention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBonsmara 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aanimal nutrition 3acomputer software 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3afood intake 3amales 3anutritive value 3anylon 3asheep 3asilage 0aDegradability 0aLeucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) 0aNapier grass (Pennisetum purpureum)1 aFushai, F.1 aBaloyi, J.J.0 tANIMAL NUTRITION AND FEED TECHNOLOGY.g2022 May, v. 22, no. 2 p.433-448dAnimal Nutrition AssociationwJournal:2096x0974-181X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-181X.2022.00034.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010800173520206300281592002802344650001002372650002802382650001602410650002402426650001902450650000902469650001502478650002002493650001102513650001002524650000902534650001102543650002002554650000902574650002402583650001902607650001202626653001702638653002502655653000802680653001602688653000902704700002202713700002402735700002602759700002502785700002502810700002302835700002102858773009502879856008602974852000903060655001203069IND60695417220221120045245.0200809e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1081922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoro, Anderson B.10aAssessing the composition of the soft tissue in lamb carcasses with bioimpedance and accessory measures  aConsumers are demanding additional information to support their decision-making while shopping for meat. In the lamb industry, labelling carcasses with composition information is challenging. This is due to issues with conventional analytical procedures, such as the time spent with determinations and product loss or devaluing due to sampling for analysis. The objective was to evaluate the potential use of bioimpedance analysis (BIA) to determine composition of the soft tissue portion of lamb carcasses. Thirty-one Texel and Ile-de-France crossbreed ram lambs were slaughtered at 20, 26, 32, or 38 kg of body weight. Values of resistance and reactance were collected from hot and cold carcasses, which weighed 12.4 ± 2.99 kg and 11.9 ± 2.94 kg, respectively and measured 53.9 ± 3.25 cm of length. Carcass weight and length were used to calculate other BIA variables such as impedance modulus, phase angle, bioelectrical volume, and both resistive and reactive densities. These variables were used as independent variables to predict the contents of soft tissue, moisture, ash, protein, fat, lean, and crude energy of the carcasses. Multiple regression analyses were carried out to calibrate BIA models. The leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to evaluate precision and accuracy of the BIA technique. Resistive density was the most important BIA variable to predict lamb composition of hot carcasses, which explained 83% to 92% of the variation in composition. In turn, reactive density better predicted lamb carcass composition in cold carcasses, which accounted for 81% to 92% of their variation in carcass composition. In addition, prediction models of the soft tissue portion of lamb carcasses assessed on cold carcasses showed a higher coefficient of determination and smaller root mean square error and Mallows Cp values than hot carcasses. Therefore, BIA has an excellent potential to predict lamb carcass components on either hot as cold carcass; however, higher accuracy was found with cold carcasses in comparison with hot.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTexel 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody weight 3acarcass composition 3acarcass weight 3acold 3acrossbreds 3adecision making 3aenergy 3alambs 3ameat 3amodels 3aovine carcasses 3arams 3aregression analysis 3asheep industry 3atissues 0aCold carcass 0aElectrical impedance 0aFat 0aHot carcass 0aLean1 aGalvani, Diego B.1 aMontanholi, Yuri R.1 aBertemes-Filho, Pedro1 aVenturini, Rafael S.1 aMartins, Andressa A.1 ada Silva, Leila P.1 aPires, Cleber C.0 tMeat science.g2020 Nov., v. 169 p.108192-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2020.1081923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012200170300001400292520191100306592002802217650000902245650002402254650002302278650001502301650001102316650001502327650000902342650001902351650001902370650001602389650001002405650002202415650001602437650001002453653003302463653001502496653002402511653001502535653001402550653001802564700001402582700001402596700001802610700001702628773010702645856008602752852000902838655001202847IND60543271520221118102200.0190410e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054327152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Shunshan10aInvestigation of radio frequency heating uniformity of wheat kernels by using the developed computer simulation model  ap. 41-49.  aTo explore the potential of using radio frequency (RF) energy to control insects or microorganisms in low-moisture granular food crops, wheat kernels were selected as a sample product, and a computer simulation model was developed to study the influence of sample size (wheat kernels filled in plastic container in cuboid shape) and vertical position on RF heating uniformity and to determine the cold and hot spots in the samples. The simulated temperature profile of RF heating was compared with the experimental results to validate the computer model. Temperature uniformity index (TUI) was selected as a criterion to evaluate RF heating uniformity. Results suggested that temperature uniformity of sample depended on sample size and location, where for small sample size, sample placed on either bottom electrode or closed to top electrode would achieve better RF heating uniformity; while for sample in large size, placed in the middle or slightly lower than middle position between the two parallel electrodes achieved better temperature uniformity. Also, a larger sample size had better RF heating uniformity, especially when sample size equaled to the size of the top electrode, indicating that RF energy is more suitable for treating bulk materials. Corner heating was also observed where hot spots located at the corner of samples in cuboid shape, and cold spots depended on sample vertical position. In this study, cold spots were at the center of the top and bottom layers when the sample was placed at the middle position between the two parallel electrodes, at the center of top layer when sample was placed on the bottom electrode, and at the center of bottom layer when sample was placed close to top electrode. Information generated from this study would be essential for developing RF treatment protocol to control insects or microorganisms in low-moisture granular agricultural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3acomputer simulation 3adielectric heating 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3afood crops 3aheat 3ainsect control 3amicroorganisms 3aradio waves 3aseeds 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3awheat 0aRadio frequency (RF) heating 0aUniformity 0aComputer simulation 0aCold spots 0aHot spots 0aWheat kernels1 aDeng, Yun1 aZhong, Yu1 aWang, Danfeng1 aZhao, Yanyun0 tFood research international.g2015 May, v. 71 p.41-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008700168300001400255520100200269592002801271650001301299650000901312650001301321650000901334650000901343650001001352650001101362650001601373650000901389650000901398650001901407650001601426651001201442653001301454653001301467653001201480653000901492653000901501653001101510700002901521700002001550700001801570700002201588773013301610856008401743852000901827655001201836IND60535349320221120170312.0200607e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053534932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanhee, Merijn10aToxocara in sandpits of public playgrounds and kindergartens in Flanders (Belgium)  ap. 51-54.  aBelgium counts more than a million dogs and at least two million cats, of which many are carrying zoonotic nematodes of the genus Toxocara. Environmental contamination with worm eggs is considered the key transmission route from animals to humans, and mainly young children are at risk. Contamination of soil with Toxocara eggs has been reported from all over the world, but data are lacking for Belgium. In this study, faecal contamination and the presence of Toxocara eggs in sand were investigated in sandpits of public playgrounds and kindergartens in Flanders (Northern Belgium). Faeces, of which 85% originated from cats, were found in about one third of the public playgrounds and one fifth of the kindergartens. Toxocara eggs were found in 12% of the faecal samples, in 14% of the public sandpits, and in 2% of the sandpits of kindergartens. These data indicate that environmental contamination with Toxocara exists in urban areas in Belgium, and that cats are most likely the main source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxocara 3acats 3achildren 3adogs 3aeggs 3afeces 3ahumans 3aplaygrounds 3arisk 3asand 3asoil pollution 3aurban areas 3aBelgium 0aToxocara 0aSandpits 0aBelgium 0aDogs 0aCats 0aFaeces1 aDalemans, Anne-Catherine1 aViaene, Jasmine1 aDepuydt, Lies1 aClaerebout, Edwin0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2015 Dec., v. 1-2 p.51-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245013300200300001600333500002000349506007600369520185700445592002802302506003702330650002802367650003702395650001002432650002902442650002302471650003902494650002002533650001102553650002002564650001602584650001602600650001402616700001602630700001702646700002102663700001502684700001902699700001902718773011502737856007402852852000902926655001202935IND60587395020221207081856.0180319e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739502DNAL7 a10.1111/age.125482doi7 aPMC55184362pmcid7 a284978482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, R.

With an increasing emphasis in modern food production on the use of a small population of high quality males for artificial insemination, the potential economic and environmental costs of hypoprolific boars, bulls, rams etc. are considerable. There is therefore a need for novel tools to facilitate rapid, cost‐effective chromosome translocation screening. This has previously been achieved by standard karyotype analysis; however, this approach relies on a significant level of expertise and is limited in its ability to identify subtle, cryptic translocations. To address this problem, we developed a novel device and protocol for translocation screening using subtelomeric probes and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Probes were designed using BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes) from the subtelomeric region of the short (p‐arm) and long (q‐arm) of each porcine chromosome. They were directly labelled with FITC or Texas Red (p‐arm and q‐arm respectively) prior to application of a ‘Multiprobe’ device, thereby enabling simultaneous detection of each individual porcine chromosome on a single slide. Initial experiments designed to isolate BACs in subtelomeric regions led to the discovery of a series of incorrectly mapped regions in the porcine genome assembly (from a total of 82 BACs, only 45 BACs mapped correctly). Our work therefore highlights the importance of accurate physical mapping of newly sequenced genomes. The system herein described allows for robust and comprehensive analysis of the porcine karyotype, an adjunct to classical cytogenetics that provides a valuable tool to expedite efficient, cost effective food production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aartificial insemination 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aboars 3achromosome translocation 3acost effectiveness 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afood production 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3akaryotyping 3alitter size 3ascreening1 aFonseka, G.1 aFrodsham, R.1 aArchibald, A.

Various studies have indicated that such low saturations can only be reached when oil layers in pore corners are included in the pore-scale modelling. These processes within a macroscopic porous medium can be modelled at the pore-scale by incorporating the fundamental physics of capillary dominated displacement within idealised pore network models. Recently, the authors have developed thermodynamic criteria for oil layer existence in pores with non-uniform wettability which takes as input geometrically and topologically representative networks, to calculate realistic Sor values for mixed-wet and oil-wet sandstones [16, 21]. This previous work is developed in this paper to include (i) the visualisation of the 3D structure of this residual oil, and (ii) a statistical analysis of this “residual/remaining” oil. Both the visualisation and the statistical analysis are done under a wide range of wettability conditions, which is reported for the first time in this paper.The structure of residual oil for strongly water wet systems is well known (where residual=remaining oil) and our model agrees with this but this structure changes radically for mixed wet systems (where residual≠remaining) and this has not yet been visualised experimentally. We find that for more water-wet systems high final residual oil saturations are reached at relatively small amounts of water injected and this oil is present in the pores as bulk oil. On the other hand, for more oil-wet systems we find a slow decrease of the amount of remaining oil with increasing amounts of injected water. During the process, the remaining connectivity of the oil phase is increasingly provided by oil layers only, hence the slow drainage. The final residual oil saturation, only reached in the theoretical limit of an infinite amount of injected water, is almost entirely contained in large number of (relatively low volume) oil layers, which are present in pores of most radius sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3amodels 3aoils 3aporous media 3asandstone 3astatistical analysis 3athermodynamics 3awater resources 3awettability 0aResidual oil saturation 0aNetwork modelling 0aWettability 0aTwo phase flow in porous media 0aPore-scale modelling 0aDigital rock physics1 aSorbie, K.S.1 avan Dijke, M.I.J.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2014 Jan., v. 63 p.11-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245014300178300001600321520179000337592002802127650002102155650001202176650002102188650002002209650001802229650001002247650001402257650001602271650002702287650000902314650001202323650002402335650000702359650001402366650001702380650001502397653002802412653002302440700002402463700001802487700002002505700002202525700002402547700002402571700002202595773013702617856008702754852000902841655001202850IND60795344120221121123140.0221004e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534412DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-181X.2022.00036.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChinnasamy, Sudharsan10aEffects of rapeseed oil (Rapus indicus) supplementation on omega-3 fatty acid concentration and carcass characteristics in broiler chicken  ap. 459-468.  aDietary fatty acid composition in broiler influences carcass quality by altering fat deposition and fatty acid profile. Thus, the study was carried out to evaluate the effect of incorporation of rapeseed oil in broiler ration on omega-3 fatty acid concentration of carcass and its traits in broiler chicken. A total of 160 day-old straight run broilers (Vencobb 400) were randomly divided into four treatment groups (G1, G2, G3 and G4) having four replicates of ten chicks each. The basal diets (G1) were prepared to meet BIS (2007) nutrient requirements with palm oil at 1.5, 3, and 4.5 per cent in pre-starter, starter and finisher diets, respectively. The experimental diets were broiler rations prepared with rapeseed oil replacing 25, 50 and 100 per cent of palm oil in G2, G3 and G4 diets, respectively. The diets were fed ad libitum till 6 weeks of age. Six birds from each group were randomly selected and slaughtered on 42ⁿᵈ day to study omega-3 fatty acid concentration of carcass and its characteristics. The crude fat content of breast and thigh muscle was significantly (P<0.05) reduced in the group fed rapeseed oil included diets. However, carcass yield, processing yield and meat to bone ratio of cut up parts was not significantly affected. The colour and pH of breast and thigh muscles were similar among the treatment groups. Omega- 3 fatty acid concentration was significantly (P<0.01) increased in both breast and thigh muscle of G4 group broilers compared to G1 group. Thus, rapeseed oil inclusion in diet significantly increased omega-3 fatty acid concentration and significantly reduced crude fat concentration breast and thigh muscles with no effect on the carcass yield and its quality when included in the diet replacing palm oil at different proportion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal nutrition 3abreasts 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass quality 3acarcass yield 3acolor 3acrude fat 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3ameat 3amuscles 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apH 3apalm oils 3arapeseed oil 3atechnology 0aCarcass characteristics 0aOmega-3 fatty acid1 aMurugan, S.

In this case study, we have reported a rare occurrence of compound heterozygosity of two different variants, namely, HBBc.92G>C and HBBc.92+5G>C in maternal amniotic fluid sample. Prenatal β-thalassemia mutation detection in fetal DNA was carried out using nucleotide sequencing method. After analysis, the father was found to be heterozygous for HBBc.92G>C (Codon 30 (G>C)) mutation which is β0 type and the mother was heterozygous for HBBc.92+5G>C (IVS I-5 (G>C)) mutation which is β+ type. When amniotic fluid sample was analyzed for β-globin gene (HBB), we found the occurrence of heterozygous allelic pattern for aforesaid mutations. This compound heterozygous state of fetus sample was considered as β+/β0 category of β thalassemia which was clinically and genotypically interpreted as β-thalassemia major. Regular blood transfusions are required for the survival of thalassemia major patients hence prenatal diagnosis is imperative for timely patient management. Prenatal diagnosis helps the parents to know the thalassemic status of the fetus and enables an early decision on the pregnancy. In the present study, we have identified compound heterozygosity for β-thalassemia in the fetus which portrays the importance of prenatal screening.  aPublisher supplied data 0aβ-Thalassemia 0aCompound heterozygous 0aβ+/β0 mutation 0aAmniotic fluid 0aNucleotide sequencing1 aDhawan, Dipali1 aBagali, Prashanth G.1 aS.Chaudhary, Pooja1 aChaudhary, Abhinav1 aSingh, Sanjay1 aVudathala, Srinivas0 tMolecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports.g2016 June, v. 7 p.51-53dElsevier Inc.x2214-42697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgmr.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009700178300001800275500001500293520096600308592002801274650001101302650001701313650001501330650002201345653001301367700001601380700001401396773008401410856008901494852000901583655001201592IND60095878820221119155823.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009587882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Meer, F.P.10aToward efficient and robust computation of energy release rate and mode mix for delamination  ap. 1101-1112.  a2019-12-06  aDifferent methods for computing energy release rates for delamination are assessed with emphasis on their performance with large elements and irregular meshes. The jump in stress and strain that appears at the crack front with shell kinematics is used to compute the energy release rate in a simple manner via the jump in Eshelby tensor, without the mesh requirements that are associated with the virtual crack closure technique. The robustness of the results is examined for different kinematic formulations. For mode partitioning, another method that also makes use of the jump in stress [15], is modified for better performance with large elements. In this manner, the proposed method connects to existing concepts for characterization of fracture toughness based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. However, by presenting a size effect in the mode mix predicted with a cohesive method, it is emphasized that the validity of these concepts is questionable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3adelamination 3akinematics 3achemical elements 0aelements1 aSluys, L.J.1 aMoës, N.0 tComposites.g2012 July, v. 43, no. 7 p.1101-1112dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2012.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245007200171300001600243520128500259592002801544650001501572650001101587650000901598650001501607650001101622650001701633650001301650650001701663650002001680653001701700653002001717653002601737653002201763653001501785653001801800700002201818773010701840856008701947852000902034655001202043IND60535349620221120170427.0190402e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053534962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehmani, Ayaz14aThe effect of microporosity on transport properties in porous media  ap. 104-119.  aSizeable amounts of connected microporosity with various origins can have a profound effect on important petrophysical properties of a porous medium such as (absolute/relative) permeability and capillary pressure relationships. We construct pore-throat networks that incorporate both intergranular porosity and microporosity. The latter originates from two separate mechanisms: partial dissolution of grains and pore fillings (e.g. clay). We then use the reconstructed network models to estimate the medium flow properties. In this work, we develop unique network construction algorithms and simulate capillary pressure–saturation and relative permeability–saturation curves for cases with inhomogeneous distributions of pores and micropores. Furthermore, we provide a modeling framework for variable amounts of cement and connectivity of the intergranular porosity and quantifying the conditions under which microporosity dominates transport properties. In the extreme case of a disconnected inter-granular network due to cementation a range of saturations within which neither fluid phase is capable of flowing emerges. To our knowledge, this is the first flexible pore scale model, from first principles, to successfully approach this behavior observed in tight reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acement 3aclay 3amicropores 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aporous media 3awater resources 0aPorous media 0aMultiphase flow 0aRelative permeability 0aTwo-scale network 0aFlow model 0aMicroporosity1 aProdanovic, Masa,0 tAdvances in water resources.g2014 Jan., v. 63 p.104-119dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2013.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012600173520201600299592002802315650003102343650002302374650002402397650001902421650001502440650001802455650001102473650000702484650001702491650001602508650001302524650002302537650002102560650002602581653002102607653001602628653001502644653001302659653001402672653002402686700001802710700003402728700001802762700001802780700001302798700001702811700001602828773009102844856009002935852000903025655001203034IND60782065320221121234208.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhenguo10aSorption of selected pharmaceutical compounds on polyethylene microplastics: Roles of pH, aging, and competitive sorption  aMicroplastics (MPs) as the carrier of pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments have been concerned in recent years. However, the influences of environmental factors on the sorption of pharmaceuticals onto MPs, particularly the effect of the simultaneous sorption by MPs of different pharmaceuticals in multi-solute systems are still unclear. This study investigated the influences of pH, aging of MPs, and competition of pharmaceuticals on the sorptions of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), propranolol (PRP), and sertraline (SER) onto polyethylene MPs. In the 96 h pH-dependent experiments, the sorptions of the three pharmaceuticals were mainly driven by hydrophobic interaction. Besides, the ionization states of the three pharmaceuticals varied with the pH ranging from 2.00 to 12.00, and electrostatic interaction would affect the sorption affinities of the pharmaceuticals in different ionization states. In the aged MPs experiments, the MPs aged by UV irradiation showed a stronger sorption capacity than the pristine ones. Across the MPs under different UV irradiation durations, the 6 d aged MPs showed the highest sorption percentages of 23.0% and 17.6% for SER and PRP, respectively; for SMX, the highest sorption percentage of 5.4% was recorded with the 10 d aged MPs. In the multi-solute systems, the sorption kinetics of the three pharmaceuticals fit well with the pseudo-second-order model. The sorption quantities of the three pharmaceuticals onto MPs followed the order of SER cations (18.70 μg g⁻¹) > SMX anions (7.83 μg g⁻¹) > PRP cations (3.80 μg g⁻¹) at pH 7.00. The good fitting of the Freundlich model suggested a multilayer sorption of the three pharmaceuticals onto MPs. The SER with higher hydrophobicity would preferentially be adsorbed onto MPs and influenced the subsequently sorption processes of the other pharmaceuticals via electrostatic interactions. This may change the environmental fate of the contaminants, which should be carefully considered in future work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenvironmental fate 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3apH 3apolyethylene 3apropranolol 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3asulfamethoxazole 3aultraviolet radiation 0aSulfamethoxazole 0aPropranolol 0aSertraline 0aKinetics 0aIsotherms 0aMulti-solute system1 aDing, Jiannan1 aRazanajatovo, Roger Mamitiana1 aHuang, Jichao1 aZheng, Lixing1 aZou, Hua1 aWang, Zhenyu1 aLiu, Jianli0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 307 p.135561-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245009000202300001800292520099900310592002801309650001101337650002701348650001701375650001201392650002201404650001601426650001201442700001301454700001901467700005601486700005201542773017001594856008001764852000901844655001201853IND60684383720221120095839.0200219e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068438372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b058382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaoying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5524-011110aMolecularly Engineered Conductive Polymer Binder Enables Stable Lithium Storage of Si  ap. 2680-2688.  aSilicon anodes are a key component for high-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Electrode binder engineering for Si anodes has been calling increasing awareness. Here, we report a series of molecularly engineered conductive polymer binders, that is, star-like polyaniline (s-PANi), cross-linked polyaniline (c-PANi), and linear polyaniline (l-PANi). As a conductive binder, the molecular structure of PANi was found to play a key role in determining the performance of a Si anode: a reversible capacity of 1776 mAh g–¹ after 100 cycles at 500 mA g–¹ was achieved using s-PANi as the conductive binder, far superior than systems adopting c-PANi, l-PANi, and conventional carboxymethyl cellulose binders. The correlation between the binder molecule structure and Si anode performance is found: a star-like molecular structure is more advantageous over the heavily cross-linked structure for it offers a 3D-conjugated conductive network that is more resistant to cycle-induced large strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acrosslinking 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3apolyaniline 3asilicon1 aHan, Rui1 aJiang, Pinxian1 aChen, Yungui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8403-72891 aLiu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1608-72700 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 59, no. 7 p.2680-2688dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b058383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007700156300001600233520113900249592002801388650001101416650001901427650001901446650001501465650000901480650000901489650001701498650001501515650001501530650003101545650001301576650001301589653001201602653003501614653001101649653002701660653001601687700001401703700001501717700001501732773013701747856007501884852000901959655001201968IND60795344420221121123115.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534442DNAL7 a10.18805/ag.R-21122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, S.N.10aErythrocyte parameters as a diagnostic tool in canine medicine: A review  ap. 288-295.  aThe haematological analysis is one of the essential diagnostic and prognostic tools for the health practitioner. Routine hematology consists of erythrocyte, leucocyte and platelet parameters estimation. Erythrocyte parameters (RBC, RDW, haemoglobin, haematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC) estimation plays a crucial role in identifying anemia and several other acute and chronic conditions. Accurate and precise haematology results depend on correct blood collection procedures, suitable anticoagulants, proper storage and effective blood transport. The individual reference value variance can be due to age, sex, stress, diet, body condition, hydration status and reproductive status. Automatic haeamtology analyzer can yield quick and accurate results provided the sample is free from any artifacts. In conclusion, the accuracy of the result of automatic haematology analyzer in canine medicine is impeded by the lack of precise and rapid comparison procedure, instability and complexity of blood cells. Therefore the findings of the automatic haemotolyzer should always be corroborated with the clinical findings and another laboratory test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3ablood sampling 3abody condition 3abody water 3adiet 3adogs 3aerythrocytes 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3alaboratory experimentation 3amedicine 3avariance 0aAnaemia 0aAutomatic haematology analyzer 0aCanine 0aErythrocytes parameter 0aHaematology1 aAhmed, N.1 aNath, A.J.1 aBoro, P.K.0 tAgricultural reviews.g2022 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.288-295dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2002x0976-07417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ag.R-21123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245015100164300001800315520117500333592002801508650001501536650001501551650001101566650001901577650001801596650001101614650001501625700002201640700006101662700006101723773017001784856008001954852000902034655001202043IND60684383820221120095815.0200219e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068438382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b058452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Ishan10aCombining the Nonuniform Structure and Flow Maldistribution for the Accurate Prediction of the Process Performance of Monolithic Adsorbent Systems  ap. 3162-3172.  aMonolithic adsorbent systems offer the potential to achieve high throughput in fast-cycle adsorption processes. Modeling these systems is typically based on the “ideal monolith” assumption, neglecting channel nonuniformities. A new model that accounts for both structural nonuniformity and inlet flow maldistributions is presented and validated using literature data of breakthrough experiments and full-cycle process performance for carbon capture separation. A detailed comparison between predictions using an apparent mass transfer coefficient (MTC) obtained by fitting the breakthrough curve and the intrinsic MTC is presented. The process calculations based on the apparent MTC grossly underpredict the carbon dioxide recovery. A procedure is established to obtain the structural nonuniformity parameters and flow maldistribution effects from the breakthrough curve. With this model, the full-cycle predictions are within 1.20 and 1.25% of the experimental observations in terms of heavy product purity and recovery, respectively. The evidence reported in this article makes a strong case for independent measurement of the intrinsic MTCs in monolithic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprediction1 aMennitto, Roberto1 aFriedrich, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3951-22011 aBrandani, Stefano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9470-68370 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 59, no. 7 p.3162-3172dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b058453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01249naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245003500170300001600205520035900221592002800580650001400608650001100622653000700633653000700640653002400647653002300671653002200694700001900716773010600735856008500841852000900926655001200935IND60599785220221120223115.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJánky, Béla,14aThe poverty-assistance paradox  ap. 447-449.  aWe present a model of preferences on welfare transfers, which incorporates the recipient’s wealth as a signal of needs and deservingness.

Traditionally patients were fed when flatus or defecation documented the return of bowel function. This study was undertaken to determine factors that may preclude early feeding. Methods: One hundred four successive patients underwent colorectal surgery from October 1999 to January 2001. Eighty-nine patients started an oral dieteither on postoperative day 1 or 2. Their clinical outcomes were recorded prospectively. Fifteen of the 104 patients were excluded for small-bowel resection (5 patients), perioperative complications (5 patients), prior radiation (3 patients), and small-bowel obstruction (2 patients). A failure in postoperative feeding consisted of nausea, vomiting, or readmission. Results: The mean age of our cohort was 65 years (range, 28 to 87 years). There were 45 male and 44 female patients. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range, 3 to 13 days). The median American Society of Anesthesiology score was II (range, I-IV). The types of resection performed were right colectomy (27 patients), low anterior resection (26 patients), sigmoid resection (11 patients), abdominoperineal resection (8 patients), formation or closure of colostomy (7 patients), posterior pelvic exenteration (4 patients), total colectomy (3 patients), left colectomy (2 patients), and transverse colectomy (1 patient). Sixty-five patients (73%) tolerated early oral feeding. Of the 24 patients that did not, 16 had nausea or emesis, and 8 required readmission for postoperative complications (small-bowel obstruction [4 patients], wound dehiscence [1 patient], abdominal pain [1 patient], and anastomotic leak [2 patients]). Univariate analysis revealed that the use of volume expanders contributed to intolerance of early feeding. On multivariate analysis, blood loss during the operation was the only factor contributing to failure of early postoperative oral feeding. Conclusions: Early oral feeding is safe and feasible for postcolectomy patients with a history of colorectal neoplasms.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adefecation 3adehiscence 3afemales 3ahospitals 3amales 3amultivariate analysis 3anausea 3apain 3apatients 3apostoperative complications 3aresection 3avomiting1 aCheng, C.,1 aDriscoll, D1 aRodriguez-Bigas, MA0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 17, no. 5 p.323-324dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0115426502017005323a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012400175300002000299520142400319592002801743650003701771650001701808650002401825650001101849650001901860650001401879650002101893650001501914650001701929650000901946650002001955650002401975650001401999650002602013650002302039650000902062650001502071653002702086653001802113653001802131653002102149653001702170700002702187700001602214700001702230700001802247700002102265700002102286773013302307856008502440852000902525655001202534IND60586475620221118041353.0171213e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647562DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b024602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Dang Le
Tri10aSelective CO2 Reduction on Zinc Electrocatalyst: The Effect of Zinc Oxidation State Induced by Pretreatment Environment  ap. 11377-11386.  aHere, we have developed porous nanostructured Zn electrocatalysts for CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR), fabricated by reducing electrodeposited ZnO (RE-Zn) to activate the CO₂RR electrocatalytic performance. We discovered that the electrochemical activation environment using CO₂-bubbled electrolyte during reducing ZnO in a pretreatment step is important for highly selective CO production over H₂ production, while using Ar gas bubbling instead can lead to less CO product of the Zn-based catalyst in CO₂RR later. The RE-Zn activated in CO₂-bubbled electrolyte condition achieves a Faradaic efficiency of CO production (FECO) of 78.5%, which is about 10% higher than that of RE-Zn activated in Ar-bubbled electrolyte. The partial current density of CO product had more 10-fold increase with RE-Zn electrodes than that of bulk Zn foil at −0.95 V vs RHE in KHCO₃. In addition, a very high FECO of 95.3% can be reached using the CO₂-pretreated catalyst in KCl electrolyte. The higher amount of oxidized zinc states has been found in the high performing Zn electrode surface by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies, which suggest that oxidized zinc states induce the active sites for electrochemical CO₂RR. Additionally, in pre- and post-CO₂RR performance tests, the carbon deposition is also significantly suppressed on RE-Zn surfaces having a higher ratio of oxidized Zn state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aargon (noble gases) 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3afoil 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen production 3aoxidation 3apotassium bicarbonate 3apotassium chloride 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aCO2 reduction reaction 0aZinc catalyst 0aCO production 0aElectrocatalysis 0aPretreatment1 aJee, Michael Shincheon1 aWon, Da Hye1 aJung, Hyejin1 aOh, Hyung-Suk1 aMin, Byoung Koun1 aHwang, Yun Jeong0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Dec. 04, v. 5, no. 12 p.11377-11386dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b024603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016100167520136300328592002801691650001901719650001301738650002001751650001801771650001601789650002601805650001401831650001801845650001301863650001701876650002001893653001201913653001701925653002001942653002301962653001801985700002402003700001302027700002902040700002802069700001702097700002102114700002802135700001502163700001402178773011402192856008602306852000902392655001202401IND60702620020221122022107.0211106e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070262002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSáez, J.A.10aOlive mill wastewater-evaporation ponds long term stored: Integrated assessment of in situ bioremediation strategies based on composting and vermicomposting  aDuring the last two decades, the method most widely used to manage olive mill wastewater (OMW) derived from olive oil production has been its disposal in evaporation ponds. Long-term storage of OMW leads to the accumulation of toxic sediments (OMWS) rich in recalcitrant compounds with phytotoxic and antimicrobial properties, which limit their use for agronomic purpose. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two in situ bioremediation strategies (composting and a combination of composting followed by vermicomposting) to remove the potential toxicity of the sediments derived from long-term stored OMW. The results obtained showed that the composting method assisted with the earthworms enhanced the depletion of phenolic compounds and OMWS ecotoxicity more than composting, especially during the maturation stage. Moreover, vermicomposting was more effective in the reduction of the OMWS salinity. However, a pre-composting process to the OMWS is necessary prior to vermicomposting to provide the suitable conditions for earthworms survival and activity. Furthermore, the final compost showed a phytostimulating effect. Therefore, these in situ bioremediation strategies can be considered potential tools for decontamination and recovery of long-term stored OMWS in evaporation ponds, which currently poses an unsolved environmental problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3acomposts 3adecontamination 3aecotoxicology 3aevaporation 3aolive mill wastewater 3aolive oil 3aphytotoxicity 3asalinity 3astorage time 3avermicomposting 0aCompost 0aVermicompost 0aOlive oil waste 0aPhenolic compounds 0aPhytotoxicity1 aPérez-Murcia, M.D.1 aVico, A.1 aMartínez-Gallardo, M.R.1 aAndreu-Rodríguez, F.J.1 aLópez, M.J.1 aBustamante, M.A.1 aSanchez-Hernandez, J.C.1 aMoreno, J.1 aMoral, R.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 402 p.123481-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009100164300001800255520161400273592002801887596006301915650002101978650002701999650001502026650002002041650001502061650001902076650000702095650001102102650001802113650002802131650001402159650001802173650002002191650001502211651001202226700001902238700001502257700001802272700001502290700001902305700001602324700001402340773016302354856008202517852000902599655001202608IND60743527120221118025213.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074352712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-020-02935-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNhut, H.

This approach brings more benefits as compared to others, particularly, no chemical use, low cost, easy to implement but equivalent efficiency and also safe for the health. The surface water samples were collected from three sites in the Dong Nai River, Vietnam, with the average concentrations of pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) ranging from 6.2 ± 0.3 to 6.7 ± 0.2, 25.2 ± 2.5 to 41.7 ± 7.9 NTU, 22.4 ± 6.4 to 41.1 ± 5.9 mg L⁻¹ and 0.70 ± 0.20 to 1.08 ± 0.15 mg L⁻¹, respectively. The study has found that the optimum bio-coagulant dosage was 0.15 ml L⁻¹ for the water samples in both rainy and dry seasons. In the rainy season, the turbidity removal efficiencies in Tan Luong Ferry, Nguyen Van Tri Park and Hoi Son Ferry ranged from 87.8 ± 2.9 to 93.3 ± 1.0%, while the tendency for dry season was obtained from 85.7 ± 2.5 to 94.3 ± 1.1%, respectively. The treated turbidity concentration met the Vietnam’s National Technical Regulation on domestic water quality. Furthermore, the paired t tests used to compare the pre-treatment and post-treatment dataset for COD and turbidity removal efficiencies were significant (p < 0.05) in three studied sites. Results indicated that Moringa oleifera extract is a promising material which is environmental-friendly and low cost to treat the surface water.  aPublisher supplied data  a(CS-CB17-MTTN-06)cNong Lam University of Ho Chi Minh City 3aMoringa oleifera 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulants 3adata collection 3adry season 3aorganic matter 3apH 3arivers 3asurface water 3atotal Kjeldahl nitrogen 3aturbidity 3awater quality 3awater treatment 3awet season 3aVietnam1 aHung, N.

Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel, is believed to play a role in sensing bladder distension. To investigate the involvement of Piezo1 in bladder dysfunction, we examined the expression and distribution of Piezo1 and neurofilament (NF-L) to understand pathological alterations in rat bladders with partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO), an animal model of BPH.Female Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to sham or pBOO operations. On days 3, 7, and 14 after pBOO, Piezo1 mRNA levels in the bladder were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of light NF-L was also examined by western blotting. On day 7, the distributions of Piezo1 were examined by in situ hybridization.The expression levels of Piezo1 mRNA in whole bladder were significantly increased from days 3 to 14 after pBOO. On day 7 in pBOO rats, significant increases in Piezo1 mRNA were observed in the detrusor layer as well as the suburothelial layer, while the predominant distribution was observed in the urothelium of sham rats. Coinciding with the increase in Piezo1, the decreases in NF-L expression were observed in the bladder from pBOO rats.The increase in Piezo1 in pBOO rat bladders might be involved in the compensatory mechanism associated with bladder denervation including the decrease in NF-L. Inhibition of Piezo-1 may be a new therapeutic approach to ameliorate the storage dysfunction shown in pBOO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3abladder 3ahyperplasia 3aion channels 3amessenger RNA 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 0aPiezo1 0aBladder outlet obstruction 0aRats 0aSmooth muscle 0aUrothelium 0aSuburothelium1 aYano, Kazuo1 aTomita, Ken-ichi1 aMatsuzaki, Osamu1 aKasahara, Ken-ichi0 tLife sciences.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 166 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016000166300002000326520128300346592002801629650001501657650002201672650001401694650001401708650001601722650002201738650001301760650001101773650001701784650002101801650002001822650000901842650001201851650001301863653001401876653001601890653001301906653002301919653002101942653001701963700001701980700001501997700001902012700001402031700002102045700001702066773013302083856008502216852000902301655001202310IND60586475720221118041300.0171213e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647572DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b024732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Heng10aCitric Acid/Cysteine-Modified Cellulose-Based Materials: Green Preparation and Their Applications in Anticounterfeiting, Chemical Sensing, and UV Shielding  ap. 11387-11394.  aFunctionalized cellulose-based materials are in high demand for many applications. In this work, we report a green approach to fabricate a type of versatile cellulose-based material through facile citric acid/cysteine treatment. For its preparation, cellulose-based materials were conjugated with citric acid/cysteine-based fluorophores (CCFs) by simply soaking them in a concentrated citric acid/cysteine aqueous solution followed by drying above 80 °C. Chemical modification occurred, which was completed in the swollen state of the cellulose, and the highest conjugating ratio reached 1.6 wt %. It was noted that the treatment had no effect on the crystallinity of the cellulose while the structural morphology of various cellulose-based components in the material was maintained. We also found that the CCF-modified cellulose-based products had remarkable fluorescence, a selective quenching ability toward chloride ions, and excellent UV absorption capacity. Thus, they could have new applications in anticounterfeiting, chemical sensing, and UV shielding. Furthermore, our developed route to fabricate these CCF-modified cellulose-based products was environmentally friendly since water was the only solvent, and no organic solvent was involved throughout the procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3achlorides 3acitric acid 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3adrying 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agreen chemistry 3aions 3asoaking 3asolvents 0aCellulose 0aCitric acid 0aCysteine 0aAnticounterfeiting 0aChloride sensing 0aUV shielding1 aYan, Xiaohui1 aFeng, Qian1 aZhao, Pengchao1 aXu, Xiayi1 aNg, Dickon H.

Eco-innovation represents a differentiating attribute for sustainable business in fiercely competitive environments. However, prior studies have not examined the role of eco-innovation in sustainable development through hierarchical structural analysis of resource management practice to address firms’ capabilities and competencies; in particular, the attributes contain qualitative information and quantitative data. This study proposes a hybrid method comprising the fuzzy Delphi method, importance-performance analysis, and a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory to rank the attributes and assist firms in decision-making. The result supports the use of advanced eco-friendly technologies and the selection of potential talent to support eco-innovation and foster changes in strategic vision, management structure, and administrative procedures.

Compared to concrete prepared using natural basalt aggregate, concrete prepared with RM-modified basalt aggregate aged for 7 and 28 days had a 25.08 % and 21.75 %, respectively, higher compressive strength and a 39.53 % and 15.30 %, respectively, flexural strength. Compared to concrete prepared using natural limestone aggregate, the compressive and flexural strengths of concrete prepared with RM-modified limestone aggregate increased by over 10.00 % and 20 % respectively, after aging of both 7 and 28 days. The RM had a higher wettability to cement paste than basalt and limestone, implying that cement paste on the surface of RM-modified aggregate had a correspondingly stronger microflow and filling capacity. In addition, concrete prepared with the RM-modified aggregate had a low voidage, a compact ITZ structure and strong interfacial adhesion, resulting in considerably enhanced mechanical properties. This study provides novel applications for RM that can be widely used in building materials and waste reduction and a new method for improving the mechanical properties of concrete.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abasalt 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3alimestone 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of rupture 3awaste reduction 3awettability 0aRed mud 0aModified aggregate 0aMechanical properties 0aPore structure 0aInterfacial transition zone1 aZhang, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1253-86521 aMao, Song0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 403 p.123482-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012300164300001600287520190200303592002802205650001902233650001102252650002502263650002702288650002502315650001202340650001302352650000902365650000902374650001202383650001902395650001302414650001302427650001202440650001402452650001002466651001002476653002402486653002402510653003402534653003102568653001902599700002102618700001202639700001602651773011302667856008602780852000902866655001202875IND60612462220221119052524.0200509e20181110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061246222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Cong10aPreparation of cleaner one-part geopolymer by investigating different types of commercial sodium metasilicate in China  ap. 636-647.  aOne-part geopolymers prepared by powder activators, similar to Portland cement in cast-in-situ application, are promising building materials due to the relatively slighter embodied environmental impact. There are three types of commercial sodium metasilicate powders in the China market, and they are Na₂SiO₃-anhydrous/NS0, Na₂SiO₃·5H₂O/NS5 and Na₂SiO₃·9H₂O/NS9, respectively. This study employed ultra-fine fly ash sinking beads (FASB) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as precursor materials to analyze the influences of NS0, NS5 and NS9 on the properties, microstructure and environmental impact of one-part geopolymer by measuring and characterizing compressive strength, porosity, reaction heat release, geopolymerization products and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂-e) emission. The experimental results indicate that NS0 has the most rapid and effective activated effect in both single GGBS and GGBS-FASB composites. The strength of geopolymer activated with NS0 is the highest, followed by that with NS9, and followed by that with NS5. The products are mainly gelatinous phases, and the gels in NS0 and NS9 activated geopolymers are better geopolymerized than those in NS5 activated geopolymer, which is proved to be responsible for the difference in macro-performance. The evaluations of the cost and CO₂-e emission per MPa of one-part geopolymer demonstrate that NS0 and NS9 are much cheaper and cleaner than NS5 for preparing one-part geopolymer. The embodied CO₂ indexes of NS0 and NS9 activated single GGBS are only about 26.5% and 34.0% of that of ordinary Portland cement. This study not only partially explains the reasons for the different properties of one-part geopolymer activated by different types of sodium metasilicate, but also provides a guidance for preparing one-part geopolymer with reasonable cost and slight environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconstruction materials 3aenvironmental impact 3afly ash 3afurnaces 3agels 3aheat 3amarkets 3amicrostructure 3apolymers 3aporosity 3apowders 3asilicates 3aslags 3aChina 0aOne-part geopolymer 0aSodium metasilicate 0aEmbodied environmental impact 0aGeopolymerization products 0aMicrostructure1 aLong, Guangcheng1 aShi, Ye1 aXie, Youjun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 10, v. 201 p.636-647dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245010400169300001600273520159500289592002801884650002601912650002101938650001501959650002901974650002102003650002202024650001502046650001802061650001802079650002402097650001502121650001802136650002002154650001802174650001702192650001702209650001202226650001702238650001302255650001302268650001202281773012902293856007702422852000902499655001202508IND60438408520221122110903.0151023e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043840852DNAL7 a10.1007/s0024400101972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalling-Sørensen, B.10aInhibition of Aerobic Growth and Nitrification of Bacteria in Sewage Sludge by Antibacterial Agents  ap. 451-460.  aToxicity of antibacterial agents on environmentally relevant bacteria was investigated using activated sludge. The growth and nitrifying inhibiting effects for activated sludge of benzyl penicillin (penicillin G) (BP), tetracycline (TC), chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), olaquindox (O), streptomycin (ST), tiamulin (TI), tylosin (TYL) sulfadiazine (SDZ), metronidazole (MET), and oxolinic acid (OXA) was investigated. Studies were performed in accordance to the ISO 15522 (1999) and ISO 9509 (1989) test guidelines, respectively. The toxicity (EC₅₀ value, mg/L) found with the ISO 15522 was in decreasing EC₅₀ values; O (95.7), BP (84.6), TYL (54.7), TI (14.3), TC (2.2), OTC (1.2), ST (0.47), CTC (0.40), and OXA (0.1). No observed effect concentrations (NOECs) (mg/L) of 100 and 60, respectively was found for MET and SDZ. Triplicate tests assessing the effects of the antibacterial agents on the nitrification rate gave indications only as the level of increased or decreased rate. More accurate data for the inhibition of Nitrosomonas europaea was found with a suspended culture of the nitrifying bacteria. The toxicity (EC₅₀ value, mg/L) found was in decreasing EC₅₀ values; TI (23.3), SDZ (17.0), TC (4.0), OTC (1.7), OXA (1.0), CTC (0.64), O (0.03), ST (0.02). For MET and TYL, NOECs (mg/L) of 100 and 50 were found, respectively. The antibacterial agents were also assessed using a pour plate method with both (separately tested) activated sludge bacteria and N. europeae showing to be 5 to 10 times more potent to most agents except SDZ, TI, and MET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas europaea 3aactivated sludge 3aaerobiosis 3aantibacterial properties 3abenzylpenicillin 3achlortetracycline 3aguidelines 3ametronidazole 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3aolaquindox 3aoxolinic acid 3aoxytetracycline 3asewage sludge 3astreptomycin 3asulfadiazine 3atesting 3atetracycline 3atiamulin 3atoxicity 3atylosin0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2001 Apr., v. 40, no. 4 p.451-460dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0024400101973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001600284520147400300592002801774650001601802650001201818650002101830650001901851650001201870650002301882650001401905650004301919650001301962650002501975650002102000700001702021700002302038700002102061700001402082773012502096856008102221990002302302852000902325655001202334IND60094836520221123021015.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, A.R.10aStatus of serum magnesium in type 2 diabetes mellitus with particular reference to serum triacylglycerol levels  ap. 187-189.  aMagnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body and the second most common intracellular cation. The association between hypomagnesemia and insulin resistance (IR) in diabetes mellitus has been documented earlier. However, we wanted to study whether the extracellular status of magnesium (Mg) could be a biochemical mediator between hypertriacylglycerolemia and diabetes mellitus. AIMS: To find out the probable association among HbA1c, triacylglycerol (TG) and magnesium levels – a predictor of vascular complications in T₂DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who had attended the diabetic clinics during the period of this study were included. All the samples were analysed for glucose, TG, Mg, and HbA1c. For statistical analysis, SPSS 17 package was used. RESULTS: Serum TG (236.67*, 195.06) and HbA1C (9.97*, 8.57) levels were independently compared between the two groups and were significantly high in group A subjects (Mg<1.2mg/dl) as compared to group B subjects (Mg>1.2mg/dl) (*p-value<0.05), respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Hypertriacylglycerolemia was pronounced in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with accompanying hypomagnesemia. This compared well with that of the glycemic control. Low Mg levels, high TG levels in association with enhanced HbA1c levels could thus serve as a reliable biochemical indicator of insulin status and action without resorting to the usage of criteria for insulin sensitivity and resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3ahypomagnesemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amagnesium 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3astatistical analysis 3atriacylglycerols1 aNiranjan, G.1 aKuzhandai Velu, V.1 aParmar, Pragnesh1 aAnish, A.0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 4 p.187-189dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03884naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010500166300001600271520220600287592002802493650001802521650001502539650001502554650002002569650001102589650002502600650001902625650002702644650001602671650002902687650001002716650001102726650001702737650001502754650002602769650001502795650001302810650002102823650000902844650002302853650001802876650001102894653003602905653002602941653003602967653002203003653007903025700001803104773011303122856008603235852000903321655001203330IND60612462320221119052554.0201125e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061246232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiayan10aIntegrated life cycle assessment of improving saline-sodic soil with flue gas desulfurization gypsum  ap. 332-341.  aA large quantity of flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG), a by-product of removing sulfur from combustion gases in coal-ﬁred power generation plants, was produced in the world. Improving saline-sodic soils with FGDG is one of the effective ways to utilize FGDG. However, the use of FGDG has severe impacts on the environment. With growing application of FGDG for improving soils, there is an increasing necessity to analyze the environmental impact on the entire agricultural application process. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is useful for comparing the potential risks of different environmental impact categories and stages. Traditional LCA methods have some limits in comparing various schemes, while the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has its unique advantages in multi-objective decision-making. Therefore, this study identified and compared the environmental impacts of four alternative schemes in three stages using LCA combined with TOPSIS. In this study, the environmental impact of improving 1 ha saline-sodic soil was assessed, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the effects of the changes in heavy metals in FGDG and in irrigation. The highest impact category was water consumption, with a weighted environmental impact value of 2.20 × 10⁻¹ and a contribution rate of 42.216%. The second-highest environmental impact category was soil toxicity, with a weighted environmental impact potential value of 8.04 × 10⁻² and a contribution rate of 15.429%. The soil toxicity was mostly from the application stage, while the water and energy consumption were mainly from the irrigation of planting stage. Acidification and eutrophication were mainly from fertilizer applications. Effective measures, including scientific use of fertilizers and pesticide, reasonable irrigation and strict control of heavy metals in FGDG should be employed to mitigate environmental risks during the agricultural application of FGDG. This study constructed a framework for the environmental impacts of improving saline-sodic soils with FGDG integrated with TOPSIS, and can be considered as an effort to advance the application of LCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abyproducts 3acombustion 3adecision making 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aeutrophication 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3aflue gas desulfurization 3agases 3agypsum 3aheavy metals 3airrigation 3alife cycle assessment 3apesticides 3aplanting 3apower generation 3arisk 3asaline sodic soils 3asoil toxicity 3asulfur 0aFlue gas desulfurization gypsum 0aLife cycle assessment 0aEnvironmental impact assessment 0aSaline-sodic soil 0aTechnique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS)1 aJinman Wang, 0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 202 p.332-341dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002200162245007800184300001600262520101400278592002801292650002501320650001301345650001201358650001201370650001201382650001301394650001101407650001101418650000901429650000901438650001401447650001401461650001201475650002601487650001101513650001401524650001301538650001301551650001101564650001101575650001301586650000901599650002801608650002501636650003801661650002801699650002101727650002901748651001001777700002001787773012901807852000901936856007701945930003302022945001302055946001302068655001202081IND60438408820221122110835.0151023e200104  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043840882DNAL7 a115254882pmid7 a10.1007/s0024400101982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, J.

The concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, S, Se, and Zn in the mosses were determined, then the contamination factors were calculated by dividing each value by the corresponding background level of that element. To assess contamination using contamination factors (CFs), a scale was established that allowed categorization of sampling sites for each element determined. The proposed scale comprises six categories, ranging from CF values of less than 1 (no contamination) to values of greater than 27 (extreme contamination). Finally, all available information was brought together and summarized in a contamination index. This index has the advantage that it takes into account the toxicity of the elements and that can be used with an already existing scale of classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypnum cupressiforme 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3airon 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amercury 3amosses and liverworts 3anickel 3apotassium 3asampling 3aselenium 3asodium 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aAir Pollutionxanalysis 2aBryopsidaxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aReference Values 2aTrace Elementsxanalysis 3aSpain1 aCarballeira, A.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2001 Apr., v. 40, no. 4 p.461-468dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0024400101983Available from publisher's site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111040001800132100002100150245014300171300001800314506017300332520124200505650002001747650002501767650000801792650001101800650001401811650002301825650002801848650002201876650002001898650003101918650001001949650001601959650001101975650001401986650004302000650001002043650005202053650002402105700002102129700002302150700002202173700002302195773008902218856011202307956009102419961000902510852000902519655001202528IND60006157920221214230208.0151007e20150921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000615792DNAL7 a3146872aris7 a10113/615792hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Rhiana F.10aDetection of Gene Expression Changes in Capsicum annuum L.

Evaluating gene expression during foliar blight can be used to identify expression patterns associated with resistance in Capsicum species. This study reports a direct comparison of gene expression changes during the foliar blight syndrome using two different races of P. capsici on C. annuum host plants with resistant and susceptible phenotypes to those races. Four genes were evaluated for differential expression following leaf inoculation with P. capsici. RNA isolated from leaves at three time points was used to quantify gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Of four genes tested, two had differential expression in response to P. capsici at 72 hours postinoculation, a xyloglucan-specific endo-β-1,4-glucanase inhibitor protein (XEGIP2) in susceptible cultivar New Mexico Heritage 6-4 (NMH6-4), and a C. annuum cell wall protein (CWP) in resistant Criollo de Morelos 334 (CM334). Both genes had a 5-fold increase in transcription in leaves over the control. These results suggest that both genes are playing a role in disease resistance to foliar blight. 3aCapsicum annuum 3aPhytophthora capsici 3aRNA 3ablight 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araces 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astructural proteins1 aBosland, Paul W.1 aSteiner, Robert L.1 aJones, Richard W.1 aO'Connell, Mary A.0 tHortScience.g2015 Sept. 21, v. 50, no. 9 p.1342-1348wJournal:1941x0018-53457nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/615793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/HortScience.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012900165300001800294520208200312592002802394650001602422650001902438650001602457650001102473650001602484650001402500650002402514650000902538650001302547650002302560650001102583650001302594650001202607650001602619653002102635653001602656653001702672653001802689653001002707700001402717700001702731700001502748700001802763700001602781700001502797700001502812700002002827773010802847856008202955852000903037655001203046IND60696616220221119193248.0210311e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069661622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Zhaoxiang10aAcetic acid, vinegar, and citric acid as washing materials for cuticle removal to improve hatching performance of quail eggs  ap. 3865-3876.  aThe cuticle is the outmost layer of the eggshell and may affect the hatchability by modulating eggshell conductance. Three different solutions using acetic acid (AA), vinegar (V), and citric acid (CA) for cuticle removal by egg washing were developed, and the effects of cuticle removal on hatching performance of quail hatching eggs were evaluated. A total of 5,238 fresh quail hatching eggs were randomly divided into 9 treatments as follows: unwashed control, nondipped (CND); washed control, water dipped (CWD); standard control, 0.13% sodium hyperchlorite (CSH); 2% AA (AA2); 4% AA (AA4); 44.4% V (V2); 88.8% V (V4); 2% CA (CA2); and 4% CA (CA4). Overall, AA4, V4, and CA4 treatments significantly improved the hatchability of fertile eggs (95.42%, 94.16% and 95.66%, respectively) (P < 0.05) and the hatchability of CND, CWD, CSH, AA2, V2 and CA2 treatments were 90.98%, 93.00%, 92.27%, 79.44%, 90.37%, and 90.59%, respectively. The eggshell thickness and cuticle quality results showed that all AA, V, and CA solutions can effectively remove the quail eggshell cuticle, and AA4, V4 and CA4 significantly decreased eggshell thickness (P < 0.05). Microbial activity on the eggshell surface in all acid treatments was reduced significantly at day 0 of incubation (P < 0.05) and that significantly decreased than controlled treatments over the incubation period except AA2 treatment.Egg weight loss was lower for all acid treatments than that of the CND treatment (P < 0.05). There was no clear effect of treatments on chick quality. Hatch time in AA4, V4, and CA4 treatments slightly improved compared with controlled treatments (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between treatments for chick livability and live weight at the first 21 D of life. Results of the present study indicate that cuticle removal with AA4, V4, or CA4 could effectively decrease the microbial activity on the eggshell surface during the incubation period and improve hatchability of quail hatching eggs without negative effects on hatch time and performance of quail chicks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aacid treatment 3abody weight 3achicks 3acitric acid 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3aeggs 3ahatching 3amicrobial activity 3aquails 3avinegars 3awashing 3aweight loss 0aeggshell cuticle 0aegg washing 0ahatchability 0achick quality 0aquail1 aChen, Xia1 aShi, Xuefeng1 aLi, Xianyu1 aLi, Chengfeng1 aLi, Junying1 aXu, Guiyun1 aYang, Ning1 aZheng, Jiangxia0 tPoultry science.g2020 Aug., v. 99, no. 8 p.3865-3876dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281520159100297592002801888650001801916650002901934650001701963650001801980650001701998650001602015650002002031650002102051650002302072650002002095650004302115650002102158650001302179650001702192650002502209651001502234700001802249773012502267856008102392990002302473852000902496655001202505IND60094836720221123021149.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYavari, Alireza10aEffect of oxidative stress on immunological parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Azerbaijan Republic  ap. 195-198.  aAIM: The study of lipid peroxidation (LPO) state and antioxidant protection (AOP) in blood plasma of patients with diabetes mellitus and the consequent changes of some immunological data depending on the severity of the pathological process. METHODS: All patients (n=76), depending on the level of glycemia and disease duration were divided into 3 groups at the stages of compensation, subcompensation and decompensation. The level of glycated hemoglobin (Hb₁Ac) was determined as the biochemical marker. Parameters of the LPO intensity – malondialdehyde and dien conjugates, antioxidant system parameters – SOD, GSH and ceruloplasmin, immune parameters – IgA, M, G, CIC and phagocytic activity were determined in all groups of patients including the control group. RESULTS: Amounts of MDA and DC increased at all stages of the disease. In contrast, decreases in antioxidant system parameters – SOD, GSH and ceruloplasmin were observed. The oxidative stress increase resulted in the decline of phagocytic activity in the three groups by 23%, 29% and 52%, respectively. Amounts of T-lymphocytes were also decreased by 9.8%, 28% and 32%. But CIC were observed to increase. CONCLUSION: Intensification of the oxidative stress and the decrease in the antioxidant system protective function stimulate alterations in immune system parameters – amounts of immunoglobulins and immune complexes increased and phagocytic activity decreased. It suggests that the level of the oxidative stress effect on the alterations in immune parameters directly depends on the stage of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigen-antibody complex 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3ablood plasma 3aferroxidase 3aglycohemoglobin 3aimmunoglobulin A 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aAzerbaijan1 aAzizova, G.I.0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 4 p.195-198dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.08.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011600168300001600284520169400300592002801994650001302022650001302035650003202048650001202080650001602092650001002108650002602118650001302144650001202157650002302169650001102192650000902203700002402212700002202236700002602258700002702284773011602311856008302427852000902510655001202519IND60624102420221117180303.0181201e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062410242DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265020170063652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFung, Ellen B.10aPlasma Zinc Is an Insensitive Predictor of Zinc Status: Use of Plasma Zinc in Children With Sickle Cell Disease  ap. 365-372.  aBackground: This study was designed to explore the use of plasma zinc in determining zinc deficiency in children with sickle cell disease-SS (SCD-SS) as indicated by a growth response to zinc supplementation. Methods: Fasting plasma zinc was assessed in children with SCD-SS (ages 4 to 10 years) who were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg zinc/d in cherry syrup (zinc) or cherry syrup alone (placebo) for 12 months. Evaluations for growth, dietary intake, and other biochemical parameters were made at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. Longitudinal mixed effects analysis evaluated differences between groups over 12 months. Results: A total of 38 prepubertal children (20 male and 18 female; 18 zinc and 20 placebo) completed the study (7.1 ± 1.7 years old). At baseline, plasma zinc was low (≤70 μg/dL) in 7 male subjects. Despite the significant increase in height over 12 months (+0.7 cm) with zinc supplementation (p = .019), plasma zinc did not change over the 12 months of study, and there was no association between plasma zinc and linear growth. Those children with low plasma zinc who received zinc supplementation showed improved linear growth. Conclusions: These findings suggest that plasma zinc is an insensitive indicator of zinc status in children with SCD-SS. Children with low plasma zinc will benefit from zinc supplementation. However, some children with normal plasma zinc and poor growth may also have growth-limiting zinc deficiency and exhibit a growth response to zinc supplementation. Although this study focused on children with SCD-SS, results may be generalized to other pediatric clinical illnesses where nutrition-related growth failure is investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acherries 3achildren 3adietary mineral supplements 3afemales 3afood intake 3amales 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplacebos 3apuberty 3asickle cell anemia 3asyrups 3azinc1 aKawchak, Deborah A.1 aZemel, Babette S.1 aOhene-Frempong, Kwaku1 aStallings, Virginia A.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 17, no. 6 p.365-372dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265020170063653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002000167245009200187300001600279500000900295520087400304592002801178650001601206650001901222650001401241650001901255650002501274650001101299650001901310650001501329650002501344650001301369650001701382700002201399700001801421700001701439700002001456773012301476852000901599856009701608655001201705991592023140742620221117022951.0191122e197109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191658062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300050005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorashy, S.

This study describes the effect of the concentration (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) of novel carrier agents, agave fructans (FOS) and maltodextrin (MD), in a chlorophyll extract spray-drying process on colour, antioxidant activity, and stability. A pilot plant was employed with a spray-dryer feed flow rate of 13% and an atomisation level of 28000 rpm. The air inlet and outlet temperatures were 180 and 80°C, respectively. A MD concentration of 0.5% was enough to obtain a chemically and physiochemically stable encapsulated chlorophyll powder. High inlet air temperatures reduced the chlorophyll content from 18 to 6 mg/g; high concentrations of the carrier agent also decreased the chlorophyll content. The results showed that, under conditions of low inlet temperature and concentration, both wall materials were efficient in microencapsulating chlorophyll for potential use in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  cBIOBERSA®  cAGAVEN®  cWashington State University 3aAgave 3aair 3aair temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3aatomization 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3afood industry 3afructans 3amaltodextrins 3amicroencapsulation 3aspray drying 3azinc1 aChávez-Rodríguez, Alejandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8666-15251 aChávez-Rodríguez, Arturo Moises1 aFlores-Martínez, Hector1 aFarías-Cervantes, Vania Sbeyde1 aAndrade-González, Isaac1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4004-63080 tJournal of food quality.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/63125843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245019200168300002000360520129300380592002801673650002201701650002101723650002201744650002601766650001901792650001901811650002201830650001601852653002601868653003301894653001901927653002701946653002601973700003101999700002502030700002102055700002902076700002802105700002702133773012602160856008002286852000902366655001202375IND60528309620221118220417.0160716e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052830962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b036932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoumeli, Eleftheria10aAmino-Functionalized Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes Lead to Successful Ring-Opening Polymerization of Poly(ε-caprolactone): Enhanced Interfacial Bonding and Optimized Mechanical Properties  ap. 11683-11694.  aIn this work, the synthesis, structural characteristics, interfacial bonding, and mechanical properties of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocomposites with small amounts (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 wt %) of amino-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) prepared by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) are reported. This method allows the creation of a covalent-bonding zone on the surface of nanotubes, which leads to efficient debundling and therefore satisfactory dispersion and effective load transfer in the nanocomposites. The high covalent grafting extent combined with the higher crystallinity provide the basis for a significant enhancement of the mechanical properties, which was detected in the composites with up to 1 wt % f-MWCNTs. Increasing filler concentration encourages intrinsic aggregation forces, which allow only minor grafting efficiency and poorer dispersion and hence inferior mechanical performance. f-MWCNTs also cause a significant improvement on the polymerization reaction of PCL. Indeed, the in situ polymerization kinetics studies reveal a significant decrease in the reaction temperature, by a factor of 30–40 °C, combined with accelerated the reaction kinetics during initiation and propagation and a drastically reduced effective activation energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrystal structure 3amechanical properties 3ananocomposites 3apolymerization 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 0apoly(ε-caprolactone) 0amultiwalled carbon nanotubes 0ananocomposites 0ain situ polymerization 0amechanical properties1 aPapageorgiou, Dimitrios

Therefore, this study asked whether trampling of peat soils had a significant effect on a major carbon flux pathway of peat ecosystems i.e. surface exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere. This study simulated regular trampling by sheep on peat cores for a period of 6months and monitored the CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Additionally, it also investigated the impact of the cessation of trampling.Results show that photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 were significantly decreased following trampling by up to 75% relative to control cores. Cessation of trampling led to a significant increase in ecosystem respiration after just 3months but photosynthesis and net ecosystem exchange were not significantly different to the pre-cessation period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3agrazing 3ahighlands 3anet ecosystem exchange 3apeat 3apeat soils 3aphotosynthesis 3asheep 3atrampling damage 3aUnited Kingdom 0aCarbon dioxide 0aDisturbance 0aLand management 0aSoil compaction1 aWorrall, Fred0 tGeoderma.g2013 Apr., v. 197-198 p.59-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245011200168300001800280520118000298592002801478650001601506650001501522650002701537650001601564650001401580650001101594650001601605650002001621650001401641650001201655650001101667651002201678700001901700700001401719700001901733773010301752856005501855852000901910655001201919IND50069494420221116160933.0130926e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006949442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2006.03204.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBYRNE, M.10aExtensive pollen dispersal in a bird‐pollinated shrub, Calothamnus quadrifidus, in a fragmented landscape  ap. 1303-1314.  aPollen dispersal was investigated in six populations of Calothamnus quadrifidus, a bird-pollinated shrub in the fragmented agricultural region of southern Western Australia. Paternity analysis using six microsatellite loci identified a pollen source within populations for 67% of seedlings, and the remainder were assumed to have arisen from pollen sources outside the populations. Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 5% to 82%, and long-distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 43% of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of up to 5 km. This extensive pollen immigration was positively associated with population size but not isolation. Comparison of two populations of similar size but different density showed greater internal pollination and less selfing in the denser population, suggesting an influence of density on pollinator behaviour. The study revealed extensive long-distance pollen dispersal for C. quadrifidus within this fragmented agricultural landscape and highlighted the interaction between reserve populations and isolated road verge remnants in maintaining genetic connectivity at the landscape scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalothamnus 3alandscapes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoutcrossing 3apaternity 3apollen 3apollination 3apopulation size 3aseedlings 3aselfing 3ashrubs 3aWestern Australia1 aELLIOTT, C.

This study presents a concept for cultivation of the intra-row and close to crop area. The weeding tool consists of an arm holder and three or more integrated arms, which are carriers of the end effectors. The hoeing tool rotates around a horizontal axis, which is positioned directly above the crop row and moves along it. The system is similar to the rotational crop thinning systems used in the past. Main differences compared with the thinning systems is the adjustment of the angular position of the arms in relation to the plane, perpendicular to the rotation axis and on-line tuning of the rotational speed depending on the travelling speed, detected distance between two adjacent plants and angular position of the weeding tool. Systems modularity allows application of various weeding strategies regarding the number of consecutive cultivation trajectories of the end effectors between adjacent plants. Trajectories number is affected by the in-row distance between the plants, used type of end effector and plants development stage.A virtual prototype of the weeding tool was used for testing the behaviour of the system for various weeding strategies, considering inter alia the problem of irregular distances between the adjacent plants. Weeding strategies with one, two and three consecutive trajectories between adjacent plants, with and without adjustment of the angular position were simulated and analysed. The size of the unaffected spaces around the crop plant was calculated. The results proved that an optimised adjustment of the arms angular position affects the size of the cultivated area between two adjacent plants and the unaffected space around the crop plant. Furthermore, advantages of the presented concept in terms of more flexible cultivation of the close to crop area were demonstrated. Based on the results of simulation, lower rate of plant injuring during the weeding can be expected, in comparison to the similar weeding tool concepts, without the possibility to adjust the angular position of the arms. In additional simulation set the behaviour of the system was observed while proportional (P-) control of the rotational speed and irregular in-row distances between plants were simulated. The results showed adequate adaptation and accurate positioning of the cultivated area between the adjacent plants, in spite of the irregularity of in-row distances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3amanual weed control 3aplanting 0aMechanical weed control 0aIntra-row weed control 0aMechatronic weeding system 0aDigital prototype 0aSimulation 0aKinematical analysis1 aSchulze Lammers, P.1 aMartinov, M.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2013 Oct., v. 98 p.166-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2013.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003900150245008600189300001600275520172600291592002802017650001602045650001802061650001302079650002002092650002402112650002002136650001502156650001702171650001802188650002602206650002302232650001902255650002102274650001902295650000702314650001602321650001302337650001102350650001302361653002302374653002102397653000902418653001202427653002402439653001502463700002402478700002002502700002002522700003002542773008102572856008402653852000902737655001202746IND60546771020221117230040.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054677102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Delgado Juárez, Marina10aCo-composting of biowaste and wood ash, influence on a microbially driven-process  ap. 155-164.  aA trial at semi-industrial scale was conducted to evaluate the effect of wood ash amendment on communal biowaste in a composting process and on the final composts produced. For this purpose, three treatments including an unamended control (C0) and composts with additions of 6% (C6), and 12% (C12) of wood ash (w/w) were studied, and physico-chemical parameters as well as microbial activity and community composition were investigated. At the end of the process, composts were tested for toxicity and quality, and microbial physiological activity. The influence of ash addition on compost temperature, pH, microbial activity and composition was stronger during the early composting stages and diminished with time, whereby composts became more similar. Using the COMPOCHIP microarray, a reduction in the pathogenic genera Listeria and Clostridium was observed, which together with the temperature increases of the composting process helped in the hygienisation of composts. Lactobacillus species were also affected, such that reduced hybridisation signals were observed with increased ash addition, due to the increased pH values in amended composts. Organic matter mineralisation was also increased through ash addition, and no negative effects on the composting process were observed. The nutrient content of the final products was increased through the addition of ash, and no toxic effects were observed. Nonetheless, greater concentrations of heavy metals were found in composts amended with more ash, which resulted in a downgrading of the compost quality according to the Austrian Compost Ordinance. Thus, regulation of both input materials and end-product quality is essential in optimising composting processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aLactobacillus 3aListeria 3aadverse effects 3acommunity structure 3acompost quality 3acomposting 3aheavy metals 3ahybridization 3amicroarray technology 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3apH 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastes 3awood ash 0aWaste valorisation 0aCompost maturity 0aDGGE 0aCompost 0aHeavy metal content 0aSanitation1 aPrähauser, Barbara1 aWalter, Andreas1 aInsam, Heribert1 aFranke-Whittle, Ingrid H.0 tWaste management.g2015 Dec., v. 46 p.155-164dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013300161300002000294520100400314592002801318650001101346650001401357650001501371650002101386650001301407650001401420700001501434700001601449700001401465700001701479700001801496700001401514700001701528700001401545700001601559700002301575700001901598700001801617700001601635773014301651856007501794852000901869655001201878IND60752716320221120025546.0211006e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075271632DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta06313h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Longcheng10aCoTe nanoparticle-embedded N-doped hollow carbon polyhedron: an efficient catalyst for H₂O₂ electrosynthesis in acidic media  ap. 21703-21707.  aRational design and development of high-efficiency electrocatalytic materials made from earth-abundant elements for H₂O₂ generation via a two-electron O₂ reduction reaction (2e⁻ ORR) is of crucial significance but still challenging. Here, we demonstrate that CoTe nanoparticles embedded in a nitrogen-doped hollow carbon polyhedron (CoTe@NC) can be adopted as a highly selective and stable 2e⁻ ORR electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the highly active CoTe nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped hollow carbon polyhedron, in 0.1 M HClO₄, the CoTe@NC hybrid exhibits superb electrocatalytic activity toward the 2e⁻ ORR with high selectivity of up to 92.6% and a large H₂O₂ production rate of 297.9 ppm h⁻¹ at −0.044 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, it operates rather stably under the working conditions with a negligible current decrease after 12 h.

As an ideology, it is criticized for failing to engender national belonging and social cohesion and thereby to encourage groups of citizens to have parallel lives. In this article, we present the case of Mauritius that is often viewed as a successful plural society. We discuss the conditions that are conducive to a working multiculturalism in Mauritius as well as the challenges. We use empirical findings from our relatively large-scale survey research among adolescents from the three main ethnic groups (i.e., Hindus, Creoles, Muslims). The metaphorical representation of the nation as a rainbow or fruit salad means that cultural diversity forms part of the national self-image, but within a secular state where individual rights prevail. Our findings show that all participants reported strong and compatible national, ethnic, and religious group identifications and that dual identity was the most chosen identity option. Furthermore, intergroup relations tended to be positive but there was a strong preference for ethnic endogamy. Additionally, there were social psychological processes that work against harmonious intergroup relations. The article concludes by discussing what can be learned from Mauritian style multiculturalism.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMuslims 3aadolescents 3amulticultural diversity 3asocial cohesion 3asurveys 3aMauritius 0amulticulturalism 0asecular state 0anational and ethnic belonging 0aintergroup evaluations1 aVerkuyten, M.,0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 6 p.679-701dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642145664983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245015200211300001600363520106800379592002801447650001901475650002101494650001601515650001901531650002001550650002601570650002101596650001501617650002301632650003101655650001301686650001501699650002601714650001601740650002901756651001001785651001301795651000901808651001201817653002301829653003701852653002101889653002201910653001301932653002101945700001901966700006201985700003102047700002602078700002702104700002802131700002902159700001802188700002102206700002602227700001902253700002202272700002302294700002002317773009702337856008702434852000902521655001202530IND60637464820221119085229.0190617e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063746482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngenbleek, Luc1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9100-146010aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in foods from the first regional total diet study in Sub-Saharan Africa: contamination profile and occurrence data  ap. 133-144.  aAs part of the first multi-centre Sub-Saharan Africa Total Diet Study, 660 typical foods from Benin, Cameroon, Mali, and Nigeria were purchased, prepared according to local consumption habits, and pooled into 55 composite samples. These core foods were tested for 15 + 1 EU priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which were quantified by isotope dilution and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The sum of benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and chrysene (PAH4) represented 77% of the 13 genotoxic and carcinogenic PAHs. The highest PAH4 concentration was quantified in sea and fresh water smoked fish (mean: 179.7 μg/kg; max: 560.4 μg/kg) and the PAH4 in all smoked fish composite samples exceeded the EU maximum limit of 12 μg/kg. Further, PAH4 in edible oils (including palm oil and peanut oil) exceeded the EU maximum limit of 10 μg/kg in 50% of the cases (mean 12.0 μg/kg; max: 60.6 μg/kg). These data can be used for assessing the contribution of core foods to dietary exposure and for risk characterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aTotal Diet Study 3aanthracenes 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acarcinogenicity 3acooking fats and oils 3adietary exposure 3afreshwater 3agas chromatography 3aisotope dilution technique 3amutagens 3apeanut oil 3arisk characterization 3asmoked fish 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aBenin 3aCameroon 3aMali 3aNigeria 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aTotal diet study 0aFood contaminants 0aGC-MS/MS 0aIsotope dilution1 aVeyrand, Bruno1 aAdegboye, Abimbola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9978-84451 aHossou, Sètondji Epiphane1 aKoné, Abdoulaye Zié1 aOyedele, Awoyinka Dada1 aKisito, Chabi Sika K.J.1 aDembélé, Yara Koreissi1 aEyangoh, Sara1 aVerger, Philippe1 aLeblanc, Jean-Charles1 aDurand, Sophie1 aVenisseau, Anaïs1 aMarchand, Philippe1 aLe Bizec, Bruno0 tFood control.g2019 Sept., v. 103 p.133-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009900163300001600262520043300278592002800711650002200739650002300761650002300784650002300807650002200830653001000852653002200862653001300884653002200897653001800919700002200937700001800959773015000977856007701127852000901204655001201213IND60522337220221119144258.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233722DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-06292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeersman, Filip10aOn the Thermal Expansion of Water and the Phase Behavior of Macromolecules in Aqueous Solution  ap. 785-790.  aWater is crucial for the existence of life as we know it, and many have wondered what makes water so special.

We used an integrated approach combining sensory analysis and physicochemistry to investigate the impact of swallowing on aroma release and perception. A panel of 10 persons evaluated the dynamics of aroma perception during the consumption of a commercial flavored vodka, using the method of temporal dominance of sensations. Two protocols (spitting out or swallowing of the product) were tested. Nosespace analysis was simultaneously carried out by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry to evaluate aroma release in the nasal cavity. Comparison of the results obtained with the 2 protocols highlighted significant differences in both the perception and the release of aroma: the swallowing of the product resulted in more complex perceptions but decreased the dominance rates of aromatic attributes. Ethanol perception also had an impact when the product was swallowed. Aroma release data partly accounted for the differences in perception, particularly as concerned ethanol release. The time at which dominance appears as well as the dominance duration of some attributes can be related to some temporal parameters of release data. But the lack of knowledge concerning the variety and complexity of mechanisms continues to limit our understanding of relationship between aroma release and perception.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeglutition 3aethanol 3amass spectrometry 3anasal cavity 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 3avodka 2aAdult 2aAlcoholic Beveragesxanalysis 2aDeglutition 2aEthanolxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aOlfactory Perception 2aYoung Adult1 aSaint-Eve, Anne1 aGuo, Yilin1 aLieben, Pascale1 aCypriani, Marie-Louise1 aJacquet, Nathalie1 aBrunerie, Pascal1 aSouchon, Isabelle0 tChemical senses.g2011 Oct., v. 36, no. 8 p.701-713dOxford University Pressx0379-864X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjr0383Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245011400163300001600277520142400293536017901717592002801896650002301924650002101947650002201968650002401990650001302014650001902027650001602046650001202062651001102074653002102085653001902106653002302125653001102148700002202159773011102181856008002292852000902372655001202381IND60620940420221120234033.0181114e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062094042DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642145664992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooghe, Marc10aHow Does the Majority Public React to Multiculturalist Policies? A Comparative Analysis of European Countries  ap. 747-768.  aMigration and ethnic minority integration remain heavily contested issues in numerous European countries. Over the past decade, researchers and political commentators have observed an apparent retreat from multiculturalist policies related to a belief that multiculturalism has lost support among the majority public. Recently, however, based on analyses of the evolution of migrant integration policies, it has been demonstrated that multiculturalist policies were largely left in place. To investigate the effect of multiculturalist policies on public opinion, we use a multilevel analysis of three policy indicators (Multiculturalism Policy Index, Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and Migrant Integration Policy Index) and European Social Survey data in 20 European countries. Results show that multiculturalist policies, as measured by Multiculturalism Policy Index and Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants–Cultural diversity, and migrant integration policies more generally, as measured by Migrant Integration Policy Index, to some extent are associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant sentiments, while they do not affect public attitudes toward political institutions. Regarding political attitudes, especially respondents with higher education levels tend to respond in a more positive manner to multiculturalist policies than respondents with lower education levels.  aFunding The author (s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: ERC Advanced Grant “Linkage”  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducational status 3ahigher education 3aissues and policy 3aminorities (people) 3apolitics 3apublic opinion 3aresearchers 3asurveys 3aEurope 0amulticulturalism 0apublic opinion 0aintegration policy 0aEurope1 ade Vroome, Thomas0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 6 p.747-768dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642145664993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008100165300001600246520105900262592002801321650003501349650002601384650001801410650001201428650001301440650001701453650001401470653001801484653001901502653003501521700002401556700001901580700002501599773015001624856007701774852000901851655001201860IND60522337320221119144019.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233732DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-06302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlovic, Melanie10aCharacterisation of a Piezotolerant Mutant of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis  ap. 791-797.  aIncubation under sublethal high pressure (50 MPa) allowed the isolation of a piezotolerant mutant of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. Compared to the wild type this strain showed faster growth at 50 MPa and an altered temperature-dependent growth at ambient pressure. Additionally, an altered antibiotic resistance pattern was detected. To address the molecular basis of the mutation the genotypic characterisation was focused on alterations of ribosomal components. Northern analysis using ssrA (transfer mRNA) as probe revealed a constitutive overexpression in the mutant. A 2.2 fold induction after pressure shock and increased pressure sensitivity of a ssrA-insertional mutant of L. sanfranciscensis indicate the tmRNA as genetic determinant of a piezotolerance response in the wild type. Thus, we propose trans-translation and peptide tagging, processes that promote recycling of stalled ribosomes and prevent accumulation of abortively synthesised polypeptides to be involved in combating high-pressure damage and conferring moderate piezotolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus sanfranciscensis 3aantibiotic resistance 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3amutation 3apolypeptides 3aribosomes 0aHigh Pressure 0aPiezotolerance 0aLactobacillus sanfranciscensis1 aHörmann, Sebastian1 aVogel, Rudi F.1 aEhrmann, Matthias A.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 6 p.791-797dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-06303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001400267520148600281592002801767650001401795650001701809650001501826650002201841650002501863650002101888650001301909650001401922653001601936653002401952653004901976653002202025700001802047700001902065700001502084700001802099700001602117700002102133773007902154856008402233852000902317655001202326IND60546771320221117230128.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054677132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeeters, Jef R.10aForecasting waste compositions: A case study on plastic waste of electronic display housings  ap. 28-39.  aBecause of the rapid succession of technological developments, the architecture and material composition of many products used in daily life have drastically changed over the last decades. As a result, well-adjusted recycling technologies need to be developed and installed to cope with these evolutions. This is essential to guarantee continued access to materials and to reduce the ecological impact of our material consumption. However, limited information is currently available on the material composition of arising waste streams and even less on how these waste streams will evolve. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to forecast trends in the material composition of waste streams. To demonstrate the applicability and value of the proposed methodology, it is applied to forecast the evolution of plastic housing waste from flat panel display (FPD) TVs, FPD monitors, cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs and CRT monitors. The results of the presented forecasts indicate that a wide variety of plastic types and additives, such as flame retardants, are found in housings of similar products. The presented case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology allows the identification of trends in the evolution of the material composition of waste streams. In addition, it is demonstrated that the recycling sector will need to adapt its processes to deal with the increasing complexity of plastics of end-of-life electronic displays while respecting relevant directives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acase studies 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic wastes 3aenvironmental impact 3aflame retardants 3aplastics 3arecycling 0aForecasting 0aElectronic displays 0aWaste electrical electronic equipment (WEEE) 0aPlastic recycling1 aVanegas, Paul1 aKellens, Karel1 aWang, Feng1 aHuisman, Jaco1 aDewulf, Wim1 aDuflou, Joost R.0 tWaste management.g2015 Dec., v. 46 p.28-39dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010800158300001400266500001900280520131200299592002801611650001901639650001101658650001701669650001201686650001801698650001901716650001801735650001301753650001901766650001301785650002101798651001301819653002301832653002101855653002601876773012001902856007402022852000902096655001202105IND60694510920221116184530.0200513e19980501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069451092DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027603072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Choonsig10aSoil Nitrogen Mineralization at Various Levels of Canopy Cover in Red Pine (Pinus resinosa) Plantations  ap. 85-89.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to determine the rate of nitrogen (N) mineralization in response to various levels of canopy cover in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) stands. Experimental plots consisted of various levels of canopy cover,i.e., clearcut, 25% (50% during first sampling year), 75%, and uncut in red pine plantations in northern Lower Michigan, USA. Net N mineralization and nitrification in the top 15 cm of mineral soil were examined during the first two growing seasons (1991–1992) following the canopy cover manipulations, using anin situ buried bag technique. Mean net N mineralization over the course of both growing seasons (May—October) ranged from 26.9 kg ha–¹ per growing season in the clearcut treatment to 13.4 kg ha–¹ per growing season in the uncut stand. Net N mineralization and nitrification increased significantly in the clearcut treatment compared to the uncut treatment during the second growing season only. However, net N mineralization and nitrification did not differ significantly between the partial canopy cover treatments and the uncut stand. Increased N mineralization and nitrification in the clearcut during the second growing season may be associated with increased soil temperature and changes of organic matter quality with time since canopy removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus resinosa 3acanopy 3aclearcutting 3aforests 3amineral soils 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aresearch 3asoil temperature 3aMichigan 0acanopy disturbance 0aN mineralization 0anitrogen availability0 tJournal of forest research.g1998 May 1, v. 3, no. 2 p.85-89dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027603073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245014400166300001200310520059700322592002800919650001300947650001400960650002000974650001500994650001701009653002201026653002301048653002701071653001701098653002801115653002501143700001901168700002401187700002201211700002201233773013301255856007701388852000901465655001201474IND60522337420221119144150.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233742DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-07012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Arthur H.10aOxokohlenstoffe und verwandte Verbindungen. 32 [1].

Organic management can influence the N-fixing community; however, diazotroph community structure and activity in horticultural systems and the impacts of specific cultivation methods (i.e., greenhouse and open field) are unclear. Using the nifH gene, a marker gene for the microbial community involved in N fixation, we investigated the occurrence (DNA) and activity (RNA) of the diazotrophic community in organically and conventionally managed soils in a horticultural system over the course of 1 year. Ordination analysis of DGGE profiles revealed organic management affected the community structure in the greenhouse but not the open field; fertilization intensity may explain this divergent response, as indicated by the relevance of total C content to community structure. Quantitative PCR revealed that organic management increased the abundance and activity of diazotrophs. The soluble organic N concentration was higher in organically managed soils and during warmer months, and correlated with diazotroph abundance. Most identified sequences were from known diazotrophs, predominantly β-, γ- and α-proteobacteria. Twenty-four bands resembled Pseudomonas stutzeri and eight resembled Azoarcus sp. Our results show that the cultivation method controls the extent of the effects of season and organic management on diazotrophs, and that greenhouse cultivation can boost the effects of organic management on this community. Organic management intensified the positive effect of seasonal temperature on diazotroph abundance and activity, which may increase biological nitrogen fixation rates. In tandem, soil DNA and RNA analyses provide a comprehensive picture of the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzoarcus 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas stutzeri 3aRNA 3aalpha-Proteobacteria 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3ahorticultural soils 3ahorticulture 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aordination techniques 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 0aDGGE 0aDiazotroph 0aGene activity 0aHorticulture 0anifH 0aQuantitative PCR1 aYe, Jun1 aWang, Shu1 aWang, Xiaoli,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1987-93531 aHuang, DanFeng0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 July, v. 79 p.37-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012500156300001500281500001900296520067600315592002800991650002501019650001301044650001201057650001301069650001701082650002101099650001701120653002201137653001601159653002901175653002601204773012101230856007401351852000901425655001201434IND60694511120221116184326.0200513e19980501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069451112DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027603092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuto, Yasuo10aTraumatic Resin-Canal Formation Caused by Inoculation with Cistella japonica in Secondary Phloem of Chamaecyparis obtusa  ap. 99-102.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the resinous lesion development caused by the inoculation withCistella japonica onChamaecyparis obtusa stem, numerous traumatic resin-canals were formed at certain radial intervals in the secondary phloem.

It is important to know whether wetlands reclamation would affect soil invertebrates, especially the winter-active invertebrates. During November 2011 to April 2012, we used pitfall traps and in-field direct observation methods to study the activity of collembolans in wetland, and a reclaimed forest plantation and soybean field. In total, 3465 collembolans were captured and identified to 8 species from 6 families. Desoria sp. 1, Desoria sp. 2 and Desoria sp. 3 were the three dominant species. Collembolan abundance and assemblages were significantly affected by the land use changes. The results showed that (1) Collembola captured by pitfall traps showed a highest abundance in wetland, with ∼50% decreased abundance in soybean field, and ∼75% decreased in the forest plantation. (2) Collembola activity changed during the winter season, their activity significantly increased from early winter to late winter; with a peak in March in all three land use types. (3) Collembola assemblages were affected by land use changes with a significant decrease of frequency of Desoria sp. 3 and a significant increase of frequency of Desoria sp. 2 in soybean field and forest plantation. (4) Collembolan densities on the snow surface usually peaked between 1400h and 1500h, and decreased quickly when the temperature dropped below freezing. Mean abundance reached 119individualsm−2 on the snow surface in wetland, 152individualsm−2 in soybean field, and 64individualsm−2 in forest plantation. All collembolans moved up and down through the snow profile depending on temperature, no collembolans were found on the snow surface in the evening. Our study indicated that the reclamation of wetland resulted in a significant decrease of abundance and a different assemblage of winter active Collembola in Northeast China, but land use changes did not change their pattern of activity: Collembolans were rarely active in early and middle winter and mostly active in late winter. Their daily densities on the snow surface fluctuated according to both air temperatures and land use types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aair temperature 3aforest plantations 3afreezing 3afreshwater 3aland use change 3apitfall traps 3asnow 3asoil invertebrates 3asoybeans 3awetlands 3awinter 3aChina 0aCollembola 0aWinter-active 0aSnow cover 0aLand use 0aWetland 0aNortheast China1 aZhang, Liang,1 aNi, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1642-41181 aCallaham, Mac A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7915-427X1 aSun, Xin1 aWu, Donghui0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 Nov., v. 83 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012200163300001600285520112900301592002801430650002501458650001501483650001001498650001601508650002001524650001001544650001501554650002201569650001201591650001101603650002101614650002501635650001201660700001801672700001901690700002601709773011201735856004801847852000901895655001201904IND4513862220221119143415.0150901e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451386222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-011-0677-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocabay, Ozge10aCarboxymethylcelluloseâgelatinâsuperoxidase dismutase electrode for amperometric superoxide radical sensing  ap. 923-930.  aA novel, highly sensitive superoxide dismutase biosensor for the direct and simultaneous determination of superoxide radicals was developed by immobilization of superoxide dismutase within carboxymethylcelluloseâgelatin on a Pt electrode surface. The parameters affecting the performance of the biosensor were investigated. The response of the CMCâGâSOD biosensor was proportional to O 2 Â·â concentration and the detection limit was 1.25Â ÃÂ 10â3Â mM with a correlation coefficient of 0.9994. The developed biosensor exhibited high analytical performance with wider linear range, high sensitivity and low response time. The biosensor retained 89.8% of its sensitivity after use for 80 days. The support system enhanced the immobilization of superoxide dismutase and promoted the electron transfer of superoxide dismutase minimizing its fouling effect. The biosensor was quite effective not only in detecting O 2 Â·â , but also in determining the antioxidant properties of acetylsalicylic acid-based drugs and the anti-radical activity of healthy and cancerous human brain tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abiosensors 3abrain 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3afouling 3ahumans 3asuperoxide anion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues1 aEmregul, Emel1 aAras, SÃ¼mer1 aEmregul, Kaan Cebesoy0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2012 Aug., v. 35, no. 6 p.923-930dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-011-0677-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009000169300001400259520123800273592002801511650001201539650001201551650001401563650002501577650002201602650001701624650001301641650001701654650001601671650001301687700002301700700003101723773009901754856008101853990002301934852000901957655001201966IND60093165720221117233915.0141103e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009316572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe La Torre, Unai10aCu-zeolite NH₃-SCR catalysts for NOₓ removal in the combined NSR–SCR technology  ap. 10-17.  aThe challenge of efficient NOₓ removal from diesel and lean-burn engine exhaust gas by combining NSR and SCR catalyst is studied. Several Cu exchanged zeolites have been prepared, varying the preparation method (ion exchange and impregnation), the copper content (1–6%) and the zeolite (BETA and ZSM5). The prepared catalysts have been characterized, and acidity, surface area, crystallinity and metal reducibility have been compared. SCR experiments under 750ppm NO, 750ppm NH₃ and 9.5% O₂ (Ar to balance) discriminated low copper loading, prepared by ion exchange catalyst (Z-IE-1.4 and B-IE-2.1) as the most active for NOₓ conversion (>95%) in ample temperature range (280–450°C). These active SCR catalysts were placed downstream a monolith NSR Pt–BaO/Al₂O₃ catalyst, running under cycled lean–rich conditions, and the improvement on NOₓ removal and selectivity to only N₂ were determined. In an ample range of temperature, from 200 to 400°C, NOₓ conversion was increased in more than 30%, also notably increasing the production of nitrogen, and reducing production of ammonia and N₂O below 3% and 2%, respectively, when comparing the combined NSR–SCR configuration versus the single NSR catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3acrystal structure 3aion exchange 3anitrogen 3asurface area 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aPereda-Ayo, Beñat1 aGonzález-Velasco, Juan R.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 207-208 p.10-17dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.0923Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245014400166300001800310520137100328592002801699650003001727650002201757650001001779650001601789650001801805650001501823650001401838650000701852650001501859700002901874700002301903773009901926856004502025852000902070655001202079IND4515813120221119143302.0151006e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451581312DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2011001662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguiar, Fernando A.10aCapillary electrophoresis method for the determination of isradipine enantiomers: Stability studies and pharmaceutical formulation analysis  ap. 2673-2682.  aA simple enantioselective method based on CE using CD as chiral selector was developed and validated for the determination of isradipine (IRD) enantiomers in a pharmaceutical formulation and for the determination of IRD enantiomers in degradation studies. After optimization, the best results were obtained using 15âmM borate buffer at pH 9.3 and sulfobutyl etherâÎ²âcyclodextrin (2.5%, w/v) as chiral selector. The applied voltage was +30âkV, and the sample injection was performed in the hydrodynamic mode. All analyses were carried out in a fusedâsilica uncoated capillary with an id of 50âÎ¼m and total length of 60.0âcm. Under these conditions, a complete separation between IRD enantiomers was achieved in less than 7âmin. Linearity was obtained in the range 50â300âÎ¼g/mL for both enantiomers (râ¥0.9978). The RSD (%) and relative errors (%) obtained in precision and accuracy studies (intraâday and interâday) were lower than 5%. Therefore, this method was found to be appropriate for controlling pharmaceutical formulations containing IRD enantiomers and the assay was considered to be stability indicating. The drug was subjected to oxidation, hydrolysis and photolysis. In all stress conditions the drug presented considerable degradation when compared with a fresh sample (zero time).  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3aenantiomers 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrolysis 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotolysis1 ade Gaitani, Cristiane M.1 aBorges, Keyller B.0 tElectrophoresis.g2011 Oct., v. 32, no. 19 p.2673-2682dWILEYâVCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.201100166  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015400163300001600317520072500333592002801058650004001086650001401126650001401140650001101154650002001165650001101185650001501196650001401211650001601225650001801241650002601259651001001285700002201295773009601317856007301413852000901486655001201495IND50072732920221120030612.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007273292DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.121682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamichhane, Jay Ram10aOlive Knot Pathogen with Pronounced Epiphytic Lifestyle is not Present in Association to Leaf Surface of European Olive Across the Himalayas in Nepal  ap. 170-179.  aPseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi, the causal agent of olive knot disease, often switches from a saprophytic to a parasitic lifestyle only following natural or man‐made activities, that cause lesions on plant tissues.

The morphology, mechanical and thermal oxidative aging properties of NPCB reinforced HDPE composites are assessed and it compared with two other commercial functional filler for the first time. Mechanical test results showed that NPCB could be used as reinforcing fillers in the HDPE composites and mechanical properties especially for stiffness is better than other two commercial fillers. The improved mechanical property was confirmed by the higher aspect ratio and strong interfacial adhesion in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. The heat deflection temperature (HDT) test showed the presence of fiberglass in NPCB can improve the heat resistance of composite for their potential applications. Meanwhile, the oxidation induction time (OIT) and the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results showed that NPCB has a near resistance to oxidation as two other commercial fillers used in this paper. The above results show the reuse of NPCB in the HDPE composites represents a promising way for resolving both the environmental pollution and the high-value reuse of resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3afiberglass 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3amechanical properties 3aoxidation 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awaste management 0aRecycling 0aComposites 0aWaste printed circuit boards 0aMechanical properties1 aBai, Shibing1 aWang, Qi0 tWaste management.g2016 Nov., v. 57 p.168-175dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013900160300002000299520104100319592002801360650003701388650002201425650004901447650001301496650001101509650001901520650002201539650001501561650001501576653000801591653002401599653002301623653001901646700001401665700001901679700001701698700001601715700002001731700002101751773012901772856007801901852000901979655001201988IND60528310520221118225413.0160716e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052831052DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b013332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Weiwei10aNanoplate-Built ZnO Hollow Microspheres Decorated with Gold Nanoparticles and Their Enhanced Photocatalytic and Gas-Sensing Properties  ap. 11824-11832.  aHierarchical porous ZnO microspheres decorated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal route. The hierarchical ZnO superstructure was constructed of interconnected nanoplates with numerous voids. Photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements demonstrated that the main defects were oxygen vacancies (VO•) with minor interstitial oxygen (Oᵢ–) in the hierarchical ZnO hollow microspheres. The as-prepared hierarchical ZnO hollow microspheres and the AuNPs used to decorate them were examined for their photocatalytic degradation ability and as gas sensors. The photodegradation results demonstrated that the degradation rate constant on rhodamine B for undecorated ZnO microspheres was 0.43 min–¹, which increased to 1.76 min–¹ for AuNP-decorated ZnO microspheres. The AuNP-functionalized ZnO microspheres displayed superior sensing properties, with a 3-fold enhancement in their gas response to 1 ppb of dibutyl phthalate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3adibutyl phthalate 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ananogold 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotolysis 3azinc oxide 0aZnS 0ahollow microspheres 0asensing properties 0aphotocatalytic1 aMei, Chao1 aZeng, Xianghua1 aFan, Guokang1 aLu, Junfeng1 aMeng, Xiangdong1 aShen, Xiaoshuang0 tACS applied materials .g2015 June 10, v. 7, no. 22 p.11824-11832dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b013333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04292naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010700172300001400279520240100293592002802694650001602722650002102738650002302759650002502782650003002807650001602837650001202853650002402865650004402889650002202933650001502955650002602970650001002996650001903006650002303025650002203048650002603070650001903096650001403115650002903129650001603158650001803174650002403192650001703216650002103233653001503254653000803269653001603277653001403293653001403307653001003321700001903331700002403350700002203374700002403396700002603420773010203446856008503548852000903633655001203642IND60535627120221121061728.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053562712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichel, Rüdiger10aSoil microbial community responses to sulfadiazine-contaminated manure in different soil microhabitats  ap. 15-25.  aVeterinary antibiotics such as sulfadiazine (SDZ) are applied with manure to agricultural soil. Antimicrobial effects of SDZ on soil microbial community structures and functions were reported for homogenized bulk soils. In contrast, field soil is structured. The resulting microhabitats are often hot spots that account for most of the microbial activity and contain strains of different antibiotic sensitivity or resilience. We therefore hypothesize that effects of SDZ are different in diverse soil microhabitats. We combined the results of laboratory and field experiments that evaluated the fate of SDZ and the response of the microbial community in rhizosphere, earthworm burrow, and soil macroaggregate microhabitats. Microbial communities were characterized by phenotypic phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and genotypic 16S rRNA gene patterns (DGGE) and other methods. Data was evaluated by principle component analyses followed by two-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests. Extractable SDZ concentrations in rhizosphere soil were not clearly different and varied by a factor 0.7–1.2 from those in bulk soil. In contrast to bulk soil, the extractable SDZ content was two-fold larger in earthworm burrows, which are characterized by a more hydrophobic organic matter along the burrow surface. Also, extractable SDZ was larger by up to factor 2.6 in the macroaggregate surface soil. The rhizosphere effect clearly increased the microbial biomass. Nonetheless, in the 10mgSDZkg−1 treatment, the biomass deceased by about 20% to the level of uncontaminated bulk soil. SDZ contamination lowered the total PLFA concentrations by 14% in the rhizosphere and 3% in bulk soil of the field experiment. Structural shifts represented by Pseudomonas DGGE data were larger in SDZ-contaminated earthworm burrows compared to bulk soils. In the laboratory experiment, a functional shift was indicated by a four-fold reduced acid phosphatase activity in SDZ-contaminated burrows compared to bulk soil. Structural and functional shifts after SDZ contamination were larger by a factor of 2.5 in the soil macroaggregate surface versus interior, but this relation reversed over the long-term under field conditions. Overall, the combined effects of soil microhabitat, microbial community composition, and exposure to SDZ influenced the microbial susceptibility towards antibiotics under laboratory and field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aacid phosphatase 3aagricultural soils 3aanalysis of variance 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotics 3aburrows 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aearthworm burrows 3aearthworms 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic matter 3aphenotype 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil microorganisms 3asulfadiazine 3aveterinary drugs 0aAntibiotic 0aSDZ 0aRhizosphere 0aAggregate 0aEarthworm 0aDRIFT1 aPatzelt, Diana1 aBarleben, Christoph1 aRosendahl, Ingrid1 aEllerbrock, Ruth H.1 aThiele-Bruhn, Sören,0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 80 p.15-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009800157300002000255520124300275592002801518650000801546650001301554650001201567650001501579650002201594700001801616700001701634700001501651700001701666700001301683700001901696700002001715700001601735700001401751773014301765856007501908852000901983655001201992IND60752717220221120062346.0211006e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075271722DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta07505e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Guanqi10aHighly stable and efficient perovskite solar cells passivated by a functional amorphous layer  ap. 21708-21715.  aPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great potential as a next generation photovoltaic candidate due to the low cost and high efficiency of the devices. However, the ionic and polycrystalline natures of perovskite films lead to high defect densities deteriorating device stability and efficiency, which impedes the practical applications of PSCs. Here, we introduce a novel passivation concept which employs a functional amorphous 5-sulfosalicylic acid (5-SSA)/PbI₂ layer with COO⁻ and SO₃⁻ groups to suppress defects of under-coordinated Pb²⁺ ions and iodide vacancies at grain boundaries/surfaces of MAPbI₃ films. Furthermore, we find that the amorphous phase can lead to the enlargement of grain size, passivation of defects and suppression of ion migration in the as-deposited perovskite films. Consequently, the 5-SSA/PbI₂-modified MAPbI₃ devices exhibit efficiencies up to 21.47% and 21.02% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. Moreover, the shelf life (3000 h in air with low humidity) and thermal stability (500 h at 60 °C in N₂) have been significantly improved. This work provides a promising strategy for overcoming the inherent instability of perovskite films in optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ahumidity 3aiodides 3ashelf life 3athermal stability1 aWang, Tianyue1 aCao, Jiupeng1 aZhao, Zeyu1 aSong, Jiajun1 aLiu, Pei1 aCheng, Haiyang1 aZheng, Fangyuan1 aZhao, Jiong1 aYan, Feng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 Oct. 5, v. 9, no. 38 p.21708-21715dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta07505e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013800170520090900308592002801217650002401245650002301269650002801292650001601320650001801336650001201354650002601366650001001392650001601402650001201418650001401430650002401444650001501468650002201483650000901505700002401514700002001538700001901558700002101577700001701598700001801615773013401633856008401767852000901851655001201860IND60757559620221120224755.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075755962DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111111692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Cuong C.10aAntifungal Activities of Ageratum conyzoides L.

Although synthetic fungicides have been used to control these diseases, the development of ecologically friendly alternatives is required because fungicides can cause health problems and environmental pollution. Natural herbs possessing antifungal activities are among the candidates as alternatives. Ageratum conyzoides is known to contain antifungal compounds, such as precocene II and polymethoxyflavones. Here, we report the antifungal activities of five compounds isolated after ethanol extraction from Ageratum conyzoides against Pyricularia oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani in vitro. Further, we demonstrated the protective effect of the extract on rice from Pyricularia oryzae infection by field trial testing in a shaded net-house.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratum conyzoides 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aagriculture 3ablast disease 3aethanol 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3aleaf blight 3apaddies 3apollution 3apolymethoxyflavones 3aprecocenes 3aprotective effect 3arice1 aNguyen, Thanh Q.

In particular, the nanofibers have been found to be very active with respect to other ceria catalyst morphologies, due to their arrangement in a network which enhances the number of soot-fiber contact points. This effect was initially elucidated in a series of tests of soot temperature programmed combustion, which were carried out on the catalysts powders mixed with soot in loose contact conditions: a specific sub-set of nanofibers exhibited a 112°C anticipation of the onset oxidation temperature (10% of total soot combustion) with respect to the non-catalytic test, and 38°C with respect to ceria nanopowders obtained with the so-called Solution Combustion Synthesis (SCS). The nanofibers were then supported on Alumina washcoated DPFs, which were loaded with soot for 1h, and subsequently subjected to a progressive temperature increase to induce soot ignition. Both CO₂ concentration in the outlet gas, and the pressure drop, were recorded during these tests. The main advantage given by the nanofiber catalyzed DPF, with respect to the other investigated morphologies, was not related to the maximum rate of soot oxidation, which was similar for all ceria catalysts, but again to the onset temperature. In fact, the pressure drop curve started to decrease more than 50°C before the DPF catalyzed with ceria through in situ SCS. This behavior could greatly improve the soot oxidation activity especially for DPF passive regeneration purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3achemical engineering 3acombustion 3afilters 3ananofibers 3apowders 3atemperature1 aTanwar, M.D.1 aBensaid, S.1 aRusso, N.1 aFino, D.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 207-208 p.258-266dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.0963Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245021200174300001400386520090300400592002801303650002501331650001801356650001601374650002001390650001401410650002101424650002801445650001101473650001301484650001401497650000701511650001401518653002401532653001601556653001401572653002301586653001501609700006301624700002801687700003401715700002101749700002201770700001501792700001901807773009001826856008101916852000901997655001202006IND60544697120221118043121.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamírez-Segovia, A.S.10aGlassy carbon electrodes sequentially modified by cysteamine-capped gold nanoparticles and poly(amidoamine) dendrimers generation 4.5 for detecting uric acid in human serum without ascorbic acid interference  ap. 18-25.  aGlassy carbon electrodes (GCE) were sequentially modified by cysteamine-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNp@cysteamine) and PAMAM dendrimers generation 4.5 bearing 128-COOH peripheral groups (GCE/AuNp@cysteamine/PAMAM), in order to explore their capabilities as electrochemical detectors of uric acid (UA) in human serum samples at pH 2. The results showed that concentrations of UA detected by cyclic voltammetry with GCE/AuNp@cysteamine/PAMAM were comparable (deviation <±10%; limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 1.7×10−4 and 5.8×10−4mgdL−1, respectively) to those concentrations obtained using the uricase-based enzymatic-colorimetric method. It was also observed that the presence of dendrimers in the GCE/AuNp@cysteamine/PAMAM system minimizes ascorbic acid (AA) interference during UA oxidation, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity of the gold nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adetectors 3aelectrochemistry 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3apH 3auric acid 0aModified electrodes 0aHuman serum 0aUric acid 0aGold nanoparticles 0aDendrimers1 aBanda-Alemán, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7292-485X1 aGutiérrez-Granados, S.1 aFernandez, Aurelio Rodriguez,1 aRodríguez, F.J.1 aGodínez, Luis A.1 aBustos, E.1 aManríquez, J.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.18-25dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001400176245007700190300001500267520120800282592002801490650001301518650001301531650003701544650001901581650001201600650001101612650003301623700001901656700001301675700001501688700002001703700001701723700001801740773015301758856007001911856009901981990002302080852000902103655001202112IND60608576520221119161201.0190510e20170927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060857652DNAL7 a10.3791/560582doi7 aPMC57523492pmcid7 a289947722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Juan10aIn Situ characterization of boehmite particles in water using liquid sem  ap. e56058.  aIn situ imaging and elemental analysis of boehmite (AlOOH) particles in water is realized using the System for Analysis at the Liquid Vacuum Interface (SALVI) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This paper describes the method and key steps in integrating the vacuum compatible SAVLI to SEM and obtaining secondary electron (SE) images of particles in liquid in high vacuum. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is used to obtain elemental analysis of particles in liquid and control samples including deionized (DI) water only and an empty channel as well. Synthesized boehmite (AlOOH) particles suspended in liquid are used as a model in the liquid SEM illustration. The results demonstrate that the particles can be imaged in the SE mode with good resolution (i.e., 400 nm). The AlOOH EDX spectrum shows significant signal from the aluminum (Al) when compared with the DI water and the empty channel control. In situ liquid SEM is a powerful technique to study particles in liquid with many exciting applications. This procedure aims to provide technical know-how in order to conduct liquid SEM imaging and EDX analysis using SALVI and to reduce potential pitfalls when using this approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aboehmite 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aimage analysis 3aliquids 3amodels 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aArey, Bruce W.1 aYang, Li1 aZhang, Fei1 aKomorek, Rachel1 aChun, Jaehun1 aYu, Xiao-Ying0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Sept. 27, , no. 127 p.e56058-e56058dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/560583Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56058/in-situ-characterization-boehmite-particles-water-using-liquid  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011100164300001600275520128100291592002801572650002501600650001601625650001001641650002001651650000901671650000901680650001101689650001701700650000901717650001501726650002101741650003501762650001101797650002401808653002501832653002301857653001201880653001401892653002601906700001201932700001501944700001601959700001201975700001901987700001402006773009202020856008102112852000902193655001202202IND60544697220221118043038.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Hongting10aAptamer-functionalized silver nanoparticles for scanometric detection of platelet-derived growth factor-BB  ap. 152-160.  aIn this work, we reported a scanometric assay system based on the aptamer-functionalized silver nanoparticles (apt-AgNPs) for detection of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) protein. The aptamer and ssDNA were bound with silver nanoparticles by self-assembly of sulfhydryl group at 5′ end to form the apt-AgNPs probe. The apt-AgNPs probe can catalyze the reduction of metallic ions in color agent to generate metal deposition that can be captured both by human eyes and a flatbed scanner. Two different color agents, silver enhancer solution and color agent 1 (10mM HAuCl4+2mM hydroquinone) were used to develop silver and gold shell on the surface of AgNPs separately. The results demonstrated that the formation of Ag core–Au shell structure had some advantages especially in the low concentrations. The apt-AgNPs probe coupled with color agent 1 showed remarkable superiority in both sensitivity and detection limit compared to the apt-AuNPs system. The apt-AgNPs system also produced a wider linear range from 1.56ngmL−1 to 100ngmL−1 for PDGF-BB with the detection limit lower than 1.56ngmL−1. The present strategy was applied to the determination of PDGF-BB in 10% serum, and the results showed that it had good specificity in complex biological media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3acolor 3adetection limit 3aeyes 3agold 3ahumans 3ahydroquinone 3aions 3ananosilver 3aoligonucleotides 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3asilver 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aGold nanoparticles 0aAptamer 0aCatalysis 0aScanometric detection1 aLi, Hui1 aZhao, Yaju1 aDong, Shiyu1 aLi, Wei1 aQiang, Weibing1 aXu, Danke0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.152-160dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009800166300001600264520128500280592002801565650001301593650001201606650001401618650000901632650001401641650001001655653001801665653002201683653003201705653002901737653002901766773015001795856007701945852000902022655001202031IND60522338120221119144110.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233812DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-07082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidbaur, Hubert10aAre Tetra[gold(I)]phosphonium Cations [(LAu)4P]+ Non-obedient to the LeBel-van’t Hoff Rule?  ap. 853-859.  aRecent theoretical studies of the molecular and electronic structure of tetra[(phosphine)gold(I)]- phosphonium cations, [(H₃PAu)₄P]⁺, gave contradictory results favoring either a classical tetrahedral or a unique square-pyramidal structure of the PAu₄ unit. A tetrahedral structure had previously been confirmed for the corresponding ammonium cations [(Ph₃PAu)₄N]⁺, while a square-pyramidal structure was discovered for the corresponding arsonium cations [(Ph₃PAu)₄As]⁺, but there is as yet no unequivocal experimental evidence for the structure of phosphonium cations like [(Ph₃PAu)₄P]⁺ in an innocent environment. - In this account the structural chemistry of this class of onium salts and related species is reviewed. The data accumulated to date provide virtually compelling evidence that the phosphonium cations should have a ground state with a square pyramidal PAu₄ core unit, provided that no external constraints are imposed. For large central elements (P, As), aurophilic interactions appear to drive the reorganization from tetrahedral to square-pyramidal skeletons in which a maximum number of short Au---Au contacts can be maintained. For the small central element N, similar interactions are already realized in the tetrahedral structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aarsenic 3achemistry 3agold 3aphosphine 3asalts 0aAurophilicity 0aPhosphonium Salts 0aPoly(gold)phosphonium Salts 0aPoly(gold)ammonium Salts 0aPoly(gold)arsonium Salts0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 7 p.853-859dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-07083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245008800209300001600297520111600313592002801429650003401457650002801491650002301519650002401542650001101566650001301577650002501590650000901615650000701624650000901631650002101640653000901661653000801670653001601678653001301694653001101707653000901718653002301727700002801750700001901778700002801797700002001825773009501845856008501940852000902025655001202034IND60546772420221117230059.0180831e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054677242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2015.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIşıldar, Arda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9516-163710aTwo-step bioleaching of copper and gold from discarded printed circuit boards (PCB)  ap. 149-157.  aAn effective strategy for environmentally sound biological recovery of copper and gold from discarded printed circuit boards (PCB) in a two-step bioleaching process was experimented. In the first step, chemolithotrophic acidophilic Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans were used. In the second step, cyanide-producing heterotrophic Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida were used. Results showed that at a 1% pulp density (10g/L PCB concentration), 98.4% of the copper was bioleached by a mixture of A. ferrivorans and A. thiooxidans at pH 1.0–1.6 and ambient temperature (23±2°C) in 7days. A pure culture of P. putida (strain WCS361) produced 21.5 (±1.5)mg/L cyanide with 10g/L glycine as the substrate. This gold complexing agent was used in the subsequent bioleaching step using the Cu-leached (by A. ferrivorans and A. thiooxidans) PCB material, 44.0% of the gold was mobilized in alkaline conditions at pH 7.3–8.6, and 30°C in 2days. This study provided a proof-of-concept of a two-step approach in metal bioleaching from PCB, by bacterially produced lixiviants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidithiobacillus thiooxidans 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aPseudomonas putida 3aambient temperature 3acopper 3acyanides 3aglycine (amino acid) 3agold 3apH 3apulp 3awaste management 0aWEEE 0aPCB 0aBioleaching 0aTwo-step 0aCopper 0aGold 0aSecondary resource1 avan de Vossenberg, Jack1 aRene, Eldon R.1 avan Hullebusch, Eric D.1 aLens, Piet N.L.0 tWaste management.g2016 Nov., v. 57 p.149-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002100167245010000188300001600288500000900304520164800313592002801961650002201989650002102011650001902032650000902051650001602060650001702076650001502093650002502108650001102133650001102144650001802155650001002173650001202183700001902195773012302214852000902337856009702346655001202443991582124010742620221119024951.0191122e197109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191658242DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300050023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapendick, R.

All profiles exhibited low potentials in the surface 1 to 1.5 m of soil, followed by a region of steep potential gradient over a depth increment of 30 cm or more. below this region the energy values were relatively constant with depth. In the dry zone the soil water potential in some cases reached −45 bars at the 60- or 90-cm depth, and in one case, −40 bars at the 150-cm depth. With coarser-textured soils the potential gradient across the moist to dry zone was steeper as compared with a finertextured soil. Depth of root penetration appeared to coincide with the base of the steep water-potential gradient. Plant wilting was absent or not pronounced when potentials below the steep gradient zone were −2 bars or higher; permanent or severe wilting occurred when the potential was −10 to −8 bars. Soil water potencials in the surface 1.5 m of soil were 8 to 10 bars lower with 110 and 220 kg N/ha applications on wheat than with no N. In most cases the water content profiles of the root zone bore little resemblance to the corresponding potential profiles. These results indicate that in the field the lower limit of water extraction by wheat may reach −40 bars or lower. However, the mobility of water in the root zone or adjacent layers underlying the root zone of the field soil is probably more important to the concept of “water availability” for plants than the actual energy status per se.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aapplication rate 3agrowing season 3arain 3arhizosphere 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3aspring 3asummer 3awater content 3awheat 3awilting1 aCochran, V.

The main component of e-waste is printed circuit boards (PCBs), which contain substantial quantities of precious metals in concentrations significantly higher than those typically found in corresponding ores. The high value and limited reserves of minerals containing these metals makes urban mining of precious metals very attractive. This article is focused on the concentration and recovery of precious metals during pyro-metallurgical recycling of waste PCBs. High temperature pyrolysis was carried out for ten minutes in a horizontal tube furnace in the temperature range 800–1350°C under Argon gas flowing at 1L/min. These temperatures were chosen to lie below and above the melting point (1084.87°C) of copper, the main metal in PCBs, to study the influence of its physical state on the recovery of precious metals. The heat treatment of waste PCBs resulted in two different types of solid products, namely a carbonaceous non-metallic fraction (NMFs) and metallic products, composed of copper rich foils and/or droplets and tin–lead rich droplets and some wires. Significant proportions of Ag, Au, Pd and Pt were found concentrated within two types of metallic phases, with very limited quantities retained by the NMFs. This process was successful in concentrating several precious metals such as Ag, Au, Pd and Pt in a small volume fraction, and reduced volumes for further processing/refinement by up to 75%. The amounts of secondary wastes produced were also minimised to a great extent. The generation of precious metals rich metallic phases demonstrates high temperature pyrolysis as a viable approach towards the recovery of precious metals from e-waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3adroplets 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3agold 3aheat treatment 3amelting point 3aminerals 3amining 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asilver 3atemperature 3awaste treatment 0aE-waste 0aPrecious metals recovery 0aPCBs 0aRecycling 0aConcentration1 aKhanna, R.1 aRajarao, R.1 aMukherjee, P.S.1 aSahajwalla, V.0 tWaste management.g2016 Nov., v. 57 p.121-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245016800175300001800343520169300361592002802054650002202082650001002104650001302114650001902127650001902146650001802165650002402183650001402207650001202221650002602233650001002259650001602269650001102285650002302296650001402319650001002333700002502343700002102368700002002389700001802409773013102427856008202558852000902640655001202649IND4484857720221119143443.0210926e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448485772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-012-0848-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirschenhauser, Katharina10aExcreted corticosterone metabolites differ between two galliform species, Japanese Quail and Chicken, between sexes and between urine and faecal parts of droppings  ap. 1179-1188.  aJapanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) are a common avian laboratory model, and measuring corticosterone metabolites (CM) non-invasively from Quail droppings would be of broad interest. Using the enzyme immunoassay suitable for measuring CM in droppings of Chicken (Gallus domesticus) and other galliform species, we tested the CM measured in Quail droppings after stimulation with adrenocorticotropic hormone. An ACTH challenge indicated that the assay did not detect major amounts of CM in Japanese Quail excreta. Therefore, we aimed at testing whether steroid metabolism and clearance differed between closely related species. We compared the CM excretion patterns in male and female Japanese Quail and Chicken. After intravenous injection with [³H]-labelled corticosterone, we collected all droppings for 24 h, including caecum excreta. Males and females of both species excreted radioactive CM with two peaks. The first radioactivity-peak presumably was from uric acid (Quail 45/55 min; Chicken 120/75 min post-injection, males/females respectively), whereas the second peak probably represented faecal excretion (180/210 min; 240/140 min, respectively). Several highly polar radioactive CM, but no corticosterone, was separated by chromatography in droppings of both species. Number and identity of CM considerably differed between males and females, as well as between urine and faecal excretion. The nature of excreted CM in Quail droppings remains unresolved. However, we show that knowing the effective time for dropping collection is essential for interpreting stimulus-specific CM responses, and mixing samples from rapid urine and slower faecal excretion should be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3acecum 3achickens 3achromatography 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aexcretion 3afemales 3aintravenous injection 3amales 3ametabolites 3amodels 3asteroid metabolism 3auric acid 3aurine1 aSpreitzer, Katharina1 aLepschy, Michael1 aKotrschal, Kurt1 aMöstl, Erich0 tJournal of ornithology.g2012 Oct., v. 153, no. 4 p.1179-1188dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-012-0848-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001600260520203500276592002802311650002102339650001802360650001402378650001602392650001402408650001702422650001102439650001202450650002002462650002102482650002302503650001302526650003302539650001502572650001102587650001002598700002702608700002102635700002302656773013602679856008202815852000902897655001202906IND60752643620221119164016.0211005e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075264362DNAL7 a10.1007/s13580-021-00355-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkhosh, Ali10aInfluence of rootstocks on scion leaf mineral content in mango tree (Mangifera indica L.)  ap. 725-735.  aGrafting is an important practice in mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchard management for propagating elite germplasm but there is limited information on the effect of rootstock-scion interactions on the mineral nutrition of mango. Here, we analyzed the variations in leaf nutrients of commercial (‘B74’ and ‘Kensington Pride’ [KP]) and newly developed cultivars from the National Mango Breeding Program (NMBP) (‘NMBP1243’, ‘NMBP1201’, and ‘NMBP4069’) grafted onto six different rootstocks (‘B’, ‘KP’, ‘Mallapunyah’, ‘SabahBRF’, ‘Vellaikulamban’, and ‘Watertank’) to determine the influence of the rootstock on the scion leaf nutrient content. Deviation from the optimum percentage (DOP and ΣDOP indexes) was calculated to compare nutrition status/balance among the different rootstocks. Leaf nutrient concentrations and their DOP index were affected by the rootstocks and scions. None of the rootstocks or scions had consistently higher or lower nutrient levels, and interaction effects between rootstock and scion factors were insignificant. The DOP index indicated an imbalance of nutrients in the leaves, but scions grafted onto rootstocks ‘Vellaikulamban’ and ‘SabahBRF’ were more nutritionally balanced, indicating that they are preferred rootstocks for propagation. Principal component analysis showed a clear separation among rootstocks according to their differences in nutrient concentrations, such that ‘Vellaikulamban’ and ‘SabahBRF’ (Group 1) were different from ‘Watertank’ and ‘B’ (Group 2) as well as from ‘KP’ and ‘Mallapunyah’ (Group 3). Scions were clustered based on their similarities with ‘B74’ and ‘NMBP1201’ in Cluster 1, ‘NMBP 4069’ in Cluster 2, ‘NMBP 1243’ in Cluster 3, and ‘KP’ in Cluster 4. This study provides valuable information to understand the potential impact of the rootstock on the nutritional status of scions as well as for the selection of rootstock-scion combinations for variety improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3aenvironment 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3aleaves 3amangoes 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutritional status 3aorchards 3aprincipal component analysis 3arootstocks 3ascions 3atrees1 aShahkoomahally, Shirin1 aAsis, Constancio1 aMcConchie, Cameron0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2021 Oct., v. 62, no. 5 p.725-735dSpringer SingaporewJournal:21607x2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-021-00355-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03502naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245009700175300001600272520210200288592002802390650002302418650001002441650002002451650002202471650001402493650001402507650002302521650001302544650001402557650002402571650001402595700002602609700001802635700002102653700002502674700002102699700002202720700001902742700002202761700002002783700002102803773011602824856008302940852000903023655001203032IND60624099420221120210442.0181201e200204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062409942DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265020170021232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubagunta, Srinivasan10aEarly Initiation of Enteral Feeding After Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube Placement  ap. 123-125.  aEnteral feeding through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is usually initiated about 12 to 24 hours after insertion of the tube. There have been earlier studies evaluating the efficacy of early initiation of enteral feedings that had encouraging results. However, delayed initiation of feeding following PEG placement continues to be practiced widely. We believe that feeding can be done earlier without any increase in associated morbidity or mortality and with obvious reduction in the need for parenteral nutrition and healthcare costs. We evaluated a protocol to initiate enteral nutrition 4 hours after the PEG tube insertion with subsequent discharge of the outpatients on the same day. We conducted a prospective study to assess the efficacy of early initiation of PEG feeding. We enrolled 77 patients in our study who were having PEG tubes placed for enteral feeding. Only patients who had a PEG placed for gastric venting procedures were excluded from our study. During the course of our study, no patient had to be excluded for the latter reason. Patients were evaluated by the physician performing the procedure, 4 hours after the tube was inserted. Their vital signs were checked, and a thorough abdominal examination was performed. Minimal tenderness around the PEG site was the most frequent finding. Otherwise, all the patients had a benign abdominal examination. The tube was flushed with 60 mL of sterile water. Following the examination, orders were given to restart the feedings. These patients were followed for a 30-day period to evaluate complications associated with PEG tube placement and early initiation of PEG feeding. There was one case of aspiration pneumonia (1.3%) and one death that was attributed to the underlying disease out of our 77 patients. Early initiation of enteral feeding after PEG tube placement can be successfully completed with a systematic protocol and close observation. Not only was this protocol found to be safe, it can also have significant cost savings by eliminating the need for inpatient hospitalization for the procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adeath 3aenteral feeding 3ahealth care costs 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3apneumonia 3aprospective studies 3aprotocols1 aStill, Christopher D.1 aKumar, Arvind1 aMakhdoom, Zahoor1 aInverso, Nicholas A.1 aBross, Ronald J.1 aKomar, Michael J.1 aMulhisen, Lisa1 aRogers, Joanne Z.1 aWhitmire, Susan1 aWhilden, Bethann0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 17, no. 2 p.123-125dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265020170021233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245010800164520153400272592002801806650001701834650001701851650002401868650003101892650001401923650001901937650001201956650001301968650002201981650000902003650001402012650002202026650001202048650001302060650002102073650002002094651002202114700002602136700001802162700002302180700001902203700002202222773011802244856007202362852000902434655001202443IND60653238520221122064749.0190714e20170812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323852DNAL7 a10.3390/w90805972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, Maria Fernanda10aMitigation Options for Future Water Scarcity: A Case Study in Santa Cruz Island (Galapagos Archipelago)  aSanta Cruz Island (Galápagos Archipelago), like many other tourist islands, is currently experiencing an exponential increase in tourism and local population growth, jeopardizing current and future water supply. An accurate assessment of the future water supply/demand balance is crucial to capital investment for water infrastructure. This paper aims to present five intervention strategies, which are suggested to solve the future water crisis. The strategies combined include environmentally sustainable options such as rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling and water demand management, as well as desalination. These strategies were evaluated under four population growth scenarios (very fast, fast, moderate and slow growths) by using several Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) including water demand, leakage levels, total costs, energy consumption, rainwater delivered and greywater recycled. Moreover, it also aims to develop a methodology for similar islands, using the WaterMet2 modelling approach, a tool for integrated of sustainable-based performance of urban water systems. The results obtained show that by 2044 only a small portion of the future water demand can be covered assuming business as usual. Therefore, desalination seems to be the most viable option in order to mitigate the lack of water at the end of the planning period considering the growth trends. However, strategies comprising more environmentally friendly alternatives may be sufficient, but only under slow population growth scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adesalination 3aeconomic investment 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreywater 3ainfrastructure 3aislands 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3arain 3arecycling 3asimulation models 3atourism 3atourists 3awater harvesting 3awater shortages 3aGalapagos Islands1 aTrifunović, Nemanja,1 aSharma, Saroj1 aBehzadian, Kourosh1 aKapelan, Zoran1 aKennedy, Maria D.0 tWater.g2017 Aug. 12, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90805973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009200171300001600263520091000279592002801189650002301217650002701240650001101267650001401278653002801292653002301320653001601343653002301359653002001382700002401402700003201426773011501458856008301573852000901656655001201665IND60597269920221119202344.0200503e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059726992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tree.2018.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolshausen, Gregor10aEvolutionary Rates Standardized for Evolutionary Space: Perspectives on Trait Evolution  ap. 379-389.  aCharacterization of evolutionary radiations benefits from describing the temporal patterns of trait disparification. Comparative methods attempt this by evaluating the statistical fit of trait distributions to a phylogenetic hypothesis under assumed evolutionary models. However, it can be challenging to differentiate between models, with discriminatory power depending on the modes of evolution underlying trait distributions. We suggest rates of ‘trait space saturation’, standardized for limits to evolutionary change, as an additional tool to distinguish between modes of trait evolution. We evaluate this approach using simulations and show that trait space saturation can identify the true model of trait evolution in cases where traditional comparative methods can fail. We illustrate our approach using diverse empirical studies that represent contrasting scenarios of evolutionary radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aevolutionary radiation 3amodels 3aphylogeny 0aevolutionary radiations 0aevolutionary rates 0atrait space 0acomparative method 0adisparification1 aDavies, T.

Irrigation is costly, so technologies need to be improved or newly developed, not only with the aim of the sustainable use of precious water resources, but also with the aim of reducing associated labor and energy costs, which lead to higher production costs. OPSIS (optimized subsurface irrigation system) is a super water-saving subsurface irrigation system developed to irrigate upland crops by soil capillarity. It is an environmentally-friendly, solar-powered automatic irrigation method with minimum energy consumption and operational costs. In soils vulnerable to drought damage, OPSIS can outperform other irrigation methods. This technical note introduces OPSIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillarity 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adrought 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3ahighlands 3alabor 3aoperating costs 3asoil 3asubsurface irrigation 3awater conservation 3awater resources1 aSakai, Kazuhito1 aNakandakari, Tamotsu1 aKazuro, Momii1 aOnodera, Tsuneo1 aKaneshiro, Hiroyuki1 aUehara, Hiroshi1 aWakasugi, Kousuke0 tWater.g2017 Aug. 12, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90805993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245012200177300001600299500001900315520082800334592002801162650001101190650004401201650002601245650001501271650001501286650002601301650001301327650001701340650001901357650001801376650002301394650001901417650002201436650001501458650001901473653002301492653001501515653003901530700006101569773014501630856008001775852000901855655001201864IND60725579420210418000000.0210127e20210113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072557942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c081542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDibona-Villanueva, Luciano10aNovel Chitosan–Riboflavin Conjugate with Visible Light-Enhanced Antifungal Properties against Penicillium digitatum  ap. 945-954.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel chemical conjugate between chitosan (CH) and riboflavin (RF) has been synthesized and characterized via Fourier transform infrared, NMR, and other spectroscopic methods.

If properly constructed and maintained, fences mitigate crop damage. However, it is difficult to enclose farmland completely when a fence crosses a river. This study evaluated the effectiveness of olfactory (wolf urine), visual (flashlight), and sound deterrents against deer at the intersection of river and fence. These deterrents were used for four weeks; the no-treatment control period was also four weeks. The treatments were tested six times. Sensor cameras detected deer intrusions into the fenced area. The sound, flashlight, and wolf urine treatments were 80%, 54%, and 57% more effective in preventing deer intrusions than the control, respectively. Statistically significant efficacy was detected only for the sound treatment. Previous studies reported that sound deterrents were ineffective, but this study revealed efficacy of the sound deterrent; this disparity could be due to the use of an attractant, since most studies employed food to test deterrent effectiveness. The short-term (four-week) tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the sonic device; however, long-term tests revealed that the efficacy declined with long-term usage (habituation effect). Use of the device should be limited, i.e., for no longer than one month.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acameras 3acrop damage 3adeer 3afences 3ahabituation 3arivers 3aurine 3awolves 0ahigh-frequency sound 0aolfactory 0asensor camera 0avisual stimuli0 tMammal study.g2019 Oct. 28, v. 44, no. 4 p.269-274dUniBio PresswJournal:19720x1348-61607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3106/ms2019-00343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002700132024003000159024001100189040001800200100002700218245014100245300001600386506017300402520184500575650001802420650001602438650001402454650003002468650001502498650002502513650001202538650002302550650002002573650001902593650001002612650001402622650001602636650001302652650001402665700002602679700002202705700002102727700002402748700002202772700001902794773011002813856011202923856007303035956008603108961000903194852000903203655001203212IND60005972620221214223514.0141023e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000597262DNAL7 a3001662aris7 a10113/597262hdl7 a10.1111/afe.120622doi7 a10.1111/afe.120622chorus8 ans5574  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRANGER, Christopher M.10aConophtorin enhances the electroantennogram and field behavioral response of Xylosandrus germanus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) to ethanol  ap. 327-334.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aEthanol acts as a long range cue that aids Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) in locating living, but weakened trees. Conophthorin is associated with a variety of deciduous trees and enhances X. germanus’ attraction to vulnerable trees. Electroantennogram (EAG) and field trapping experiments were conducted with conophthorin and other selected semiochemicals to assess their influence on X. germanus’ response to ethanol and determine if EAG responses provided an indication of field behavioral activity. Semiochemicals were chosen based on their likelihood of enhancing (i.e. conophthorin), reducing (i.e. verbenone), or having a negligible effect (i.e. lineatin, retusol, sulcatol, and terpinolene). Ethanol plus conophthorin elicited a larger EAG response amplitude than ethanol plus any of the remaining semiochemicals at stimulus concentrations of 0.2, 2, and 200 µg. EAG responses to ethanol plus the remaining semiochemicals were indistinguishable. Ethanol plus conophthorin attracted more X. germanus, Euwallacea validus (Eichhoff), and Xyleborus pelliculosus Eichhoff than traps baited with ethanol alone, and a synergistic effect was detected for X. germanus and E. validus. In contrast, retusol, sulcatol, terpinolene, and verbenone reduced the attractiveness of ethanol to X. germanus, E. validus, Monarthrum fasciatum (Say), Xyleborinus saxesenii (Ratzeburg), Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky), X. pelliculosus, and/or Anisandrus sayi Hopkins. While ethanol acts as an important olfactory cue for X. germanus, other volatiles can enhance (i.e. conophthorin) or reduce (i.e. retusol, terpinolene, and verbenone) orientation to ethanol. The larger EAG response generally elicited by conophthorin, and corresponding enhanced field activity, also suggests EAG analyses may be useful for identifying potential attractants. 3aCurculionidae 3aXyleborinus 3aXyleborus 3aXylosandrus crassiusculus 3abait traps 3aelectroantennography 3aethanol 3ainsect attractants 3ainsect behavior 3asemiochemicals 3asmell 3asynergism 3aterpinolene 3atrapping 3averbenone1 aGORZLANCYK, Austin M.1 aADDESSO, Karla M.1 aOLIVER, Jason B.1 aReding, Michael E.,1 aSCHULTZ, Peter B.1 aHeld, David W.0 tAgricultural and forest entomology.g2014 Nov., v. 16, no. 4 p.327-334wJournal:jnl58336x1461-95637nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/597263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.120623Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/300166.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001400285520145900299592002801758650003001786650001801816650002001834650001201854650001201866650002901878650004301907650001701950650002801967650004301995650002602038650001302064650001402077650002902091650001402120650002502134650001902159700001802178700002102196700002102217773012302238856008102361990002302442852000902465655001202474IND60094833320221122070105.0141104e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, Hakki10aIs vitamin D status a predictor glycaemic regulation and cardiac complication in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients?  ap. 28-31.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate vitamin D as a predictor of glycaemic regulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In observational study 171 type 2 diabetic patients who are followed for median (range) of 10.15 (3–18) years. Mean±SD age was 56±10. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry on baseline samples. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a 25-OHD level of less than 20ng/ml. Vitamin D levels between 20 and 30ng/ml are termed ‘insufficient’. Vitamin D levels greater than 30ng/ml are termed ‘optimal’. RESULTS: 125 patients have vitamin D deficiency, 14 patients have insufficient and the others have optimal. Vitamin D levels were not associated with sex, age, BMI, HDL, LDL, kreatinin, hypertension and smoking. But vitamin D deficiency patients had more longer duration (p=0.011), more higher uric acid (p=0.021), fasting glucose (p=0.037), postprandial glucose (p=0.001) and HbA1c (p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: In our study type 2 diabetic patients have 73% of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency predicts higher fasting and postprandial blood glucose and diabetes disregulation. Type 2 DM patients and low 25-OH vitamin D levels could increased cardiovascular disease directly or indirectly (low HDL and high uric acid in 25-OH vitamin D <20ng/ml). Whether vitamin D substitution improves prognosis remains to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahypertension 3alow density lipoprotein 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3aprognosis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3auric acid 3avitamin D deficiency 3avitamin status1 aKaya, Mustafa1 aŞahin, Mustafa,1 aDelibasi, Tuncay0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 1 p.28-31dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.05.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245005600212300001600268520093600284592002801220650001201248650002601260650001301286650001901299650001401318650002701332650002101359653002501380653001501405653001501420653001401435653001501449653001301464700002201477773011501499856008301614852000901697655001201706IND60597270020221118060420.0200503e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tree.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWellenreuther, Maren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2764-829110aEco-Evolutionary Genomics of Chromosomal Inversions  ap. 427-440.  aChromosomal inversions have long fascinated evolutionary biologists due to their suppression of recombination, which can protect co-adapted alleles. Emerging research documents that inversions are commonly linked to spectacular phenotypes and have a pervasive role in eco-evolutionary processes, from mating systems, social organisation, environmental adaptation, and reproductive isolation to speciation. Studies also reveal that inversions are taxonomically widespread, with many being old and large, and that balancing selection is commonly facilitating their maintenance. This challenges the traditional view that the role of balancing selection in maintaining variation is relatively minor. The ubiquitous importance of inversions in ecological and evolutionary processes suggests that structural variation should be better acknowledged and integrated in studies pertaining to the molecular basis of adaptation and speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3achromosome inversions 3agenomics 3amating systems 3aphenotype 3areproductive isolation 3asocial structure 0astructural variation 0ainversions 0aadaptation 0aevolution 0aspeciation 0agenomics1 aBernatchez, Louis0 tTrends in ecology & evolution.g2018 June, v. 33, no. 6 p.427-440dElsevier LtdwJournal:1990x0169-53477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245011400164520129300278592002801571650003001599650002101629650002101650650001301671650002101684650001501705650001301720650001101733650001501744650003301759650001601792650001101808650001501819650002301834650001801857650001801875650001701893650001301910650002101923650001801944650001501962651001501977700002701992700003402019700002602053700002702079773011802106856007202224852000902296655001202305IND60653238820221122064921.0190714e20170813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323882DNAL7 a10.3390/w90805582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMena-Rivera, Leonardo10aSpatial and Seasonal Surface Water Quality Assessment in a Tropical Urban Catchment: Burío River, Costa Rica  aWater quality assessments are essential for providing information regarding integrated water resource management processes. This study presents the results of a spatial and seasonal surface water quality assessment of the Burío river sub-catchment in Costa Rica. Fourteen sample campaigns were conducted at eight sample sites between 2005 and 2010. Seasonal variations were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models where dissolved oxygen, total solids, and nitrate showed significant differences between dry and wet seasons (p < 0.05). Cluster analysis identified three clusters at the top, middle, and bottom of the catchment that were consistent with land use patterns, and principal component analysis identified the main parameters that were affecting 84% of the total variance in water quality (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total phosphate, and nitrate). The National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) results indicated the majority of the river consisted of mainly “medium” water quality, although “bad” and “good” water quality results were identified depending on sample site and season. This methodological approach provides a useful monitoring technique for local governments that can be used for further remediation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acluster analysis 3adissolved oxygen 3aland use 3alocal government 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3aprincipal component analysis 3aremediation 3arivers 3asanitation 3aseasonal variation 3asubwatersheds 3asurface water 3atotal solids 3avariance 3awater management 3awater quality 3awet season 3aCosta Rica1 aSalgado-Silva, Viviana1 aBenavides-Benavides, Cristina1 aCoto-Campos, Juana M.1 aSwinscoe, Thomas H.

Herein, we report a hydrochromic display due to the interfacial effect of liquid metal (LM)-triggered ammonium metatungstate (AMT) with instant dual-mode color switching. The double-electron-transfer reaction of the AMT on the surface of gallium-based LM caused the formation of heteropoly blue in the presence of acidic surroundings, resulting in a reversible color switching from being colorless to blue or blue to colorless. This visual interfacial discoloration phenomenon can be applied to the liquid display on diverse patterns of the LM surface. Furthermore, papers with a functional display were prepared, which can be used for writing up to eight times with dual-mode color switching. In addition, the reactive activity of acid triggering make it a potential candidate for use in visualizing an acidic environment with a detection range of pH = 1 to 0 (0.1–1.5 M). Briefly, this interfacial discoloration phenomenon enriches the interfacial engineering of LM and provides a unique prospective and wide-range platform for the application of LM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acolor 3adiscoloration 3aliquids 3apH 0ahydrochromic visualization 0aliquid metal 0arewriting papers 0aacidic environment detection 0ainterfacial discoloration1 aCui, Yun-Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3273-91631 aQin, Peng1 aGao, Jianye1 aYe, Jiao1 aLiu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0844-52960 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 26, v. 13, no. 30 p.36445-36454dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c075063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008600162300001600248520155700264592002801821650002501849650002201874650001501896650001801911650001301929650000901942650002301951651001301974653002401987653002602011653001002037653003302047653002802080653002602108700002202134700002002156700001602176773011402192856007802306852000902384655001202393IND60676368820221120131520.0210602e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067636882DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2019-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJobbágy, Ján10aApplication and Evaluation of Performance Quality of Hose-Reel Irrigation Machine  ap. 109-114.  aConsidering the global tendency in water saving, this research is focused on practical measurements of even distribution of water. The performance quality is determined by values of coefficients of distribution uniformity and non-uniformity given in percentages. Objects of investigation were belt irrigators with varying input conditions (seven pieces). Testing of hose-reel irrigators took place in Southern and Western Slovakia. Tests were carried out during irrigation of selected agricultural crops (potatoes, vegetables); in these areas, rainwater vessels were distributed at a spacing of 1 or 2 m, perpendicular to the direction of movement of the bracket or tripod with a gun sprinkler. The input conditions, such as machine specifications and weather conditions, were monitored and evaluated for all variants. The data were also analysed along with the linear model through statistical analysis software – one-way analysis of variance ANOVA. Considering the results, it is possible to conclude that there were recorded statistically significant differences for uniformity coefficients, depending not only on the site but also on the specific evaluation methodology (P > 0.05). If the input conditions (site, type of irrigator, sprinkler) were changed, the effect of dependence was demonstrated to a much greater extent (P <0.05, F = 7.08> Fcᵣᵢₜ). The results of the non-uniformity coefficients confirmed the statistically significant differences not only in the sample sets of coefficients but also in the selection sets of conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acomputer software 3airrigation 3alinear models 3apotatoes 3arain 3awater conservation 3aSlovakia 0aperformance quality 0airrigation uniformity 0aANOVA 0ahose-reel irrigation machine 0alevel of non-uniformity 0avariation coefficient1 aMichlian, Norbert1 aDačanin, Peter1 aRigó, Ivan0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 22, no. 4 p.109-114dSciendowJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2019-00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013800167300001800305520196800323592002802291650001302319650001902332650002102351650002002372650003402392650001502426650001502441650001602456650000902472650001402481650003002495650002402525650003502549650001602584653001902600653001902619653000902638653000802647653001602655700001702671700002302688700003102711700003202742700002902774700001402803700001802817700001902835700001802854700001502872773010802887856008202995852000903077655001203086IND60696613820221117013303.0211015e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069661382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzmal, Syed Ali12aA genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism scan reveals genetic markers associated with fertility rate in Chinese Jing Hong chicken  ap. 2873-2887.  aThe function of the sperm storage tubules is directly correlated with the fertility of laying hens. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the fertility traits in chicken. To identify genetic markers associated with reproductive traits, we calculated fertility rate at 61 to 69 wk (51 D) of Jing Hong chickens parent generation as the phenotype and the genotype were detected by the chicken 600K Affymetrix Axiom High Density single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-array. The genome-wide association study using 190 Jing Hong hens showed that the 20 SNP in chromosomes 3 and 13 were significantly associated with fertility rate. To verify these results, a total of 1900 Jing Hong laying hens from 2 populations (P1 and P2) were further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragments length polymorphisms method. The association analysis results revealed that 12 polymorphisms (AX-75769978, AX-76582632, AX-75730546, AX-75730496, AX-75730588, AX-76530282, AX-76530329, AX-76529310, AX-75769906, AX-75755394, AX-80813697 and AX-76582809) out of 20 showed highly significant effects (P < 0.0001) on fertility rate in P1, P2 and P1+P2. Six haplotypes (TTAA, TTGG, TTAG, CTAA, CTGG, and CTAG) were inferred based on significant loci (AX-75730546 and AX-76530282) also showed significant association with fertility rate, where haplotype CTAG was shown to be markedly associated with the significantly highest (P < 0.0001) fertility rate (in P1, 86.42 ± 0.59; P2, 85.98 ± 0.59 and P1+P2, 86.16 ± 0.42) followed by other haplotypes for the irrespective of population studied. Collectively, we report for the first time that 12 SNP in the chromosomes 3 and 13 were significantly associated with fertility rate during the later stage of egg production, which could be used as the potential genetic markers that would be able to facilitate in the selection and improvement of fertility rate through chicken breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3aegg production 3afemale fertility 3agenetic markers 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3alaying hens 3aloci 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areproductive traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspermatozoa 0aJing Hong hens 0afertility rate 0aGWAS 0aSNP 0aassociation1 aNan, Jiuhong1 aBhuiyan, Ali Akbar1 aElokil, Abdelmotaleb Ahmed1 aĀlī, Mohāmmada Isahāka,1 aAdetula, Adeyinka Abiola1 aMa, Shuai1 aSun, Chenghao1 aHan, Zhongdong1 aYuan, Jingwei1 aLi, Shijun0 tPoultry science.g2020 June, v. 99, no. 6 p.2873-2887dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010900155520206400264592002802328650001302356650002202369650001102391650002102402650001902423650001202442650002302454650002102477650001302498650001302511650001302524650002102537650001102558650002302569650002902592650001102621650001102632650001802643650001602661650001402677650001102691700001302702700001902715700001302734700001702747773011802764856007202882852000902954655001202963IND60653238920221122064824.0190714e20170814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323892DNAL7 a10.3390/w90806012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinhong10aSediment-Water Methane Flux in a Eutrophic Pond and Primary Influential Factors at Different Time Scales  aWater bodies are major areas for methane release. Eutrophic water bodies may promote methane flux. The sediment-water interface is the major location for methane release, and studies on sediment-water interactions are necessary to regulate methane release in water. However, relevant studies on methane flux at the sediment-water interface are limited due to methodological difficulties. Using an innovative gas trapping device, this study investigated the seasonal characteristics and diel variation in summer methane flux from eutrophic water bodies and analyzed the correlations between temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), different forms of nitrogen and the methane flux at different time scales. The results showed that methane flux in the eutrophic pond was high and had distinct seasonal variations and diel variations: the average value was 2.81 ± 0.19 mmol m−2 h−1 in summer, which was significantly greater than that in spring (0.62 ± 0.14 mmol m−2 h−1), autumn (0.63 ± 0.10 mmol m−2 h−1) (p < 0.01) and winter (approached zero). The diel characteristics of methane flux in summer exhibited a unimodal pattern of increase at night and decrease during the day. The correlation analysis showed that the sediment-water methane flux rate of the water body was significantly positively correlated with the temperature and NH<inf>4</inf>+ concentration and significantly negatively correlated with DO, NO<inf>3</inf>− and NO<inf>2</inf>− concentration. Meanwhile, among different time scales, the correlations between NO<inf>3</inf>−/NH<inf>4</inf>+ concentration and methane flux were the highest at the diel scale in summer (R2 = 0.68, 0.87 respectively) when the temperature and DO vibration was low and the relationship between temperature/DO and methane flux was poor (R2 = 0.45, 0.87 respectively). This study considered that higher NH<inf>4</inf>+-N and lower NO<inf>3</inf>−-N/NO<inf>2</inf>−-N content in eutrophic water could have an effect on the high methane flux in summer as well as the low dissolved oxygen content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aautumn 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxygen 3aseasonal variation 3asediment-water interface 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3atemperature 3avibration 3awinter1 aGao, Yan1 aZhang, Zhenhua1 aLuo, Jia1 aYan, Shaohua0 tWater.g2017 Aug. 14, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90806013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001600260520145200276592002801728650001501756650002501771650001301796650001501809650001501824650001701839650001901856650002201875650001601897650001301913650000901926650003501935650003601970653003002006653003102036653001902067700001102086700001302097700001602110700001202126700001902138700001602157700001502173773008302188856008102271852000902352655001202361IND60556540020221123030012.0170719e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055654002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Congcong10aPolymorphisms of Interlukin-1β rs16944 confer susceptibility to myelodysplastic syndromes  ap. 109-112.  aGenetic factors have been shown to be associated with Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) susceptibility. In recent years, the role of inflammation in the promotion of tumor growth is supported by a broad range of experimental and clinical evidence. But the relationship between polymorphisms in NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and MDS is rarely reported. Thus, we conducted a case-control study, and genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, CARD8, and NF-κB) in MDS patients and healthy controls. The association of different genotypes with patient characteristics was analyzed. Comparing MDS patients with controls, GG genotype of IL-1β (rs16944) was observed to be associated with a significantly increased risk of MDS 78/166 (48.8%) vs 26/96 (27.0%), OR=2.1, CI (1.0–4.4). No significant association was identified regarding the rest of investigated polymorphisms and MDS susceptibility. Complex karyotypes were more frequent in patients with GG genotype of IL-1β (rs16944). Patients with IL-1β polymorphisms (rs16944) GG and GA had lower hemoglobin than those without. Patients with IL-1β polymorphisms (rs16944) GG had higher IPSS scores than those without IL-1β polymorphisms. In conclusion, our present data shows that the IL-1β polymorphisms (rs16944) GG were frequently occurred in MDS. IL-1β (rs16944) GG genotype might serve as a novel biomarker and potential targets for MDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acase-control studies 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahemoglobin 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3akaryotyping 3apatients 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aMyelodysplastic syndromes 0aInflammasome polymorphisms 0aSusceptibility1 aHe, Na1 aLi, Peng1 aZhang, Chen1 aYu, Jie1 aHua, Mingqiang1 aJi, Chunyan1 aMa, Daoxin0 tLife sciences.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 165 p.109-112dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04786naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003500155245017100190520245900361592002802820650002402848650002502872650001702897650002202914650001002936650001602946650001302962650001802975650002102993650001103014650002003025650001603045650000903061650001403070650001603084650002703100650002303127650001203150650001603162650001403178650001203192650002103204650001103225650002203236650001503258650002103273650001303294650002103307650002003328650001103348650001803359650001803377650001103395653001303406653002803419653002103447653002703468653001803495700002003513700002403533700001703557700002403574700002003598700002403618700002103642700001903663700002303682700003103705700002003736700002603756773009903782856009003881852000903971655001203980IND60701885320221120143500.0210909e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070188532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontagné-Dicharry, Stéphanie10aEffect of selenium sources in plant-based diets on antioxidant status and oxidative stress-related parameters in rainbow trout juveniles under chronic stress exposure  aSelenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient required for normal development and antioxidant protection. Oxidative stress induced by stressful conditions has been shown to be reduced by dietary Se supplementation. However, replacing fishmeal, an important source of Se, with ingredients of plant origin usually results in decreased Se content in aquafeeds. The objective of the study was hence to assess the impact of dietary Se supplementation by an inorganic or organic source on the antioxidant defense system of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles fed practical plant-based feeds under normal or chronic stress conditions. Fish (initial mean weight: 42 ± 2 g) were maintained under normal (25 fish/tank, dissolved oxygen: 7.9 mg/l) or stressful conditions combining decreased water quality with hypoxia and increased stocking density (50 fish/tank, dissolved oxygen: 5.9 mg/l) for 12 weeks at 17 °C. Rainbow trout juveniles were fed three plant-derived protein-based diets containing 0.5 mg Se/kg diet supplemented or not with 0.3 mg Se/kg diet supplied as sodium selenite or Se-enriched yeast, Selsaf®. The apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter, protein, ash and Se were improved by Se-enriched yeast supplementation while the ADC of Se was reduced by sodium selenite supplementation and the ADC of dry matter, starch, energy, ash and phosphorus were reduced by chronic stress exposure. Dietary Se supplementation had no significant impact on growth performance contrary to chronic stress exposure which led to decreased final body weight and feed intake. Total Se content of fish was increased by both dietary Se supplementations but to a larger extent with Se-enriched yeast. Fish fed Se-enriched yeast displayed increased hepatic selenomethionine content and decreased muscle anisidine value. Blood glutathione content was reduced by chronic stress exposure. While hepatic catalase activity and transcript expression were increased by chronic stress exposure, both hepatic and renal glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity and hepatic transcript expression of gpx1b2 and gpx4a2 were decreased in non-Se supplemented fish. These results suggest the necessity to supplement plant-based diets with Se for rainbow trout juveniles, independently of chronic stress exposure and highlight the superiority of organic form of Se to fulfil the dietary Se requirement and sustain the antioxidant status of fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquaculture feeds 3ablood 3abody weight 3acatalase 3adigestibility 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afeed intake 3afish 3afish meal 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3ahypoxia 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3amuscles 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3ap-anisidine value 3aphosphorus 3aplant-based diet 3aselenium 3aselenomethionine 3asodium selenite 3astarch 3astocking rate 3awater quality 3ayeasts 0aSelenium 0aChronic stress exposure 0aOxidative stress 0aGlutathione peroxidase 0aRainbow trout1 aVéron, Vincent1 aLarroquet, Laurence1 aGodin, Simon1 aWischhusen, Pauline1 aAguirre, Pierre1 aTerrier, Frédéric1 aRichard, Nadège1 aBueno, Maïté1 aBouyssière, Brice1 aAntony Jesu Prabhu, Philip1 aTacon, Philippe1 aKaushik, Sadasivam J.0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735684-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012300170300001800293520053000311592002800841650001300869650001200882650002300894650002800917650001300945650001300958650002000971700001800991700001801009700001901027773010601046856008501152852000901237655001201246IND60586473420221118041710.0171213e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b033692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Gwang

This method is a greener, atom-economical reaction that tolerates various functional groups and provides good to excellent yield. Moreover, the cyclization products can be conveniently converted into tetrasubstituted allylic alcohols and enamines.

These atypical pathotypes cause acute mortality events resulting in catastrophic losses, as opposed to more chronic mortality and lesions seen in typical infections of motile aeromonas septicemia (MAS). This study provides a basic framework for rapid field sampling negating the need for re-isolation or enrichment culture, thereby reducing the time between sampling and detection. Rapid and accurate quantitative PCR based methods for detection of aAh have been described and are important confirmative tools in research and diagnostic settings. These methods also have application in epidemiological surveys investigating the spread of disease and elucidating pathogen dynamics that may lead to outbreaks. To date, no field-based sampling technique for rapid aAh detection in resident pond populations has been explored. In this study, culture swabs taken from the gills and lower intestine of pond-raised catfish were assessed for their suitability as rapid field-based collection methods for downstream applications. Results showed the state of the pond has a significant effect on which swab location yields the highest proportion of PCR positive results. During an active outbreak, gill swabs identified more fish as aAh-positive; however, in apparently healthy populations, swabs taken from the lower intestine identified significantly more aAh-positive fish than gill swabs, despite no statistical difference in the concentration of aAh cell equivalents between swab sites. Naïve prevalence estimates from the two swab types were compared to estimates provided by a hierarchical occupancy model. Prevalence estimates from gill swabs was 0.95% while vent swabs showed a prevalence of 2.2%; however, estimates based on the occupancy model were 6.6% and 9.8%, respectively. This multi-fold increase in prevalence estimates highlights the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in epidemiological studies and in assessing potential outbreak risk. Furthermore, occupancy models based on these data indicate resident fish can be aAh-positive carriers with no gross signs of infection, providing evidence aAh can reside in catfish ponds in the absence of disease. The presence of a carrier state indicates the pathogen may pose minimal risk to the host is compromised or a mechanical portal of entry into the blood stream is available. This provides an important direction for future research in understanding the mechanisms of aAh outbreaks in catfish aquaculture ponds.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cMississippi State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007250  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cCollege of Veterinary Medicine, Purdue University0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aIctalurus punctatus 3ablood flow 3acarrier state 3acatfish 3adisease transmission 3aenrichment culture 3aepidemiological studies 3afish culture 3agills 3aindustry 3aintestines 3amodels 3amortality 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3aponds 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asampling 3asepticemia 3aSoutheastern United States 0aChannel catfish 0aAquaculture 0aPolymerase chain reaction 0aOccupancy modeling1 aGriffin, Matt J.1 aColvin, Michael E.1 aWise, David J.1 aWare, Cynthia1 aMischke, Charles C.1 aGreenway, Terrence E.1 aByars, Todd S.1 aHanson, Larry A.1 aLawrence, Mark L.0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 530dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01569naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008000165300001800245520062800263592002800891650001200919650001300931650001900944650002000963650002100983700001901004700001301023700001901036773010601055856008501161852000901246655001201255IND60586473520221118041842.0171213e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b033712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Jian10aPhotoredox Divergent 1,2-Difunctionalization of Alkenes with gem-Dibromides  ap. 6452-6455.  aThe redox neutral photocatalytic divergent radical 1,2-difunctionalization of a wide array of structurally varied alkenes with gem-dibromides is presented.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone playing a pivotal role in the folding process of client proteins, and therefore its activity is fundamental for cell survival and proliferation. Since the chaperone activity requires ATP hydrolysis, molecules able to occupy the ATP binding pocket in the protein N-terminal domain (NTD) act as Hsp90 inhibitors. The development of selective molecules targeting the ATPase site of protozoan Hsp90 is tricky for the high homology with the human Hsp90 NTD (hNTD). Notably, only the human Lys112 is replaced by Arg97 in the L. braziliensis enzyme. Recently, this difference has been probed to design selective inhibitors targeting parasite Hsp90s. Here, a reliable protocol for expression and purification of LbHsp90-NTD (LbNTD) was developed but its structural characterization was unsuccessful. The role of Arg97 in LbNTD was hence probed by means of the “leishmanized” K112R variant of hNTDα. To deeply investigate the role of this residue, also the hNTDα K112A variant was generated. Structural studies performed on hNTDα and its variants using various ADP and ATP analogues and cAMP revealed that this residue is not crucial for nucleotide binding. This finding strongly suggests that Arg97 in LbNTD and more generally the conserved arginine residue in parasite Hsp90s are not exploitable for the development of selective inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania braziliensis 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aarginine 3abinding sites 3acell viability 3acyclic AMP 3adeath 3aheat-shock protein 90 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3aleishmaniasis 3aparasites 3aprotocols 3asite-directed mutagenesis 0aHeat shock protein 90 0aLeishmania braziliensis 0aProtozoan parasites 0aX-ray crystallography 0aSelectivity 0aNucleotides 0aLB 0aSB 0aIPTG 0aDTT 0aATP 0aADP 0aAMPCP 0aAMPPNP 0acAMP 0aAMPCPP 0aPDB 0aCryo-EM1 aMangani, Stefano1 aBotta, Maurizio1 aPozzi, Cecilia0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2018 Nov., v. 1866, no. 11 p.1190-1198dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2018.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014000161300002000301520157200321592002801893650002001921650001701941650002101958650000901979650001201988650001402000650002202014650001302036650002502049650002602074650001602100653002502116653003302141653001702174653002402191653001502215653003002230700002002260700005302280700001202333700001502345700001802360700001402378700001102392700001602403700001702419700005502436773014202491856007802633852000902711655001202720IND60746467320221119232030.0210805e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c076812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiaxin10aStrong Polarized Photoluminescence CsPbBr₃ Nanowire Composite Films for UV Spectral Conversion Polarization Photodetector Enhancement  ap. 36147-36156.  aIn this work, we proposed a fluorescence conversion layer with polarization characteristics to enhance UV polarization detection for the first time. To achieve this goal, the colloidal lead halide CsPbBr₃ nanowires (NWs) with appropriate lengths were synthesized by the method of ultrasonication synthesis assisted by the addition of hydrobromic acid (HBr) ligands. By adding HBr, the properties of synthesized NWs are improved, and due to the controllable perovskite-stretched NWs, polymer composite films were fabricated, which can generate photoluminescence (PL) with strong polarization. The optimized stretched composite film can achieve a polarization degree of 0.42 and dichroism ratio (I∥/I⊥) of 2.49 at 520 nm. Based on this film, an imaging system with polarization-selective properties and efficient UV spectral conversion was developed. The spectrum conversion of 266 to 520 nm luminescence wavelength was realized and sensitive to the polarization of incoming 266 nm UV light. The experimental results also showed that the response after spectral conversion is greatly improved, and different responsivities can correspond to different polarization states. This imaging system overcomes the insufficiency of the conventional charge coupled device (CCD), which makes it difficult to receive the optical signal for high-quality UV imaging. The use of light conversion films with polarization characteristics for polarized UV imaging is of great significance for improving the detection of solar-blind UV bands and the recognition of military targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite films 3afluorescence 3ahydrobromic acid 3alead 3aligands 3ananowires 3aphotoluminescence 3apolymers 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultraviolet radiation 3awavelengths 0aperovskite nanowires 0aNW−polymer composite films 0apolarization 0aspectral conversion 0aUV imaging 0aphotodetector enhancement1 aZhang, Yuanzhou1 aChen, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1247-35801 aWei, Yi1 aYu, Dejian1 aLiang, Lumeng1 aLiu, Yang1 aWu, Ye1 aShen, Weili1 aLi, Xiaoming1 aZeng, Haibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0281-36170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 22, v. 13, no. 30 p.36147-36156dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c076813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245015500174520158200329592002801911650002201939650002801961650002501989650002902014650002502043650002202068650000902090650001402099650002202113650002002135650002302155650001302178650003002191650001502221650001102236650001502247650002602262650002002288650001502308650001502323650001102338650002902349653002102378653002902399653002302428653002302451700001602474700001602490700001702506700001302523700001402536700001802550773009902568856009002667852000902757655001202766IND60701885620221120081937.0201104e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070188562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mingzhu10aStudy of fermented feed by mixed strains and their effects on the survival, growth, digestive enzyme activity and intestinal flora of Penaeus vannamei  aIn this study, the mixed strains, including Lactobacillus plantarum (STBL1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (STBS1), and Bacillus safensis (SQVG18) were applied to the solid-state fermentation of commercial feed for Penaeus vannamei. Firstly, the optimum combination of strain inoculum, optimum fermentation conditions, and nutritional quality of the fermented feeds were investigated. It was noted that the acid-soluble protein and the content of amino acids (lysine, methionine, etc.) were remarkably improved in the feeds by solid-state fermentation with the optimum combination of STBL1: STBS1: SQVG18 = 1: 3: 3. Secondly, a six-week feeding experiment was performed using one control diet without probiotics (D0: 0 CFU g⁻¹) and three fermented diets containing different concentrations of the optimum mixed-strain combination (D1: 10⁷ CFU g⁻¹; D2: 10⁸ CFU g⁻¹; D3: 10⁹ CFU g⁻¹). Shrimps fed D2, and D3 groups exhibited significantly better growth performance and activities of antioxidant enzymes and digestive enzymes than shrimp of other groups (P < .05). The fermented feeds also affected the intestinal microflora of P. vannamei at the end of the feeding trial. The diversity indices, composition, and functional prediction of microbial communities showed that shrimp fed D1 and D2 groups had a better microecological environment in intestines. Overall, the fermented diet with mixed strains of 10⁸ CFU g⁻¹ may be conducive to the growth and health of P. vannamei by improving growth, antioxidant capacity, digestion, and gut microflora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus safensis 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture feeds 3adiet 3adigestion 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3agrowth performance 3ainoculum 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alysine 3amethionine 3amicrobial communities 3anutritive value 3aprediction 3aprobiotics 3ashrimp 3asolid state fermentation 0aPenaeus vannamei 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aQuality evaluation 0aIn vivo evaluation1 aPan, Luqing1 aFan, Depeng1 aHe, Jingjing1 aSu, Chen1 aGao, Shuo1 aZhang, Mengyu0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 530 p.735703-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015900180300002000339520151200359592002801871650001501899650001001914650002101924650001401945650001201959650001601971650002001987650001502007650001102022650001402033650000902047650001702056653003202073653001602105653002902121653003102150653000902181700002202190700001702212700002702229700002002256700002502276700001802301700002002319700001702339773013302356856008502489852000902574655001202583IND60586473720180323000000.0171213e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647372DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b027962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOregui-Bengoechea, Mikel10aHigh-Performance Magnetic Activated Carbon from Solid Waste from Lignin Conversion Processes. 2.

Such lignin-derived MACs can be further used as functional substrates for hydrotreating NiMo catalysts. In this work, we studied the activity of different NiMo-MACs for the catalytic conversion of lignin in a formic acid/ethanol media (lignin-to-liquid, LtL, process). Two KOH-activated LtL hydrochars from eucalyptus (MACE) and Norwegian spruce (MACS) lignins were used as catalyst supports. In addition, the activity of the resulting NiMo-MACs, namely, C-MACE and C-MACS, was compared with a NiMo catalyst supported on a commercial activated carbon (AC). At reaction conditions of 340 °C and 6 h, the best result was obtained for the NiMo-MACS with a yield of 72.2 wt % of oil and 21.1 wt % of organic solids. At 300 °C and 10 h, both NiMo-MAC catalysts displayed higher hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) activities than their commercial counterpart, yielding considerably higher oil yields. The higher HDO activities are tentatively assigned to the formation of NiFe species on the catalytic surfaces of the NiMo-MAC catalysts. In addition, the magnetism exhibited by the C-MACS made it easy to recover the catalyst. However, a considerable loss of activity was observed upon recycling due to a chemical modification of the catalyst surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aPicea 3aactivated carbon 3acatalysts 3aethanol 3aformic acid 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrochars 3alignin 3amagnetism 3aoils 3asolid wastes 0aLignin catalytic conversion 0aFormic acid 0aHydrodeoxygenation (HDO) 0aMagnetic activated carbons 0aNiFe1 aMiletić, Nemanja1 aHao, Wenming1 aBjörnerbäck, Fredrik1 aRosnes, Mali H.1 aS.

The results revealed that optimal choline supplementation (1) reduced the incidence of rotten gill and protected gill morphology; (2) increased the contents of choline, acetylcholine, betaine, and phosphatidylcholine in grass crap gill; (3) reduced the proportion of positive cells with TUNEL assay and the degree of DNA fragments. Similarly, down-regulated the activities of caspase-3, -8, -9. Reduced caspase-3, -7, -8, -9, Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), Fas ligand (FASL), p38MAPK, and apoptotic protease activating factor-1(Apaf1) mRNA levels, as well as cytochrome C (CtyC) protein level. Up-regulated myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) mRNA level in grass carp gill, suggested that choline inhibited cell apoptosis in fish gill; (4) decreased p-p38MAPK, T-p38MAPK protein levels and down-regulated the JAK2,TYK2, and STAT3 mRNA levels, as well as p-STAT3 protein abundance in grass crap gill, indicating that choline protected cell apoptosis in association with p38MAPK and JAK1(TYK2)/STAT3 signalling pathways in fish gill; In conclusion, choline protected the gill health and inhibited gill apoptosis might be related to p38MAPK and JAK1(TYK2)/STAT3 signalling pathways in fish. Moreover, the requirements of choline for resist gill rot morbidity and apoptosis indices (DNA fragmentation) of grass carp (9.28–108.97 g) were calculated as 1548.07 and 1383.20 mg kg⁻¹ diet, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacetylcholine 3aapoptosis 3abetaine 3acaspase-3 3acholine 3acytochrome c 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agrasses 3ajuveniles 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3amorbidity 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aprotein content 3asignal transduction 0aCholine 0aApoptosis 0aGrass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) 0aGill 0aJAK/STAT signalling1 aWu, Pei1 aFeng, Lin1 aJiang, Weidan1 aLiu, Yang1 aKuang, Shengyao1 aTang, Ling1 aZhou, Xiaoqiu0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735699-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01645naa a2200301 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024003300090040001800123100001500141245004300156300001300199520077400212592002800986650002601014650001401040650001101054700001701065700001801082700001601100700001801116700001501134773012701149856004601276852000901322655001201331IND607255720221120041329.0170525e20120316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND60725572DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12159852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoblin, X.14aThe Fern Sporangium: A Unique Catapult  ap. 1322.  aVarious plants and fungi have evolved ingenious devices to disperse their spores. One such mechanism is the cavitation-triggered catapult of fern sporangia. The spherical sporangia enclosing the spores are equipped with a row of 12 to 13 specialized cells, the annulus. When dehydrating, these cells induce a dramatic change of curvature in the sporangium, which is released abruptly after the cavitation of the annulus cells. The entire ejection process is reminiscent of human-made catapults with one notable exception: The sporangia lack the crossbar that arrests the catapult arm in its returning motion. We show that much of the sophistication and efficiency of the ejection mechanism lies in the two very different time scales associated with the annulus closure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aferns and fern allies 3asporangia 3aspores1 aRojas, N.

Toxic elements such as Hg and Cd decreased in adult males and thus the male-female difference was clearly observed in their concentrations, which differed from patterns usually found in marine mammals. Such accumulation patterns were due to difference in the feeding rates between males and females under low exposure to Hg and Cd. In addition, a greater excretion of Hg than that of Cd through molting and parturition was estimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoca sibirica 3aadults 3acadmium 3acopper 3aexcretion 3afemales 3aheavy metals 3aimmatures 3airon 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3amanganese 3amercury 3amolting 3amuscles 3aparturition 3aseals 3atoxic substances 3azinc 3aLake Baikal1 aTanabe, S.1 aAmano, M.1 aMiyazaki, N.1 aPetrov, E.

[Q-VADIS Study]  ap. 85-89.  aAIMS: The aim was to compute a normative data of VPT [Vibration Perception Threshold], compare results of VPT among type 2 diabetes patients with and without neuropathy, validate VPT taking NDS [Neuropathy Disability Scores] as gold standard and suggest a cut off value for the Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinic based case-control study was conducted at Nightingale Hospital (NH) in Kolkata for 2 months duration. Fifty type 2 diabetes patients (who were detected with by fasting plasma glucose or on medication) reporting at OPD (Out Patent Department) were randomly selected and informed consent was obtained. The age range was 20–65 years and other common causes of neuropathy were excluded. Same number of control patients without diabetes and reporting at the same hospital during the study period in the similar age range were selected. RESULTS: The normative data of VPT for mean of 4 sites (malleoli and great toe) was 11.3±4.9mV. The VPT value was significantly higher among diabetic patients with neuropathy compared to non-neuropathic and non-diabetic patients. Considering NDS score as gold standard lowering the cutoff value of VPT from 25mV to 20mV increased the sensitivity from 50% to 62.5% in detecting diabetic neuropathy compared to NDS taken as a gold standard. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that lowering the cut off value of VPT in Indian population increased the sensitivity of the test to detect diabetic neuropathy without hampering the specificity. There is however no indication that a lower cut off VPT value is justified as of now.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acase-control studies 3adiabetic neuropathy 3adrug therapy 3afasting 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3avibration1 aStephens, Jeff1 aMukherjee, Aninda0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 2 p.85-89dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245018100163300002000344520139200364592002801756650002301784650001701807650002101824650001901845650001901864650001201883650001201895650002101907650002001928653004001948653003101988653004502019653002602064653003002090700005602120700001702176700002102193700005902214700005802273773014202331856007802473852000902551655001202560IND60746467520221119232155.0210805e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646752DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c077342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Woonghee10aStable Cycling of a 4 V Class Lithium Polymer Battery Enabled by In Situ Cross-Linked Ethylene Oxide/Propylene Oxide Copolymer Electrolytes with Controlled Molecular Structures  ap. 35664-35676.  aCommercial lithium-ion batteries are vulnerable to fire accidents, mainly due to volatile and flammable liquid electrolytes. Although solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are considered promising alternatives with antiflammability and processability for roll-to-roll mass production, several requirements have not yet been fulfilled for a viable lithium polymer battery. Such requirements include ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and interfacial resistance. In this work, the ionic conductivity of the SPEs is optimized by controlling the molecular weight and structural morphology of the plasticizers as well as introducing propylene oxide (PO) groups. Electrochemical stability is also enhanced using ethylene oxide (EO)/PO copolymer electrolytes, making the SPEs compatible with high-Ni LiNiₓCoyMn₁–ₓ–yO₂ cathodes. The in situ cross-linking method, in which a liquid precursor first wets the electrode and is then solidified by a subsequent thermal treatment, enables the SPEs to soak into the 60 μm thick electrode with a high loading density of more than 8 mg cm–². Thus, interfacial resistance between the SPE and the electrode is minimized. By using the in situ cross-linked EO/PO copolymer electrolytes, we successfully demonstrate a 4 V class lithium polymer battery, which performs stable cycling with a marginal capacity fading even over 100 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylene oxide 3aheat treatment 3aliquids 3alithium 3amolecular weight 3apropylene oxide 0a4 V class lithium polymer batteries 0asolid polymer electrolytes 0aethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer 0ain situ cross-linking 0aelectrochemical stability1 aKang, Yongku1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2898-872X1 aKim, In-Jung1 aSeong, Byeong-Gi1 aYu, Woong-Ryeol1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5916-33391 aKim, Dong Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0752-53660 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 21, v. 13, no. 30 p.35664-35676dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c077343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245014300178520181300321592002802134650002602162650001902188650001302207650002302220650002002243650000902263650001702272650002102289650002202310650001502332650001402347650001602361650001502377650001502392650001202407650002502419650001002444650001602454653003102470653003402501653002502535653000802560653000702568653000802575653000802583653000802591653000802599653000902607700003902616700002902655700003702684700003702721700002902758700003302787700003502820700002602855700004202881700002602923773009902949856009003048852000903138655001203147IND60701885820221120082036.0201104e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070188582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaice, Laice Menes10aUse of symbiotics in biofloc (BFT)-based Nile tilapia culture: Production performance, intestinal morphometry and hematological parameters  aSymbiotics are a combination of prebiotics and probiotics that positively affect the animal by stimulating health-promoting bacteria and thus improving production performance and animal welfare. The aim of this study was to evaluate a water symbiotic on the performance, hematological parameters and intestinal morphometry of Nile tilapia raised in a biofloc technology system (BFT) for the initial grow-out phase. Eighty juveniles (initial weight: 30–35 g) were stocked in eight 100-L tanks (10 fish/box). The fish were evaluated using BFT with and without symbiotics. The symbiotic was added directly to the water on a weekly basis at a dose of 0.2 mg L⁻¹ (commercial recommendation for the product). The experiment was laid out in a completely randomized design with two treatments (BFT with symbiotics and BFT without symbiotics) and four replicates, totaling eight experimental units. The experimental period was 40 days. Final weight, weight gain and the specific growth rate were higher (p < .05) in the fish produced in BFT with symbiotics (77.28 ± 0.61 g; 46.79 ± 0.64 g; 2.33 ± 0.03%) than in those farmed in BFT without symbiotics (73.31 ± 0.73 g; 42.54 ± 0.77 g; 2.17 ± 0.04%). Feed conversion ratio was higher (p < .05) in the group reared in BFT without symbiotic (1.02 ± 0.01) as compared with those farmed in BFT with symbiotics (0.94 ± 0.01). Overall, hematological conditions were better (p < .05) in the fish grown in BFT with symbiotics. There were no major differences in intestinal morphometry between treatments. The inclusion of symbiotics in BFT improved the performance and hematological parameters of Nile tilapia in the initial phase (30 to 77 g) without causing significant changes in intestinal morphometry or intestinal cell density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aanimal welfare 3abacteria 3abiofloc technology 3afeed conversion 3afish 3afish culture 3ahealth promotion 3ahematologic tests 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3amorphometry 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3arearing 3aspecific growth rate 3atanks 3aweight gain 0aAquaculture sustainability 0aAquaculture production system 0aMicrobial aggregates 0aBFT 0aDO 0aTAN 0aTPP 0aRBC 0aMCV 0aMCHC1 aCorrêa Filho, Ruy Alberto Caetano1 aVentura, Arlene Sobrinho1 aFarias, Karine Nathiele Nogueira1 aSilva, André Luiz do Nascimento1 aFernandes, Carlos Eurico1 aSilva, Ana Crimilda Fernando1 aBarbosa, Phillipe Thiago Leite1 ade Souza, Alda Izabel1 aEmerenciano, Maurício Gustavo Coelho1 aPovh, Jayme Aparecido0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 530 p.735715-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04029naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245006500212300001400277520256200291592002802853650001202881650001202893650000902905650001102914650001702925650001502942650001302957650001802970650000802988650001502996650001303011650001203024650001203036650001203048650001303060653000903073653002003082653002603102653002303128653001703151700002603168700006103194700002203255700002303277700001903300773009603319856008703415852000903502655001203511IND60597270820221118055858.0200128e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConway, Susan J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0577-231210aGlacial and gully erosion on Mars: A terrestrial perspective  ap. 26-57.  aThe mid- to high latitudes of Mars host assemblages of landforms consistent with a receding glacial landscape on Earth. These landforms are postulated to have formed >5 Ma under a different climate regime when Mars' orbital obliquity was on average 10° higher than today. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal relationship between gullies and glacial landforms, both common in the mid-latitudes. Gullies are kilometre-scale landforms with a source alcove, transportation channel, and depositional apron. The glacial landforms comprise (1) extant viscous flow features (VFF) that extend from the base of crater walls into the interior of crater floors and are widely interpreted as debris-covered glaciers containing extant ice, and (2) landforms such as arcuate ridges at the base of crater walls that have been interpreted as relicts of more recent, less extensive glacial advances focussed on crater walls. We measure headwall retreat associated with glacial landforms and date their host-craters to constrain minimum headwall retreat rates. We record headwall retreat rates up to ~10² m My⁻¹ for the youngest suite of glacial landforms, equivalent to erosion rates of wet-based glaciers on Earth and to headwall retreat rates associated with martian bedrock gully systems. We find extensive evidence for a single erosional episode dating 5–10 Ma, which postdates emplacement of the majority of VFF but seems to predate formation of the gullies. We propose that the wet-based glacial episode was associated with glaciation focussed on the crater walls rather than melting of the glacial ice deposits on the crater floors (VFF). This is consistent with our observations of crater wall morphologies, including the presence of arcuate ridges consistent with terrestrial glaciotectonic features that require liquid water to form, textural alteration of the eroded bedrock surface consistent with ice-segregation and frost-shattering, and the presence of downslope pasted-on terrain, tentatively interpreted here as glacial till deposits sourced from glacial erosion of the crater wall. The pasted-on terrain is usually interpreted as a thicker, latitude-dependant mantle located on sloping terrain formed from airfall of ice nucleated on dust, but we suggest that it has been reworked by glaciation and is predominantly glacial in origin. Although our results cannot substantiate that gullies are produced by meltwater, the discovery of this wet glacial event does provide evidence for widespread meltwater generation in Mars' recent history.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3aclimate 3adust 3afloors 3aglacial till 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3agully erosion 3aice 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3aliquids 3amelting 3aravines 3asnowmelt 0aMars 0aMartian gullies 0aViscous flow features 0aGlacier-like forms 0aLiquid water1 aButcher, Frances E.G.1 ade Haas, Tjalling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8949-39291 aDeijns, Axel A.J.1 aGrindrod, Peter M.1 aDavis, Joel M.0 tGeomorphology.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 318 p.26-57dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2018.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011400170300001100284520142600295592002801721596006701749650001901816650001201835650002201847650002501869650001801894650001701912650001201929650001001941651002801951651001101979700002101990700002202011700002702033700002002060700002002080700001902100700002302119700002202142700002002164700001602184700002502200700002102225773011102246856008302357852000902440655001202449IND60743525220221118025554.0220308e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074352522DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-021-01044-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazarika, Reneema10aMulti-actor perspectives on afforestation and reforestation strategies in Central Europe under climate change  ap. 60.  a• KEY MESSAGE : Understanding forest genetic diversity and national legislation on trade and utilization of forest reproductive material (FRM) are key aspects for management and adapting forests to climate change. Despite concerns about the negative effects of climate change on forests, awareness of the role of genetic diversity in climate change adaptation is limited. • CONTEXT : Adaptive forest management strategies such as afforestation and reforestation depend on the selection of appropriate FRM and their knowledge among the relevant stakeholders. • AIMS : To analyze the perceptions among the forest, conservation, and nursery managers of six Central European countries on awareness of genetic diversity and practical and legislative issues of afforestation and reforestation in climate change. • METHODS : A survey was conducted with structured questionnaires. • RESULTS : Around 80% of the respondents believe in climate change. Local FRM is preferred for reforestation. Although 80% of the conservation and forest managers perceive the importance of forest genetic diversity, almost half of them feel unaware of it. The majority of respondents believe that national and European legislation on seed transfer is not adapted to climate change. • CONCLUSION : Inadequacy in the awareness of genetic diversity and policies on FRM is likely to influence forest adaptation to climate change in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data  aSUSTREE,Interreg CE-Project No: CE614cInterreg Central Europe 3aclimate change 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3alaws and regulations 3areforestation 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3atrade 3aCentral European region 3aEurope1 aBölte, Andreas,1 aBednarova, Dagmar1 aChakraborty, Debojyoti1 aGaviria, Julian1 aKanzian, Monika1 aKowalczyk, Jan1 aLackner, Magdalena1 aLstibůrek, Milan1 aLongauer, Roman1 aNagy, Lazlo1 aTomášková, Ivana,1 aSchueler, Silvio0 tAnnals of forest science.g2021 Sept., v. 78, no. 3 p.60-60dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-021-01044-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009800164300001200262520149900274592002801773650002001801650001701821650001401838650002601852650002501878650001301903650001401916700001701930773011601947856008302063852000902146655001202155IND60624100320221120032914.0181201e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062410032DNAL7 a10.1177/01154265020170031942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoivin, MA10aGastric Feeding With Erythromycin Is Equivalent to Transpyloric Feeding in the Critically Ill  ap. 194.  aObjective: To determine whether adding erythromycin to a gastric feeding regimen could render it as effective in meeting nutritional needs as transpyloric feeding. Design: Randomized, controlled study. Setting: University hospital medical, surgical, and neurologic care intensive care units. Patients: Critically ill patients, requiring a projected 96 hrs of enteral feeding, who had no specific indication for tube location (gastric or transpyloric). Eighty patients were randomized. Interventions: Patients were randomized to gastric feeding with erythromycin (200 mg IV) given every 8 hrs or feeding through a transpylorically placed feeding tube. Goal rate and feeding advancement were determined by protocol. Measurements and Main Results: During the 96-hr period, the gastric group received 74% of their goal calories and the transpyloric group received 67%. The only day on which gastric feedings were superior was the first study day, where the gastric group attained 55% of their goal, compared with 44% in the transpyloric group. This 1-day difference was the result of an initial failure of tube placement in some subjects. Exclusion of these patients did not change overall results. Nutritional indexes, length of stay in the intensive care unit, ventilator dependence, and survival were not different between the two groups. Conclusions: Gastric feeding with erythromycin as a prokinetic is equivalent to transpyloric feeding in meeting the nutritional goals of the critically ill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenteral feeding 3aerythromycin 3ahospitals 3anutrient requirements 3anutrition assessment 3apatients 3aprotocols1 aLevy, H.

Nonetheless, up to date, there are no reports on such kinds of materials due to the lack of in-depth understanding of the origin of TDLT and TDEBS at a molecule level, being critical for exploiting a universal approach to design a dual-parametric CN phosphorescent thermometer (CN-PT). Herein, we have constructed a thermoresponsive CN [Cu₂(L1)Br₂]∞ (IAM21-1, L1 = N¹,N⁶-di(pyridin-3-yl)adipamide) via a flexible-ligand-implanted strategy. The TDLT and TDEBS properties of IAM21-1 enable it to be applied as a single-metallic dual-parametric CN-PT in 50–500 K, which is the widest temperature range reported so far. The combination of structure analysis and DFT calculations demonstrates that the redshift of the emission band upon the decreasing temperature originates from the reversible skeleton-shrinkage-triggered narrower band gap. This work has unveiled the origin of TDLT and TDEBS properties and proposed an efficient strategy for designing dual-parametric CN-PTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphorescence 3atemperature 3athermometers 0asingle-metallic 0acoordination network 0athermoresponsive 0adual-parametric 0aluminescent thermometer1 aChen, Baojun1 aBian, Li1 aXu, Yixiu1 aHe, Jiangang1 aHuang, Wei1 aJu, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8521-845X1 aFang, Zhenlan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5161-844X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 21, v. 13, no. 30 p.35905-35913dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c078123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168500001900299520134000318592002801658650002201686650001401708650002301722650002701745650001101772650002901783650001801812650001101830650001401841650001301855653003301868653001401901653001301915653001401928700001701942700001301959700001301972700001501985700001902000773011402019856008602133852000902219655001202228IND60702618520221121043013.0201230e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070261852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ruitong10aCatalytic effect and mechanism of coexisting copper on conversion of organics during pyrolysis of waste printed circuit boards  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPyrolysis is a promising technology for recycling organic materials from waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs). Nevertheless, the generated organic bromides are toxic and urgently needed to be removed. The coexisting copper (Cu) of WPCBs has potential performance on debromination. However, the catalytic effect and mechanism of Cu on pyrolysis process and products were still unclear. To clarify the in-situ catalysis of Cu, the analysis on kinetics and pyrolysis products was performed. The results showed that Cu can change the mechanism function of pyrolysis, which reduced the apparent activation energy (Ea). The mechanism function of Cu-coated WPCBs was obtained by Šesták-Berggren model and expressed as: dαdt=1.65×107×1-α-1.30α6.09-ln1-α-6.03exp⁡-202.45KJ/molRT. Product analysis suggested that Cu promoted the conversion of organic bromides to Br₂ and HBr. During the process of pyrolysis, bromide atoms interacted with Cu to form coordination compound, which can weaken the strength of C-Br bond and generate bromide free radical (Br*). Besides, Cu can promote the conversion of aromatic-Br to Br₂ as the catalyst for Ullmann cross-coupling reaction. Therefore, the presence of Cu was beneficial to pyrolysis. This work provided the theoretical basis for the improvement and application of pyrolysis technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination compounds 3acopper 3across-coupling reactions 3afree radicals 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3atoxicity 0aWaste printed circuit boards 0aCatalysis 0aKinetics 0aMechanism1 aLiu, Binyang1 aZhan, Lu1 aGuo, Jie1 aZhang, Jie1 aHsu, Chen-Min,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 403 p.123465-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100007300144245013800217300001800355500001900373520145900392592002801851650001501879650003001894650001301924650002801937650002401965650001401989650002402003650001002027650001602037650000902053653001202062653001802074653001502092653002702107700007302134700003302207700007502240700002702315700004102342700007202383700006902455700006802524700002802592700003102620700002802651700005602679773013902735856007802874852000902952655001202961IND60725580220210831000000.0210127e20210114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072558022DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c156812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristina de Oliveira, Regiane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7332-873110aRole of Surfaces in the Magnetic and Ozone Gas-Sensing Properties of ZnFe₂O₄ Nanoparticles: Theoretical and Experimental Insights  ap. 4605-4617.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe magnetic properties and ozone (O₃) gas-sensing activity of zinc ferrite (ZnFe₂O₄) nanoparticles (NPs) were discussed by the combination of the results acquired by experimental procedures and density functional theory simulations. The ZnFe₂O₄ NPs were synthesized via the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method by varying the reaction time in order to obtain ZnFe₂O₄ NPs with different exposed surfaces and evaluate the influence on its properties. Regardless of the reaction time employed in the synthesis, the zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization measurements showed superparamagnetic ZnFe₂O₄ NPs with an average blocking temperature of 12 K. The (100), (110), (111), and (311) surfaces were computationally modeled, displaying the different undercoordinated surfaces. The good sensing activity of ZnFe₂O₄ NPs was discussed in relation to the presence of the (110) surface, which exhibited low (−0.69 eV) adsorption enthalpy, promoting reversibility and preventing the saturation of the sensor surface. Finally, the O₃ gas-sensing mechanism could be explained based on the conduction changes of the ZnFe₂O₄ surface and the increase in the height of the electron-depletion layer upon exposure toward the target gas. The results obtained allowed us to propose a mechanism for understanding the relationship between the morphological changes and the magnetic and O₃ gas-sensing properties of ZnFe₂O₄ NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3aenthalpy 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ahot water treatment 3amagnetism 3amicrowave treatment 3aozone 3atemperature 3azinc 0aZnFe2O4 0ananoparticles 0aO3, sensor 0amicrowave hydrothermal1 aPontes Ribeiro, Renan Augusto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4128-82961 aCruvinel, Guilherme Henrique1 aCiola Amoresi, Rafael Aparecido1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7523-60131 aCarvalho, Maria Helena1 aAparecido de Oliveira, Adilson Jesus1 aCarvalho de Oliveira, Marisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3392-74891 aRicardo de Lazaro, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9753-79361 aFernando da Silva, Luís1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6257-55371 aCatto, Ariadne Cristina1 aSimões, Alexandre Zirpoli1 aSambrano, Julio Ricardo1 aLongo, Elson1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8062-77910 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 14, v. 13, no. 3 p.4605-4617dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c156813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245016100210520137300371592002801744650002301772650001501795650001501810650001401825650001201839650002001851650001901871650001601890650001101906650001601917650000701933650002301940653001701963653001201980653002501992653002502017653002602042700005702068773011402125856008602239852000902325655001202334IND60702618620221121053258.0211106e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070261862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaval, Nirav P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2519-478310aGeogenic arsenic removal through core–shell based functionalized nanoparticles: Groundwater in-situ treatment perspective in the post–COVID anthropocene  aGroundwater, one of the significant potable water resources of the geological epoch is certainly contaminated with class I human carcinogenic metalloid of pnictogen family which delimiting its usability for human consumption. Hence, this study concerns with the elimination of arsenate (As(V)) from groundwater using bilayer–oleic coated iron–oxide nanoparticles (bilayer–OA@FeO NPs). The functionalized (with high–affinity carboxyl groups) adsorbent was characterized using the state–of–the–art techniques in order to understand the structural arrangement. The major emphasis was to examine the effects of pH (5.0–13), contact times (0–120 min), initial concentrations (10–150 μg L–¹), adsorbent dosages (0.1–3 g L–¹), and co–existing anions in order to understand the optimal experimental conditions for the effective removal process. The adsorbent had better adsorption efficiency (∼ 32.8 μg g–¹, after 2 h) for As(V) at neutral pH. Adsorption process mainly followed pseudo–second–order kinetics and Freundlich isotherm models (R²∼0.90) and was facilitated by coulombic, charge–dipole and surface complexation interactions. The regeneration (upto five cycles with 0.1 M NaOH) and competition studies (with binary and cocktail mixture of co–anions) supported the potential field application of the proposed adsorbent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3acarcinogenicity 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3airon oxides 3apH 3asorption isotherms 0aNanoparticle 0aArsenic 0aGeogenic contaminant 0aSurface modification 0aIn–situ remediation1 aManish Kumar,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3351-72980 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 402 p.123466-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1234663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245010200201300001400303500001500317520159700332592002801929650001801957650001501975650001101990650001402001650000802015650001302023650001702036650003102053650001202084650001602096650002602112650001602138650001402154650002902168650000902197650002402206650002102230650001002251650001502261650001702276650001002293650001302303650002602316650002502342650001602367650001802383650001202401650001302413653001002426653001002436653001102446653002102457653001002478653001002488653001102498700001202509700001602521700001902537700001802556700001502574700001802589700001602607773008102623856008102704852000902785655001202794IND60556540920221117164034.0161102e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055654092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Hyelin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9118-508410aDeletion of exons 3 and 4 in the mouse Nr1d1 gene worsens high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis  ap. 13-19.  a2019-12-06  aTo elucidate the role of nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1) in hepatic lipid metabolism and pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, Nr1d1 gene mutant mice, in which the DNA-binding domain (exons 3 and 4) was deleted (Nr1d1 Δex3/4), were challenged with a high-fat diet (HFD), and the gene expression patterns that responded to this alteration were profiled.The Nr1d1 Δex3/4 mice were fed an HFD for 12weeks. Liver tissues were examined by histology, and lipid droplets were detected by Oil-Red O staining. Serum biochemical analyses were performed to assess markers of liver injury. Microarray analysis was used to profile hepatic gene expression patterns. Functional annotation, upstream prediction, and gene coexpression prediction analyses were performed.The Nr1d1 Δex3/4 mice showed enhanced hepatic steatosis after being challenged with an HFD, but not with a low-fat diet, indicating an interaction between diet and genotype for this phenotypic change. Gene expression profiling revealed that this interaction might involve neutrophil recruitment and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate metabolic pathway. A study of transcription factor binding site enrichment suggested that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha were associated with this phenotypic change.Loss of DNA binding of Nr1d1 was associated with a deterioration in hepatic steatosis. The interaction between the Nr1d1 Δex3/4 genotype with an HFD might mediate these phenotypic changes, probably through a nonclassical transcriptional function of Nr1d1.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahigh fat diet 3acyclic AMP 3alipids 3aphenotype 3aDNA 3agenotype 3apathogenesis 3agene expression regulation 3atissues 3afatty liver 3atranscription factors 3ablood serum 3ahistology 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3aDNA-binding domains 3alipid metabolism 3aexons 3aprediction 3alow fat diet 3aliver 3astaining 3amicroarray technology 3abiochemical pathways 3aneutrophils 3abinding sites 3amutants 3adroplets 0agenes 0aLiver 0aHnf4α 0aLipid metabolism 0aThrsp 0aNr1d1 0aCebpα1 aLee, Ho1 aLee, Min-Ho1 aLim, Han Jeong1 aKim, Hyeon-Ji1 aJeon, Yoon1 aKang, Hae-Lim1 aLee, Mi-Ock0 tLife sciences.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 166 p.13-19dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010300170520152400273592002801797650002501825650002101850650001701871650002501888650001501913650001201928650001501940650004401955650001301999650001902012653002502031653003802056653003802094653004402132653002502176653002802201700001502229700002102244700001802265700002602283700002002309773009402329856008402423852000902507655001202516IND60730180620221120184851.0220124e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073018062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2021.1022522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiss, Christian10aStructure of the polysaccharide sheath from the B race of the green microalga Botryococcus braunii  aThe green microalga Botryococcus braunii forms a colony of cells held together by an intricate extracellular matrix. This extracellular matrix also acts as a storage location for liquid hydrocarbons initially produced inside the cells. These hydrocarbons can be used as feedstocks to produce transportation fuels. In the B race of B. braunii, the extracellular matrix is composed of several elements: a cross-linked hydrocarbon network filled with the liquid hydrocarbons, a retaining wall to hold the hydrocarbons in the extracellular matrix, an arabinogalactan polysaccharide fibrillar sheath that extends outward from the retaining wall, and a single protein known as polysaccharide associated protein is found at the base of the polysaccharide fibers where they connect to the retaining wall. During growth, colonies of the B race of B. braunii shed fragments of the retaining wall with polysaccharide fibrils attached into the media. Here we describe the isolation and structural analysis of these polysaccharides using a series of chemical degradations in combination with glycosyl residue composition and linkage analysis, as well as 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the polysaccharide is highly branched, consisting of a galactan backbone with short branches comprised of d-galactopyranose, l-arabinofuranose, 4-O-methyl-d-glucopyranuronic acid, and 6-deoxy-d-altropyranose. To our knowledge, this is the first description of 6-deoxyaltrose in algae or plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryococcus braunii 3aarabinogalactans 3acrosslinking 3aextracellular matrix 3afeedstocks 3aliquids 3amicroalgae 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aresearch 3atransportation 0aBotryococcus braunii 0aPolysaccharide associated protein 0aPolysaccharide structure analysis 0aNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aAlgal polysaccharide 0aArabinogalactan protein1 aBlack, Ian1 aIshihara, Mayumi1 aTatli, Mehmet1 aDevarenne, Timothy P.1 aAzadi, Parastoo0 tAlgal research.g2021 May, v. 55 p.102252-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2021.1022523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245010900155520117900264592002801443650004101471650003601512650001601548650001301564650003001577650001901607650001101626650001601637650001601653650002501669650002001694650001501714651001701729700002501746700001901771700002401790773011801814856007201932852000902004655001202013IND60653239720221122064811.0190714e20170816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065323972DNAL7 a10.3390/w90806102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Supria10aAssessment of Nitrogen Inputs into Hunt River by Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems via SWAT Simulation  aNonpoint source nitrogen pollution is difficult to effectively model in groundwater systems. This study aims to elucidate anthropogenic nonpoint source pollution discharging into Potowomut Pond and ultimately Narragansett Bay. Hydrologic modeling with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Program (SWAT-CUP) was used to simulate streamflow and nitrogen levels in the Hunt River with and without onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). The objective of this study was to determine how input of OWTS data impacts nitrogen loading into the Hunt River Watershed in Rhode Island, USA. The model was simulated from 2006 to 2014, calibrated from 2007 to 2011 and validated from 2012 to 2014. Observed streamflow data was sourced from a US Geological Survey gauge and nitrogen loading data from University of Rhode Island Watershed Watch (URIWW). From the results, adding OWTS data to the SWAT simulation produced a better calibration and validation fit for total fit (Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.50 calibration, 0.78 validation) when compared with SWAT simulation without OWTS data (NSE = −1.3 calibration, −6.95) validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3agroundwater 3anitrogen 3anonpoint source pollution 3apollution load 3arivers 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3aRhode Island1 aCashman, Michaela A.1 aSzura, Katelyn1 aPradhanang, Soni M.0 tWater.g2017 Aug. 16, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90806103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245003600176300001600212520031600228592002800544650001200572650001600584650002500600651001000625653000800635653000800643653000800651653000800659653001800667653001000685653002600695653004500721700002300766700002400789773010600813856008500919852000901004655001201013IND60599783820221121024744.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmami Namini, Julian10aExport growth and firm survival  ap. 481-486.  aThis paper uses plant-level data from Chile to show that an increase in sector-wide exports decreases the survival probability of exporters, but not that of non-exporters.
