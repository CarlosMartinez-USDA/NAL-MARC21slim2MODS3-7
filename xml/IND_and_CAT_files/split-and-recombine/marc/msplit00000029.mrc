Ten stream segments were sampled across the known geographic distribution in Brazil, with a total of 65 individuals sequenced for the cox2-3 spacer and 30 for cox1. Six cox2-3 and eight cox1 haplotypes were observed among the individuals analyzed. Two haplotypes were found in one location for cox2-3 spacer, with all other locations having just one haplotype. Each of the cox1 haplotypes was found in a distinct location. Haplotype networks showed one haplotype occurring in most locations in southern and south-eastern Brazil for cox2-3 and revealed a relatively complex structure for cox1, with the same haplotype represented by individuals from two distant locations of southern and south-eastern Brazil. The low divergence observed among the Brazilian haplotypes supported the recognition of all collections as a single species, for both markers considering the geographic range sampled (maximum distance ~ 1000 km) as compared with previous studies at similar or broader geographic scales (> 2500 km). This study confirmed the general pattern found in Batrachospermales: that little variation is typically observed within a location and that most populations have one, rarely two haplotypes. In addition, we found no evidence of higher genetic divergences with increased geographic distance among haplotypes, which has also been reported in members of the Batrachospermales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBatrachospermales 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3aphylogeography 3astreams 3aAfrica 3aBrazil 0acox1 0acox2-3 spacer 0agenetic distances 0ageographical patterns 0aintraspecific variation1 aNecchi, Orlando0 tPhycologia.g2017 July 1, v. 56, no. 4 p.390-395dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/16-104.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011800163300001600281520134500297592002801642650002101670650003001691650002101721650003401742650001501776650001701791650001801808650001801826650001101844650002601855700001601881773016101897856008102058852000902139655001202148IND60685888220221120065110.0200311e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068588822DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000202212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguu, E.

Heating of the plasma at 42, 50 and 60 °C for 30 min resulted in a 20, 38 and 40% loss of inhibitor activity respectively, whereas only negligible loss occurred below 42 °C. Similarly, one and four freeze-thawing cycles resulted in 32 and 60% loss of activity respectively. Inactivation of the inhibitor activity, which occurred rapidly during storage (for example, 80% loss after 7 days at −20 °C) could not be stopped by the addition of various protease inhibitors or lyophilisation of the plasma. Treatment of plasma with pronase (1 mg/ml for 2 h) completely abrogated the inhibitor activity, whereas trypsinisation had only a partial effect. Ammonium sulphate fractionation of fresh plasma showed that the inhibitor was insoluble above 50% salt. When the plasma was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography, the inhibitory activity was recovered in the bound fractions. Efforts to purify the inhibitor were unsuccessful due to the rapid loss of activity under all conditions tested. It is concluded that the low capacity of eland blood to support transformation of bloodstream trypanosomes is due to an inhibitor present in the plasma fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTragelaphus oryx 3aTrypanosoma brucei brucei 3aammonium sulfate 3aanion exchange chromatography 3ablood flow 3ablood plasma 3afractionation 3afreeze drying 3amidgut 3aproteinase inhibitors1 aOsir, E.

It has been proved that SAPO-34 is the best catalyst for this process. This molecular-sieve is characterized by high thermal stability, moderate acid sites, and shape selectivity. In this report, SAPO-34 was synthesized using the seed-assisted method. Effects of OSDA and seed on crystallinity and particle size were investigated using Central Composite Design. Samples were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, FTIR, BET, EDX, and TPD. Results showed that the samples had excellent physicochemical properties. The design of Experiments could predict the results accurately (R² > 0.9). It was demonstrated that template was the key factor in the seed-assisted synthesis of SAPO-34. Template consumption was reduced by 50%, and it was proved that the synthesis time could be effectively decreased to 3 h due to rapid nucleation. Samples exhibited 100% methanol conversion and up to 90% selectivity toward ethylene and propylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acrystal structure 3aenergy efficiency 3aethylene 3amethanol 3aparticle size 3apropylene 3athermal stability 0aSAPO-34 0aSeed-assisted 0aTemplate 0aZeolites 0aMethanol-to-olefin1 aAskari, Sima1 aHalladj, Rouein0 tPowder technology.g2021 Sept., v. 389 p.383-391dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245018300170500002200353520092700375592002801302650002301330650001001353650001201363650002301375650002101398650001501419650002201434650001301456650001401469650004301483650001401526651002301540653001501563653002801578653002101606700002101627700002301648700002801671773008001699856008301779852000901862655001201871IND60566341120221122040215.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056634112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2017.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, Robert A.10aReal-time PCR assay for Aquimarina macrocephali subsp. homaria and its distribution in shell disease lesions of Homarus americanus, Milne-Edwards, 1837, and environmental samples  aPre-press version  aEpizootic shell disease (ESD) is causing major losses to the lobster fishery in southern New England. Potential pathogens have been identified in lesion communities, but there are currently no efficient means of detecting and quantifying their presence. A qPCR assay was developed for a key potential pathogen, Aquimarina macrocephali subsp. homaria found to be ubiquitous in ESD lesions but not the unaffected integument. Application of the assay to various samples demonstrated that A. macrocephali subsp. homaria is ubiquitous and abundant in lobster lesions, commonly associated with healthy surfaces of crabs and is scarce in water and sediment samples from southern New England suggesting the affinity of this microorganism to the Arthropod integument. The qPCR assay developed here can be applied in future in vivo and in vitro studies to better understand the ecology and role in shell disease of A. ‘homaria’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus americanus 3acrabs 3aecology 3aepizootic diseases 3ain vitro studies 3aintegument 3alobster fisheries 3alobsters 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asediments 3aNew England region 0aqPCR assay 0aEpizootic shell disease 0aAmerican lobster1 aHazra, Suchandra1 aSmolowitz, Roxanna1 aChistoserdov, Andrei Y.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245015900162300001600321520094500337592002801282650001301310650001001323650004301333650004401376651001801420700001901438700001901457700001601476700001401492700001501506700001701521773013501538856007901673852000901752655001201761IND60673263420221120060226.0191018e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067326342DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmy0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Changjie10aIdentification, Characterization and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Quantification for Process-Related Impurities in Abiraterone Acetate Bulk Drug  ap. 802-811.  aDuring the synthesis of abiraterone acetate bulk drug in some laboratory batches, two unreported impurities were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis at levels ranging from 0.05 to 0.10% according to the United States Pharmacopeia method. The structures of two impurities were characterized and confirmed by NMR and MS, which were proposed to be [3β-acetoxy-16-(3β-acetoxy-androsta-5,16-dien-17-yl)-17-(3-pyridyl)-androsta-5,16-di-ene] and [3β-acetoxy-16-(3β-acetoxy-androsta-5,16-dien-17-yl)-17-androsta-5,16-di-ene]. It was proved that these impurities come into being during the preparation process of penultimate intermediate (abiraterone). The newly developed LC–UV method was used to monitor the impurity profile in the penultimate intermediate (abiraterone), which was validated by its satisfactory specificity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity. The probable origin of the impurity was also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aUnited States1 aZhang, Hanqiao1 aZhang, Menglin1 aMi, Zhiyuan1 aWang, Jun1 aLu, Wenpin1 aSu, Jiangtao0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 56, no. 9 p.802-811dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmy0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245007200171300001600243520190400259592002802163650001202191650001102203650001602214650002102230650001602251650001902267650002602286650002402312650002402336650001002360650001102370650001902381650002102400650001802421650001702439650001202456650001702468700002302485700002002508773009202528856004802620852000902668655001202677IND4473746420221118005502.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447374642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-012-1208-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirinda, Ngonidzashe10aRoot carbon input in organic and inorganic fertilizer-based systems  ap. 321-333.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: In agroecosystems, carbon (C) inputs come from plant roots, retained shoot residues and in some cases from applied manures. Manure and shoot derived C inputs are relatively easy to determine. Conversely, high costs associated with root measurements have caused knowledge on root C input to remain scant. This study aimed at determining macro-root C input and topsoil root related respiration in response to nutrient management and soil fertility building measures. METHODS: We sampled roots and shoots of cereals and catch crops in inorganic and organic fertilizer-based arable cropping systems in a long-term experiment in 2 years, 2008 and 2010. Sampled shoots and macro-roots of catch crop mixtures and cereals were characterized for dry matter (DM) biomass (C was estimated as 45 % of DM biomass). We also measured topsoil root-related soil respiration throughout the growing season of winter wheat by subtracting soil respiration from soil with and without exclusion of roots. RESULTS: Catch crop roots accounted for more than 40 % of total plant C. For spring barley in 2008 and spring wheat in 2010, root C was higher in the organic than in the inorganic fertilizer-based systems. However, for winter wheat in 2008 and spring barley in 2010, there were similar amounts of root C across systems. The measurements of topsoil root-derived respiration also showed no difference across systems, despite large differences in harvested cereal yields. Cereal biomass shoot-to-root (S/R) ratio was higher (31–131 %) in inorganic than in organic fertilizer-based systems. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that macro-roots of both cereal crops and catch crops play a relatively larger role in organically managed systems than in mineral fertilizer based systems; and that the use of fixed biomass S/R ratios to estimate root biomass leads to erroneous estimates of root C input.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acatch crops 3acropping systems 3agrain crops 3agrowing season 3along term experiments 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrient management 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil fertility 3asoil respiration 3aspring barley 3aspring wheat 3atopsoil 3awinter wheat1 aOlesen, Jørgen E.1 aPorter, John R.0 tPlant and soil.g2012 Oct., v. 359, no. 1-2 p.321-333dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-012-1208-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003800117024004100155040001800196100002200214245012800236300001400364506007600378506003100454520163200485592002802117596000902145596006702154596001002221596007902231506003702310650001302347650002302360650002002383650002602403650001702429650001102446650001502457650001902472650002002491650001702511650001202528650001402540650001702554650001402571650001702585650001302602651001102615700001902626700002102645700002202666700001802688700002202706773014102728856008402869961000902953852000902962655001202971IND60731886620221215142355.0220901e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073188662DNAL7 a10113/73188662hdl7 a10.1016/j.ijpddr.2019.01.0022doi7 a10.1016/j.ijpddr.2019.01.0022chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyagwange , James10aLeveraging the Medicines for Malaria Venture malaria and pathogen boxes to discover chemical inhibitors of East Coast fever  ap. 80-86.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aChemotherapy of East Coast fever, a lymphoproliferative cancer-like disease of cattle causing significant economic losses in Africa, is largely dependent on the use of buparvaquone, a drug that was developed in the late 1980's. The disease is caused by the tick-borne protozoan pathogen Theileria parva. Buparvaquone can be used prophylactically and it is also active against tropical theileriosis, caused by the related parasite Theileria annulata. Recently, drug resistance was reported in T. annulata, and could occur in T. parva. Using a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay we screened 796 open source compounds from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to discover novel chemicals with potential inhibitory activity to T. parva. We identified nine malaria box compounds and eight pathogen box compounds that inhibited the proliferation of F100TpM, a T. parva infected lymphocyte cell line. However, only two compounds, MMV008212 and MMV688372 represent promising leads with IC(50) values of 0.78 and 0.61 μM, respectively, and CC(50) values > 5 μM. The remaining compounds exhibited a high degree of toxicity (CC(50) values < 1.09 μM) on the proliferation of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with concanavalin A. We also tested the anti-cancer drug, dasatinib, used in the chemotherapy of some leukemias. Dasatinib was as active and safe as buparvaquone in vitro, with an IC(50) of 5 and 4.2 nM, respectively, and CC(50) > 10 μM. Our preliminary data suggest that it may be possible to repurpose compounds from the cancer field as well as MMV as novel anti-T. parva molecules.  aPublisher supplied data  cBMGF  cDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom  cUSAID  cUnited States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service, USA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProtozoa 3aTheileria annulata 3aTheileria parva 3aantineoplastic agents 3abuparvaquone 3acattle 3acell lines 3aconcanavalin A 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3amalaria 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apathogens 3atheileriosis 3atoxicity 3aAfrica1 aAwino ,  Elias1 aTijhaar ,  Edwin1 aSvitek , Nicholas1 aPelle , Roger1 aNene, Vishvanath,0 tInternational Journal for Parasitology: Drugs and Drug Resistance.g2019 Apr., v. 9 p.80-86dElsevier BVwJournal:23219x2211-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04203naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245016500162300001600327500001500343520251500358592002802873650001902901650000902920650002102929650002402950650002902974650001203003650002603015650001703041650002003058650001203078650001203090650001903102650001603121650001903137650002103156650002603177650001003203650001703213650001803230653001103248700001803259700001703277700001703294700002003311700001703331700001803348700001803366700001703384700001703401700001503418773009003433856008103523852000903604655001203613IND4467906520221120205517.0141111e20120227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446790652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2011.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Afeng10aEffects of biochar amendment on soil quality, crop yield and greenhouse gas emission in a Chinese rice paddy: A field study of 2 consecutive rice growing cycles  ap. 153-160.  a2019-12-05  aBiochar production and application from crop straw had been proposed as one effective countermeasure to mitigate climate change. We conducted a 2-year consecutive field experiment in 2009 and 2010 in rice paddy to gain insight into the consistency over years of biochar effects on rice production and greenhouse gases emissions. Biochar was amended in 2009 before rice transplanting at rates of 0, 10, 20 and 40thaâ»Â¹, soil emissions of carbon dioxide (COâ), methane (CHâ) and nitrous oxide (NâO) were monitored with closed chamber method at 7 days interval throughout the whole rice growing season (WRGS) both in 2009 and 2010. The results showed that biochar amendment increased rice productivity, soil pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen but decreased soil bulk density in both cycles of rice growth. Soil respiration observed no significant difference between biochar amendment and the corresponding control both in the first and second cycle, respectively. However, biochar amendment decreased nitrous oxide emission but increased methane emission in both cycles. No significant difference in carbon intensity of rice production (GHGI) and global warming potential (GWP) were observed between the biochar amendment at the rate of 10thaâ»Â¹ and 40thaâ»Â¹ and control though the GWP and GHGI was increased by 39% and 26% at the rate of 20thaâ»Â¹ respectively, in the first cycle. However, in the second cycle, both of overall GWP and GHGI were observed significantly decreased under biochar amendment as compared to control, ranging from 7.1% to 18.7% and from 12.4% to 34.8%, respectively. The biochar effect intensity on global warming potential were observed from â2.5% to 39.2% in the first cycle, and from â18.7% to â7.1% in the second cycle. However, the biochar effect intensity on C intensity of rice production was observed from â10.2% to 25.8% in the first cycle, and from â36.9% to â18.6% in the second cycle. Therefore, biochar effect on reducing the overall C intensity of rice production could become stronger in the subsequent cycles than that in the first cycle though a consistently strong effect on reducing NâO emission in a single crop cycle after biochar amendment. Nevertheless, these effects were not found in proportional to biochar amendment rates and a high rice yield but lowest C intensity was achieved under biochar amendment at 10thaâ»Â¹ in both cycles of the rice paddy in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3arice 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3asoil pH 3agreenhouse production 3asoil quality 3asoil amendments 3amethane 3abiochar 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3asoil respiration 3afield experimentation 3astraw 3asoil density 3anitrous oxide 0acarbon1 aBian, Rongjun1 aPan, Genxing1 aCui, Liqiang1 aHussain, Qaiser1 aLi, Lianqing1 aZheng, Jinwei1 aZheng, Jufeng1 aZhang, Xuhui1 aHan, Xiaojun1 aYu, Xinyan0 tField crops research.g2012 Feb. 27, v. 127 p.153-160dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012500164300001600289500002000305520145700325592002801782650003201810650002001842650002301862650002601885650000901911650001501920650001501935650001801950650001301968650001401981650001101995700002302006700001902029773011502048856007302163852000902236655001202245IND60548389920221119214856.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054838992DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.132102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatif‐Eugenín, F.10aEvaluation of different conditions and culture media for the recovery of Aeromonas spp. from water and shellfish samples  ap. 883-891.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To perform a comparative study for determining the optimum culture method (direct plating or enrichment) and medium (ampicillin dextrin agar (ADA), starch ampicillin agar (SAA), bile salts irgasan brilliant green modified (BIBG‐m)) for recovering Aeromonas species from water and shellfish samples. METHODS AND RESULTS: By direct culture, Aeromonas was detected in 65% (13/20) of the water samples and in 54·5% (6/11) of the shellfish samples. However, when a pre‐enrichment step was included, the number of positive water samples increased to 75% (15/20) and the ones of shellfish to 90·1% (10/11). The enriched culture significantly favoured (P < 0·05) the isolation of Aeromonas allosaccharophila from water, Aeromonas salmonicida from shellfish and Aeromonas caviae from both types of samples. The most specific (P < 0·05) culture medium for detecting Aeromonas from water was ADA. However, no differences were observed in the case of shellfish samples (P > 0·05). Isolation of Aeromonas media from water was favoured (P < 0·05) in the ADA medium, while SAA enhanced (P < 0·05) the isolation of Aer. salmonicida from shellfish. CONCLUSIONS: The culture method and medium used influenced the recovery of some Aeromonas species from water and shellfish samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This fact should be considered in future prevalence studies to avoid overestimating the above mentioned Aeromonas species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas allosaccharophila 3aAeromonas media 3aAeromonas punctata 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3aagar 3aampicillin 3abile salts 3aculture media 3adextrins 3ashellfish 3astarch1 aBeaz‐Hidalgo, R.1 aFigueras, M.J.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.883-891dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245015300175300001400328520177300342592002802115650001002143650001902153650001702172650000902189650002002198650002202218650002302240650002002263650001602283650002302299653004202322653007302364653001802437700003102455700002802486700002602514773011402540856008402654852000902738655001202747IND50063392420221120201919.0190403e20130331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006339242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2012.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil Rodriguez, Maria,10aApplication of active heat pulse method with fiber optic temperature sensing for estimation of wetting bulbs and water distribution in drip emitters  ap. 72-78.  aThrough the use of the Distributed Fiber Optic Temperature Measurement (DFOT) method, it is possible to measure the temperature in small intervals (on the order of centimeters) for long distances (on the order of kilometers) with a high temporal frequency and great accuracy. The heat pulse method consists of applying a known amount of heat to the soil and monitoring the temperature evolution, which is primarily dependent on the soil moisture content. The use of both methods, which is called the active heat pulse method with fiber optic temperature sensing (AHFO), allows accurate soil moisture content measurements.In order to experimentally study the wetting patterns, i.e. shape, size, and the water distribution, from a drip irrigation emitter, a soil column of 0.5m of diameter and 0.6m high was built. Inside the column, a fiber optic cable with a stainless steel sheath was placed forming three concentric helixes of diameters 0.2m, 0.4m and 0.6m, leading to a 148 measurement point network. Before, during, and after the irrigation event, heat pulses were performed supplying electrical power of 20W/m to the steel.The soil moisture content was measured with a capacitive sensor in one location at depths of 0.1m, 0.2m, 0.3m and 0.4m during the irrigation. It was also determined by the gravimetric method in several locations and depths before and right after the irrigation.The emitter bulb dimensions and shape evolution was satisfactorily measured during infiltration. Furthermore, some bulb's characteristics difficult to predict (e.g. preferential flow) were detected. The results point out that the AHFO is a useful tool to estimate the wetting pattern of drip irrigation emitters in soil columns and show a high potential for its use in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulbs 3aelectric power 3afiber optics 3aheat 3amicroirrigation 3apreferential flow 3asoil water content 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3awater distribution 0aDistributed temperature sensing (DTS) 0aActive heat pulse method with fiber optic temperature sensing (AHFO) 0aWetting bulbs1 aRodríguez-Sinobas, Leonor1 aBenítez-Buelga, Javier1 aSánchez-Calvo, Raúl0 tAgricultural water management.g2013 Mar. 31, v. 120 p.72-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011400167300001800281520154500299592002801844650003901872650001901911650001601930650002001946650003401966650003302000650003302033650001002066650002602076650001402102650001902116650001202135650001002147650001402157650001002171653000802181653001302189653000902202653000902211653000902220700002002229700002002249700002002269700001602289700002002305773012902325856008302454852000902537655001202546IND60542663820221119230338.0190405e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Sydney14aThe Use of Equine Follicle Stimulating Hormone to Increase Equine Chorionic Gonadotropin in the Pregnant Mare  ap. 1021-1024.  aEquine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG), obtained from pregnant mares, is used for assisted reproductive technologies in laboratory rodents and livestock. The objective of the present study was to use equine follicle-stimulating hormone (eFSH) to increase the incidence of twin pregnancies, through multiple ovulations, and increase eCG. Nineteen light horse–type mares were enrolled in the study. The control group (n = 9) was bred with fresh or cooled semen and given human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the time of breeding. The second group (n = 10) was given 12.5 mg of eFSH intramuscularly twice a day beginning 5–7 days after ovulation. Prostaglandin F2α was administered intramuscularly the second day of eFSH treatment. Treatment with eFSH continued until follicles were >35 mm in diameter, and mares were then given no treatment for 36 hours. The mares were then bred with fresh or cooled semen from the same stallion as the control group and given hCG. Blood samples were taken weekly from day 35 to day 105 after ovulation. Serum concentration of eCG was obtained, and data were analyzed with multivariate analysis using the mixed procedure. Significance was set at P < .05. Data were combined for all mares carrying twins and compared with those carrying singletons. The group of mares carrying twins had higher peak concentrations of eCG and higher values for area under the curve compared with mares carrying singletons (P < .05). These results suggest inducing twins could be a method used to increase eCG production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abreeding season 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3amares 3amultivariate analysis 3aovulation 3aprostaglandins 3arodents 3asemen 3astallions 3atwins 0aeCG 0aPregnant 0aMare 0aeFSH 0aTwin1 aCerny, Katheryn1 aCampos, Juliana1 aTroedsson, Mats1 aBall, Barry1 aSquires, Edward0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.1021-1024dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011300172300001600285520109400301592002801395650001801423650001401441650002301455650001001478650001901488650001901507650001401526650001901540650001101559650003101570650001501601650001601616650001601632653002001648653002501668653001901693653001701712653002401729700001601753700002401769773010001793856008501893852000901978655001201987IND60739127120221123002510.0220207e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073912712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthancheri, Indu10aAnalysis and prediction of nucleation mechanisms in a bi-component powder bed with wettability differentials  ap. 209-218.  aIn this study, the effect of hydrophobic components was analyzed through single drop nucleation experiments on a particle bed.

The data collected from repeating the experiments were then processed using a random forest machine learning model to predict the probability of immersion and solid-spread nucleation. This model was used to indicate the nucleation mechanism of two formulations. The first contains a varying composition of Ibuprofen and Microcrystalline cellulose, and the second consists of varying compositions of Acetaminophen and Microcrystalline cellulose. The model was validated with experiments. At higher percentage composition of Acetaminophen, the model predicted a higher probability of immersion nucleation. At a higher concentration of Ibuprofen, the model predicted a high likelihood of solid-spread nucleation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3acellulose 3aforestry equipment 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aibuprofen 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprediction 3aprobability 3awettability 0aWet granulation 0aNucleation mechanism 0aHydrophobicity 0aBi-component 0aRandom forest model1 aOka, Sarang1 aRamachandran, Rohit0 tPowder technology.g2021 Sept., v. 390 p.209-218dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011900165500001400284520154300298592002801841650001301869650002201882650002201904650001301926650001401939650002701953650001901980650000801999650001602007650001302023700002002036700002502056700001902081700002102100700001602121700002002137700001802157700002002175773012302195856008002318852000902398655001202407IND60718813020221122223224.0201126e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071881302DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy101116672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyun, Do  Yoon10aUtilization of Phytochemical and Molecular Diversity to Develop a Target-Oriented Core Collection in Tea Germplasm  aNAL-light  aTea has received attention due to its phytochemicals. For the direct use of tea germplasm in breeding programs, a core collection that retains the genetic diversity and various phytochemicals in tea is needed. In this study, we evaluated the content of eight phytochemicals over two years and the genetic diversity through 33 SSR (simple sequence repeats) markers for 462 tea accessions (entire collection, ENC) and developed a target-oriented core collection (TOCC). Significant phytochemical variation was observed in the ENC between genotypes and years. The genetic diversity of ENC showed high levels of molecular variability. These results were incorporated into developing TOCCs. The TOCC showed a representation of the ENC, where the mean difference percentage, the variance difference percentage, the variable rate of coefficient of variance percentage, and the coincidence rate of range percentage were 7.88, 39.33, 120.79, and 97.43, respectively. The Shannon’s diversity index (I) and Nei’s gene diversity (H) of TOCC were higher than those of ENC. Furthermore, the accessions in TOCC were shown to be selected proportionally, thus accurately reflecting the distribution of the overall accessions for each phytochemical. This is the first report describing the development of a TOCC retaining the diversity of phytochemicals in tea germplasm. This TOCC will facilitate the identification of the genetic determinants of trait variability and the effective utilization of phytochemical diversity in crop improvement programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abreeding programs 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphytochemicals 3atea 3avariability 3avariance1 aGi, Gwang-Yeon 1 aSebastin, Raveendar 1 aCho, Gyu-Taek 1 aKim, Seong-Hoon 1 aYoo, Eunae 1 aLee, Sookyeong 1 aSon, Dong-Mo 1 aLee, Kyung  Jun0 tAgronomy.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy101116673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245012200162300001800284520088600302592002801188650002301216650001001239650002601249650001001275650002401285650001501309650002601324650003001350650000901380650001001389650001301399650002201412650001701434700001901451700002001470773010601490856008501596852000901681655001201690IND4486566820221118110443.0150810e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448656682DNAL7 a10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60123-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHAO, Te10aDevelopment of Transgenic Glyphosate-Resistant Rice with G6 Gene Encoding 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase  ap. 1307-1312.  aGlyphosate-resistant crops have been a huge economic success for genetic engineering. The creating of new glyphosate-resistant plants would increase the available choices for planting and lower the price of genetically modified crop seeds. A novel G6 gene from Pseudomonas putida that encoded 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) was previously isolated. The G6 gene was transfected into rice via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic rice obtained was confirmed by PCR, Southern, and Western blots. The lab experiment and field trials further confirmed that the transgenic rice can survive glyphosate spraying at a dose of 8 g Lâ»Â¹. In contrast, conventional rice was killed at a weed control glyphosate spray dose of 1 g Lâ»Â¹. Altogether, the present study showed that the G6 gene works well in rice in vivo for glyphosate-resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aglyphosate 3anitric oxide synthase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aseeds 3aspraying 3atransgenic plants 3aweed control1 aLIN, Chao-yang1 aSHEN, Zhi-cheng0 tAgricultural sciences in China.g2011 Sept., v. 10, no. 9 p.1307-1312dElsevier B.V.x1671-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60123-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013000157520135800287592002801645650002301673650002201696650001901718650001101737650001501748650001601763650001501779651001001794700001601804773011901820856007301939852000902012655001202021IND60653547020221121234158.0190714e20190331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065354702DNAL7 a10.3390/w110406662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Lihua 10aImpacts of Introducing Remote Sensing Soil Moisture in Calibrating a Distributed Hydrological Model for Streamflow Simulation  aWith the increased availability of remote sensing products, more hydrological variables (e.g., soil moisture and evapotranspiration) other than streamflow data are introduced into the calibration procedure of a hydrological model. However, how the incorporation of these hydrological variables influences the calibration results remains unclear. This study aims to analyze the impact of remote sensing soil moisture data in the joint calibration of a distributed hydrological model. The investigation was carried out in Qujiang and Ganjiang catchments in southern China, where the Dem-based Distributed Rainfall-runoff Model (DDRM) was calibrated under different calibration schemes where the streamflow data and the remote sensing soil moisture are assigned to different weights in the objective function. The remote sensing soil moisture data are from the SMAP L3 soil moisture product. The results show that different weights of soil moisture in the objective function can lead to very slight differences in simulation performance of soil moisture and streamflow. Besides, the joint calibration shows no apparent advantages in terms of streamflow simulation over the traditional calibration using streamflow data only. More studies including various remote sensing soil moisture products are necessary to access their effect on the joint calibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic models 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asoil water 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aZeng, Ling 0 tWater.g2019 Mar. 31, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110406663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04220naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245015200190300001600342520182200358592002802180650001502208650001602223650001602239650001002255650001302265650001502278650001402293650001402307650002302321650001202344650002002356650000902376650002802385650002002413650001602433650001302449650001702462650000902479650001202488650003102500650002902531650002602560650001102586650002802597650006802625650004102693650003002734650000902764650003302773650003302806650001402839650003802853650000902891650001702900650006402917650002402981650004703005650002903052650002103081700003103102700002503133700002203158700001803180700002203198700002103220700002503241773008203266856008103348852000903429655001203438IND4449763820221119231822.0141112e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444976382DNAL7 a211676842pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2010.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiotrowska, Katarzyna10aChanges in male reproductive system and mineral metabolism induced by soy isoflavones administered to rats from prenatal life until sexual maturity  ap. 372-379.  aOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the influence of high-dose soy isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) administered from prenatal life to sexual maturity on testosterone and estradiol levels, testicular and epididymal morphology, the number of epididymal spermatozoa, and mineral metabolism in rats. METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats received orally soy isoflavones, daidzein, and genistein at a dose of 200 mg/kg of body weight per day. After separating sucklings from their mothers, male rats received the same dose of isoflavones until reaching the age of sexual maturity, i.e., for 3 mo. RESULTS: In the isoflavone-treated group, statistically significant decreased concentrations of zinc (determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry) in blood serum and increased concentrations in bone were observed. The isoflavones induced changes in the morphology of the seminiferous epithelium of rat testes. However, there were no significant changes in the number of spermatozoa in the epididymis. The levels of estradiol in serum and cauda epididymis homogenates of rats receiving phytoestrogens were significantly higher than in the control group. No differences were observed in testosterone concentrations in the serum of treated and control rats. The testosterone levels in the homogenates of the treated rat testes were significantly lower than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The relatively mild effects of phytoestrogen administration on the morphology of testes and epididymides and the number of epididymal spermatozoa were observed despite the high dose used. The exposure of rats to genistein and daidzein during intrauterine life until sexual maturity influenced the mineral metabolism of the organism by significant decreases of Zn concentration in serum and increased Zn concentration in bones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abones 3adaidzein 3aepididymis 3aestradiol 3agenistein 3amineral metabolism 3amothers 3aplant estrogens 3arats 3aseminiferous epithelium 3asexual maturity 3aspermatozoa 3asuckling 3atestosterone 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aEpididymisxdrug effects 2aEstradiolxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGenisteinxpharmacology 2aGenitalia, Malexanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGonadal Steroid Hormonesxmetabolism 2aIsoflavonesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aPhytoestrogensxpharmacology 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSeminiferous Epitheliumxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aTestisxanatomy & histologyxdrug effects. 2aTestosteronexmetabolism 2aZincxmetabolism1 aBaranowska-Bosiacka, Irena1 aMarchlewicz, Mariola1 aGutowska, Izabela1 aNoceń, Iwona1 aZawiślak, Monika1 aChlubek, Dariusz1 aWiszniewska, Barbara0 tNutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.372-379dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2010.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245014800161300001600309500001900325520164200344592002801986650001702014650001302031650002002044650001002064650002302074650001402097650001402111650001202125651001002137651001602147653002202163653001502185653000802200653001602208653000902224653000902233653001502242653001302257700003102270700002602301773010302327856007202430852000902502655001202511IND60695710120221120151959.0200518e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571012DNAL7 a10.2216/16-115.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Archino, Roberta10aNeither Callophyllis nor Gelidium: Blastophyllis gen. nov. and Zuccarelloa gen. nov. (Kallymeniaceae, Rhodophyta) for three New Zealand species  ap. 549-560.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStudies of New Zealand Kallymeniaceae have revealed a great deal of diversity, providing new perspectives on relationships within the family and necessitating the establishment of new genera. Based on rbcL, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), psbA sequence analyses and morphological observations, we reassessed the phylogenetic relationships of three endemic species from southern New Zealand. A new genus, Blastophyllis, was established to accommodate two distinctive species, currently known as Callophyllis hombroniana and Callophyllis calliblepharoides. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these species were distantly related to Callophyllis sensu stricto, including the generitype Callophyllis variegata from Chile. Blastophyllis had compressed thalli consisting of branches with short side proliferations and protruding cystocarps developed on the lateral proliferations. Zuccarelloa gen. nov. was established to accommodate a peculiar species erroneously referred to the genus Gelidium, as Gelidium ceramoides. Zuccarelloa was different from every other genus in the Kallymeniaceae, having filiform thalli, small roundish cell, resembling rhizines, intermixed with large medullary cells and reproductive structures confined to swollen apical parts, similar to sori in Gelidium. A sister relationship between these two new genera was recovered in the concatenated COI-rbcL analysis and in both COI and rbcL single gene analyses, albeit with only moderate support. This relationship was not recovered in analyses of the less variable psbA dataset, which also failed to resolve some other relationships within the Kallymeniaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallophyllis 3aGelidium 3adata collection 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3athallus 3aChile 3aNew Zealand 0aCalliblepharoides 0aceramoides 0aCOI 0ahombroniana 0apsbA 0arbcL 0aRhodophyta 0aTaxonomy1 aNelson, W.

METHOD AND RESULTS: In this study, soils from tea orchards with continuously cropping histories for 1, 10 and 20 years were collected for investigating rhizosphere bacterial communities using 454 pyrosequencing. The results indicated that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the main phyla in the tea orchard soils and accounted for more than 60% of the bacterial sequences. At the genus level, the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Rhodanobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium and Sphingomonas, significantly decreased in the 20‐year tea orchard soils. Similar patterns of bacterial community structure were observed between 1‐year and 10‐year tea orchards, which significantly differed from those of 20‐year tea orchards. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil organic carbon and pH showed high correlations (positive or negative) with the majority of the taxa. CONCLUSION: Long‐term tea cultivation altered the composition and structure of soil bacterial community, which led to the reduction in the beneficial bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results can provide clues on how to regulate the soil microbial community and maintain the health of soils in tea orchard systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aBradyrhizobium 3aCamellia sinensis 3aMycobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3aRhodanobacter 3aSphingomonas 3abacterial communities 3achronosequences 3acommunity structure 3acontinuous cropping 3aorchard soils 3aorchards 3apH 3arhizosphere 3asequence analysis 3asoil bacteria 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil structure 3atea1 aLi, Z.1 aLi, Z.W.1 aJiang, Y.H.1 aWeng, B.Q.1 aLin, W.X.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2016 Sept., v. 121, no. 3 p.787-799dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.132253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003800117024004100155040001800196100003200214245010400246300001600350506007600366506003100442520161700473592002802090596000902118596000902127506003702136650002702173650001302200650002502213650002902238650001702267650001702284650001302301650001802314650002002332650001902352650001102371650001802382650001902400650001902419650001802438650001402456650001702470650001802487650001702505650001102522700003202533700001302565700002402578700003002602773014402632856008402776961000902860852000902869655001202878IND60731887120221215142339.0220901e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073188712DNAL7 a10113/73188712hdl7 a10.1016/j.ijpddr.2021.02.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.ijpddr.2021.02.0032chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDominguez-Uscanga ,  Astrid10aAnti-protozoal activity of Thymol and a Thymol ester against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture  ap. 126-133.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that infects intestinal epithelial cells causing malabsorption and severe diarrhea. The monoterpene thymol has been reported to have antifungal and antibacterial properties but less is known about the antiparasitic effect of this compound. Terpenes are sometimes unsuitable for therapeutic and food applications because of their instability. Esterification of terpenes eliminates this disadvantage. The present study evaluates the effects of thymol (Th) and a thymol ester, thymol octanoate (TO), against C. parvum infectivity in vitro. The cytotoxicity IC(50) value for TO after 24 h of treatment was 309.6 μg/mL, significantly higher than that of Th (122.5 μg/mL) in a human adenocarcinoma cell line (HCT-8). In the same way, following 48 h of treatment, the cytotoxicity IC(50) value for TO was significantly higher (139 μg/mL) than that of Th (75.5 μg/mL). These results indicate that esterification significantly reduces Th cytotoxicity. Dose-dependent effects were observed for TO and Th when both parasite invasion and parasite growth assays were evaluated. When evaluated for their activity against C. parvum growth cultured in vitro in HCT-8 cells, the anti-cryptosporidial IC(50) values were 35.5 and 7.5 μg/mL, for TO and Th, respectively. Together, these findings indicate that esterified thymol has anti-cryptosporidial effect comparable with its parental compound thymol, but with improved safety margins in mammalian cells and better physicochemical properties that could make it more suitable for diverse applications as an antiparasitic agent.  aPublisher supplied data  cNIFA  cNIFA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aProtozoa 3aantiparasitic agents 3aantiprotozoal properties 3acell culture 3acytotoxicity 3adiarrhea 3adose response 3adrug resistance 3aesterification 3ahumans 3amalabsorption 3amonoterpenoids 3aneoplasm cells 3aoctanoic acid 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apathogenicity 3atherapeutics 3athymol1 aAycart , Danielle Francesca1 aLi, Kun,1 aWitola , William H.1 aAndrade Laborde , Juan E.0 tInternational Journal for Parasitology: Drugs and Drug Resistance.g2021 Apr., v. 15 p.126-133dElsevier BVwJournal:23219x2211-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2021.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245008600177300001800263500000900281520097700290592002801267650001501295650001501310650002601325650001301351650001801364650002001382650001501402650001701417650002101434650001901455700001801474700002501492773015101517856009601668852000901764655001201773IND60668139520221118065346.0191125e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066813952DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300050002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafolie, F.10aAnalysis of Water Flow under Trickle Irrigation: I.

After reviewing available approaches and models for simulating water flow under trickle irrigation, we present a new numerical solution of the governing partial differential equations that improves the prediction of the size of the ponded area at the soil surface. A common formulation could be used for both Cartesian and axicylindrical flow geometries. The spatial operator was approximated using finite differences, and time integration was performed with an implicit method. Nonlinearity was treated by means of a fixed point iterative algorithm. The proposed model is applicable to saturated-unsaturated flow in layered soils having anisotropic hydraulic properties. Accuracy and stability of the solution are checked and comparisons made with previous numerical solutions for several trickle irrigation and other unsaturated flow problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanisotropy 3adifferential equation 3ageometry 3alayered soils 3amicroirrigation 3aprediction 3asurface area 3aunsaturated flow 3awater analysis1 aGuennelon, R.1 avan Genuchten, M.Th.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1989 Sept., v. 53, no. 5 p.1310-1318dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300050002x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002700168245008700195300001700282520199700299592002802296650001802324650001602342650001602358650001702374650001702391650001202408650002002420650001402440650001302454650001502467650001402482650002202496650004502518650001802563650002502581650002702606650003302633650002502666650001202691650002002703650002502723650002002748650001402768650003402782650002702816653002102843653001502864653001702879700001902896700002102915700002702936773013102963856008403094852000903178655001203187IND60082844920221117190729.0190411e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008284492DNAL7 a237921542pmid7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2013.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMennes, Constantijn B.10aNew insights in the long-debated evolutionary history of Triuridaceae (Pandanales)  ap. 994-1004.  aThe mycoheterotrophic plant family Triuridaceae (Pandanales) is hypothesized to be an old family, mainly based on its pantropical distribution. The existence of fossils from the Upper Cretaceous, assigned to Triuridaceae may form additional support for a great age of the family, although the affinity of these fossils to Triuridaceae is questioned. Although the circumscription of Triuridaceae has never been problematic, probably due to its distinct morphological characters, its systematic relationship has been under debate since the family was described around 1840. The lack of synapomorphies suitable for resolving higher taxonomic relationships is a function of the family’s reduced vegetative growth and the highly modified floral structures. Molecular studies have assigned Triuridaceae to Pandanales, but its exact phylogenetic position remains unknown. In the present study the phylogeny of the Pandanales was reconstructed using four molecular markers and the divergence age estimates were obtained with a relaxed molecular clock method. We found that Triuridaceae are monophyletic and most likely descent form the second major split in Pandanales. The relationships between the other Pandanales families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae, Stemonaceae and Velloziaceae) are otherwise in accordance with earlier studies. Velloziaceae are sister to the rest of the Pandanales, Stemonaceae are most likely sister to a clade consisting of Pandanaceae and Cyclanthaceae, and the latter two families are sister to each other. All currently recognized tribes within Triuridaceae are also monophyletic at current taxon sampling. We estimate that the family has a Cretaceous (or Lower Paleocene) stem age, which is in accordance with earlier predictions. This old age, along with elevated mutation rates indicated by long branch lengths and the family’s mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, might account for the substantial morphological differences between Triuridaceae and its closest relatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclanthaceae 3aPandanaceae 3aStemonaceae 3aTriuridaceae 3aVelloziaceae 3afossils 3agenetic markers 3amonophyly 3amutation 3aprediction 3asymbiosis 3avegetative growth 2aMagnoliopsidaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBayes Theorem 2aBiological Evolution 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFossils 2aGenetic Markers 2aLikelihood Functions 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aMycoheterotrophy 0aPandanales 0aTriuridaceae1 aSmets, Erik F.1 aMoses, Sainge N.1 aMerckx, Vincent S.F.T.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2013 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.994-1004dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2013.05.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04487naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245007000169300001600239520326200255592002803517650000803545650001103553650000903564650001603573650002203589650003003611650001203641650001903653650001303672650001403685650002603699650002303725650001103748650001703759650001103776650001403787650001203801650001103813651001003824700001903834773012203853856004503975852000904020655001204029IND50063076120221120222440.0130324e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006307612DNAL7 a10.1065/lca2006.05.2442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Shinichiro10aHybrid LCC of Appliances with Different Energy Efficiency (10 pp)  ap. 305-314.  aGOAL, SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: This paper is concerned with a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) by the use of the waste input-output (WIO) quantity- and price model of air conditioners with different energy efficiency at the use phase (high-end, low-end and average models) that were available in Japan as of winter 2002. The functional unit is an air conditioner of the 2.5kW type that is used for 10 years, and then subjected to an end-of-life (EoL) process that is consistent with the Japanese law on the recycling of appliances. METHODS: This is the first simultaneous application of the WIO methodology to an LCA and LCC over the entire life-cycle of a product including the use phase, and represents a methodological extension (in the sense of considering the use phase) and integration (in the sense of a simultaneous application) of previous studies by us (Kondo and Nakamura, Int. J. LCA, 2004, Nakamura and Kondo, Ecol. Econ., 2005, in press). The main body of data is provided by the WIO table for the year 2000, an update of the previous table for 1995 that was used in the above WIO studies. Compared with the WIO table for 1995 that consisted of only about 80 industry sectors, the current one consists of about 400 industry sectors, and includes air conditioner as a separate sector. The data on the purchase price and efficiency of air conditioners indicate wide variations: the cheapest one (the low-end model) costs half of the most expensive one (the high-end model), but its efficiency is about half of the latter. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: When the cost in the use and EoL phases is included, the low-end model becomes the most expensive one, and the high-end model with the highest purchase cost the least expensive. This reversal of the relative cost levels is attributed to the difference in the efficiency in the use phase. A sensitivity analysis indicates that a reduction of the electricity price in the use phase by about 40% does not alter the significant superiority of the high-end model over the low-end model. In spite of the largest amount of input in the production phase, the high-end model performs the best in terms of both global warming potential (GWP) and landfill, while the low-end model performs the worst. The use phase generates the largest amount of waste for landfill across the three models, the largest component of which is flyash generated from coal firing power plants. A possible internalization of externality in the form of carbon tax was found to work in favor of the high-end model. The cost advantage of the high-end model, however, is sensitive to the rate of discounting of future costs: discounting at 15% diminishes its advantage over the low-end model. RECOMMENDATION AND PERSPECTIVE: The results indicate the effectiveness of the pricing based on the life cycle cost for achieving sustainability, that is, for promoting the shift of the demand away from appliances with low environmental performance to the one with higher environmental performance. Acceptance by society of pricing based on life cycle costing would require, among other things, an economy-wide standardization of the LCC concept (in a manner analogous to ISO-LCA) that can be used complementary to ISO-LCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acoal 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental performance 3afly ash 3aglobal warming 3aindustry 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3alife cycle costing 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprices 3arecycling 3asociety 3awastes 3aJapan1 aKondo, Yasushi0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2006 Sept., v. 11, no. 5 p.305-314dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1065/lca2006.05.244  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009100160520150600251592002801757650002101785650002001806650001301826650002201839650001901861650001301880650001001893650001801903650001701921651001401938700002101952700002001973700002101993700002102014773011902035856007302154852000902227655001202236IND60653547520221121234150.0190714e20190331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065354752DNAL7 a10.3390/w110406702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlazzeh, Shatha 10aImpacts of Intermittent Water Supply on Water Quality in Two Palestinian Refugee Camps  aWe investigated the quality of treated drinking water in Aida Camp and Alazzah Camp, two Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank. Water supply in the two camps is intermittent: Water deliveries are first stored in a centrally located community tank before being pumped through distribution networks to users, who then store the water in rooftop tanks. Between March 2016 and June 2017, we examined water quality within the distribution system in the camps, testing 520 samples in Aida Camp and 198 samples in Alazzah Camp for total coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, and residual chlorine. We observed deterioration in water quality in both camps, but the deterioration was more pronounced in Aida Camp where 2.5% of community-tank samples, 5.0% of network samples, and 10% of rooftop-tank samples contained one or more colonies (per 100 mL) of total coliform bacteria. In Alazzah Camp, 3.7% of community-tank samples, 2.5% of network samples, and 5% rooftop-tank samples contained one or more colonies (per 100 mL) of total coliform bacteria. E. coli was detected in two samples from Aida Camp and one sample from Alazzah Camp. In both camps, average residual chlorine concentrations were higher in the community tanks than in rooftop tanks. The main factor influencing water quality deterioration in rooftop tanks in Aida Camp appears to be air temperature. We recommend more systematic water testing in the camps and greater transparency in reporting test results to camp residents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aair temperature 3achlorine 3acoliform bacteria 3adrinking water 3arefugees 3atanks 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aWest Bank1 aGalaitsi, S.

At a global scale, the Convention on Biological Diversity targeted at halting the decline of biodiversity by the end of 2010. Agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been developed at the national level to reach this biodiversity target in agricultural areas. We evaluated the effectiveness of Austrian agro-environmental schemes on species-rich grasslands within the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Wienerwald. We found a general decrease of vascular plant species richness at 95 sites, from an average of 43 species in 1990/92 to 31 species in 2011. The average decrease of species classified as threatened according to the national Red List from 12 to 7 and the parallel increase of widespread, nitrophilous species indicates a reduced conservation value of observed meadows. Species losses did not differ between mesic meadows of the Arrhenatherion type (EU habitat type 6510) and more nutrient-poor, semi-dry Brometalia grasslands (EU habitat type 6210), indicating the sensitivity to changes in agricultural management regimes even for more intensively used grassland types. AES decelerated this overall trend but could not stop biodiversity losses over the past two decades. Although the maintenance of grassland management through AES prevented biodiversity loss in areas which otherwise would have been abandoned, adaptations of the Austrian AES are desirable to effectively conserve biodiversity at agricultural sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3aagri-environmental policy 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural management 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3aintensive farming 3ameadows 3arange management 3aspecies diversity 3aAustria 3aCentral European region 0aAgri-environmental scheme 0aAustria 0aBiosphere reserve 0aEllenberg indicator value 0aPlant species diversity 0aGrassland management 0aSpecies loss1 aMoser, Dietmar1 aSauberer, Norbert1 aMaas, Bea1 aStaudinger, Markus1 aGrass, Viktoria1 aWrbka, Thomas1 aWillner, Wolfgang0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 June 01, v. 243 p.10-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245012500210300001600335506007600351520188000427592002802307506003702335650003102372650001902403650003302422650002602455650001502481650001902496650001502515650001202530650001902542650001602561650002002577650001202597650001002609650001802619650002002637650001902657650002402676650001502700650001502715650002502730650002702755650001502782650002202797653002302819653002402842653000902866653000902875653002502884653003002909700001802939700001902957773012602976856008203102852000903184655001203193IND60554811920221207130455.0180905s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055481192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2015.02.0012doi7 aPMC43484312pmcid7 a257507022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasheed, Suraiya10aPossible Biomarkers for the Early Detection of HIV-associated Heart Diseases: A Proteomics and Bioinformatics Prediction  ap. 145-152.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe frequency of cardiovascular disorders is increasing in HIV-infected individuals despite a significant reduction in the viral load by antiretroviral therapies (ART). Since the CD4⁺ T-cells are responsible for the viral load as well as immunological responses, we hypothesized that chronic HIV-infection of T-cells produces novel proteins/enzymes that cause cardiac dysfunctions. To identify specific factors that might cause cardiac disorders without the influence of numerous cofactors produced by other pathogenic microorganisms that co-inhabit most HIV-infected individuals, we analyzed genome-wide proteomes of a CD4⁺ T-cell line at different stages of HIV replication and cell growth over >6months. Subtractive analyses of several hundred differentially regulated proteins from HIV-infected and uninfected counterpart cells and comparisons with proteins expressed from the same cells after treating with the antiviral drug Zidovudine/AZT and inhibiting virus replication, identified a well-coordinated network of 12 soluble/diffusible proteins in HIV-infected cells. Functional categorization, bioinformatics and statistical analyses of each protein predicted that the expression of cardiac-specific Ca²⁺ kinase together with multiple Ca²⁺ release channels causes a sustained overload of Ca²⁺ in the heart which induces fetal/cardiac myosin heavy chains (MYH6 and MYH7) and a myosin light-chain kinase. Each of these proteins has been shown to cause cardiac stress, arrhythmia, hypertrophic signaling, cardiomyopathy and heart failure (p=8×10⁻¹¹). Translational studies using the newly discovered proteins produced by HIV infection alone would provide additional biomarkers that could be added to the conventional markers for an early diagnosis and/or development of specific therapeutic interventions for heart diseases in HIV-infected individuals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantiretroviral agents 3aarrhythmia 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3acalcium 3acardiomyopathy 3acell growth 3aearly diagnosis 3aenzymes 3aheart 3aheart failure 3aimmune response 3amicroorganisms 3amyosin heavy chains 3aprediction 3aproteomics 3astatistical analysis 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviral load 3avirus replication 0aHIV-cardiomyopathy 0aRyanodine-receptors 0aITPR 0aPI3K 0aFetal-cardiac myosin 0aMyosin light-chain kinase1 aHashim, Rahim1 aYan, Jasper S.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2015, v. 13 p.145-152dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2015.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010700173300001700280520156700297592002801864650001801892650001501910650001101925650002101936650002301957650001201980650002301992650001402015650001802029653002302047653002102070653002602091653003302117700002302150700001802173700002102191700001702212773012802229856008302357852000902440655001202449IND60542664320221121071024.0190405e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenugopal, Changaram10aComparison of Insulin-Induced Digital Vessel Ring Responses of Laminitic and Clinically Healthy Horses  ap. 998-1002.  aHyperinsulinemia leads to insulin resistance of blood vessels and interferes with circulation of laminae of the equine foot. The objective of the study was to compare the digital vessel responses of clinically healthy and laminitic horses with and without experimental induction of insulin resistance. Vessel segments (artery and vein) collected after euthanasia were cut into 3-mm wide rings and were prepared in tissue baths containing Tyrode solution for response studies. Two rings of each vessel type from each horse were used as nonresistant, and two were made insulin resistant. Insulin resistance was induced by incubating the rings with 10-μM bath concentration of insulin. Then, all rings were contracted with phenylephrine (5 μM). When the contraction reached a plateau, insulin (10 μM) was added, and the response monitored for 30 minutes. The response to insulin was calculated as a percentage of the phenylephrine response. The results showed that the responses of the nonresistant rings differed significantly between the groups. However, when all rings were made insulin resistant, the significance between the groups disappeared. In the laminitic group, responses of resistant and nonresistant rings did not differ, whereas in the healthy group, the vessel responses differed significantly. In all experiments, arterial and venous rings followed the same pattern, but the magnitudes were greater in arterial rings. The findings suggest that the vessel responses to insulin are altered in laminitis which could be due to insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood vessels 3aeuthanasia 3ahorses 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainduced resistance 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alaminitis 3aphenylephrine 0aInsulin resistance 0aEquine laminitis 0aEquine digital vessel 0aVascular responses in vitro1 aHolmes, Earnestine1 aBeadle, Ralph1 aKearney, Michael1 aEades, Susan0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Aug., v. 34, no. 8 p.998-1002dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010200158300001600260500001900276520187300295592002802168650002102196650001502217650001602232650001702248650001602265650002302281650001702304650001502321650001502336650002002351650001802371650001902389650001302408650000902421650001702430650002002447650001602467650002602483651001802509653001902527653001702546653001902563653001702582700002202599700002502621700001802646700001702664773010202681856007202783852000902855655001202864IND60695710620221120203053.0200518e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571062DNAL7 a10.2216/16-122.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, Karin10aHyposaline conditions affect UV susceptibility in the Arctic kelp Alaria esculenta (Phaeophyceae)  ap. 675-685.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe kelp Alaria esculenta represents a key species in high Arctic marine fjord ecosystems. However, the European Arctic is currently experiencing extensive environmental change. Glacial fjord systems, such as Kongsfjorden (Spitsbergen, Svalbard), are subjected to rising temperature, increased freshwater inflow from glaciers and melting snow and a changing ultraviolet (UV) radiation regime related to stratospheric ozone depletion. Thus, in addition to natural seasonality, sessile organisms require acclimation in order to adapt to an environment in transition. We examined the physiological and ultrastructural responses of A. esculenta to the combined exposure to hyposalinity and UV radiation. Photosynthetic quantum yield slightly decreased during a low-salinity treatment of 7 d. Exposure to UV radiation also lowered quantum yield, but specimens previously treated with hyposalinity were significantly less susceptible to UV than nontreated individuals. Concomitant with a loss of chlorophyll during the hyposaline treatment, phlorotannin and antioxidant contents were maintained, and samples treated with low salinities exhibited higher UV-screening characteristics as demonstrated by significantly higher absorption ratios at 300/680 nm. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a treatment-dependent swelling of cell walls and accumulations of phlorotannin-containing vesicles. Our findings point to a strategy by which kelps apply a fast and cost-efficient redistribution of phlorotannins rather than increased synthesis as a general stress response to different environmental drivers in contrast to stress-specific responses. The notion that acclimation to one stressor (low salinity) reflects increased tolerance towards a second stressor (UV radiation) supports the concept of ‘cross-acclimation’ as established for higher plants but not yet for seaweeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlaria esculenta 3aabsorption 3aacclimation 3aantioxidants 3achlorophyll 3acost effectiveness 3afjord inlets 3afreshwater 3amacroalgae 3aozone depletion 3aphlorotannins 3aphotosynthesis 3asalinity 3asnow 3astratosphere 3astress response 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3aArctic region 0aClimate change 0aHyposalinity 0aUltrastructure 0aUV radiation1 aLütz, Cornelius,1 aLütz-Meindl, Ursula1 aWendt, Angela1 aBischof, Kai0 tPhycologia.g2017 Nov. 1, v. 56, no. 6 p.675-685dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/16-122.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245014700160300001600307500001900323520196800342592002802310650001702338650001602355650001202371650001602383650001702399650002002416650004002436650001102476650002502487650002602512653001502538653001502553653001602568653002802584653002402612653001502636653002502651653002302676700002402699700002102723773010302744856007202847852000902919655001202928IND60695710720221120213612.0200518e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571072DNAL7 a10.2216/16-124.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, Nelso P.10aMycosporine-like amino acids vs carrageenan yield in Mazzaella laminarioides (Gigartinales; Rhodophyta) under high and low UV solar irradiance  ap. 570-578.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of increased solar photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on biomass, mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) content, and carrageenan yield were studied for 14 days in tank-cultivated tetrasporophytes and gametophytes of Mazzaella laminarioides from the Magellan Strait. The initial values of carrageenan yield were similar between gametophytes and tetrasporophytes, whereas the MAA content was higher in gametophytes than that in tetrasporophytes. After 14 days of exposure to different combinations of solar radiation (PAR, PAR + UV-A, and PAR + UV-A + UV-B) and two irradiance levels (high and low), differences between gametophytes and tetrasporophytes of M. laminarioides in growth rate (GR), MAA, and carrageenan yield were observed. Higher GRs were observed in gametophytes than in tetrasporophytes under all radiation and irradiance treatments. A significant decrease in total MAA content was observed in both reproductive phases, with these decreases being more evident in gametophytes under all radiation and irradiance treatments (20 to 30% decrease compared with the initial value). Changes in the proportion of each MAA were also observed. The asterina-330 and palythine content decreased in gametophytes in all radiation and irradiance treatments, whereas tetrasporophytes exhibited an increase of these MAAs, mainly under PAR + UV-A at low irradiance. The carrageenan yield decreased in tetrasporophytes in all radiation treatments, whereas gametophytes exhibited an increase in this parameter under UV radiation at high irradiance. These results suggest that both reproductive phases have different strategies to cope with light stress, mainly under high UVR. Furthermore, both reproductive phases are adapted to high solar radiation, and the differences between gametophytes and tetrasporophytes could result from the vertical distribution on shore and from intrinsic differences related to ploidy level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGigartinales 3aamino acids 3abiomass 3acarrageenan 3agametophytes 3alight intensity 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aploidy 3aspatial distribution 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCarragenan 0aIrradiance 0aMAA content 0aMazzaella laminarioides 0aReproductive phases 0aRhodophyta 0aSub-Antarctic region 0aUV solar radiation1 aFigueroa, Félix L.1 aKorbee, Nathalie0 tPhycologia.g2017 Sept. 1, v. 56, no. 5 p.570-578dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/16-124.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010400168300001400272500001100286520120400297592002801501650001401529650001901543650001501562650001901577650001101596650001601607650000901623700002201632773013501654856008201789852000901871655001201880IND60644604920221117235001.0190517e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460492DNAL7 a10.1007/s40641-019-00126-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuijens, Louise10aBoundary Layer Clouds and Convection over Subtropical Oceans in our Current and in a Warmer Climate  ap. 80-94.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review our understanding of mechanisms underlying the response of (sub)tropical clouds to global warming, highlight mechanisms that challenge our understanding, and discuss simulation strategies that tackle them. RECENT FINDINGS: Turbulence-resolving models and emergent constraints provide probable evidence, supported by theoretical understanding, that the cooling cloud radiative effect (CRE) of low clouds weakens with warming: a positive low-cloud feedback. Nevertheless, an uncertainty in the feedback remains. Climate models may not adequately represent changing SST and circulation patterns, which determine future cloud-controlling factors and how these couple to clouds. Furthermore, we do not understand what mesoscale organization implies for the CRE, and how moisture-radiation interactions, horizontal advection, and the profile of wind regulate low cloud, in our current and in our warmer climate. Clouds in nature are more complex than the idealized cloud types that have informed our understanding of the cloud feedback. Remaining major uncertainties are the coupling of clouds to large-scale circulations and to the ocean, and mesoscale aggregation of clouds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aclimate models 3aconvection 3aglobal warming 3aoceans 3auncertainty 3awind1 aSiebesma, A.

Nodularin, a potent hepatotoxin, has been previously observed to accumulate on different trophic levels, in zooplankton, mysid shrimps, fish as well as benthic organisms, even in waterfowl. While the largest concentrations of nodularin have been measured from the benthic organisms and the food web originating from them, the concentrations in the pelagic organisms are not negligible. The observations on concentrations in zooplankton and planktivorous fish are sporadic, however. A field study in the Gulf of Finland, northern Baltic Sea, was conducted during cyanobacterial bloom season where zooplankton (copepod Eurytemora affinis, cladoceran Pleopsis polyphemoides) and fish (herring, sprat, three-spined stickleback) samples for toxin analyses were collected from the same sampling areas, concurrently with phytoplankton community samples. N. spumigena was most abundant in the eastern Gulf of Finland. In this same sampling area, cladoceran P. polyphemoides contained more nodularin than in the other areas, suggesting that this species has a low capacity to avoid cyanobacterial exposure when the abundance of cyanobacterial filaments is high. In copepod E. affinis nodularin concentrations were high in all of the sampling areas, irrespective of the N. spumigena cell numbers. Furthermore, nodularin concentrations in herring samples were highest in the eastern Gulf of Finland. Three-spined stickleback contained the highest concentrations of nodularin of all the three fish species included in this study, probably because it prefers upper water layers where also the risk of nodularin accumulation in zooplankton is the highest. No linear relationship was found between N. spumigena abundance and nodularin concentration in zooplankton and fish, but in the eastern area where the most dense surface-floating bloom was observed, the nodularin concentrations in zooplankton were high. The maximum concentrations in zooplankton and fish samples in this study were higher than measured before, suggesting that the temporal variation of nodularin concentrations in pelagic communities can be large, and vary from negligible to potentially harmful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aEurytemora affinis 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aMalacostraca 3aNodularia spumigena 3abenthic organisms 3aherring 3anodularin 3aphytoplankton 3aplanktivores 3arisk 3ashrimp 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atoxicity 3atrophic levels 3awaterfowl 3azooplankton 3aGulf of Finland1 aPääkkönen, Jari-Pekka,1 aPeltonen, Heikki1 aSipiä, Vesa1 aValtonen, Terhi1 aViitasalo, Markku0 tMarine biology.g2008 Oct., v. 155, no. 5 p.483-491dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-008-1046-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014800158300001800306500002000324520139400344592002801738650001601766650002401782650001401806650001601820650002101836650001201857650001301869650002601882650001601908650001501924650002401939650002001963650001101983650001001994650002402004650001502028650001102043650001902054650001602073650002302089650003102112700005102143700001702194700001602211700001402227773015002241856007302391852000902464655001202473IND60600038920221121131532.0180702e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060003892DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kaixiong12aA full‐scale thermophilic biofilter in the treatment of sludge drying exhaust: performance, microbial characteristics and bioaerosol emission  ap. 2216-2225.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), NH₃, and SO₂ generated from a sludge drying process were treated by a full‐scale thermophilic biofilter (FTB). The correlation between gaseous pollutants removal and the microbial community structure in the FTB was studied. Bioaerosols emission from the FTB was also investigated. RESULTS: More than 90% of VOCs, NH₃, and SO₂ were removed at steady state. The maximum elimination capacities of VOCs, NH₃, and SO₂ were 3.01, 1.83, and 5.13 g m‐³ h‐¹, respectively. Analysis of clone libraries indicated that the structure of the bacterial communities showed temporal variation. Species that have the abilities of desulfuring and denitrifying, e.g. Alcaligenes sp., Comamonas sp., Sphingobacterium sp., and Bacillus sp., were abundant in the FTB. High bioaerosols concentration of nearly 2.3 × 10³ CFU m‐³ was detected in the FTB outlet. Most of the bacteria in bioaerosols were assigned to Pseudomonas sp., which were the main bacteria attached to the surface of packing materials. CONCLUSION: The FTB was highly efficient and showed potential for the removal of real complex gases at high temperature. The composition of the inlet stream influenced the species and abundance of microorganisms in the FTB. Control of bioaerosols emission should be taken into account in the future. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcaligenes 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aComamonas 3aPseudomonas 3aSphingobacterium 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abioaerosols 3abiofilters 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3adrying 3agases 3apackaging materials 3apollutants 3asludge 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLi, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5205-02591 aDing, Wenjie1 aLiu, Junxin1 aXue, Song0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 93, no. 8 p.2216-2225dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03984naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245013800175506011700313506007600430520186800506592002802374506003702402650002202439650001302461650001802474650002302492650002202515650002502537650001302562650001802575650002002593650001402613650001502627650001802642650001802660650002002678650001202698650001802710650001102728650001802739650002102757650001802778650002002796650002602816650002202842650001602864650000902880650001102889653001802900653001502918653002202933653002102955653001702976700002902993700002903022700002603051700002503077773012703102856008403229852000903313655001203322IND60770198020221207082948.0220914e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbduh, Muhammad Yusuf10aEffects of aeration rate and feed on growth, productivity and nutrient composition of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.) larvae  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBlack soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens L.) are widely cultivated as bioconversion agents. These larvae are known to be highly sensitive to changes in the external environment, such as temperature and relative humidity. Therefore, a rearing hive equipped with an instrumentation system known as the Modular Fly Hive was designed to cultivate black soldier larvae. This study aimed to determine the effects of aeration rate (0 – 0.84 m³/s.) and feed type (coconut endosperm waste and soybean curd) on growth and productivity of black soldier fly cultivated in Modular Fly Hives as well as well as feed digestibility and nutrient composition of the larval biomass. Increasing aeration rate decreased the average temperature and relative humidity within the hives. The results showed that the larvae demonstrated a sigmoidal growth curve for all types of feed and the type of feed significantly affects the average wet weight and length of the larvae. The greatest dry biomass productivity (52.85 ± 3.85 g/m²/day) was observed when the larvae were cultivated using soybean curd residue with an aeration rate of 0.84 m³/s, while the lowest dry biomass productivity (35.27 ± 9.72 g/m²/day) was observed when the larvae were cultivated using coconut endosperm waste without aeration. Proximate analysis revealed that the larval biomass had total protein, lipid, ash and carbohydrate content in the range of 37.20 – 48.60%, 9.61 – 20.02%, 4.80 – 6.40%, 33.86 – 38.70%, respectively. Amino acid in the biomass were dominated by glutamic acid (11.11–12.30%), aspartic acid (8.25 – 10.35%), leucine (8.09 – 8.57%), and lysine (6.74 – 8.14%). Lipid isolated from the larval biomass were mainly composed of lauric acid (28.35–61.68%), linoleic acid (6.27 – 30.29%), palmitic acid (7.62 – 15.23%), and myristic acid (5.05 – 14.34%).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHermetia illucens 3aaeration 3aaspartic acid 3abiomass production 3abiotransformation 3acarbohydrate content 3acoconuts 3adigestibility 3adodecanoic acid 3aendosperm 3aentomology 3aglutamic acid 3agrowth curves 3ainstrumentation 3aleucine 3alinoleic acid 3alysine 3amyristic acid 3anutrient content 3apalmitic acid 3aprotein content 3aproximate composition 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3atofu 3awastes 0aAeration rate 0aAmino acid 0aHermetia illucens 0aModular Fly Hive 0aProductivity1 aPerdana, Marcelino Putra1 aBara, Muhammad Arifuddin1 aAnggraeni, Lela Wahyu1 aPutra, Ramadhani Eka0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.101902-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2022.1019023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01623naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245007900189300001600268520064300284592002800927653001500955653001300970653001400983653001500997653001501012653001501027700002001042773013501062856011501197852000901312655001201321IND60128489920221117184348.0151115e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012848992DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567(2007)80[223:NHAFNW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Joseph S.10aNew Host Associations for New World Spider Wasps (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae)  ap. 223-228.  aA new host association is made for the Neotropical spider wasp Priochilus gloriosum gloriosum Cresson, which also represents the first host association for this genus.

In test emulsions consisting of hydrogenated soy oil (HSO) in liquid canola oil (CO) and a dispersed aqueous phase representing up to 20wt% of the emulsion, use of glycerol monooleate (GMO) promoted oil-water interfacial crystallization whereas polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) resulted in HSO crystallization in the continuous phase only. By removing the confounding effects of droplet size and solid fat content, GMO-covered emulsion droplets were shown to behave as active fillers as they interacted with the surrounding fat crystal matrix and increased emulsion rigidity. By contrast, the PGPR-stabilized droplets only weakly associated with the matrix and did not significantly alter emulsion rheology, hence these were inactive fillers. This study shows that by simply changing emulsifier type, it is possible to alter the magnitude of the association between the dispersed droplets and surrounding fat crystals and, by extension, tailor the texture and rigidity of fat crystal-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3agenetically modified organisms 3aglycerol 3alipid content 3amicrostructure 3apolyglycerol polyricinoleate 3arheology 3aricinoleic acid 3asoybean oil 3atexture 0aWater-in-oil emulsion 0aEmulsifier 0aFat crystal 0aRheology 0aInterface 0aCrystallization 0aStability1 aRousseau, Dérick0 tFood research international.g2017 Sept., v. 99 p.355-362dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010700155300001800262520032100280592002800601650001500629650001600644650001500660650002700675650001100702650001300713650002400726700001600750700002700766773013400793856007400927852000901001655001201010IND60659577820221120131011.0190823e20120614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065957782DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc32750c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aUnusual CoS₂ ellipsoids with anisotropic tube-like cavities and their application in supercapacitors  ap. 6912-6914.  aUnusual CoS₂ ellipsoids with anisotropic tube-like cavities have been synthesized from the simultaneous thermal decomposition and sulfidation of a preformed cobalt carbonate precursor.

Eight lines of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) carrying mutations in the three homoeologous waxy loci, Wx-A1, Wx-B1 and Wx-D1, have been classified by near-infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. Sample spectra from wheat seeds were collected by using a NIR spectrometer in the wave rage 1600–2400 nm, and then Raman spectrometer in the wave range 700–2000 cm–¹. All samples were split randomly into a calibration sample set containing 284 seeds (∼35 seeds per line) and a validation sample set containing the remaining 92 seeds. Classification of these samples was undertaken by discriminant analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA) based on the raw spectra processed by appropriate pre-treatment methods. The classification results by discriminant analysis indicated that the percentage of correctly identified samples by NIR spectroscopy was 84.2% for the calibration set and 84.8% for the validation set, and by Raman spectroscopy 94.4% and 94.6%, respectively. The results demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy combined with chemometrics as a rapid method is superior to NIR spectroscopy in classifying eight partial waxy wheat lines with different waxy proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aTriticum aestivum 3aamylose 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aloci 3amutation 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteins 3arapid methods 3aseeds 3aspectrometers 3awheat 0aclassification 0ahigh amylose wheat 0anondestructive analysis 0aqualitative identification1 aWu, Yixuan1 aGao, Zongmei1 aYun, Yong-Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1777-32050 tCrop & pasture science.g2019 May 16, v. 70, no. 5 p.437-441dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl4206942x1836-57957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP184993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245015500160300001600315520175100331592002802082650003902110650002002149650002002169650002502189650002502214650001602239650001602255650002202271650002002293650001602313650002102329650001602350650002202366650002602388650002302414650002002437650001202457650001302469650002502482650001402507650001902521650001802540650001202558650001502570650001602585650001602601650001702617650001702634653002702651653002002678700006702698700002002765773012002785856007202905852000902977655001202986IND60644605320221117234816.0190528e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460532DNAL7 a10.1071/CP185012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNematpour, Afsaneh10aDrought-tolerance mechanisms in foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) under different nitrogen supply and sowing dates  ap. 442-452.  aDrought stress is one of the main limitations to crop growth and yield. Efficient nitrogen (N) nutrition may moderate the negative effects of drought stress on plants through retention of metabolic activities. The present study was conducted to investigate the biochemical responses of two millet species, foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P.Beauv.) and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), under two irrigation regimes (based on 55% and 85% soil-water depletion) and two N fertiliser levels (0 and 112.5 kg N ha–¹) at four sowing dates (22 June and 6 July 2015, 14 and 30 June 2016). Drought stress increased hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), malondialdehyde (MDA) and other aldehyde contents of the plants, ultimately leading to 52% and 55% reductions in grain yield in foxtail millet and proso millet, respectively. Antioxidant activities showed significant increases under drought stress. Nitrogen application decreased H₂O₂, MDA and other aldehyde contents and activities of antioxidant enzymes, whereas it increased chlorophyll, carotenoid, phenolic compound and proline contents as well as grain yield. Higher grain yields were obtained with early planting dates under sufficient water supply, whereas superior yields were obtained with delayed planting dates under water stress owing to lower temperatures and evaporation rates. The results suggest that N application could mitigate the adverse effects of drought stress on millet plants by promoting osmoregulation, alleviating lipid peroxidation, and improving plant physiological traits. Foxtail millet had higher antioxidant potential than proso millet, resulting in greater capacity to inhibit production of free oxygen radicals and making it the more drought-tolerant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum miliaceum subsp. miliaceum 3aSetaria italica 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical pathways 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adrought tolerance 3aenzyme activity 3aevaporation 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airrigation management 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amillets 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrition 3aosmoregulation 3aplanting date 3aproline 3asoil water 3asowing date 3atemperature 3awater stress 3awater supply 0astress tolerance index 0aurea fertiliser1 aEshghizadeh, Hamid Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0477-03151 aZahedi, Morteza0 tCrop & pasture science.g2019 May 16, v. 70, no. 5 p.442-452dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl4206942x1836-57957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP185013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245013600179300001600315520178700331592002802118650001802146650002002164650001902184650001602203650001502219650002002234650001102254650001002265650001302275650001602288650002202304650001502326650002002341650001102361650001102372650002502383650001002408650001202418650002202430650003302452651001502485700002202500700002102522700002202543700002502565773010002590856005502690852000902745655001202754IND50065300220221119023618.0130419e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006530022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2012.02394.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRICHARDSON, KELLY M.12aA replicated comparison of breeding‐container suitability for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti in tropical and temperate Australia  ap. 219-229.  aIn Australia, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti is presently restricted to Queensland but was historically more widespread. Future spread may be facilitated by changes in the availability of suitable ovipositing sites (artificial containers) in response to climate change. We undertook a replicated comparison of thermal and hydric conditions in a selection of water containers commonly used by Ae. aegypti under sun and shade conditions in a tropical (Cairns) and temperate (Melbourne) location. We assessed the implications of thermal and hydric regimes for development rates and thermal stress. Container type had no effect on potential development rate in Cairns but mosquitoes in tyres were predicted to have consistently slower development than those in other containers in Melbourne. Our dataset included the hottest day on record for Melbourne (46.4°C) yet few containers exhibited lethal water temperatures in this location. Similarly high water temperatures were reached in Cairns at more benign air temperatures due to high solar radiation loads. The tyres had unique thermal profiles that exhibited a plateau at shaded air temperature even when in full sun. Overall, our results suggest that chronic cold stress would prevent development in Melbourne during spring, drying of containers would be limiting in Melbourne in summer, and heat stress in unshaded small containers would be limiting in Cairns. Tyres could be an important and unappreciated buffered habitat in open areas in the tropics. These results are of value for directing water storage and waste policy to prevent the further spread of Ae. aegypti and dengue fever as well as other mosquitoes. The methodology can be applied to identify priority containers for surveillance in other parts of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acold stress 3acontainers 3adata collection 3adengue 3afever 3ahabitats 3aheat stress 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3atires 3atropics 3awater temperature 3awet environmental conditions 3aQueensland1 aHoffmann, Ary A.,1 aJOHNSON, PETRINA1 aRITCHIE, SCOTT R.1 aKearney, Michael R.,0 tAustral ecology.g2013 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.219-229dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2012.02394.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245014600163520195300309592002802262650001502290650001602305650001402321650001202335650002102347650001202368650001502380650001802395650001002413650001102423650001902434700002702453700002902480700002202509700001902531700002202550773012802572856007502700852000902775655001202784IND60703881320221120125409.0200721e20200312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070388132DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosenza, Diogo  N.10aImpact of Calibrating Filtering Algorithms on the Quality of LiDAR-Derived DTM and on Forest Attribute Estimation through Area-Based Approach  aGround point filtering of the airborne laser scanning (ALS) returns is crucial to derive digital terrain models (DTMs) and to perform ALS-based forest inventories. However, the filtering calibration requires considerable knowledge from users, who normally perform it by trial and error without knowing the impacts of the calibration on the produced DTM and the forest attribute estimation. Therefore, this work aims at calibrating four popular filtering algorithms and assessing their impact on the quality of the DTM and the estimation of forest attributes through the area-based approach. The analyzed filters were the progressive triangulated irregular network (PTIN), weighted linear least-squares interpolation (WLS) multiscale curvature classification (MCC), and the progressive morphological filter (PMF). The calibration was established by the vertical DTM accuracy, the root mean squared error (RMSE) using 3240 high-accuracy ground control points. The calibrated parameter sets were compared to the default ones regarding the quality of the estimation of the plot growing stock volume and the dominant height through multiple linear regression. The calibrated parameters allowed for producing DTM with RMSE varying from 0.25 to 0.26 m, against a variation from 0.26 to 0.30 m for the default parameters. The PTIN was the least affected by the calibration, while the WLS was the most affected. Compared to the default parameter sets, the calibrated sets resulted in dominant height equations with comparable accuracies for the PTIN, while WLS, MCC, and PFM reduced the models’ RMSE by 6.5% to 10.6%. The calibration of PTIN and MCC did not affect the volume estimation accuracy, whereas calibrated WLS and PMF reduced the RMSE by 3.4% to 7.9%. The filter calibration improved the DTM quality for all filters and, excepting PTIN, the filters increased the quality of forest attribute estimation, especially in the case of dominant height.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acalibration 3aequations 3afilters 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3alandscapes 3aleast squares 3alidar 3amodels 3aremote sensing1 aGomes Pereira, Luísa 1 aGuerra-Hernández, Juan 1 aPascual, Adrián 1 aSoares, Paula 1 aTomé, Margarida,0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 12, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120609183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017400167300001400341520060900355592002800964650001300992650001101005650003401016650001301050700001801063700002201081773009901103856004801202852000901250655001201259IND50070572620221122225842.0131112e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007057262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-013-9936-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Harinder10aHigh radiation and desiccation tolerance of nitrogen-fixing cultures of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 emanates from genome/proteome repair capabilities  ap. 71-81.  aThe filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 was found to tolerate very high doses of ⁶⁰Co-gamma radiation or prolonged desiccation.

However, because of the difficulties in studying the behaviour of free-ranging predators, we have a limited understanding of how predators respond to those signals. Here, we took advantage of our ability to quantify predatory behaviours of free-ranging sidewinder rattlesnakes, Crotalus cerastes, to examine the influence of anti-snake behaviours performed by desert kangaroo rats, Dipodomys deserti. We recorded natural encounters and quantified the predator-deterrent behaviours displayed by the kangaroo rats, as well as any strikes performed by the rattlesnakes and whether the strikes were successful. We found that predator-deterrent signalling significantly reduced the probability that a rattlesnake would strike. This was most likely due to the ability of kangaroo rats to mobilize extremely rapid evasive leaps; even rats that appeared unaware of the snakes were almost always able to avoid rattlesnake strikes. The degree of effectiveness of this evasive leaping in countering rattlesnake predation was unexpected and indicates that this may be a rich system for exploring the biomechanics of extreme physical performance in a naturalistic context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus 3aDipodomys 3aantipredatory behavior 3abiomechanics 3aphysical activity 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aprobability 3arats 3asnakes 0aanimal communication 0aKangaroo rat 0apredator-deterrent signal 0apredator–prey 0arattlesnake1 aFreymiller, Grace A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7786-06101 aClark, Rulon W.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 Aug., v. 130 p.73-78dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245011300208520201400321592002802335650001302363650002002376650001602396650001402412650002102426650001102447650002302458650002202481650001902503650001602522651001002538653001202548653002902560653002702589653001902616700001402635700001602649700001802665700001802683773010602701856008702807852000902894655001202903IND60770198620221120052700.0220523e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0832-289114aThe health impacts of aerosol-planetary boundary layer interactions on respiratory and circulatory mortality  aAerosols could affect the thermal radiation process of planetary boundary layer (PBL), thus changing its thermodynamic and circulation structure and further triggering changes in aerosol concentrations. However, previous studies mostly focused on the direct health impacts of aerosols and meteorological conditions in the boundary layer and little is known about the health impacts associated with aerosol-PBL interactions. We quantitatively estimate the impacts of PM₂.₅ and air temperature on mortality caused by aerosol-PBL interactions. Utilizing the WRF-Chem model, we conducted a one-month numerical simulation during December 2015 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, one of the most polluted regions with the highest population density in China. We simulated PM₂.₅ concentrations and air temperature under two scenarios: with/without considering the aerosol-PBL interactions. Based on the simulation data, we adopted the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to establish the exposure-response associations of PM₂.₅ and temperature with mortality and calculated the population-weighted exposure levels of PM₂.₅ and temperature. During December 2015 in the BTH region, the additional PM₂.₅-related and temperature-related deaths were 312 due to respiratory and circulatory disease. Without considering the aerosol-PBL interactions, the population-weighted average levels of both PM₂.₅ and temperature increased compared with the average levels. However, after considering the aerosol-PBL interactions, the population-weighted average temperature was decreased, while the population-weighted average PM₂.₅ concentration was increased. In the BTH region, more people lived in areas with high PM₂.₅ concentrations where have strong aerosol-PBL interactions. The aerosol-PBL interactions could intensify the adverse health impacts of temperature and PM₂.₅, which should not be neglected when to assess the health effects of aerosol and meteorological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair temperature 3aenvironment 3amortality 3anonlinear models 3apeople 3apopulation density 3athermal radiation 3athermodynamics 3atroposphere 3aChina 0aAerosol 0aPlanetary boundary layer 0aBidirectional feedback 0aHealth effects1 aHan, Ling1 aDing, Aijun1 aLiu, Hongnian1 aZhao, Xiujuan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 May 01, v. 276 p.119050-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1190503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008200168300001600250520168000266592002801946650001201974650001901986650001302005650000902018650001402027650001402041650001502055650002002070650001602090653001302106653000802119653001402127653002402141653003302165700001202198700001802210700001602228700001802244700001602262773010502278856008702383852000902470655001202479IND60630403020221117234944.0190321e20190505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zihao10aReducing the minimum miscibility pressure of CO2 and crude oil using alcohols  ap. 105-112.  aThe establishment of a miscible phase between CO2 and crude oil can significantly improve CO2 flooding efficiency. However, the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) between CO2 and crude oil is usually higher than the fracture pressure of the formation, how to reduce the MMP between CO2 and crude oil is very important, and there are fewer related studies. Our inspiration for reducing MMP comes from the unique dispersion characteristics of CO2 in alcohol, the intermolecular force of crude oil may decrease due to the existence of alcohols. In this paper, the CO2 solubility and the oil volume expansion with adding a variety of alcohols (1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol) were measured by a visible high temperature and high pressure cell from 7 MPa to 20 MPa at 343.15 K. The MMP between CO2 and crude oil is predicted by measuring the interfacial tension (IFT) between CO2 and crude oil from 2 MPa to 43.3 MPa at 343.15 K. The results showed that the CO2 solubility in crude oil and the oil volume expansion were greatly improved due to the addition of alcohols. Especially 1-butanol, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol were mixed by 8:1:1(volume ratio), 5% (volume ratio) alcohols mixture was added to the crude oil, the CO2 solubility in crude oil increased by 28.74% at 345.15 K and 19 MPa, and the volume expansion coefficient of crude oil also increased by 4.45% at 345.15 K and 14 MPa. It is encouraging to note that the MMP between CO2 and crude oil decreases by 9.21% after adding 5% alcohols mixture into crude oil. This article is able to provide a new technique for reducing the MMP between CO2 and crude oil in the field of enhanced oil recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanol 3acarbon dioxide 3acolloids 3aoils 3apentanols 3apetroleum 3asolubility 3asurface tension 3atemperature 0aAlcohols 0aCO2 0aCrude oil 0aInterfacial tension 0aMinimum miscibility pressure1 aWu, Wei1 aDong, Zhaoxia1 aLin, Meiqin1 aZhang, Shuwei1 aZhang, Juan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 May 05, v. 568 p.105-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245012400182300001600306500001500322520100200337592002801339650002301367650001601390650002201406650002601428650001801454650001901472650001401491653002401505700001901529700001501548700001801563700001601581700001601597773009901613856004801712852000901760655001201769IND50089430720221119093321.0140508e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008943072DNAL7 a245993942pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-014-9988-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Daoyong10aTriton X-100 as an effective surfactant for the isolation and purification of photosystem I from Arthrospira platensis   ap. 311-321.  a2019-12-05  aSurfactants play important roles in the preparation, structural, and functional research of membrane proteins, and solubilizing and isolating membrane protein, while keeping their structural integrity and activity intact is complicated. The commercial n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and Triton X-100 (TX) were used as solubilizers to extract and purify trimeric photosystem I (PSI) complex, an important photosynthetic membrane protein complex attracting broad interests. With an optimized procedure, TX can be used as an effective surfactant to isolate and purify PSI, as a replace of the much more expensive DDM. A mechanism was proposed to interpret the solubilization process at surfactant concentrations lower than the critical solubilization concentration. PSI-TX and PSI-DDM had identical polypeptide bands, pigment compositions, oxygen consumption, and photocurrent activities. This provides an alternative procedure and paves a way for economical and large-scale trimeric PSI preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoxygen consumption 3asurfactants 3amembrane proteins 3aArthrospira platensis 3aphotosystem I 3asolubilization 3aoctoxynol 0aSpirulina platensis1 aHuang, Guihong1 aXu, Fengxi1 aWang, Mengfei1 aLiu, Shuang1 aHuang, Fang0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2014 June, v. 120, no. 3 p.311-321dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-014-9988-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009300152300001800245500002000263520154800283592002801831650001501859650001501874650002201889650001301911650003501924650001701959650001301976650001401989650001102003650001502014650001602029700001902045700005202064700001902116700001302135700001102148700001602159700001902175773015002194856007302344852000902417655001202426IND60600039520221121065807.0180702e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060003952DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Lihe10aAdsorption of phenol from aqueous solutions using interlayer modified titanate nanotubes  ap. 2208-2215.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Layered titanate nanostructures have long been studied as efficient adsorbents for different kinds of pollutants such as heavy metals and dye cations. As to the electro‐neutral and anionic organic pollutants, titanates show relatively low adsorption capacity due to a negatively charged surface and lack of organophilic affinity. This research focuses on the interlayer modification of titanate nanotubes for adsorption of this kind of organic pollutants. Phenol was chosen as a representative target. RESULTS: Two surfactants, hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HTAB) and dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium bromide (DDBAB), were chosen as organic modifier for the interlayer modification. Detailed characterization proved that surfactant molecules were intercalated into the interlayer and surface properties of titanates were successfully modified. Adsorption behavior of phenol was then systematically investigated. Results show that DDBAB modified titanates are efficient phenol adsorbents, possessing better performance than HTAB modified titanates. The high adsorption capacity is attributed to the special structure of titanates and the affinity between phenyl groups in DDBAB and phenol. Subsequently, thermally induced phase change of spent adsorbents led to complete regeneration. CONCLUSION: Interlayer modified titanate nanotubes were efficient phenol adsorbents with a maximum adsorption capacity of 226.24 mg g‐¹. Complete regeneration of spent adsorbents was also achieved. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abromides 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aheavy metals 3amoieties 3ananotubes 3aphenol 3apollutants 3asurfactants1 aZhang, Jixiang1 aLi, Nian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1267-629X1 aZhang, Shudong1 aChen, Fa1 aJi, Bo1 aLi, Haifeng1 aWang, Zhenyang0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 93, no. 8 p.2208-2215dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008400168300002000252520141700272592002801689650002301717650000801740650005201748650001301800650000801813650002601821650001101847650001301858650001401871650001301885650001901898651001001917700002201927700002201949700001901971700002001990700002002010700001902030700002502049700002602074700001902100700002602119700002002145700006002165773015502225856008302380852000902463655001202472IND60765835120221118215223.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16737-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConte, Marianna10aAirborne concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor community environments in Italy  ap. 13905-13916.  aCOVID-19 pandemic raised a debate regarding the role of airborne transmission. Information regarding virus-laden aerosol concentrations is still scarce in community indoors and what are the risks for general public and the efficiency of restriction policies. This work investigates, for the first time in Italy, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples collected in different community indoors (one train station, two food markets, one canteen, one shopping centre, one hair salon, and one pharmacy) in three Italian cities: metropolitan city of Venice (NE of Italy), Bologna (central Italy), and Lecce (SE of Italy). Air samples were collected during the maximum spread of the second wave of pandemic in Italy (November and December 2020). All collected samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, using both real-time RT-PCR and ddPCR, and no significant differences were observed comparing samples taken with and without customers. Modelling average concentrations, using influx of customers’ data and local epidemiological information, indicated low values (i.e. < 0.8 copies m⁻³ when cotton facemasks are used and even lower for surgical facemasks). The results, even if with some limitations, suggest that the restrictive policies enforced could effectively reduce the risk of airborne transmissions in the community indoor investigated, providing that physical distance is respected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaerosols 3aair 3aairborne transmission 3acotton 3apandemic 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk reduction 3aItaly1 aFeltracco, Matteo1 aChirizzi, Daniela1 aTrabucco, Sara1 aDinoi, Adelaide1 aGregoris, Elena1 aBarbaro, Elena1 aLa Bella, Gianfranco1 aCiccarese, Giuseppina1 aBelosi, Franco1 aLa Salandra, Giovanna1 aGambaro, Andrea1 aContini, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4454-06420 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.13905-13916dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16737-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011600165300001400281520098600295592002801281650001301309650000901322650002101331650001901352650001101371650001601382650001301398650000901411650000901420653003001429653002901459653002301488653000901511653001501520700005801535700001501593700001901608700001701627700001301644700001701657700005001674700001701724773010301741856008701844852000901931655001201940IND60630403120221117235113.0190321e20190505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Sha10aPreparation and photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells based on zinc titanium mixed metal oxides  ap. 59-65.  aA novelty method has been replenished for getting one kind of photoanode materials for dye-sensitized solar by an ingenious way. Using the ZnTi layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a precursor of photoanode materials, the ZnTi-LDH with different ratios were produced through urea method. Since the thermal treatment of LDH precursor at 500 ℃, the ZnTi mixed metal oxides (MMO) were easily obtained and then DSSC based on different ratios of ZnTi-MMO were fabricated with two kinds of dyes (C101 and Z907). The different ZnTi cationic ratios and diverse dyes make a big difference on the performance of DSSC. As the amount of Zn2+ increasing, the photocurrent and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells first increase and then decrease. The optimal efficiency under C101 condition gets up to 1.57% at 9:1 cationic ratio of the ZnTi-LDH precursor. The C101 dye exhibits a more impressive performance than the Z907 where the DSSC is equipped with same MMO and other conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3adyes 3aelectric current 3aheat treatment 3aoxides 3asolar cells 3atitanium 3aurea 3azinc 0aDye-sensitized solar cell 0aLayered double hydroxide 0aMixed metal oxides 0aZnTi 0aPhotoanode1 aLiu, Jianqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7301-43881 aWang, Tong1 aWang, Chenglei1 aGe, Zhongwei1 aLiu, Jie1 aHao, Xiaotao1 aDu, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2455-34971 aXiao, Hongdi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 May 05, v. 568 p.59-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008000208300002000288520161700308592002801925596005701953650001002010650002702020650002502047650002902072650001302101650000902114650002602123650001402149650001402163650001302177773015502190856008302345852000902428655001202437IND60765835320221118215619.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16746-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOishi, Yoshitaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7837-874610aBiomonitoring of transboundary pollutants using moss in Japan’s mountains  ap. 15018-15025.  aLong-range transported atmospheric pollutants (or transboundary pollutants) include trace metals with isotope ratios and compositions that vary from those of domestic pollutants, which threaten mountain ecosystems. These differences can be applied as indices to evaluate the influence of transboundary pollutants on mountain ecosystems. Mosses play important ecological functions in mountains and are sensitive to atmospheric deposition. Therefore, using these indices for moss biomonitoring can provide a more accurate indication of ecosystem health. However, studies on indices that are appropriate for moss biomonitoring are limited. Here, the effectiveness of moss biomonitoring using trace metal indices was examined to evaluate transboundary pollutants in mountainous areas in Japan. Transboundary pollutants in these areas originate from mainland Asia and are characterized by high lead isotope ratios, lead-to-zinc (Pb/Zn) ratios, and arsenic-to-vanadium (As/V) ratios. Given that the abundance of transboundary pollutants decreases with distance from mainland Asia, these three indices are also expected to vary with distance. The Pb isotope ratios were found to decrease with distance from mainland Asia; in contrast, the Pb/Zn and As/V ratios did not display any notable relationship with distance. These results are likely attributed to biological and environmental factors that affect trace metal content in moss. Thus, moss Pb isotope ratios are useful indicators of transboundary pollutants in Japan’s mountains, offering an important tool for comparable moss biomonitoring studies in East Asia.  aPublisher supplied data  a16K00566cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aJapan 3aatmospheric deposition 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aisotopes 3alead 3amosses and liverworts 3amountains 3apollution 3aresearch0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.15018-15025dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16746-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100001700167245008700184300001600271520129200287592002801579653001301607653002501620653001801645653001601663653002301679773013501702856011501837852000901952655001201961IND60128491020221120061834.0151115e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012849102DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567(2007)80[361:HBBTSO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcock, John10aHilltopping Behavior by Three Species of Tachytes Wasps (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae)  ap. 361-368.  aAlthough hilltopping behavior has rarely been reported for crabronid wasps, three species of Tachytes wasps defend hilltop perch sites in central Arizona during the late summer. All three species (T. ermineus, T. spatulatus, and T. sculleni) can be found at the same hilltop during August and September and they perch in many of the same plants at this location. The three species are, however, spatially segregated to some extent in that T. ermineus perches very near the top of large shrubs and small palo verde trees on the hilltop, T. spatulatus perches somewhat lower within many of these same plants, while T. sculleni perches very close to or on the ground about the outer edges of shrubs growing on the hilltop. Males of all three species tend to be site faithful with marked males returning to their perch sites over several days. In experiments in which resident males of T. spatulatus were removed, the replacements that arrived to occupy the trees tended to be smaller, suggesting that large body size confers an advantage in the defense of perching sites in this species. The mating system of these species can be labeled landmark territoriality, with males defending visually conspicuous sites on hilltops that presumably attract receptive females to the territory holders.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTachytes 0ahilltopping behavior 0amating system 0aCrabronidae 0aspatial segregtion0 tJournal of the Kansas Entomological Society.g2007 Oct., v. 80, no. 4 p.361-368dThe Kansas Entomological Societyx0022-85677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2317%2F0022-8567%282007%2980%5B361%3AHBBTSO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013600174500001400310520123400324592002801558650003001586650001101616650002101627650001501648650002501663650001101688650001201699650001801711650001301729650002301742650001801765650001301783650001101796650001001807651001001817653002501827653001801852653002501870653002101895653002601916700002501942700002901967773011301996856008602109852000902195655001202204IND60719496320221118213313.0210201e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Chao, Ángel10aEnvironmental assets, industry 4.0 technologies and firm performance in Spain: A dynamic capabilities path to reward sustainability  aNAL-light  aThe consolidation of industry 4.0 (I4.0) as a new innovative ecosystem has generated high expectations about its economic and environmental effects. In this study, we investigate whether I4.0 technologies can reinforce environmental assets management in achieving firm results. We intend to contrast the existence of reward mechanisms for being green. Using a panel of 1028 Spanish industrial firms in 2009–2016 period, the research has obtained three main results. First, environmental assets, the use of robots and the adoption of flexible production technologies generate individual and two-complementarity marginal effects in the explanation of sales, exports and labour productivity. Second, environmental assets and I4.0 technologies do not generate any individual or complementarity marginal effect that positively explains gross operating margins. And, third, however, we have found a business model that generates significant total effects on the four firm results, especially on profitability, through the combination of environmental assets, I4.0 technologies, R&D expenditure, production flexibility and human capital management. Implications for the circular economy and ethical business models are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aassets 3acircular economy 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aethics 3aexports 3ahuman capital 3aindustry 3alabor productivity 3aprofitability 3aresearch 3arobots 3asales 3aSpain 0aEnvironmental assets 0aIndustry 4.0. 0aDynamic capabilities 0aFirm performance 0aCircular economy (CE)1 aFicapal-Cusí, Pilar1 aTorrent i Sellens, Joan,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 281 p.125264-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007600160300001200236500001100248520155600259592002801815650001001843650001301853650001201866650001401878650002301892650001101915650001101926650001101937650001201948650001401960700002501974700001901999700002602018700002202044700006202066773013902128856008202267852000902349655001202358IND60615238120221119084525.0181017e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-018-2580-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Joy10aMultilevel factors affecting early socioemotional development in humans  ap. 172.  aReview  aSocioemotional climate in the family environment is critical to a child’s socioemotional development. This focused literature review examines some central dynamics of that relation, viz. how positive and negative parent-child interactions influence genetic, neurodevelopmental, affective, and behavioral adjustment in children across cultures. Our narrative review of the extant empirical research indicates that, first, socioemotional caregiving experienced in infancy contributes to the postnatal genome and development of the brain in that, for example, early parent-child interactions affect genetic expression and the integrity of white matter neural tracts involved in emotion regulation, social cognition, and behavioral adjustment and presumably do so in culturally common ways. Second, positive parenting (warmth and acceptance) favorably affects child socioemotional adjustment, whereas negative parenting (rejection and punishment) adversely affects child socioemotional adjustment, in specific and fairly consistent ways across cultures. Third, very negative parenting, specifically corporal punishment, anticipates poor child socioemotional behavioral adjustment across cultures. These dynamics are situated in broader caregiving contexts reflecting parent and child gender, parent-child relationship quality, and cultural normativeness. Overall, contemporary research emphasizes the importance of parent-child socioemotional dynamics and cultural interpretation for understanding long-term socioemotional development in human children.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3achildren 3aclimate 3acognition 3aempirical research 3agender 3agenome 3ahumans 3ainfancy 3aparenting1 aMistur, Elisabeth J.1 aWei, Christine1 aLansford, Jennifer E.1 aPutnick, Diane L.1 aBornstein, Marc H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6810-84270 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2018 Oct., v. 72, no. 10 p.172-172dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-018-2580-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012700173300001600300520195800316592002802274650002002302650001402322650001302336650001902349650002002368650002302388650001002411650003302421650001702454650001402471650001102485650001602496650001402512650001802526650001102544651001202555653001702567653001402584653001602598653001402614653001502628653001302643700001902656700002302675700002502698773011402723856008502837852000902922655001202931IND60613332420221121015804.0201202e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndres, Michael J.10aOn the systematics of some marine haploporids (Trematoda) with the description of a new species of Megasolena Linton, 1910  ap. 805-815.  aMegasolena mikra sp. nov. is described from the queen angelfish, Holacanthus ciliaris (Linnaeus), off Florida, USA. The new species can be differentiated from all other species of Megasolena Linton, 1910 except Megasolena littoralis Muñoz, George-Nascimento, and Bray, 2017 in possessing testes that are smaller in diameter than the ovary. The new species can be differentiated from M. littoralis in lacking tegumental spines and possessing oral sucker papillae. Molecular data are provided for two species each of Cadenatella Dollfus, 1946, Hapladena Linton, 1910, and Megasolena Linton, 1910. Bayesian inference analysis of concatenated internal transcribed spacer region-2 (ITS2) and partial 28S rDNA sequences of 50 haploporoids revealed 1) a monophyletic Atractotrematidae Yamaguti, 1939 sister to the rest of the haploporoids tested; 2) a paraphyletic Megasoleninae Manter, 1935 – if Hapladena is included; and 3) a monophyletic Cadenatellinae Gibson and Bray, 1982 sister to the ‘mugilid’ haploporids. The ‘mugilid’ haploporids formed a monophyletic clade consisting of the subfamilies Chalcinotrematinae Overstreet and Curran, 2005, Forticulcitinae Blasco-Costa, Balbuena, Kostadinova, and Olson, 2009, Haploporinae Nicoll, 1914, and Waretrematinae Srivastava, 1937. Based on our analysis we restrict the Megasoleninae to include Megasolena, Vitellibaculum Montgomery, 1957, and Metamegasolena Yamaguti, 1970, all of which have species with two testes. To accommodate the former megasolenine taxa with a single testis, we erect the Hapladeninae subf. nov. for species in Hapladena and tentatively, Myodera Montgomery, 1957. Our results further support that haploporoids had a common marine ancestor with two testes, and that members of the Haploporoidea Nicoll, 1914 underwent diversification following a shift from a primarily marine life history with eupercarian hosts to a more euryhaline one with diadromous hosts (namely mullet).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aTrematoda 3aancestry 3aanimal ovaries 3adiadromous fish 3aeuryhaline species 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alife history 3amonophyly 3amullet 3anew species 3aparaphyly 3aribosomal DNA 3atestes 3aFlorida 0aHaploporidae 0aPhylogeny 0aCadenatella 0aHapladena 0aITS region 0a28S rRNA1 aPulis, Eric E.1 aCurran, Stephen S.1 aOverstreet, Robin M.0 tParasitology international.g2018 Dec., v. 67, no. 6 p.805-815dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01359naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300001800280520039200298592002800690650002300718650002700741650002300768650002300791650002300814700001600837773013300853856007400986852000901060655001201069IND60659578620221120192532.0190823e20120530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065957862DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc32783j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Min-Qiang10aDesymmetrization of cyclohexadienones viad-camphor-derived triazolium salt catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction  ap. 6363-6365.  aEnantioselective desymmetrization of cyclohexadienones via a d-camphor-derived triazolium salt catalyzed intramolecular Stetter reaction was realized.

Parasite infection can have pervasive effects on hosts, including altering host behaviour, and may thus contribute to differences in host personality. We investigated the relationship between the three-spined stickleback and its common parasite Glugea anomala, with focus on differences in host personality. Naturally infected and uninfected individuals were assayed for the five personality traits activity, exploration, boldness, sociability, and aggression. If infected fish behaved differently from uninfected, to benefit this parasite with horizontal transmission, we predicted behaviour increasing interactions with other sticklebacks to increase. Infection status explained differences in host personality. Specifically, Glugea-infected individuals were more social than uninfected fish. This confirms a link between parasite infection and host behaviour, and a relationship which may improve the horizontal transmission of Glugea. However, future studies need to establish the consequences of this for the parasite, and the causality of the parasite-host personality relationship. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Parasite infection that alters host behaviour could be a possible avenue of research into the causes of animal personality. We studied the link between infection and personality using the three-spined stickleback and its parasite Glugea anomala. We predicted that infected individuals would be more prone to interact with other sticklebacks, since this would improve transmission of this parasite. The personality of uninfected and naturally infected fish was measured and we observed that Glugea-infected sticklebacks were more social. Our results confirm a link between parasitism and variation in host personality.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aGlugea 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3afish 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3amicrosporidiosis 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3asocial behavior1 aAbbey-Lee, Robin N.1 aLøvlie, Hanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4352-62750 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2018 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.173-173dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-018-2586-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014500158520179900303592002802102650001302130650001202143650002902155650002802184650001202212650002002224650002902244650001502273650001202288650001502300650002302315650002702338650001302365650001602378650001902394650001302413650001502426650002502441650001202466651001102478700002202489700001902511700002902530700002302559700001802582700001802600700002002618700004502638700002302683700001802706700002802724700002102752700003202773700002202805700002102827773012802848856007502976852000903051655001203060IND60703881920221120145321.0200721e20200313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070388192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlencar, Ane 10aMapping Three Decades of Changes in the Brazilian Savanna Native Vegetation Using Landsat Data Processed in the Google Earth Engine Platform  aWidespread in the subtropics and tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, savannas are highly heterogeneous and seasonal natural vegetation types, which makes change detection (natural vs. anthropogenic) a challenging task. The Brazilian Cerrado represents the largest savanna in South America, and the most threatened biome in Brazil owing to agricultural expansion. To assess the native Cerrado vegetation (NV) areas most susceptible to natural and anthropogenic change over time, we classified 33 years (1985–2017) of Landsat imagery available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The classification strategy used combined empirical and statistical decision trees to generate reference maps for machine learning classification and a novel annual dataset of the predominant Cerrado NV types (forest, savanna, and grassland). We obtained annual NV maps with an average overall accuracy ranging from 87% (at level 1 NV classification) to 71% over the time series, distinguishing the three main NV types. This time series was then used to generate probability maps for each NV class. The native vegetation in the Cerrado biome declined at an average rate of 0.5% per year (748,687 ha yr⁻¹), mostly affecting forests and savannas. From 1985 to 2017, 24.7 million hectares of NV were lost, and now only 55% of the NV original distribution remains. Of the remnant NV in 2017 (112.6 million hectares), 65% has been stable over the years, while 12% changed among NV types, and 23% was converted to other land uses but is now in some level of secondary NV. Our results were fundamental in indicating areas with higher rates of change in a long time series in the Brazilian Cerrado and to highlight the challenges of mapping distinct NV types in a highly seasonal and heterogeneous savanna biome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3aanthropogenic activities 3aartificial intelligence 3acerrado 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3ainformation processing 3aland use 3aprobability 3aremote sensing 3asavannas 3asubtropics 3atime series analysis 3atropics 3aBrazil1 aZ.

Conversely, the use of these statistical methods to study the potential distribution of subterranean organisms has lagged behind, relative to their above‐ground (epigean) counterparts. The reason for this is possibly related to a number of peculiarities of subterranean systems, which pose important limits, but also opportunities, for these correlative models. The aim of this forum is to explore the caveats that need to be made when generalizing these statistical techniques to caves and other subterranean habitats. We focus on the typical bias in spatial datasets of cave‐dwelling species, and provide advice for selecting the model calibration area. In parallel, we discuss the potential use of different large scale surface variables to represent the subterranean condition. A more widespread adoption of these statistical techniques in subterranean biology is highly attractive and has great potential in broadening our knowledge on a variety of ecological topics, especially in the fields of climate change and biodiversity conservation. Their use would especially benefit the study of the biogeographic patterns of subterranean fauna and the impact of past and future climate change on subterranean ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiogeography 3acaves 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afauna 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aspatial data 3astatistical analysis 3awildlife management1 aLeroy, Boris0 tEcography.g2018 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.1194-1208dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.034643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04074naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016800166300002000334520227500354592002802629596006402657596006102721650001702782650001602799650002502815650001802840650002802858650001802886650002002904650002202924650002102946650002102967650001502988650002103003650001203024650001603036650001403052650001303066650001603079650000903095650001903104650002403123650001903147651001003166700001803176700001303194700001903207700001903226700001603245773015503261856008303416852000903499655001203508IND60765835620221118215816.0220203e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16886-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Kaikai10aImpact of long-term tillage management on utilization of microbial carbon sources in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils under a double-cropping rice paddy field  ap. 15205-15214.  aIn order to reveal the mechanism of microbial carbon (C) sequestration in paddy soil under different tillage management and to provide an important theoretical basis for perfecting the mechanism of C sequestration in paddy soil. C can indicate changes of soil nutrient content and soil microbial community, but more research is needed to study how C sources utilization characteristics respond to different tillage management under a double-cropping rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddy field in southern China. Hence, the impact of long-term (2005–2018) tillage management on utilization of microbial carbon sources in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils under a double-cropping rice paddy field was studied by using ¹⁸O–H₂O method in this study. The tillage treatments were included: (1) moldboard plow with all crop residue removed as a control (CT), (2) moldboard plow with all crop residue incorporated (CTS), (3) no-tillage with all crop residue retained on the soil surface (NTS), and (4) rotary tillage with all crop residue incorporated (RTS). The results indicated that Richness, Shannon, and McIntosh indices were increased by application of crop residue management, compared with treatment without crop residue, and soil microbial growth rate, soil microbial biomass C content, and soil microbial basal respiration with CT treatment were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of NTS, RTS, and CTS treatments. And the soil C utilization efficiency in rhizosphere soil with NTS, RTS, and CTS treatments was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of CT treatment. Compared with CT and CTS treatments, the metabolic capacity of soil microorganisms to exogenous C sources with NTS and RTS treatments was increased, and the different types of exogenous C sources were showed as following: complex compounds < carbohydrate < amino acid < carboxylic acids. The redundancy analysis results showed that utilization characteristics of soil microorganisms to exogenous C sources were significantly changed under tillage and crop residue incorporated conditions. Hence, this result indicated that characteristics of soil C sources utilization were significantly increased combined applied with tillage and crop residue incorporated management.  aPublisher supplied data  a(2020JJ5318)cnatural science foundation of hunan province  a(31872851)cnational natural science foundation of china 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acids 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbohydrates 3acrop residue management 3acrop residues 3adouble cropping 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial carbon 3amicrobial growth 3ano-tillage 3anutrient content 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3apollution 3aresearch 3arhizosphere 3arice 3arotary tillage 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3aChina1 aTang, Haiming1 aLi, Chao1 aTang, Wenguang1 aXiao, Xiaoping1 aYi, Zhenxie0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.15205-15214dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16886-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245010300183500001400286520110900300592002801409650001601437650002901453650002001482650001501502650000901517650001001526650001501536650002301551650001301574650001401587650001001601650001301611650001001624650001701634651001301651651001801664651001201682653002801694653002001722653001401742653001901756653001201775653001101787700005901798700003201857773011301889856008602002852000902088655001202097IND60719496620221118212656.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTayo Tene, Christian Valery10aInternalizing environmental management practices in Africa: The role of power distance and orality  aNAL-light  aThis paper investigates the role of power distance and orality in the internalization of ISO 14001 in Africa. The data was collected from 35 semi-structured interviews with a set of relevant stakeholders: managers, employees, environmental coordinators/directors, consultants, and auditors in Cameroon, Senegal, and Ivory Coast. The results point to the low power of action of the persons in charge of the implementation of ISO 14001, the tendency for managers to centralize decisions and to view the internalization of ISO 14001 as more of an issue for employees than for themselves, and the perfunctory implementation of the environmental management system. This seems to lead to low ownership of the environmental practices in place by managers and employees, and little change to behaviors and practices. This paper contributes to the literature on the internalization of environmental management practices and sheds light on the under-explored role of cultural issues in the effectiveness of ISO 14001. The managerial implications of the study and the avenues for future research are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsultants 3aenvironmental management 3ahuman resources 3ainterviews 3alead 3alight 3aliterature 3amanagement systems 3amanagers 3aownership 3apaper 3aresearch 3asheds 3astakeholders 3aCameroon 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aSenegal 0aEnvironmental practices 0aInternalization 0aISO 14001 0aPower distance 0aOrality 0aAfrica1 aBoiral, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9722-76441 aHeras-Saizarbitoria, Iñaki0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 291 p.125267-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018600160520190200346592002802248650002402276650001102300650001602311650001902327650002002346650002102366650001502387650001902402650002202421650001702443650001502460650001602475650001702491650001702508651001102525651001202536651001602548700002202564700001902586700002102605700002202626700002502648700002002673773012802693856007502821852000902896655001202905IND60703882020221120161654.0200721e20200313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070388202DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTewes, Andreas 10aHow Do Methods Assimilating Sentinel-2-Derived LAI Combined with Two Different Sources of Soil Input Data Affect the Crop Model-Based Estimation of Wheat Biomass at Sub-Field Level?  aThe combination of Sentinel-2 derived information about sub-field heterogeneity of crop canopy leaf area index (LAI) and SoilGrids-derived information about local soil properties might help to improve the prediction accuracy of crop simulation models at sub-field level without prior knowledge of detailed site characteristics. In this study, we ran a crop model using either soil texture derived from samples that were taken spatially distributed across a field and analyzed in the lab (AS) or SoilGrids-derived soil texture (SG) as model input in combination with different levels of LAI assimilation. We relied on the LINTUL5 model implemented in the SIMPLACE modeling framework to simulate winter wheat biomass development in 40 to 60 points in each field with detailed measured soil information available, for 14 fields across France, Germany, and the Netherlands during two growing seasons. Water stress was the only growth-limiting factor considered in the model. The model performance was evaluated against total aboveground biomass measurements at harvest with regard to the average per-field prediction and the simulated spatial variability within the field. Our findings showed that a) per-field average biomass predictions of SG-based modeling approaches were not inferior to those using AS-texture as input, but came with a greater prediction uncertainty, b) relying on the generation of an ensemble without LAI assimilation might produce results as accurate as simulations where LAI is assimilated, and c) sub-field heterogeneity was not reproduced well in any of the fields, predominantly because of an inaccurate simulation of water stress in the model. We conclude that research should be devoted to the testing of different approaches to simulate soil moisture dynamics and to the testing in other sites, potentially using LAI products derived from other remotely sensed imagery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3acrop models 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3auncertainty 3awater stress 3awinter wheat 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aNetherlands1 aHoffmann, Holger 1 aNolte, Manuel 1 aKrauss, Gunther 1 aSchäfer, Fabian,1 aKerkhoff, Christian 1 aGaiser, Thomas 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 13, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120609253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245007700176520073200253592002800985650002401013650002701037650001301064650002001077650001301097650001101110650001101121650002701132650001301159650001301172650001001185650001401195650001301209650001901222653001701241653001501258653000801273653001601281653001201297653001201309700002301321700002901344773012601373856008401499852000901583655001201592IND60770199320221119232227.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2022.1015792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Stephanie A.V.10aSurfactant equilibria and its impact on penetration into stratum corneum  aAnionic surfactant penetration into the skin and their subsequent interactions with stratum corneum lipids and proteins has historically been linked with irritation and dryness from the use of soaps, body washes, facial cleansers, shampoos, and other rinse-off personal care products. Mechanisms of surfactant penetration into the skin surface has been a topic of debate for decades. In this review, we discuss relevant theories of surfactant penetration into skin as well as interactions of surfactants with skin components. We present evidence that thermodynamic analyses of surfactant solution equilibria can be useful in modeling these behaviors.

As part of a commercial operation, bee colonies are exposed to a variety of agricultural ecosystems throughout the year and a multitude of environmental variables that may affect the microbial balance of individuals and the hive. While many recent studies support the idea of a core microbiota in guts of younger in-hive bees, it is unknown whether this core is present in forager bees or the pollen they carry back to the hive. Additionally, several studies hypothesize that the foregut (crop), a key interface between the pollination environment and hive food stores, contains a set of 13 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that inoculate collected pollen and act in synergy to preserve pollen stores. Here, we used a combination of 454 based 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the microbial communities of forager guts, crops, and corbicular pollen and crop plate counts to show that (1) despite a very different diet, forager guts contain a core microbiota similar to that found in younger bees, (2) corbicular pollen contains a diverse community dominated by hive-specific, environmental or phyllosphere bacteria that are not prevalent in the gut or crop, and (3) the 13 LAB found in culture-based studies are not specific to the crop but are a small subset of midgut or hindgut specific bacteria identified in many recent 454 amplicon-based studies. The crop is dominated by Lactobacillus kunkeei, and Alpha 2.2 (Acetobacteraceae), highly osmotolerant and acid resistant bacteria found in stored pollen and honey. Crop taxa at low abundance include core hindgut bacteria in transit to their primary niche, and potential pathogens or food spoilage organisms seemingly vectored from the pollination environment. We conclude that the crop microbial environment is influenced by worker task, and may function in both decontamination and inoculation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcetobacteraceae 3aApis mellifera 3aLactobacillus kunkeei 3aacid tolerance 3aagroecosystems 3abacterial communities 3acrops 3adecontamination 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3afood pathogens 3afood spoilage 3aforegut 3agenes 3ahindgut 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3alactic acid bacteria 3amidgut 3aphyllosphere 3aplate count 3apollen 3apollination 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis1 aMaes, Patrick1 aAnderson, Kirk E.0 tPlos One.g2014 Apr. 16, v. 9, no. 4 p.1-13wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/600033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.00950563Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/The%20microbial%20communities%20associated%20with%20honey%20bee%20%28Apis%20millifera%29%20foragers.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015500174300001400329520121400343592002801557650001201585650001201597650001501609650001601624650002401640650001401664650001701678650001301695650001301708650001301721650002301734650001101757650002001768651001401788653002401802653002301826653002001849653002801869653001101897700002801908700002101936700002401957700002401981700001902005773010302024856008502127852000902212655001202221IND60613332820221121030004.0190411e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2018.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoo, Katherina L.10aDietary and seasonal variability in trophic relations at the base of the North Sea pelagic food web revealed by stable isotope and fatty acid analysis  ap. 61-70.  aA two-dimensional biomarker approach including fatty acids and stable isotopes of seston and copepods was applied to examine how the variability at the base of the food web affects trophic interactions between primary producers and copepod consumers over a sampling period of two years. We investigated how the composition of the seston affected feeding behaviour by analysing the fatty acid and stable isotope signals of the copepods Calanus helgolandicus, Acartia spp., Centropages spp. and Temora longicornis at Helgoland Roads, North Sea. Our results indicate that the relative contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic fractions in the seston determined the stable isotope signal of the seston and hence the δ15N of copepods. Our findings show that the combination of stable isotope and fatty acid analyses provides an ideal tool to address the complexity of trophic relations in planktonic food-webs and to define relative trophic position and feeding preferences of e.g. copepods. Defining accurate baselines from bulk seston samples containing a mixture of auto- and heterotroph protist communities still remains a challenge when defining lower food-web dynamics in natural plankton communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia 3aCalanus 3abiomarkers 3afatty acids 3afeeding preferences 3afood webs 3aheterotrophs 3anitrogen 3aplankton 3aprotists 3aseasonal variation 3aseston 3astable isotopes 3aNorth Sea 0aPlanktonic food web 0aBaseline variation 0aCopepod feeding 0aLower food-web dynamics 0aSeston1 aBoersma, M.q(Maarten),1 aMalzahn, Arne M.1 aLöder, Martin G.J.1 aWiltshire, Karen H.1 aAberle, Nicole0 tJournal of sea research.g2018 Nov., v. 141 p.61-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2018.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03830naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002400185245016100209500021200370506007600582506013700658520174100795592002802536506003702564650002802601650002202629650002102651650001102672650002602683650001502709650001502724650002602739650001302765650001302778650001602791651001002807653002802817653002202845653002802867653002902895653001002924700002102934700002702955700002202982700002103004700002103025700002503046773011803071856007803189852000903267655001203276IND60560926320221207075609.0170112e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092632DNAL7 a10.4081/ijfs.2016.61612doi7 aPMC51788422pmcid7 a280582482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerratore, Patrizia10aFirst Multi-Year Retrospective Study on Vibrio Parhaemolyticus and Vibrio Vulnificus Prevalence in Ruditapes Philippinarum Harvested in Sacca Di Goro, Italy  aFunding: this work was realized utilizing data from previous research activities, without costs from the Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (by-nc 3.0).

On the whole, 104 samples, collected in the period 2007-2015 and submitted to microbiological analyses (isolation and genotyping), have been reconsidered for Vibrio spp. load, V. parahaemolyticus prevalence (total, gene marker toxRP; potentially pathogenic, gene markers tdh and/or trh) and V. vulnificus prevalence (total, gene markers vvhA and hsp) together with environmental data obtained from the monitoring activity of the Emilia-Romagna Regional Agency for the Prevention, the Environment and the Energy. Environmental data have been processed to calculate the median of each, assessing the seasonal range of seawater temperature (warmer months: April-October, T°C >16.45°C; cooler months November-March, T°C <16.45°C), salinity (<or>27 psu), and dissolved oxygen (< or >8.2 mg/L). Total V. vulnificus, total and potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus were present respectively in the 11.5, 29.8 and 6.7% of the samples. The Vibrio spp. load (mean value of 4.69±0.65 log₁₀ colony forming unit g⁻¹) and the prevalence of potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, were not significantly correlated to the environmental conditions (P>0.05), whereas the prevalence of both total V. vulnificus and total V. parahaemolyticus was significantly higher in the warmer period (P<0.05), without correlation with salinity and dissolved oxygen values (P>0.05).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aVibrio vulnificus 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotyping 3amonitoring 3aretrospective studies 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperature 3aItaly 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aVibrio vulnificus 0aRuditapes philippinarum 0aEnvironmental conditions 0aItaly1 aOstanello, Fabio1 aPassalacqua, Pier Luca1 aZavatta, Emanuele1 aBignami, Giorgia1 aSerraino, Andrea1 aGiacometti, Federica0 tItalian journal of food safety.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 5, no. 4dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-71327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ijfs.2016.61613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009700173300001600270520124500286592002801531650002901559650001301588650002001601650000901621650001601630650001501646650001001661650001001671650000701681650004801688650001401736650001601750653002401766653001301790653002101803700002301824700002601847773011301873856008201986852000902068655001202077IND60605766320221121043923.0190411e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSirikharin, Ratchanok10aCharacterization of a cold-active transglutaminase from a crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus  ap. 546-549.  aTransglutaminase (TGase) from signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and its activity at low temperatures was studied. TGase is an abundant protein in the hematopoietic (HPT) cells and this tissue was used for TGase enzyme preparation. The optimal temperature and pH for the activity of crayfish TGase were determined. We found that TGase activity at 4 °C showed nearly the same activity as at a temperature of 22 °C. TGase activity from crayfish was compared with guinea pig liver TGase activity at 4 °C and the crayfish TGase displayed a higher activity while guinea pig liver TGase had a very low activity at this low temperature. By comparing kinetic parameters to guinea pig liver TGase, the results showed that a high activity of crayfish TGase was due to a decreasing Km value for pentylamine as a substrate, while it did not affect the kcat value (at 22 °C). The amino acid sequences of a krill and a crayfish TGase, which both are cold adapted, do not give any clue to why these two enzymes are cold-adapted. These results demonstrate that crayfish TGase is adapted to have significant activity at low temperatures and since crayfish are living in quite cold waters this is an interesting adaptation of this enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPacifastacus leniusculus 3acrayfish 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3aguinea pigs 3aimmunology 3akrill 3aliver 3apH 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3ashellfish 3atemperature 0aCold-adapted enzyme 0aCrayfish 0aTransglutaminase1 aSöderhäll, Irene1 aSöderhäll, Kenneth,0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 80 p.546-549dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.06.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015300174300001800327520060600345592002800951650001600979650002800995650001701023650001601040650002901056650001101085650000901096653001101105653000901116653000901125653001001134653001001144653000901154653000801163653000801171653000801179653000901187653000701196653000901203653000801212653000701220653000801227653001001235653000701245653000701252653000801259653001001267653000901277653001001286653000901296653000801305653000901313653000801322653000701330653000901337653000801346653000701354653000901361653000901370653000801379653000801387653000801395653001001403653001001413653000901423653002001432653003201452653002501484653002901509653003401538700002701572700001801599700002501617700002501642773012201667856008501789852000901874655001201883IND60613332920221121040725.0200517e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnastasius, Malcolm12aA critical appraisal of the measurement of serum ‘cholesterol efflux capacity’ and its use as surrogate marker of risk of cardiovascular disease  ap. 1257-1273.  aThe ‘cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC)’ assay is a simple in vitro measure of the capacities of individual sera to promote the first step of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, the delivery of cellular cholesterol to plasma HDL.This review describes the cell biology of this model and critically assesses its application as a marker of cardiovascular risk.

Körfez province, located along the İzmit Bay of Marmara Sea, Turkey, has been one of these coastal areas that has become a major point for industrial facilities and highly populated urbanized area since 1960s. Therefore, the analysis of the spatial changes in the land use patterns of the province has a critical role in the success of the physical planning processes and the protection of the coastal areas. In order to highlight this critical role, temporal change detection analysis for Körfez province covering a 6-year period and 5 land use classes was made using 2009 and 2015 SPOT imagery and thematic maps. Reclassified CORINE data, development plans, and land survey results were benefited for the supervised classification of the images. Four hundred eighty control points for each year were used to achieve a strong accuracy tested by Kappa coefficient. The spatio-temporal change detection results revealed a 22.5% and 2.3% decrease in agricultural lands and sea areas respectively, while there was an increase of 16.6% in forest-green areas, 6.4% in settlement areas, and 74.1% in lake areas. The results are believed to be significant input data to facilitate coastal and physical development planning over the area, and thus make sustainable land use decisions to protect the delicate landscape and coastal characteristics, while providing a sound risk management plan.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3alakes 3aland use 3alandscapes 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk management process 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3asustainable land management 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3aMarmara Sea1 aCabuk, Saye Nihan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4859-22711 aCetin, Mehmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8992-02890 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Feb., v. 29, no. 10 p.15172-15187dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16660-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04159naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245011300204506007600317506013700393520175700530592002802287506003702315650001502352650002102367650002702388650001602415650001502431650001802446650001902464650003702483650001002520650001602530650002402546650002502570650001102595650001002606650002102616650002802637650001802665650001502683650001302698650001302711650001002724650000702734650001402741650001602755650002602771650001802797650001502815650002002830650001702850650001302867650001602880650004402896650003402940650001102974653002102985653001503006653001403021653002503035700001903060700002303079700002803102700001903130700002303149773011803172856007803290852000903368655001203377IND60560926420221207075604.0170112e20161117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092642DNAL7 a10.4081/ijfs.2016.61652doi7 aPMC51788412pmcid7 a280582492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTirloni, Erica10aMicrobiological and Chemico-physical Shelf-life and Panel Test to Evaluate Acceptability of Liver Mortadella  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License (by-nc 3.0).

The proximate composition, aw nitrites and NaCl content were determined at T0. Weekly, samples were submitted to microbiological [total viable count (TVC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., coagulase positive staphylococci, sulphite reducing clostridia, yeasts and moulds, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.] and physicalchemical analyses [pH, colorimetric parameters, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs)], in parallel with consumer acceptability tests. The product characteristics (low salt and nitrites concentration, high aw and pH close to 6.5) were not efficient hurdles for microbial growth. No pathogens were detected in the samples; the initial TVC [5.4 Log colony forming unit (CFU)/g] increased rapidly, reaching values around 8 Log CFU/g at T14 for both the series, and was almost totally composed by LAB, leading to the acidification of the product (pH at T49=5.05 at 4°C and 5.24 at 8°C). The other microbiological parameters were below 2 Log CFU/g. The product showed a good protein and lipid stability (TVBN <33 N/100 g and TBARs <8 nmol/g at T49). The sensorial quality of liver mortadella was more affected by the storage time than by the temperature. An evident colour modification was detected after T35, when the product was also frequently rejected by the panellists, mainly due to odour. Thus, the shelf life of sliced cooked liver mortadella should be shortened below 30 days.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridia 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas 3aSalmonella 3aacidification 3acarbon dioxide 3acoagulase positive staphylococci 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aconsumer acceptance 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipids 3aliver 3amicrobial growth 3amicrobiological quality 3amolds (fungi) 3amortadella 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aodors 3apH 3apathogens 3aplate count 3aproximate composition 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3asodium chloride 3astorage time 3asulfites 3atemperature 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3ayeasts 0aLiver mortadella 0aShelf life 0aOxidation 0aLactic acid bacteria1 aStella, Simone1 aBernardi, Cristian1 aMoretti, Vittorio Maria1 aBersani, Carla1 aCattaneo, Patrizia0 tItalian journal of food safety.g2016 Nov. 17, v. 5, no. 4dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-71327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ijfs.2016.61653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010300162300001400265520068900279592002800968650001500996650002601011650001201037650001101049651001401060651001901074653001301093653001501106653001001121653001001131653001101141653001201152700001701164700001701181773011601198856008201314852000901396655001201405IND60549543720221118001434.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiez, M.E.10aPearls in the ribbed mussel Aulacomya atra caused by polydorin polychaetes (Spionidae) infestation  ap. 42-45.  aAulacomya atra populations of the San Jose gulf, Northern Patagonia, Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, are infested by two polydorin species, Polydora rickettsi and Dipolydora cf. giardi. The infestation by these boring polychaetes causes the formation of pearls which is evidenced by the presence of capsules containing polydorin tissue debris and the elemental composition of organic material inside the pearls. Moreover, a positive relationship between the abundance of perforations of polydorin polychaetes and abundance of pearls was found by applying generalized lineal model analysis. These results constitute the first evidence of pearls formation due to infestation by polychaete.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3aelemental composition 3amussels 3apearls 3aArgentina 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aPolydora 0aDipolydora 0aShell 0aPearl 0aDamage 0aMollusc1 aVázquez, N.1 aCremonte, F.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2016 Oct., v. 140 p.42-45dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010400157520172800261592002801989650001202017650001202029650001102041650005002052650003202102650001502134650001602149650001902165650001202184650001602196651001002212700001502222700001702237700001802254700001802272700001602290700001602306700002102322700001702343700001702360773012802377856007502505852000902580655001202589IND60703879220221119130417.0200721e20200324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070387922DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120610372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Aixia 10aRadiometric Cross-Calibration of the Wide Field View Camera Onboard GaoFen-6 in Multispectral Bands  aGaoFen6 (GF-6), successfully launched on June 2, 2018, is the sixth satellite of the High-Definition Earth observation system (HDEOS). Although GF-6 is the first high-resolution satellite in China to achieve precise agricultural observation, it will be widely used in many other domains, such as land survey, natural resources management, emergency management, ecological environment and so on. The GF-6 was not equipped with an onboard calibration instrument, so on-orbit radiometric calibration is essential. This paper aimed at the on-orbit radiometric calibration of the wide field of view camera (WFV) onboard GF-6 (GF-6/WFV) in multispectral bands. Firstly, the radiometric capability of GF-6/WFV is evaluated compared with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8, Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra, which shows that GF-6/WFV has an obvious attenuation. Consequently, instead of vicarious calibration once a year, more frequent calibration is required to guarantee its radiometric consistency. The cross-calibration method based on the Badain Jaran Desert site using the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model calculated by Landsat-8/OLI and ZY-3/Three-Line Camera (TLC) data is subsequently applied to GF-6/WFV and much higher frequencies of calibration are achieved. Finally, the cross-calibration results are validated using the synchronized ground measurements at Dunhuang test site and the uncertainty of the proposed method is analyzed. The validation shows that the relative difference of cross-calibration is less than 5% and it is satisfied with the requirements of cross-calibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acameras 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anatural resource management 3aradiometry 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3aChina1 aZhong, Bo 1 aHu, Longfei 1 aWu, Shanlong 1 aXu, Zhaopeng 1 aWu, Hongbo 1 aWu, Junjun 1 aGong, Xueshuang 1 aWang, Haibo 1 aLiu, Qinhuo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 24, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120610373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013700171500001400308520119200322592002801514650001201542650001501554650001501569650001101584650001301595650001301608650001201621650001301633650001501646650001101661650001001672650001301682650001601695653000801711653000901719653002001728653000801748653000801756653000901764653001701773700001901790700001701809700006001826773011301886856008601999852000902085655001202094IND60719493220221118213206.0210201e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1251482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGórecki, Jerzy14aThe development and validation of a rapid, in situ method of the determination of NH3 in solid by-products of the combustion process  aNAL-light  aThis article presents the following: the developed apparatus and a rapid, in situ (industrial) method of the determination of NH₃ in fly ash and gypsum and the application of the method to real samples. Ammonia is released from the fly ash sample by means of the thermal method in 500–600 °C, using a specially designed 500 W electric tubular furnace. The NH₃ is determined by means of a Tunable Diode Laser Spectroscope (TDLS). The range of the method is from 0.18 to 375 μg NH₃ and the duration of a single analysis is from 2 to 20 min (depending on the concentration of ammonia in the sample). The constructed system is mobile and it can be used for in situ measurements in industrial conditions. The method can be used both to optimize the operation of DeNOx systems (high NH₃ concentration in fly ash) and to measure the level of ammonia in the product (NH₃ concentration below 100 mg/kg). The method that was developed has been validated and the uncertainty of the method was estimated in accordance with EURACHM guidelines. The paper describes the use of the developed method to optimize the SCR system operation and reduce ammonia slip in fly ash and flue gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abyproducts 3acombustion 3adiodes 3aduration 3aflue gas 3afly ash 3afurnaces 3aguidelines 3agypsum 3apaper 3asampling 3auncertainty 0aNH3 0aCoal 0aDenitrification 0aNOx 0aSCR 0aSNCR 0aAmmonia slip1 aBorovec, Karel1 aPilar, Lukas1 aMarcola, Justyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7934-13150 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 281 p.125148-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1251483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245013700158300001400295520128800309592002801597650001201625650001301637650001501650650002301665650001501688650001101703650001101714650001101725651001801736651001101754651001501765653001201780653002201792653001901814653001901833653001901852653001801871700001401889700001901903773010501922856007702027852000902104655001202113IND60560923520221120180445.0170112e20161103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092352DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-01782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatt, C.A.10aSpatial distribution of narwhal (Monodon monoceros) diving for Canadian populations helps identify important seasonal foraging areas  ap. 41-50.  aIn Canada, narwhals (Monodon monoceros L., 1758) are divided into the Baffin Bay (BB) and northern Hudson Bay (NHB) populations. Satellite tracking of 21 narwhals from BB and NHB provided information on their diving behaviour and was used to identify foraging regions. Previous research from hunted narwhals indicated that narwhals in both populations depend on benthic prey to meet their dietary needs. To evaluate home ranges and define areas important for benthic foraging, we conducted kernel density analysis on narwhal locations and focused on areas where deep diving occurs, as a proxy for foraging, in the winter, spring, and migratory periods. These analyses revealed important areas for foraging for BB narwhals on the summer grounds in Eclipse Sound, and the winter grounds in Davis Strait, as well as on the migratory pathway between regions. Similarly, important areas were identified for the NHB narwhal population in northwestern Hudson Bay in summer, in NHB and Hudson Strait on the migration, and to the east of the entrance to Hudson Strait in the winter. This, along with an analysis of the absolute dive depths, provides information on seasons and regions important for foraging, which is particularly relevant with increasing industrial activities in the Arctic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonodon 3aforaging 3ahome range 3amigratory behavior 3asatellites 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aArctic region 3aCanada 3aHudson Bay 0anarwhal 0aMonodon monoceros 0asatellite tags 0adive behaviour 0aforaging range 0aseasonal diet1 aOrr, J.R.1 aFerguson, S.H.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 Nov. 3, v. 95, no. 1 p.41-50dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-01783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162500002200285520091800307592002801225650002501253650002201278650001701300650002101317650001301338650001301351650004201364650002401406653002701430653001901457653002001476653001101496700001401507700001501521700001801536700001901554700001801573773006801591856008101659852000901740655001201749IND60570512720221121155035.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Rong10aSimultaneous detection of two hepatocellar carcinoma-related microRNAs using a clever single-labeled fluorescent probe  aPre-press version  aThe simultaneous detection of two important microRNAs (miRNAs) can potentially evaluate pathological states. The simultaneous detection of miRNA-26a and miRNA-122 is proposed in this study using a cleverly designed single-labeled, dual-functional fluorescent probe with a 2-aminopurine as a fluorophore, which is a G-quadruplex single-stranded DNA. The probe can partly complement cDNA-1 and cDNA-2. cDNA-1 and cDNA-2 are complementary strands of miRNA-26a and miRNA-122, respectively. When the target miRNAs are added simultaneously, these cDNA (cDNA-1 and cDNA-2) can be competed off from the cDNA∖probe duplex to form a cDNA∖RNA heteroduplex. The probe is released and the fluorescent signal is increased. The detection limits of miRNA-26a and miRNA-122 are both 2.5 nM, and their wide linear which ranges from 2.5 to 500 nM are achieved using the assay. This method has potential practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acomplementary DNA 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahepatoma 3amicroRNA 3apathological processes and conditions 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aSimultaneous detection 0aSingle-labeled 0aDual-functional 0amiRNAs1 aLi, Shiyu1 aWang, Huan1 aChen, Chunyan1 aChen, Xiaoming1 aCai, Changqun0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245014000171300001400311520133200325592002801657650003101685650002501716650001001741650001901751650001101770650001701781650001601798650001801814650002601832650001501858650002601873650001301899650002101912650001701933650001701950650001301967650002801980650001402008650001802022650001802040650001602058653003102074653001302105653001502118653003302133653001702166653002202183700001702205700005702222700001602279700001802295700005502313773012202368856008902490852000902579655001202588IND60605763720221121043817.0200121e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qiaochu10aRed light-emitting diode irradiation regulates oxidative stress and inflammation through SPHK1/NF-κB activation in human keratinocytes  ap. 31-40.  aOxidative stress, in which the amount of oxidants exceeds the capacity of antioxidant defense system, is a well-accepted pathogenesis of several human diseases. Light-emitting diode irradiation (LEDI) is an efficient strategy to counteract this condition. The biological effect of phototherapy, using visible light, has attracted recent attention especially in dermatological practice. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of red light irradiation. We evaluated these effects of LEDI in HaCaT human keratinocyte cells under phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Microarray analysis revealed changes in 309 genes after LEDI. LEDI at 625 nm produced ROS scavenging and anti-inflammatory effects. One of the most important genes identified by microarray analysis was sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1), which is a key molecule in sphingolipid metabolism. SPHK1 knock-down drastically reduced ROS scavenging efficiency as well as expression levels of inflammation-related proteins in PMA-treated HaCaT cells. These results not only indicate the potential for the clinical application of 625-nm LEDI in treating skin disorders via ROS and/or inflammation, but also suggest SPHK1 as a potential therapeutic target in phototherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3airradiation 3akeratinocytes 3alight emitting diodes 3ametabolism 3amicroarray technology 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aphototherapy 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3ared light 3askin diseases 3asphingolipids 3asphingosine 0aLight-emitting diode (LED) 0a625 nm 0aMicroarray 0aSphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) 0aAnti-oxidant 0aAnti-inflammation1 aKim, Hye-Eun1 aCho, Hyejoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8038-46511 aShi, Shuhan1 aKim, Byungkuk1 aKim, Okjoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6347-14110 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2018 Sept., v. 186 p.31-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010800155520213900263592002802402650002002430650001502450650003202465650002002497650001102517650001502528650004002543650001602583650001902599650002302618650001602641650002102657700001802678700001702696700001902713700002802732700001702760700001602777700001602793700001302809773012802822856007502950852000903025655001203034IND60703879320221119130346.0200721e20200312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070387932DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120609122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qiong 10aEvaluation of Global Decametric-Resolution LAI, FAPAR and FVC Estimates Derived from Sentinel-2 Imagery  aGlobal biophysical products at decametric resolution derived from Sentinel-2 imagery have emerged as a promising dataset for fine-scale ecosystem modeling and agricultural monitoring. Evaluating uncertainties of different Sentinel-2 biophysical products over various regions and vegetation types is pivotal in the application of land surface models. In this study, we quantified the performance of Sentinel-2-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) estimates using global ground observations with consistent measurement criteria. Our results show that the accuracy of vegetation and non-vegetated classification based on Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products is greater than 95%, which indicates the vegetation identification is favorable for the practical application of biophysical estimates, as several LAI, FAPAR, and FVC retrievals were derived for non-vegetated pixels. The rate of best retrievals is similar between LAI and FAPAR estimates, both accounting for 87% of all vegetation pixels, while it is almost 100% for FVC estimates. Additionally, the Sentinel-2 FAPAR and FVC estimates agree well with ground-measurements-derived (GMD) reference maps, whereas a large discrepancy is observed for Sentinel-2 LAI estimates by comparing with both GMD effective LAI (LAIₑ) and actual LAI (LAI) reference maps. Furthermore, the uncertainties of Sentinel-2 LAI, FAPAR and FVC estimates are 1.09 m²/m², 1.14 m²/m², 0.13 and 0.17 through comparisons to ground LAIₑ, LAI, FAPAR, and FVC measurements, respectively. Given the temporal difference between Sentinel-2 observations and ground measurements, Sentinel-2 LAI estimates are more consistent with LAIₑ than LAI values. The robustness of evaluation results can be further improved as long as more multi-temporal ground measurements across different regions are obtained. Overall, this study provides fundamental information about the performance of Sentinel-2 LAI, FAPAR, and FVC estimates, which imbues our confidence in the broad applications of these decametric products.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afractional vegetation cover 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3atemporal variation 3auncertainty 3avegetation types1 aYang, Jingya 1 aXu, Baodong 1 aHuang, Jianxi 1 aMemon, Muhammad  Sohail1 aYin, Gaofei 1 aZeng, Yelu 1 aZhao, Jing 1 aLiu, Ke 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Mar. 12, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120609123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245009400158300001400252520134200266592002801608650002101636650002101657650002701678650001001705650001101715650000901726650001201735650001601747651001301763653001901776653002101795653001401816653001801830653002801848700001701876700001601893773010601909856007702015852000902092655001202101IND60560923620221120180457.0170112e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056092362DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2016-01802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurt, D.M.10aClimate factors related to localized changes in snowshoe hare (Lepusamericanus) occupancy  ap. 15-22.  aInformation on climate that influences snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777) can inform adaptation strategies. We identified climate factors correlated with localized changes in occupancy of snowshoe hares in Michigan, USA. A change in occupancy occurred if a site (∼7.5 ha) knowingly occupied by hares sometime in the past became unoccupied. We used local ecological knowledge to map sites where hares historically occurred and to assign a year of last-known occupancy. At 134 historically occupied sites, we conducted snow track surveys in 2013 to determine current occupancy status. We identified climate variables having relevance to hare population demographics and modeled the likelihood that those variables influenced current occupancy status. The top-ranking model included maximum temperature from 15 May to 19 January; as maximum temperature increased, the likelihood of a site becoming unoccupied increased. The second-ranked model included total number of days with measurable snow on the ground; as days with snow on the ground decreased, the likelihood of a site becoming unoccupied increased. Our data indicated that site occupancy status of hares can be described by climate variables and that the southern edge of snowshoe hare distribution in Michigan shifted northward by ∼45 km over the last 20 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepus americanus 3aclimatic factors 3ademographic statistics 3ahares 3amodels 3asnow 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aMichigan 0aclimate change 0aLepus americanus 0aoccupancy 0asnowshoe hare 0asouthern range boundary1 aRoloff, G.J.1 aEtter, D.R.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 95, no. 1 p.15-22dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-01803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015600171500001400327520148400341592002801825650003001853650001701883650001701900650002201917650001901939650003001958650002301988650002202011650001602033650001802049650002002067650002502087650002202112650001502134650002402149650002202173650002002195650001202215650001502227650002002242650001102262650001002273650001302283650001302296650001902309650000902328650001602337651001102353651001102364653002802375653003002403653002402433653002802457653003002485700002002515700002502535700005502560700006002615700002202675700001902697700002202716700001902738773011302757856008602870852000902956655001202965IND60719493320221118212740.0210121e20210220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071949332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1251612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBranca, Giacomo10aAssessing the economic and mitigation benefits of climate-smart agriculture and its implications for political economy: A case study in Southern Africa  aNAL-light  aClimate change poses a serious risk to the economic growth of sub-Saharan Africa. Sustainable enhancement of resilience and mitigation capacity of small farm households is a major political economy goal. This paper has the objective to assess the on-farm economic and mitigation benefits of climate-smart agriculture production and their cost-effectiveness to be used as a prioritization criterion for policy incentives. An interdisciplinary model which integrates elements of economics and ecological science at farm-scale is developed and applied using a unique dataset for Malawi and Zambia built through household surveys. Results show that switching from conventional to climate-smart farming enhances economic returns more significantly in semi-dry areas than in sub-humid ones. However, high up-front costs hinder technology adoption. Negative abatement costs for most smart farming options indicate synergies between livelihood enhancement and mitigation. Land management based on minimum tillage, crop residues incorporation, use of cover crops, and inclusion of legumes has relatively higher economic returns. Agroforestry provides lower economic returns but the highest emission abatement potential. Payments for mitigation benefits could be a management strategy to incentivize cleaner agriculture production if tailored appropriately. These results strengthen the case for public support to climate-smart agriculture scaling-up within policy and planning strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aagroforestry 3acase studies 3achemical elements 3aclimate change 3aclimate-smart agriculture 3acost effectiveness 3acosts and returns 3acover crops 3acrop residues 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3ainnovation adoption 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3alegumes 3alivelihood 3aminimum tillage 3amodels 3apaper 3aplanning 3apolitics 3aprioritization 3arisk 3asmall farms 3aMalawi 3aZambia 0aSustainable agriculture 0aEcological-economic model 0aSmallholder farming 0aMarginal abatement cost 0aCost-effective mitigation1 aArslan, Aslihan1 aPaolantonio, Adriana1 aGrewer, Uwe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8665-75611 aCattaneo, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8845-50201 aCavatassi, Romina1 aLipper, Leslie1 aHillier, Jonathan1 aVetter, Sylvia0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.125161-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1251613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245014700188300001200335520167900347592002802026650001802054650001302072650002102085650001202106650001302118650002602131650001102157650001502168650001602183650001302199650000802212650001302220650003002233651001002263700002402273700001702297700002102314773009702335856004802432852000902480655001202489IND50070572420221119224507.0131112e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007057242DNAL7 a241420372pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-013-9933-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherman, Louis A.10aHighlights from the Indo-US workshop “Cyanobacteria: molecular networks to biofuels” held at Lonavala, India during December 16–20, 2012  ap. 1-8.  aAn Indo-US workshop on “Cyanobacteria: molecular networks to biofuels” was held December 16–20, 2012 at Lagoona Resort, Lonavala, India. The workshop was jointly organized by two of the authors, PPW, a chemical engineer and LAS, a biologist, thereby ensuring a broad and cross-disciplinary participation. The main objective of the workshop was to bring researchers from academia and industry of the two countries together with common interests in cyanobacteria or microalgae and derived biofuels. An exchange of ideas resulted from a series of oral and poster presentations and, importantly, through one-on-one discussions during tea breaks and meals. Another key objective was to introduce young researchers of India to the exciting field of cyanobacterial physiology, modeling, and biofuels. PhD students and early stage researchers were especially encouraged to participate and about half of the 75 participants belonged to this category. The rest were comprised of senior researchers, including 13–15 invited speakers from each country. Overall, twenty-four institutes from 12 states of India were represented. The deliberations, which are being compiled in the present special issue, revolved mainly around molecular aspects of cyanobacterial biofuels including metabolic engineering, networks, genetic regulation, circadian rhythms, and stress responses. Representatives of some key funding agencies and industry provided a perspective and opportunities in the field and for bilateral collaboration. This article summarizes deliberations that took place at the meeting and provides a bird’s eye view of the ongoing research in the field in the two countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3abiofuels 3acircadian rhythm 3afunding 3aindustry 3ametabolic engineering 3amodels 3aphysiology 3aresearchers 3astudents 3atea 2aBiofuels 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolism 3aIndia1 aWangikar, Pramod P.1 aSwarup, Renu1 aKasture, Sangita0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2013 Nov., v. 118, no. 1-2 p.1-8dSpringer-Verlagx0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-013-9933-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245010100169300001600270506010400286506007600390520151900466592002801985506003702013650002102050650001702071650001702088650001902105650001802124650003202142650001202174650001302186650001402199653001802213653001702231653001502248653001502263653001202278653002002290700002402310700001802334700002502352700002402377700001702401700001602418700002202434700001702456700002002473700002102493700002202514700001702536700002002553700001902573700002102592700002002613700002002633700001902653700001902672773014702691856008402838852000902922655001202931IND60770196420221207131416.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077019642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2022.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, Joseph P.10aMulti-omic based production strain improvement (MOBpsi) for bio-manufacturing of toxic chemicals  ap. 133-149.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRobust systematic approaches for the metabolic engineering of cell factories remain elusive. The available models for predicting phenotypical responses and mechanisms are incomplete, particularly within the context of compound toxicity that can be a significant impediment to achieving high yields of a target product. This study describes a Multi-Omic Based Production Strain Improvement (MOBpsi) strategy that is distinguished by integrated time-resolved systems analyses of fed-batch fermentations. As a case study, MOBpsi was applied to improve the performance of an Escherichia coli cell factory producing the commodity chemical styrene. Styrene can be bio-manufactured from phenylalanine via an engineered pathway comprised of the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase and ferulic acid decarboxylase. The toxicity, hydrophobicity, and volatility of styrene combine to make bio-production challenging. Previous attempts to create styrene tolerant E. coli strains by targeted genetic interventions have met with modest success. Application of MOBpsi identified new potential targets for improving performance, resulting in two host strains (E. coli NST74ΔaaeA and NST74ΔaaeA cpxPₒ) with increased styrene production. The best performing re-engineered chassis, NST74ΔaaeA cpxPₒ, produced ∼3 × more styrene and exhibited increased viability in fed-batch fermentations. Thus, this case study demonstrates the utility of MOBpsi as a systematic tool for improving the bio-manufacturing of toxic chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3acase studies 3aferulic acid 3ahydrophobicity 3aphenylalanine 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3astyrene 3atoxicity 3aviability 0aBiotechnology 0aCell factory 0aLipidomics 0aProteomics 0aStyrene 0aTranscriptomics1 aPaiva, Ana Carolina1 aRossoni, Luca1 aAlstrom-Moore, Amias1 aSpringthorpe, Vicki1 aVaud, Sophie1 aYeh, Vivien1 aMinde, David-Paul1 aLanger, Sven1 aWalker, Heather1 aHounslow, Andrea1 aNielsen, David R.1 aLarson, Tony1 aLilley, Kathryn1 aStephens, Gill1 aThomas, Gavin H.1 aBonev, Boyan B.1 aKelly, David J.1 aConradie, Alex1 aGreen, Jeffrey0 tMetabolic engineering.g2022 July, v. 72 p.133-149dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2022.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008100167300001600248520112700264592002801391650001501419650001101434650002401445650001101469650001701480650002501497651001201522653002501534653004901559653001701608653003801625700006101663773009701724856008501821852000901906655001201915IND60567460220221120160047.0180831e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2016.05.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qingqing10aModelling and control of solar thermal system with borehole seasonal storage  ap. 114-128.  aThe paper addresses the problem of controlling a solar thermal storage system with the purpose of achieving a desired thermal comfort level and energy savings. A solar thermal power plant is used for heating district houses with borehole seasonal energy storage. As the energy output from the solar thermal plant with borehole seasonal storage varies, the control system maintains the thermal comfort by using a servo controller. In this work, the modelling of the solar thermal system with borehole seasonal storage is inspired by the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada [1]. The discrete model of the integrated energy system is obtained by using energy preserving Cayley-Tustin discretization. A simple and easily realizable servo control algorithm is designed to regulate the system operating at desired thermal comfort level despite disturbances from the solar thermal plant system, the borehole geo-thermal energy storage system and/or the district heating loop system. Finally, the performance of the servo controller and frequency analysis of the plant is given in simulation results section.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3amodels 3apower plants 3asolar thermal energy 3aAlberta 0aSolar thermal system 0aBorehole geo-thermal seasonal storage system 0aServo design 0aCayley-Tustin time discretization1 aDubljevic, Stevan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1889-15990 tRenewable energy.g2017 Jan., v. 100 p.114-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2016.05.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012700206300001600333520189300349592002802242650002202270650001102292650001502303650000902318650001202327650001402339650001202353650001502365650001302380650001702393650000902410650001302419650001402432650001402446650001202460650001802472650001202490650001302502650001002515653002402525653003502549653000902584653001402593653001502607700002002622700002602642700002402668700005802692773011802750856008302868852000902951655001202960IND60549544220221118001319.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054954422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2016.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Tam T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0282-776010aEffect of diet on phosphine toxicity, rate of development and reproduction of the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae (Linnaeus)  ap. 221-226.  aOne of the loci responsible for strong phosphine resistance encodes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD). The strong co-incidence of enzyme complexes that contain DLD, and enzymes that require thiamine as a cofactor, motivated us to test whether the thiamine deficiency of polished white rice could influence the efficacy of phosphine fumigation against insect pests of stored grain. Three strains of Sitophilus oryzae (susceptible, weak and strong resistance) were cultured on white rice (thiamine deficient), brown rice or whole wheat. As thiamine is an essential nutrient, we firstly evaluated the effect of white rice on developmental rate and fecundity and found that both were detrimentally affected by this diet. The mean time to reach adult stage for the three strains ranged from 40 to 43 days on brown rice and 50–52 days on white rice. The mean number of offspring for the three strains ranged from 7.7 to 10.3 per female over a three day period on brown rice and 2.1 to 2.6 on white rice. Growth and reproduction on wheat was similar to that on brown rice except that the strongly resistant strain showed a tendency toward reduced fecundity on wheat. The susceptible strain exhibited a modest increase in tolerance to phosphine on white rice as expected if thiamine deficiency could mimic the effect of the dld resistance mutation at the rph2 locus. The strongly resistant strain did not respond to thiamine deficiency, but this was expected as these insects are already strongly resistant. We failed, however, to observe the expected synergistic increase in resistance due to combining thiamine deficiency with the weakly resistant strain. The lack of interaction between thiamine content of the diet and the resistance genotype in determining the phosphine resistance phenotype suggests that the mode of inhibition of the complexes is a critical determinant of resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aadults 3abrown rice 3adiet 3aenzymes 3afecundity 3afemales 3afumigation 3agenotype 3ainsect pests 3aloci 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aphosphine 3aprogeny 3astorage pests 3athiamin 3atoxicity 3awheat 0aThiamine deficiency 0aDihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 0arph2 0aPhosphine 0aFumigation1 aKaur, Ramandeep1 aSchlipalius, David I.1 aCollins, Patrick J.1 aEbert, Paul R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4435-07370 tJournal of stored products research.g2016 Oct., v. 69 p.221-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006500188245013400253300001200387506007600399520143100475592002801906596005201934596007901986596008002065596007802145506003702223650002202260650001302282650001702295650002102312650001802333650001902351650000902370650001002379650001202389650000702401650001702408650000902425650001302434650001402447700006302461700006402524773011602588856008202704852000902786655001202795IND60644603720221207115328.0190623e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460372DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1744-22doi7 aPMC65225932pmcid7 a311147372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalazzolo, Martín A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7134-230210aFrom agro-waste to tool: biotechnological characterization and application of Ganoderma lucidum E47 laccase in dye decolorization  ap. 213.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe culture of fungal species from agro-waste allows for the sustainable preparation of valuable biotechnological products and contributes to establish the Circular Economy concept. The Ganoderma lucidum species is well known as producer of laccases (EC 1.10.3.2), which serves as a tool to oxidize chemicals. When producing G. lucidum E47 basidiomes with edible purposes out of rice crop residues, its laccase remains as by-product. In this work, we report the biotechnological characterization and application of the laccase recovered from spent cultures of the G. lucidum E47 strain. We detected at least one polypeptide (ca. 59 kDa) which displays attractive activity and stability values when used in the range of 18–45 °C in mildly acidic environment (pH 4.8–5.8). These parameters can be enhanced in the presence of organic cosolvents such as butyl acetate and methyl iso-butyl ketone, but the opposite effect is observed with solvents of lower log P. The best activity–stability performance is reached when the biocatalyst is used in pH 4.8 buffer with 5% (v/v) butyl acetate at 37 °C. The laccase was capable of decolorizing xanthene, azo and triarylmethane dyes, exhibiting excellent selectivity on bromocresol green and bromocresol purple. Furthermore, the biocatalyst displayed an attractive activity when assessed for the decolorization of bromocresol green in a proof-of-concept effluent biotreatment.  aPublisher supplied data  aPROICO 2-1716cUniversidad Nacional de San Luis  aPIP 2015 090cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aPDTS 2014 0492cMinisterio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva  aPICT 2014 0654cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aacetates 3abiocatalysts 3acircular economy 3acrop residues 3adecolorization 3adyes 3afungi 3alaccase 3apH 3apolypeptides 3arice 3asolvents 3axanthenes1 aPostemsky, Pablo D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2174-16281 aKurina-Sanz, Marcela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9839-65730 t3 Biotech.g2019 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.213-213dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1744-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003200154245009500186300001400281520152500295592002801820650001601848650001501864650001601879650001601895650002201911650002601933650001101959650001801970650002001988650002402008650001802032650001302050653002302063653001602086653001302102653001302115653001602128653003302144700002902177773012202206856008902328852000902417655001202426IND60605764020221121054355.0200121e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaik, Sangeeta Mahableshwar10aInfluence of darkness on pigments of Tetraselmis indica (Chlorodendrophyceae, Chlorophyta)  ap. 17-22.  aIn the photic zone, phytoplankton experience diurnal variation in light intensity. However, prolonged exposure to aphotic condition influences their physiological state. Pigment composition is a useful biomarker to decipher cells physiological state and adaptive response to changing environmental conditions. Chlorophyll, a natural pigment, is biosynthesised even in darkness and studies have shown this ability is determined by genetic characteristics of an organism. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of darkness on pigments and chlorophyll autofluorescence of Tetraselmis indica. Dark exposure (up to 6 months) had no significant impact on chlorophyll a and b concentration, whereas carotenoids were enhanced. Upon re-illumination pigments gradually recovered to pre-dark phase condition. These adaptive survival strategies of T. indica by altering pigment concentration in response to prolonged darkness are interesting. The absence of loroxanthin and loroxanthin esters in T. indica is reported in a first Tetraselmis species so far. In addition, the evaluation of autofluorescence and cellular chlorophyll concentration pointed out that they are not interdependent in this species. Hence, careful consideration of these two factors is needed when either of them is used as a proxy for other. The results obtained encourage a thorough study of pigment analysis, especially when subjected to darkness, to elucidate potential role in the evolution, chemotaxonomy, and survivability of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetraselmis 3abiomarkers 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adiurnal variation 3aenvironmental factors 3aesters 3aeuphotic zone 3alight intensity 3aphysiological state 3aphytoplankton 3apigments 0aTetraselmis indica 0aGreen algae 0aSurvival 0aPigments 0aLoroxanthin 0aChlorophyll autofluorescence1 aAnil, Arga Chandrashekar0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2018 Sept., v. 186 p.17-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007700184300001800261520114500279592002801424650001801452650000901470650002201479650001601501650002301517650001301540650002301553650001601576650001701592650001001609650002001619650002001639700001601659700001801675700001901693700002001712700001301732700001901745700001701764700001901781773012301800856008201923852000902005655001202014IND50089427520221119091701.0220304e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008942752DNAL7 a247001672pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3205-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Ling-Bo12aA systematic proteomic analysis of NaCl-stressed germinating maize seeds  ap. 3431-3443.  aSalt (NaCl) is a common physiological stressor of plants. To better understand how germinating seeds respond to salt stress, we examined the changes that occurred in the proteome of maize seeds during NaCl-treated germination. Phenotypically, salt concentrations less than 0.2 M appear to delay germination, while higher concentrations disrupt development completely, leading to seed death. The identities of 96 proteins with expression levels altered by NaCl-incubation were established using 2-DE-MALDI-TOF–MS and 2-DE-MALDI-TOF–MS/MS. Of these 96 proteins, 79 were altered greater than twofold when incubated with a 0.2 M salt solution, while 51 were altered when incubated with a 0.1 M salt solution. According to their functional annotations in the Swiss-Prot protein-sequence databases, these proteins are mainly involved in seed storage, energy metabolism, stress response, and protein metabolism. Notably, the expression of proteins that respond to abscisic acid signals increased in response to salt stress. The results of this study provide important clues as to how NaCl stresses the physiology of germinating maize seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3acorn 3aenergy metabolism 3agermination 3aprotein metabolism 3aproteins 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3aseed storage 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3astress response1 aChen, Yi-Bo1 aLu, Tian-Cong1 aWang, Yue-Feng1 aQian, Chun-Rong1 aYu, Yang1 aGe, Xuan-Liang1 aLi, Xiao-Hui1 aWang, Bai-Chen0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.3431-3443dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3205-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01420naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245014300167300001800310520034200328592002800670650001300698650002700711650002300738650001100761650001200772650001400784700003000798700003000828700001900858773013400877856007401011852000901085655001201094IND60659576620221121100143.0190823e20120620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065957662DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc32725b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvarez, Celedonio M.10aBeyond click chemistry: spontaneous C-triazolyl transfer from copper to rhenium and transformation into mesoionic C-triazolylidene carbene  ap. 7209-7211.  aThe exceptional versatility of the 1,2,3-triazole ring in tridentate carbonyl rhenium complexes has been explored starting from a “click chemistry” unexpected product obtained from the spontaneous copper to rhenium transmetalation, which opens the way to successive transformation to C-triazolyl and triazolylidene mesoionic carbene.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbenes 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3acopper 3arhenium 3atriazoles1 aGarcía-Escudero, Luis A.1 aGarcía-Rodríguez, Raúl1 aMiguel, Daniel0 tChemical communications.g2012 June 20, v. 48, no. 57 p.7209-7211dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc32725b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002100167245010300188300001600291520146200307592002801769650001801797650002001815650001501835650001001850650003001860650001401890650001601904650002501920650001401945650001801959650006801977650002602045650002902071650002602100650002802126650001402154651001102168651001502179651001602194700002002210700002302230700002402253700002502277700002202302700002502324773008702349856008402436852000902520655001202529IND4449776120221119023436.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444977612DNAL7 a213153152pmid7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2010.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrey, James D.14aThe obligately lichenicolous genus Lichenoconium represents a novel lineage in the Dothideomycetes  ap. 176-187.  aLichenicolous fungi are obligately lichen-associated organisms that have evolved many times throughout the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Approximately 20% of lichenicolous ascomycetes are recognized only from asexual (anamorphic) characteristics, so the phylogenetic position of many groups has never been resolved. Here we present the first molecular phylogeny of Lichenoconium, a genus of strictly asexual, obligately lichenicolous species with broad geographic distributions and diverse host ecologies. We obtained nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences from fungal cultures isolated from four species in the genus, including a new species, Lichenoconium aeruginosum sp. nov., collected in France, Luxembourg and Netherlands. Our multilocus phylogeny supports the monophyly of fungi in the genus Lichenoconium, and places the genus in the Dothideomycetes, an ascomycete class made up mainly of saprobes and plant-associated endophytes and pathogens. There are only a few recognized groups of lichen-formers in the Dothideomycetes, but Lichenoconium is not supported as being closely related to any of these, nor to any other recognized order within the Dothideomycetes. Given that Lichenoconium is but one of over 100 genera of anamorphic lichenicolous fungi, most of which have never been studied phylogenetically, we suggest that asexual lichenicolous fungi may represent novel and evolutionarily significant phylogenetic groups in the Kingdom Fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBasidiomycota 3aDothideomycetes 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3amonophyly 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aribosomal DNA 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aLichensxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 3aFrance 3aLuxembourg 3aNetherlands1 aDiederich, Paul1 aNelsen, Matthew P.1 aSikaroodi, Masoumeh1 aGillevet, Patrick M.1 aBrand, A.

The oxidation is a two-electron process with oxidation potentials at ~0.94 and ~1.14 V vs SCE (reference to ferrocene at 0.528 V) in THF. These potentials are higher than that of symmetrical canthaxanthin at 0.775 V and 0.972 V and for β-carotene at 0.634 V and 0.605 V respectively. The second oxidation potential for canthaxanthin is higher by 0.20 V than the first. Similar difference is observed for bixin. In contrast, the second oxidation potential for β-carotene is lower by 30 mV than that of the first. Reduction potentials were found to occur at ~−0.69 and ~−1.22 V vs SCE. The lifetime of the radical cation of cis bixin, Car⁺, is short and decays rapidly at ambient temperature. The suggested scavenging ability of cis bixin towards reactive oxidative oxygen species is estimated to be 44. On the other hand, that of β-carotene, symmetrical canthaxanthin and the dicyano substituted carotenoid which exhibit oxidation potentials of 0.634 V, 0.775 V and 0.833 V vs SCE were measured to be 0.64, 1.96 and 23.60 respectively. The non-reversible electrochemical measurements suggest the tendency for bixin to react with trace amounts of reactive oxygen species (OH, O₂⁻, OOH).  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abeta-carotene 3acanthaxanthin 3acations 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxidation 3asuperoxide anion 0aIrreversible cyclic voltammetry 0aBixin 0aRedox potential 0aRadical cation 0aDication1 aStreet, Shane1 aKispert, Lowell0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2018 Sept., v. 186 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2018.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245020400183300001800387520177700405592002802182650001702210650003802227650001302265650001002278650001002288650002202298650001902320650001302339650001402352650003502366700002002401700001602421700001902437700001802456700001802474700001802492700001802510700002002528773012302548856008202671852000902753655001202762IND50089427720221119091752.0220304e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008942772DNAL7 a245104092pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3207-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Su Kang10aAssociation study between monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene polymorphisms and schizophrenia: lack of association with schizophrenia and possible association with affective disturbances of schizophrenia  ap. 3457-3464.  aMonoamine oxidase A (MAOA) catalyzes monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), and norepinephrine. MAOA also plays a key role in emotional regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MAOA gene located on the X chromosome and schizophrenia. We also analyzed the relationships between these SNPs and the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia such as persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations, affective disturbances, and poor concentration. Two hundred seventy five Korean schizophrenia patients and 289 control subjects were recruited. Three SNPs [rs6323 (Arg294Arg), rs1137070 (Asp470Asp), and rs3027407 (3′-untranslated region)] of the MAOA gene were selected and genotyped by direct sequencing. The common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia according to the Operation Criteria Checklist were analyzed. Three examined SNPs showed no associations with male and female schizophrenia, respectively (p > 0.05). In the analysis of the common clinical symptoms of schizophrenia patients, three examined SNPs were associated with affective disturbances, especially restricted affect and blunted affect in male schizophrenia, respectively (restricted affect, p = 0.002, OR = 2.71, 95 % CI 1.45–5.00; blunted affect, p = 0.009, OR 2.25, 95 % CI 1.22–4.12). The SNPs were not associated with other clinical symptoms of schizophrenia (persecutory delusion, auditory hallucinations, and poor concentration). These results suggest that exonic SNPs (rs6323, rs1137070, and rs3027407) of the MAOA gene may be contributed to affective disturbances of Korean males schizophrenia, especially restricted affect and blunted affect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX chromosome 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3adopamine 3agenes 3amales 3aneurotransmitters 3anorepinephrine 3apatients 3aserotonin 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aPark, Hae Jeong1 aSeok, Hosik1 aJeon, Hye Sook1 aChung, Joo-Ho1 aKang, Won Sub1 aKim, Jong Woo1 aYu, Gyeong Im1 aShin, Dong Hoon0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.3457-3464dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3207-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014000206300001600346520178800362592002802150596005902178596008402237650001702321650001402338650002302352650001402375650000902389650002202398650001902420650002102439650002302460650001902483650001602502650001402518650001102532650002202543700001602565700001602581700001802597773010902615856008302724852000902807655001202816IND60765833520221118215106.0220203e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04336-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shiliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7079-330710aGraphene-oxide-bacterial-cellulose nanohybrid gives a “substrate-driven enhancement” effect to catalytic activity of phthalocyanine  ap. 849-861.  aThe understanding of interaction between graphene oxide (GO) and bacterial cellulose (BC) at molecular level is indispensable for meeting the goal of constructing a graphene-oxide-bacterial-cellulose (GOBC) nanohybrid and the fabrication of GOBC-based functional nanocomposites. In this paper, a GOBC with hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) framework was designed as a substrate for the metal phthalocyanine (Pc) catalyst. This substrate caused a remarkable enhancement of the catalysis of organic dye molecules. Firstly, GOBC was conveniently fabricated with one-step biosynthesis. The interaction mechanism at the molecular level between GO and BC was modeled with DFT quantum mechanics calculations that followed semi-empirical molecular dynamics studies to propose a structure. The formation of hydrogen-bond between O(3)-H and O(6)-H of BC and oxygen atom of GO was verified by core valence bifurcation and revealing noncovalent interactions theoretical analysis. Graphene-bacterial-cellulose (GBC) nanohybrid was then prepared by brief reduction of GOBC with N₂H₄ and used for the direct immobilization of Pc catalyst. The catalytic activity of the Pc that was immobilized on the GBC nanohybrid was evaluated based on its catalytic oxidation of organic dyes, and a remarkable enhancement of the catalytic activity by the GBC substrate was observed. The electron transfer and the electrical structure state of the catalytic system were investigated by charge density difference and density of states theoretical calculations. An innovative catalytic mechanism of “substrate-driven enhancement” of the highly reactive metal phthalocyanine immobilized graphene-bacterial-cellulose nanocomposite was proposed based on both experimental and theoretical calculation results.  aPublisher supplied data  a51803044cnational natural science foundation of china  a11110031541801cadvanced programs of postdoctoral research of zhejiang province 3abiosynthesis 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3adyes 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocomposites 3ananohybrids 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aquantum mechanics1 aWu, Zhijing1 aFan, Qiujin1 aHuang, Jiachi0 tCellulose.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.849-861dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04336-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012300171300001600294520106000310592002801370650001201398650000901410650001901419650002301438650002001461651002101481653002101502653002201523653003401545653002001579653000701599653000901606653000801615653000801623653001001631653000801641653000701649653000801656653001001664653000701674700001501681700001901696700001901715700002001734700001701754773009101771856009001862852000901952655001201961IND60605764420221121054502.0180904e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Yejin10aAnalysis of the proficiency of single radial immunodiffusion assays for quality control of influenza vaccines in Korea  ap. 137-140.  aInfluenza vaccine potency, which is determined by quantitatively measuring the content of Hemagglutinin (HA), is an essential index representing the efficacy of the vaccine. Standardization of the single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay, a method for measuring HA content, and proficiency of the testing institutions are crucial for influenza vaccine quality control. Herein, we assessed the proficiency of SRID assays at the National Control Laboratory (NCL) of Korea and several vaccine manufacturers. Eight laboratories participated in this study, and the proficiencies of all laboratories yielded satisfactory results in overall SRID assays. In contrast, there were some unsatisfactory results in measuring with different types of agarose gel plates produced by other laboratories. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the proficiency of SRID assay in the tested laboratories is acceptable for quality control of influenza vaccines and that detailed review on the validation reports regarding the test methods will be helpful for better control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3agels 3ahemagglutinins 3ainfluenza vaccines 3aquality control 3aKorean Peninsula 0aProficiency test 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aSingle radial immunodiffusion 0aQuality control 0aHA 0aSRID 0aNCL 0aWHO 0aNIFDS 0aSOP 0aEP 0aMAD 0aANOVA 0aCV1 aLee, Sunmi1 aKwon, Seong Yi1 aLee, YoungHee,1 aPark, Yong Keun1 aBan, Sang Ja0 tBiologicals.g2017 Nov., v. 50 p.137-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014300173300001600316520138200332592002801714650001401742650002301756650001201779650002101791650001901812650001201831650001801843650001501861650001401876650001101890650001201901650002101913650000701934650001501941650002001956650001601976653003401992653003102026653002302057653001902080653003302099700002702132700002302159700002102182773014602203856009002349852000902439655001202448IND60605764520221121054553.0180904e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060576452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbed, Heba S.10aEvaluation of the combined effects of pegylation and glycosylation on the stability of erythropoietin using a stability-indicating SE-HPLC  ap. 129-136.  aRecombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) is a commonly used biopharmaceutical for the treatment of anemia-associated disorders. Epogen; glycosylated erythropoietin (G-EPO) has short half-life and poor stability. Pegylated Epogen (Peg-G-EPO) was introduced to the market to overcome these limitations. The combined effects of pegylation and glycosylation on the stability of Peg-G-EPO was studied. Determination of Peg-G-EPO in the presence of its degradation products was achieved using SE-HPLC. The assay was validated according to ICH guidelines over concentration range of 50.00–320.00 μg/mL (r 0.9999). A mobile phase of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) with 300 mM sodium chloride and 20% ethanol was employed. Isocratic elution was carried out at 0.5 mL/min over run time of 30 min. Peg-G-EPO was found stable towards mechanical agitation only at low concentrations while it was stable towards repeated freeze/thaw; regardless of the concentration. Effect of temperature and pH were also investigated and Peg-G-EPO was found stable within narrow ranges. Results indicated formation of small molecular weight and very high molecular weight aggregates that have been filtered-off the column. Although Peg-G-EPO was found relatively more stable than its non-pegylated but glycosylated version, results indicated the need for careful stability-assessment of Peg-G-EPO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abuffers 3achemical bonding 3aerythropoietin 3aethanol 3aglycosylation 3aguidelines 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3amarkets 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aphosphates 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 0aSize exclusion chromatography 0aStability-indicating assay 0aBiopharmaceuticals 0aErythropoietin 0aPegylated biopharmaceuticals1 aAl-Ghobashy, Medhat A.1 aFathalla, Faten A.1 aSalem, Maissa Y.0 tBiologicals.g2017 Nov., v. 50 p.129-136dElsevier LtdaInternational Alliance for Biological StandardizationwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2017.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010200163300001600265520150100281592002801782596006101810596006101871596010401932650001502036650001302051650001202064650001402076650002202090650000902112650001102121650002102132650001502153650002702168650001102195650001302206650001502219650001402234650001302248650002002261650001002281650001502291650002302306700002002329700001502349700001202364700001602376700001402392700001802406700001602424700001302440700001602453700005202469700001702521773010902538856008302647852000902730655001202739IND60765833720221118215759.0220203e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076583372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-04323-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Jun10aFull bagasse bio-waste derived 3D photothermal aerogels for high efficient solar steam generation  ap. 927-939.  aNowadays, freshwater shortage, energy crisis and environmental pollution are the three major threats to human beings. Bio-waste is an important source of environmental pollutant emissions and a renewable resource with great potential. Herein, we develop a photothermal material based on bagasse for solar steam generation to relieve the freshwater crisis and mitigate environmental pollution caused by bio-waste. The mainly functional part of the solar-driven steam generator here is bagasse-based photothermal aerogel (B-PTA), which composes of carbonized bagasse (CB) and bagasse-derived cellulose fiber (BDCF). The B-PTA relying on CB can effectively absorb sunlight (~ 95%), resulting in a prominent light-to-heat ability. The B-PTA with DBCF has super-hydrophilicity, water transport and retention ability. Depending on the excellent light absorption and 3D water passageway, the B-PTA gives a water evaporation rate of 1.36 kg m–² h–¹, and achieves a photothermal conversion efficiency of 77.34% under 1-sun illumination (1 kW m–²). The B-PTA shows remarkable stability that the efficiency without significant change after 20 cycles. In addition, the B-PTA can effectively desalt seawater and purify dye wastewater with natural sunlight. Therefore, turning bio-waste into valuable photothermal material for solar steam generation is possible. Due to the merits of low cost, scalability, environmental friendliness, B-PTA has the potential for real-world water purification.  aPublisher supplied data  a51203125cthe nation natural science foundation of china  a2019CFC905cnatural science foundation of hubei province  aD20191704cscience and technology research project of the department of education of hubei province 3aabsorption 3aaerogels 3abagasse 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3adyes 3aenergy 3aevaporation rate 3afreshwater 3agenerators (equipment) 3ahumans 3alighting 3apollutants 3apollution 3aseawater 3asolar radiation 3asteam 3awastewater 3awater purification1 aZhang, Zhenning1 aLiu, Yuhao1 aYi, Jie1 aWang, Yixin1 aLi, Bowen1 aWang, Weiming1 aPeng, Shuai1 aMin, Xue1 aGui, Yunyun1 aLi, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2476-77271 aPeng, Junjun0 tCellulose.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 2 p.927-939dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-04323-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245009800172300001600270520100100286592002801287650002301315650002401338650002101362650001701383650001301400650000901413653000901422653001301431653001201444653001701456700001701473700001401490773009101504856009001595852000901685655001201694IND60613330720221122065826.0200614e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Huiyuan10aDamage characteristics analysis of GFRP-Balsa sandwich beams under Four-point fatigue bending  ap. 564-577.  aFour-point bending static and fatigue experiments were performed on composite sandwich beams with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) face sheets and Balsa wood cores. Specimens with various span-to-depth ratios were prepared using a vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. The results showed that the sandwich beams under both static and fatigue tests failed due to core shear and debonding. The S–N curves of sandwich beams were determined using an exponential empirical model. The study showed that to sustain at least one million cycles, the service load should be limited to 60% of the ultimate load. The deflection evolution of the sandwich beams were found to occur in three stages, namely, transient fall, stable evolution, and rapid failure. Furthermore, a fatigue damage model closely related to the possible detection of damage initiation and progression was proposed. The model was proved to be appropriate for describing the fatigue response of GFRP-Balsa sandwich beams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchroma pyramidale 3acomposite materials 3aempirical models 3aglass fibers 3apolymers 3awood 0aGFRP 0aSandwich 0aFatigue 0aDamage model1 aLiu, Weiqing1 aFang, Hai0 tComposites.g2018 June, v. 109 p.564-577dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2018.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024003400131024004100165040001800206100006100224245011700285500002200402506010200424506007600526506003100602520074300633592002801376596008301404506003701487650001401524650001301538650002101551650001101572650002001583650002001603650001101623650002101634653001401655653001701669653002501686653003101711653002701742700002001769773006901789856008101858852000901939655001201948IND60570513620221207074706.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057051362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.06.0122chorus7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.06.0122doi7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.06.0122chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Matthew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5393-073312aA plate-based histo-blood group antigen binding assay for evaluation of human norovirus receptor binding ability  aPre-press version  aCHORUS License Informationg20170706uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/g20170706  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aHuman norovirus is a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide.

Receptor-binding assays supplement these assays and give insight into capsid integrity. We present a streamlined version of receptor-binding assays with minimal time-to-result while maintaining accuracy and high throughput. We validate assay performance for physical and chemical inactivation treatments of norovirus GII.4 capsid. The assay produces a high positive/negative ratio (25.3 ± 4.9) in <2.5 h and a limit of detection of 0.1 μg/ml capsid.

Such autonomous environmental benefits of products differ from conventional, static environmental benefits, which derive from pre-purchase processes and design decisions. However, the literature still lacks knowledge of how to use such autonomous environmental benefits to attract new customers. Therefore, drawing on signaling theory, this study examines the effect of these environmental benefits on a consumer’s purchase intent and its variation across types of consumers, locations, and products. Based on hierarchical linear modeling of 1635 consumer evaluations of AI-enhanced products, this study finds that both static and autonomous perceived environmental benefits influence purchase intent positively. The effect of autonomous environmental benefits is stronger for women than for men and for products targeted at adults rather than children. The effect of static environmental benefits is stronger for men than women, for products targeted at children rather than adults, for consumers with a higher need for cognition, and in locations with a higher perceived environmental well-being.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildren 3acognition 3aconsumers (people) 3adesign 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental performance 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ainvasive species 3aknowledge 3alearning 3alinear models 3aliterature 3amarketing 3amen 3apollutants 3arobots 3awastes 3awomen 0aArtificial intelligence 0aAutonomy 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aGreen purchasing 0aRobotics0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 20, v. 285 p.125242-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1252423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015200167300001600319520188400335592002802219650002902247650001402276650002202290650001402312650001102326650001402337650001202351650001402363650001102377650001502388650001102403650001102414650002402425650002502449650001602474700001902490700002502509700002302534773011802557856008102675852000902756655001202765IND60615236720221119084554.0181009e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061523672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-008-1043-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLankin, Kate F.14aThe effects of temperature, body size and growth rate on energy losses due to metabolism in early life stages of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus)  ap. 461-472.  aRates of routine respiration (RR, μl O₂ fish⁻¹ h⁻¹) and total ammonia nitrogen excretion (ER, μg NH₄–N + NH₃–N fish⁻¹ h⁻¹) were measured on larval and juvenile haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) to ascertain how energy losses due to metabolism were influenced by temperature (T), dry body mass (MD, mg) and specific growth rate (SGR, % per day). RR and ER increased with MD according to y = a · MDᵇ with b-values of 0.96, 0.98, 1.14, and 0.89, 0.78, 0.74, respectively, at 10, 7, and 4°C, respectively. Multiple regressions explained 98% of the variability in the combined effects of MD and T on RR and ER in larval haddock: RR = 0.97 · MD⁰.⁹⁸ · e⁰.⁰⁹² · ᵀ; ER = 0.06 · MD⁰.⁷⁹ · e⁰.⁰⁹² · ᵀ. In young juvenile (24–30 mm standard length) haddock, RR tended to decline (P = 0.06) and ER significantly declined (P = 0.02) with increasing SGR. O:N ratios significantly increased with increasing SGR suggesting that N was spared in relatively fast-growing individuals. Our results for young larval and juvenile haddock suggest: (1) nearly isometric scaling of RR with increasing body size, (2) allometric scaling of ER with increasing body size, (3) Q₁₀ values of 2.5 for both RR and ER, (4) metabolic differences in substrate utilization between relatively fast- and slow-growing individuals, and (5) that rates of routine energy loss and growth were not positively related. The measurements in this study will provide robust parameter estimates for individual-based models that are currently being utilized to investigate how variability in climatic forcing influences the vital rates of early life stages of haddock. Our results also stress that inter-individual differences in rates of energy loss should not be overlooked as a factor influencing growth variability among individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelanogrammus aeglefinus 3aallometry 3aammonium nitrogen 3abody size 3aenergy 3aexcretion 3ahaddock 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aregression analysis 3aspecific growth rate 3atemperature1 aPeck, Myron A.1 aBuckley, Lawrence J.1 aBengtson, David A.0 tMarine biology.g2008 Oct., v. 155, no. 5 p.461-472dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-008-1043-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01832naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245009800187300001600285520085500301592002801156653000901184653000901193653002201202653001801224700002001242700002101262773013501283856011501418852000901533655001201542IND60128489120221117184400.0151115e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012848912DNAL7 a10.2317/0022-8567(2007)80[136:MSAOTS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitts, James P.10aMolecular Sex Associations of Three Species of Nocturnal Velvet Ant (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae)  ap. 136-145.  aPitfall trap sampling and light trapping for Mutillidae were conducted in Cache County, Utah.

For this reason, the separation of Nd from a mixture containing Nd/Tb/Dy in chloride media using Cyanex 272 and Cyanex 572 has been evaluated. RESULTS: Using Cyanex 272 and Cyanex 572, the metals are transported in the order Dy(III) > Tb(III) > > Nd(III) in all conditions studied. The optimum feed conditions to achieve Nd(III) separation are: Cyanex 272: pH 2 and Cyanex 572: pH 1.5 with 1.2 mol L‐¹ HCl as a receiving agent for both carriers. CONCLUSION: The results obtained suggest that Cyanex 572 is a better carrier than Cyanex 272 for separating Nd(III) from a mixture containing Nd/Tb/Dy. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3ahydrochloric acid 3amagnetic materials 3aneodymium 3apH 3awastes1 aKutucu, Merve1 aColl, M Teresa1 aFortuny, Agustin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2350-86541 aSastre, Ana M1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6586-81130 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 Aug., v. 93, no. 8 p.2152-2159dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011700207300001100324520132500335592002801660650001501688650002601703650001501729650002001744650002401764650002301788650001101811651001201822700002001834773011801854856008101972852000902053655001202062IND60644604420221117234856.0200110e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064460442DNAL7 a10.1186/s13717-019-0169-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscoriza, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6853-013410aUsing hierarchical spatial models to assess the occurrence of an island endemism: the case of Salamandra corsica  ap. 15.  aBACKGROUND: Island species are vulnerable to rapid extinction, so it is important to develop accurate methods to determine their occurrence and habitat preferences. In this study, we assessed two methods for modeling the occurrence of the Corsican endemic Salamandra corsica, based on macro-ecological and fine habitat descriptors. We expected that models based on habitat descriptors would better estimate S. corsica occurrence, because its distribution could be influenced by micro-environmental gradients. The occurrence of S. corsica was modeled according to two ensembles of variables using random forests. RESULTS: Salamandra corsica was mainly found in forested habitats, with a complex vertical structure. These habitats are associated with more stable environmental conditions. The model based on fine habitat descriptors was better able to predict occurrence, and gave no false negatives. The model based on macro-ecological variables underestimated the occurrence of the species on its ecological boundary, which is important as such locations may facilitate interpopulation connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing fine spatial resolution models requires greater investment of resources, but this is advisable for study of microendemic species, where it is important to reduce type II error (false negatives).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalamandra 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3aforest habitats 3ahabitat preferences 3aindigenous species 3amodels 3aCorsica1 aHernandez, Axel0 tEcological processes.g2019 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.15-15dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22887x2192-17097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-019-0169-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002800166245009800194300001800292520150000310592002801810650001601838650001101854650001001865650001001875650001901885650002001904650001401924650001701938650002101955650001501976650001801991650002202009650003102031650001402062650002102076700001802097700002002115700001302135700001902148700001702167700002002184700001902204773012302223856008202346852000902428655001202437IND50089428220221119091636.0220304e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008942822DNAL7 a246155022pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3212-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamal, Abu Hena Mostafa10aProteomic analysis of the effect of retinoic acids on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7  ap. 3499-3507.  aBreast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in many areas and is increasing found in developing countries, where the majority of cases are diagnosed in late stages. Retinoic acids, through their associated nuclear receptors, exert intoxicating effects on cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, and hold significant promise in relation to cancer therapy and chemoprevention. To enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with retinoic acids in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in a time-dependent manner, we conducted a proteomic analysis of MCF-7 cells using the 2-DE couple with high-throughput mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools. In the 2-DE patterns of MCF-7 cells treated with retinoic acid in a time-dependent manner, 35 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed. These were 17 increased, 4 decreased, and 14 unevenly expressed protein spots, all of which were analyzed using LTQ-FTICR mass spectrometry. Furthermore, five candidate proteins, up-regulated, were validated by western blotting. These were nucleoredoxin, latexin, aminomethyltransferase, translationally controlled one tumor protein, and rab GDP dissociation inhibitor β. These observations represent novel findings leading to new insight into the exact mechanism behind the effect of retinoic acids in MCF-7 cells while also identifying possible therapeutic targets for breast cancer diagnosis and novel drug development paths for the treatment of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3ahumans 3adrugs 3awomen 3abioinformatics 3achemoprevention 3areceptors 3atherapeutics 3aWestern blotting 3aproteomics 3aretinoic acid 3amass spectrometry 3agene expression regulation 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms1 aHan, Baek Soo1 aChoi, Jong-Soon1 aCho, Kun1 aKim, Sun Young1 aKim, Won Kon1 aLee, Sang-Chul,1 aBae, Kwang-Hee0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 May, v. 41, no. 5 p.3499-3507dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3212-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01387naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245010100153300001600254520012400270650002500394650001800419650001500437650002900452650001200481650003300493650001600526650001100542650000900553650003500562650002100597650002000618650003200638650002600670650001700696653002800713653002700741700001500768700001700783773006800800852000900868939003300877945000800910946001100918655001200929991604248810742620221120104723.0830504s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830047382DNAL7 a71707142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinkerton, A.M.10aScanning electron microscopy of post-ejaculatory spermiogenesis in the tick Ornithodoros moubata  ap. 785-797.  aOrnithodoros moubata, post-ejaculatory spermiogenesis, time sequence, morphologic changes, scanning electron microscopy 3aOrnithodoros moubata 3agametogenesis 3agerm cells 2aAcrosomexultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleusxultrastructure 2aEjaculation 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aSperm Maturation 2aSpermatogenesis 2aSpermatozoaxultrastructure 2aTicksxultrastructure 2aTime Factors 0aDevelopment, Arthropoda 0aMorphology, Arthropoda1 aHall, J.D.1 aShepherd, J.0 tTissue and cell.g1982, v. 14, no. 4 p.785-797x0040-81667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830504c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01142naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245006300153300001600216500001200232520008500244650002600329650001500355650003300370650003100403650001100434650001100445650002600456650002600482651001100508653002100519700001800540700001800558773011900576852000900695939003300704945000800737946001100745655001200756991604246910742620221120090212.0830511s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830046982DNAL7 a63443562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerraroni, J.J.10aMultiple drug resistance in falciparum malaria from Brazil  ap. 138-139.  aLetter.  aPlasmodium falciparum, human, case of multiple drug resistance: Brazilian Amazon 3aPlasmodium falciparum 2aAdolescent 2aChloroquinextherapeutic use 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMalariaxdrug therapy 2aPlasmodium falciparum 3aBrazil 0aResistance, Drug1 aAlencar, F.H.1 aShrimpton, R.0 tTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.g1983, v. 77, no. 1 p.138-139x0035-92037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830511c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle04525naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001700160245014200177300001600319500002400335520247500359650002302834650002402857650000902881650000902890650002202899650000902921650002402930650001802954650002202972650001202994650001203006650002303018650001003041650001603051650001403067650001203081650001403093650001203107650001203119650001203131650003303143650003303176650003003209650001103239650003903250650003503289650000903324650000903333650003303342650002403375650001403399650002203413650002403435650002203459650002503481700001903506700001403525700001603539700001603555700001703571773013703588852000903725856008103734655001203815IND4448294420221120072310.0110126e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444829442DNAL7 a212629782pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-30372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadunz, A.E.10aWinter-feeding systems for gestating sheep II. Effects on feedlot performance, glucose tolerance, and carcass composition of lamb progeny  ap. 478-488.  aIncludes references  aMature pregnant crossbred ewes (n = 90) were used in a randomized complete block design experiment and were assigned to 1 of 3 winter-feeding systems differing in primary feed source: haylage (HL), limit-fed corn (CN), or limit-fed dried distillers grains (DDGS). Effects of these winter-feeding strategies on postweaning progeny performance were determined. Lamb progeny (n = 96) were weaned at 61 ± 4 d of age and fed a common high-concentrate diet. Lambs were assigned to feedlot pen (n = 18) based on dam mid-gestation pen. Growth rate, DMI, and ADG were determined for the first 40 d of the finishing period. At 96 ± 4 d of age, 1 wether lamb was randomly selected from each pen (n = 18) for a glucose tolerance test. The experiment was terminated, and lambs were slaughtered individually when they were determined to have achieved 0.6-cm 12th-rib fat thickness. After a 24-h chill, carcass data were collected and a 2.54-cm chop was removed from each lamb from the LM posterior to the 12th rib for ether extract analysis. Additional carcass measurements of bone, muscle, and fat from the shoulder, rack, loin, and leg were collected on 35 carcasses. At weaning, lamb BW was not different among treatments, whereas final BW tended to be greater (P = 0.09) for lambs from ewes fed DDGS and CN during gestation than from those fed HL. Overall lamb growth rate from birth to slaughter was not different among treatments. Lambs from ewes fed DDGS vs. CN or HL tended to have a greater initial insulin response (P = 0.09). Dressing percent was less (P = 0.04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, but no difference (P = 0.16) was detected in HCW among treatments. As expected, 12th rib fat thickness was similar among treatments, whereas LM area was largest to smallest (P = 0.05) in lambs from ewes fed CN, HL, and DDGS, respectively. Proportion of internal fat tended to be greatest to smallest (P = 0.06) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, CN, and HL, respectively. Calculated boneless trimmed retail cuts percentage was less (P = 0.04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS than CN or HL. Loin muscle weight as a percentage of wholesale cut tended (P = 0.10) to be greater in lambs from ewes fed CN and HL than DDGS, whereas other muscle, bone, and fat weights and proportions were similar (P > 0.24) among treatments. Prepartum diet during mid to late gestation of ewes altered postnatal fat and muscle deposition and may be associated with alterations in insulin sensitivity of progeny. 3aanimal performance 3acarcass composition 3acorn 3adiet 3adistillers grains 3aewes 3aexperimental design 3afat thickness 3aglucose tolerance 3ahaylage 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alambs 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aslaughter 3aweaning 3awethers 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxphysiology 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aEdible Grainxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Testxveterinary 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aMale 2aMeat 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexmetabolism 2aPregnancy 2aRandom Allocation 2aRegression Analysis 2aSheepxmetabolism 2aZea maysxmetabolism1 aFluharty, F.L.1 aSusin, I.1 aFelix, T.L.1 aZerby, H.N.1 aLoerch, S.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.478-488dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-30373Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03426naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072000900140072000900149100002300158245013800181300002000319500002400339520180200363650002202165650002102187650001302208650001202221650001702233650001602250650002502266650001502291650002802306650002502334650002302359650002302382651001002405653003002415653002702445653001702472700002002489700001702509700002302526700001402549700001602563700001502579773013202594852000902726856008002735930003302815945002502848946001102873655001202884IND4447779720221120063511.0110122e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444777972DNAL7 a10.1038/ijo.2010.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aMartinez-Gomez, D.10aAssociations of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and fatness with low-grade inflammation in adolescents: the AFINOS Study  ap. 1501–1507.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To examine the independent associations of objectively measured physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and fatness with low-grade inflammatory markers in adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional study in Spain. Subjects: A sample of 192 adolescents aged 13–17 years. Measurements: PA was assessed with an accelerometer for 7 days. A 20-m shuttle-run test was used to assess CRF. Skinfold thicknesses at six sites and WCs were measured. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and complement factors C3 and C4 were assayed. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from glucose and insulin. Regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders and HOMA-IR was used to determine the associations between PA, CRF and fatness with low-grade inflammatory markers. Results: Total PA, vigorous PA and MVPA were positively associated with CRF (r=0.25–0.48), whereas vigorous PA was negatively associated with skinfolds (r=−0.27). CRF was inversely associated with fatness, (r=−0.30 to −0.48). CRF and fatness were inversely and positively associated with HOMA-IR (r=−0.16 and 0.21, respectively). PA variables were not independently associated with inflammatory markers. CRF and fatness were inversely and positively associated with CRP, C3 and C4, respectively. Only body fat explained a relevant amount of the variance of the model in CRP (4%) and C4 (19%), whereas CRP and body fat jointly explained the variance in C3 (25%). All these observations were independent of HOMA-IR. Conclusions: These findings support the key role of CRF and fatness on low-grade inflammation, as well as the possible indirect role of habitual PA through CRF and body fat in adolescents.

Here, we present an approach to forecasting the range expansion of the nonindigenous green crab Carcinus in Japanese waters, with consideration of the human-mediated shipping and natural dispersal. Two types of shipping, namely, primary transport to Japan via long-distance ocean-going shipping and secondary transport within Japan via short-distance coastal shipping, were considered. The presence and absence of the crab in 50-km shoreline segments were obtained at 5 year intervals from 1985 to 2005, based on observation records by professional and amateur naturalists. Two types of dispersal kernel, namely, conventional logistic regression and a multiplicative immigration model considering multiple pathways explicitly, were compared. The multiplicative immigration model gave significantly better results. Natural dispersal was the most significant factor, in spite of its low expansion rate: secondary transport by coastal shipping was the second. Transport by international ocean-going shipping was not statistically significant, suggesting quite a small immigration probability of the crab by long voyages. Stochastic simulations forecasted that the crab will invade most of the coasts of western Japan along the Pacific Ocean and Seto Inland Sea by 2055, and will become widespread all over the country by 2205. Quarantine scenarios to eliminate transport by vessels revealed that preventing crab transport by domestic coastal vessels may delay the arrival of crabs in Hokkaido and the northern Japan area by 700 years at maximum. 3adispersal behavior 3ageographical distribution 3asimulation models 3ashipping 3aintroduced species 3aCarcinus 3aaquatic invertebrates 3adata analysis 3apopulation density 3acoasts 3ainvasive species 3aquarantine 3aJapan 0amathematical models 0aCarcinus aestuarii 0ainvasion vectors1 aIwasaki, Keiji 0 tBiological invasions.g2011 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.459-470dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9841-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110511b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/04/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01743naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008100129520068900210650001300899650001400912650001100926650001300937650001500950650001600965650001800981650002000999650001701019650002301036650001501059650001201074700001601086700001801102700002701120773006801147852000901215856008701224939003301311946001301344655001201357IND4462939720221120024321.0120320e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446293972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyquist, Helen10aPromoting Healthy Eating and Exercise Through Online Messages: A Pilot Study  aThe effectiveness of online messages to change dietary intake and level of physical activity was assessed.

This species is endemic to North America and has been introduced into Europe by imports of their hosts, the North American crayfish species. As a consequence, extensive mass mortalities involved several populations of the European crayfish. Here, we checked its occurrence in four Italian populations of Procambarus clarkii, the most widespread alien crayfish in Italy. Digital image analyses and image processing techniques were used to select micro-melanized areas in the subabdominal cuticle of 2-10 crayfish per population. All the selected areas tested positive for A. astaci ITS nrDNA specific primers; moreover, the obtained sequences clearly corresponded to A. astaci, thus revealing that P. clarkii is an active carrier of this oomycete in Italy. Decisions are to be urgently made to control the spread of both P. clarkii and A. astaci for the conservation of the indigenous crayfish biodiversity. 3aProcambarus clarkii 3ainvasive species 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aAphanomyces astaci 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3amycoses 3ahosts 3adisease reservoirs 3amortality 3aAstacus 3aindigenous species 3aimage analysis 3aanimal cuticle 3aribosomal DNA 3adisease detection 3apathogen identification 3anucleotide sequences 3amicrobial genetics 3aItaly 0amolecular sequence data1 aMartín, M.

To generate a monoculture, the invader must garner more resources than resident natives and, once established, persist despite high densities of conspecific neighbors. Coincident with expansion and long-term persistence, successful invaders typically accumulate senesced material, but the role of this litter in mediating the invader's ability to establish and maintain monospecific dominance has rarely been investigated. We used stands of the common reed, Phragmites australis, a prolific wetland invader in North America, to explore the impact of litter on interspecific competition with the native rush, Juncus gerardii, and intraspecific competition among live shoots. In 10 × 10 m areas positioned on Phragmites expansion fronts, we removed litter to isolate its effect from live Phragmites on light availability, aboveground biomass and community composition. Compared to adjacent, unmanipulated fronts, light availability nearly tripled and Juncus biomass increased >170% in litter removal areas after 4 months. Although the positive response of Juncus and native forbs was most pronounced on the leading edge of Phragmites stands, litter removal triggered a 271% increase in native plant biomass even in the interior of stands where Phragmites' live stem density was highest. Litter treatment did not significantly affect Phragmites biomass, but more, shorter stems emerged in litter removals revealing Phragmites modifies stem phenotype in response to local litter and light conditions. These results suggest that litter plays a central role in Phragmites' invasion process, from initial establishment to subsequent monospecific dominance. Thus, prescribed litter removal may be an effective strategy to enhance coexistence of native plant populations in wetlands where eradication of invasive monocultures is not an ecologically or economically feasible option. 3aweed control 3aPhragmites australis 3aplant litter 3aJuncus 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3aintroduced species 3aplant establishment 3alight intensity 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant density 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant competition 3aindigenous species 3agrass weeds 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3awetland plants 3aNew England region 0aJuncus gerardii 0acompetitive ability 0asenescence1 aBertness, Mark D.0 tBiological invasions.g2011 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.423-433dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9836-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/04/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007900164300001600243500002400259500001500283520130700298650002301605650001601628650002201644650002501666650002501691650001101716650001801727650002601745650001301771650001701784650001601801650002101817650002401838650001801862651001501880653002401895700002301919700002301942773010001965852000902065856008502074930003302159945002502192946001102217655001202228IND4447289020221117173126.0110107e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444728902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-010-9834-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennis, Brian 10aLateral spread of invasive Spartina alterniflora in uncrowded environments  ap. 401-411.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe present a stochastic model of clonal growth in uncrowded environments and use it to study data of 7,536 clones from the invasion of Willapa Bay, Washington by the Atlantic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. The model incorporates effects on clone growth of covariates, spatial autocorrelation, and temporal trends. The deterministic component of the model assumes that growth rate of a clone's area is proportional to its perimeter, resulting in constant radial growth of the clone. The full stochastic model is built assuming that the fluctuations of radial growth increments (differences of square root-transformed areas) are normally distributed with constant variance. Graphical fit analysis with the density probability plot technique indicates that the stochastic model provides an excellent description of the S. alterniflora invasion. Variation in Spartina growth was significantly but weakly (5%) related to intertidal elevation, substrate type, year of survey, and the two-way interactions between these variables, suggesting that factors intrinsic to Spartina, along with localized high frequency noise, dominate the effects of larger scale abiotic factors on clone growth. Our model of clonal growth is potentially applicable to other systems with approximately circular plants or lichens. 3atemporal variation 3acorrelation 3asimulation models 3aspatial distribution 3aasexual reproduction 3aclones 3aplant density 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aaltitude 3asalt marshes 3agrass weeds 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3awetland soils 0aWashington 0amathematical models1 aCiville, Janie C. 1 aStrong, Donald R. 0 tBiological invasions.g2011 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.401-411dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9834-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20110511b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/04/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009600167300001600263500002400279500001500303520161200318650004301930650002501973650002301998650002202021650001602043650002802059650002102087650001302108650002002121650001302141650002202154650002102176650001302197650002002210651001602230653002302246700002302269700002802292700002302320773010002343852000902443856008502452930003302537945002502570946001102595655001202606IND4447289120221117173226.0110107e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444728912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-010-9835-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrtikova, Miluse 10aDistribution, growth performance and genetic variation of Erigeron annuus in the Swiss Alps  ap. 413-422.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated whether local adaptation has been important in enabling the invasive apomictic species Erigeron annuus to extend its altitudinal range in the Swiss Alps. We first conducted a field survey along several major roads crossing the Swiss Alps to study the distribution and growth performance of E. annuus along an altitudinal gradient. We then used amplified fragment length polymorphism to assess genetic variation within and among populations originating from different altitudes. To complement the molecular analyses, we compared the performance of genotypes with different distributions (i.e. local, occasional, widespread genotypes) in two common gardens at 400 m and 1,000 m a.s.l. Although E. annuus was seldom found above 1,000 m, plant performance in field populations did not decrease with increasing altitude. However, there was a significant decline in genotypic diversity within populations, and highland (711-1,100 m) populations were more differentiated (Gst = 0.55) than lowland (200-530 m) populations (Gst = 0.33). In the common garden experiment, local genotypes (i.e. those restricted to a single population) grew less vigorously than widespread genotypes, and were less likely to reproduce. We found no evidence for on-going adaptive changes and conclude that any selection acting on particular genotypes at the altitudinal limit is weak. This leads us to propose that the patterns in the distribution of genotypic diversity in E. annuus are governed by processes of occasional sexual reproduction, dispersal and extinction that are to a large extent independent of altitude. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aspatial distribution 3aintroduced species 3agenetic variation 3aacclimation 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant adaptation 3aapomixis 3aErigeron annuus 3agenotype 3anatural selection 3ainvasive species 3aaltitude 3agenetic markers 3aSwitzerland 0aplant reproduction1 aGüsewell, Sabine 1 aBaltisberger, Matthias 1 aEdwards, Peter J. 0 tBiological invasions.g2011 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.413-422dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9835-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110511b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/04/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03699naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245007900179300001800258500002400276500001500300520224200315650002002557650001802577650002002595650002602615650003302641650002202674650001602696650002402712650001202736653002302748653002402771653002302795700001702818700001602835700002302851773014702874852000903021856012803030930003303158945002503191946001303216655001203229IND4447778420221123033247.0110122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444777842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChoi, Hong L.10aComparison of Natural and Forced ventilation Systems in Nursery Pig Houses  ap. 1023-1033.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPig producers prefer to have automated control systems installed in their indoor environments because it reduces labor and enhances control precision. The effectiveness of two ventilation systems (forced and natural) were examined in several nursery houses and the overall distributions of environmental parameters and productivity indicators, such as temperature, humidity and air speed, ammonia concentration, weight gain, and feed efficiency were analyzed during the winter (19 November-16 December 1999) and the summer (13 May- 18 June 2000). These experiments were conducted at the Collegiate Experiment Animal Farm of Seoul National University. Results showed that the indoor temperature of the forced ventilation house was 3 °C to 4°C higher than the natural ventilation house during the winter and ammonia concentration in the forced ventilation house was approximately 2 ppm lower than the natural ventilation house in both seasons. Also, feed requirement was 10% higher during the winter and 7% higher during the summer in the forced ventilation house. Energy costs for the natural ventilation house were two times more ($20.84/yr/head) than that of the forced ventilation house ($10.21/yr/head). The construction costs for a confined house with a forced ventilation system was only 17% higher than that for a natural ventilation house. The confined nursery house equipped with the mechanical, ducted ventilation system performed better than the natural ventilation house when measuring pig productivity and spatial homogeneity of environmental parameter distributions during both the summer and the winter. As a result, a confined nursery pig house with a forced ventilation system is considered to be 'more efficient' when applied on a field scale as a standard structure. With proper design confined facilities with forced ventilation systems could drastically reduce labor input through automation and improve inside air quality of a nursery pig house by using precision control. It can also save energy by using higher insulation level construction materials, which will ultimately lead to better profitability if it repays the extra construction cost of a forced ventilation house within the expected investment period. 3afeed conversion 3aswine housing 3aliveweight gain 3aequipment performance 3aindoor environmental quality 3aenergy efficiency 3atemperature 3anatural ventilation 3apiglets 0anursery pig houses 0aventilation systems 0aforced ventilation1 aSong, Jun I.1 aLee, Jae H.1 aAlbright, Louis D.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 6 p.1023-1033dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=6&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle03346naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137072000900146100001700155245014800172300001800320500002400338500001500362520172700377650002002104650001902124650002002143650003302163650001402196650001902210650000902229650002402238650001202262653002402274653002302298653002302321700001702344700001902361700002002380700001302400700001602413700001802429700001602447773013302463852000902596856012802605930003302733945002502766946001302791655001202804IND4447778620221123033244.0110122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444777862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL105 0aN100 0aL500 0aL6001 aGu, Zhaobing10aCharacterization of Two Types of Covered Creep Boxes for Piglet Usage and Piglet Performance in a Naturally Ventilated Swine Farrowing Building  ap. 1043-1049.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigates two types of covered piglet creep boxes in a naturally ventilated swine farrowing building with regards to air quality (ammonia and carbon dioxide levels), piglet usage of the box, and piglet health and performance. The covered creep boxes featured either double plastic curtains along the entire width of the box (designated as the DC box) or an arc-shaped access opening occupying about one-third of the box width (designated as the AO box). The study was conducted with 12 farrowing crates, six per box regimen, during wintertime. Continuous, 24-h video observations of the piglet behaviors were made at days 2, 9, and 16 of post-parturition. Ammonia and CO 2 concentrations inside the creep boxes were measured using portable electronic sensors. The results showed that the interior NH 3 levels tended to be lower for the DC type than for the AO type, although the magnitude was quite low in both cases (averaging 4 to 6 ppm). No significant difference was found in the interior CO 2 concentrations between the two box types. Pre-weaning piglet culling rate (mean +/- S.D.) was 2.5 +/- 0.08% and 11.3 +/- 1.17% for the DC and AO litters, respectively (p < 0.001). Although there was no significant treatment effect (p = 0.26), piglet diarrhea morbidity was numerically lower for the DC litters (0.80 +/- 0.03%) than for the AO litters (1.29 +/- 0.12%). At 21-d weaning age, the DC litters showed heavier body weight (6.18 +/- 0.23 kg) than the AO litters (5.69 +/- 0.18 kg) (p < 0.05). Results of the present work, despite the relatively small sample size, indicate that the DC-style covered creep box seems more conducive to enhancing piglet usage of the box and piglet health and performance. 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3aliveweight gain 3aindoor environmental quality 3amortality 3afarrowing pens 3asows 3anatural ventilation 3apiglets 0acovered creep boxes 0acrushing mortality 0aanimal performance1 aXin, Hongwei1 aWang, Chaoyuan1 aShi, Zhengxiang1 aCao, Wei1 aLiu, Zuohua1 aLin, Baozhong1 aLi, Baoming0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 6 p.1043-1049dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=6&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/07  aOther US 7aarticle01148naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245013900132300001600271520017400287650001400461650001000475653002300485653001800508653002400526653001700550653002900567653001900596700001800615700002400633773009200657852000900749939003300758945000800791946001100799655001200810991604237900742620221123033305.0830506s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830048472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, P.B.10aSome biochemical effects of the microsporidian Nosema whitei on the blood components of Tribolium castaneum using disc electrophoresis  ap. 553-558.  aNosema whitei, quantitative and qualitative changes in total proteins, certain enzymes, glycoproteins, phospholipids, and lipoproteins in parasitized Tribolium castaneum 3ahemolymph 3ablood 0aBiochemistry, Host 0aEnzymes, Host 0aGlycoproteins, Host 0aLipids, Host 0aNosema whitei (Protozoa) 0aProteins, Host1 aArmstrong, E.1 aReichelderfer, C.F.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1983, v. 74, no. 3 p.553-558x0305-04917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830506c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01658naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245012400153300001600277500001500293520033200308650001300640650002300653650002400676650001800700650002400718650001200742650001800754650003300772650001000805650002200815650002800837650003200865650002900897650002700926650004000953653001300993653002801006653001301034700001801047773006201065852000901127939003301136945000801169946001101177655001201188991604237450742620221123022747.0830506e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830048522DNAL7 a71662342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoothroyd, J.C.10aTranscripts coding for variant surface glycoproteins of Trypanosoma brucei have a short, identical exon at their 5' end  ap. 281-289.  a2019-12-04  aTrypanosoma brucei, nucleotide sequences of 5' half of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) 117 basic copy and 5' ends of VSG 117 and VSG 221 mRNAs determined and compared with each other and with recently obtained results for VSG 118, comparison shows that 5'-terminal 35 nucleotides of all three VSG mRNAs are indistinguishable 3aimmunity 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aantigenic variation 3aglycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Recombinantxmetabolism 2aGenes 2aGenetic Variation 2aGlycoproteinsxgenetics 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixgenetics 0agenetics 0aNucleic acids, Protozoa 0aProtozoa1 aCross, G.A.M.0 tGene.g1982 Dec., v. 20, no. 2 p.281-289x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830506c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02356naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100003200128245006000160300001700220500002400237520108200261650001401343650002001357650001001377650001901387650002001406650001601426650001901442650001701461653002501478653002001503700002901523700002101552700002101573773013201594852000901726856012801735930003301863945002501896946001301921655001201934IND4447778120221123022736.0110122s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444777812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX620 0aQ2041 aVadivambal, R.q(Rajagopal)10aDetection of Sprout-Damaged Wheat Using Thermal Imaging  ap. 999-1004.  aIncludes references  aSprout-damaged wheat affects the quality of flour resulting in poor qualities of bread, pasta, cookies, or any other product prepared from the wheat. The most common methods to determine sprout-damaged kernels include visual inspection, falling number, and rapid visco analyzer. These methods are either subjective or destructive and are time consuming. We tested the use of thermal imaging to detect sprout damage based on heat radiated by healthy and sprouted wheat kernels. An infrared thermal camera was used to collect images of healthy and sprout-damaged kernels and the images were analyzed using Matlab. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to classify healthy and sprout-damaged kernels. The classification accuracies were: for LDA 88.2% and 98.1%, for QDA 88.7% and 95.1%, and for ANN 99.4% and 91.7%, respectively, for healthy and sprout-damaged kernels. The results have shown that thermal imaging has a potential to determine sprout-damaged wheat kernels from the healthy kernels. 3adetection 3agrain sprouting 3awheat 3aimage analysis 3aneural networks 3acrop damage 3afalling number 3acrop quality 0asprout-damaged wheat 0athermal imaging1 aChelladurai, Vellaichamy1 aJayas, Digvir S.1 aWhite, Noel D.G.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 6 p.999-1004dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=6&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/06  aOther US 7aarticle03145naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002700163245016800190300001800358500002400376500001500400520177300415650001702188650002202205650002902227650001502256650001702271650001802288650001202306650002702318650001102345653003602356653001502392700002302407773011802430852000902548856008502557930003302642945002502675946001102700655001202711IND4447579020221123014042.0110120e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444757902DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145100025152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aMeijl, Leonie E.C. van10aEffects of low-fat dairy consumption on markers of low-grade systemic inflammation and endothelial function in overweight and obese subjects: an intervention study  ap. 1523-1527.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlthough increased concentrations of plasma inflammatory markers are not one of the criteria to diagnose the metabolic syndrome, low-grade systemic inflammation is receiving large attention as a metabolic syndrome component and cardiovascular risk factor. As several epidemiological studies have suggested a negative relationship between low-fat dairy consumption and the metabolic syndrome, we decided to investigate the effects of low-fat dairy consumption on inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules in overweight and obese subjects in an intervention study. Thirty-five healthy subjects (BMI>27 kg/m2) consumed, in a random order, low-fat dairy products (500 ml low-fat milk and 150 g low-fat yogurt) or carbohydrate-rich control products (600 ml fruit juice and three fruit biscuits) daily for 8 weeks. Plasma concentrations of TNF-α were decreased by 0·16 (sd 0·50) pg/ml (P = 0·070), and soluble TNF-α receptor-1 (s-TNFR-1) was increased by 110·0 (sd 338·4) pg/ml (P = 0·062) after the low-fat dairy period than after the control period. s-TNFR-2 was increased by 227·0 (sd 449·0) pg/ml (P = 0·020) by the dairy intervention. As a result, the TNF-α index, defined as the TNF-α:s-TNFR-2 ratio, was decreased by 0·000053 (sd 0·00 012) (P = 0·015) after the dairy diet consumption. Low-fat dairy consumption had no effect on IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 concentrations. The present results indicate that in overweight and obese subjects, low-fat dairy consumption for 8 weeks may increase concentrations of s-TNFR compared with carbohydrate-rich product consumption, but that it has no effects on other markers of chronic inflammation and endothelial function. 3alow fat diet 3aendothelial cells 3anutritional intervention 3abiomarkers 3ainflammation 3alow fat foods 3aobesity 3atumor necrosis factors 3aadults 0alow-grade systemic inflammation 0aoverweight1 aMensink, Ronald P.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2010 Nov., v. 104, no. 10 p.1523-1527dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145100025153Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01480naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007700129520065900206650001700865650001100882650001600893650002000909650001000929651001800939700002400957773006800981852000901049856008601058939003301144946001301177655001201190IND4462392220221123014144.0111206e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446239222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, K.P.10aInfluence of 4-H Horse Project Involvement on Development of Life Skills  aFour-H horse project members who competed in non-riding horse contests were surveyed to evaluate the influence of their horse project participation on life-skill development.

While research findings suggest the efficacy of program experiences to positively influence a variety of life skills, it remains difficult to compare these findings due to measurement incongruities. Individual life skills (e.g., leadership, decision making, etc.) often lack standardized conceptualizations and measurement approaches. The purpose of the study reported here was to gather data about practitioners' perceptions of those life skill domains most in need of measurement development. Based on the results of the study, 10 life skill sub-domains are recommended for future measurement development efforts. 3aattitudes and opinions 3acareer development 3adata collection 3adecision making 3aextension agents 3aextension programs 3aleadership 3alife skills 3aneeds assessment 3ayouth1 aWitt, Peter A.0 tJournal of extension.g2011 Oct., v. 49, no. 5x1077-53157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.joe.org/joe/2011october/index.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111206  aOther US 7aarticle01236naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001300133245006800146300001600214520004800230650002500278650002500303650002600328650002800354650001200382650003000394650003100424650002400455650002800479650002500507650001600532650002700548653002500575653002400600700001900624700001800643773009200661852000900753939003300762945000800795946001100803655001200814991604234970742620221122233917.0830505s1983    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830048442DNAL7 a64045922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWack, M.10aAmino acid metabolism in the rat tapeworm, Hymenolepis diminuta  ap. 399-402.  aHymenolepis diminuta, amino acid metabolism 3aHymenolepis diminuta 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAlaninexbiosynthesis 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAspartic Acidxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHymenolepisxmetabolism 2aLactatesxmetabolism 2aLactic Acid 2aSuccinatesxmetabolism 0aAmino acids, Cestoda 0aMetabolism, Cestoda1 aKomuniecki, R.1 aRoberts, L.S.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1983, v. 74, no. 3 p.399-402x0305-04917nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830505c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03309naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002200163245011000185300001800295500002400313520180100337650001302138650002502151650002502176650001102201650001002212650002102222650001302243650002102256650001502277650001602292650001802308650001602326650001602342653002902358653001702387653003202404700002002436700001902456700001902475700001602494773011802510852000902628856008502637930003302722945002502755946001102780655001202791IND4447573920221122233930.0110118e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444757392DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145100023942doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT3001 aAndersson, Helena10aActive recovery training does not affect the antioxidant response to soccer games in elite female players  ap. 1492-1499.  aIncludes references  aChanges in plasma endogenous and dietary antioxidants and oxidative stress markers were studied following two 90 min elite female soccer games separated by 72 h of either active or passive recovery. The active recovery group (n 8) trained for 1 h at 22 and 46 h after the first game (low-intensity cycling and resistance training), while the passive group rested (n 8). Blood samples were taken before the games; immediately after the games; 21, 45 and 69 h after the first game; and immediately after the second game. The oxidative stress markers and antioxidants were not affected by active recovery. The oxidative stress marker GSSG increased by the same extent after both the games, while the lipid peroxidation marker diacron-reactive oxygen metabolite remained unchanged. The endogenous antioxidants total glutathione and uric acid and ferric reducing/antioxidant power increased immediately after both the games with the same amplitude, while increases in cysteine, cysteine–glycine and total thiols reached significant levels only after the second game. The changes in dietary antioxidants after the first game were either rapid and persistent (tocopherols and ascorbic acid (AA) increased; polyphenols decreased) or delayed (carotenoids). This resulted in high pre-second game levels of tocopherols, AA and carotenoids. Polyphenols returned to baseline at 69 h, and were not affected by the second game. In conclusion, the soccer-associated dietary antioxidant defence, but not the endogenous antioxidant defence, is persistent. Similar acute oxidative stress and endogenous antioxidant responses and dissimilar dietary antioxidant reactions occur during two repeated female soccer games. Finally, the complex antioxidant response to soccer is not affected by active recovery training. 3aexercise 3aathletic performance 3aantioxidant activity 3asports 3awomen 3asports nutrition 3aathletes 3aoxidative stress 3abiomarkers 3atocopherols 3aascorbic acid 3apolyphenols 3acarotenoids 0aactive recovery training 0asoccer games 0aelite female soccer players1 aKarlsen, Anette1 aBlomhoff, Rune1 aRaastad, Truls1 aKadi, Fawzi0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2010 Nov., v. 104, no. 10 p.1492-1499dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145100023943Available from publisher's Web site  a20110406b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/02/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02575naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245006900150300001600219500002400235520158200259650001901841650002801860650001401888650002601902650002201928650001901950650000901969650002501978650001502003651001002018700002102028773009202049852000902141856007502150655001202225IND4463152020221122221018.0120507s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446315202DNAL7 a10.1071/BT020942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuma, T.B.10aIsozyme variation in five provenances of Santalum album in India  ap. 243-249.  aIncludes references  aSantalum album L., the 'East Indian sandalwood', is among the oldest known perfumery material, highly acclaimed worldwide. Genetic diversity within and between five Indian sandal provenances, namely Marayoor (Kerala state), Bangalore, Mandagadde and Thangli (Karnataka state) and Javadis (Tamil Nadu state), was investigated by using metabolic enzymes, viz. peroxidase (PRX), shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH), glucophosphate isomerase (GPI), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and esterase (EST). Ten of the eleven resolved loci (90.9%) were found to be polymorphic at least in one of the individuals analysed. Observed heterozygosity, both at the locus and provenance level, was higher than the expected heterozygosity in Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The average rate of gene flow between the provenances was found to be very low (0.069). An examination of the partitioning of genetic diversity within and between provenances indicated that 78.3% of the observed variation occurred between provenances and the rest of the variation within provenances. The genetic relatedness of the five provenances was revealed by the UPGMA dendrogram, which comprised of mainly two clusters. Bangalore and Thangli were the most genetically similar and Marayoor and Mandagadde were the most diverse provenances. The low degree of genetic variability within Santalum album provenances might be due to the fragmentation of a previously large original population, resulting in loss of genetic variation, least amount of gene flow between provenances and differentiation of population due to random drift. 3aSantalum album 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene flow 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amalate dehydrogenase 3aprovenance 3aIndia1 aBalasundaran, M.0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2003, v. 51, no. 3 p.243-249dCSIRO Pubx0067-19247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT020943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01762naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011100129520072800240650001700968650002200985650001101007650002601018650002501044650002401069650002601093650001501119650001001134651001701144700002501161700001701186773006801203852000901271856008601280939003301366946001301399655001201412IND4462390320221122221135.0111205e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446239032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohse, Barbara10aIntention to Consume Fruits and Vegetables Is Not a Proxy for Intake in Low-Income Women from Pennsylvania  aIntention as an outcome measure for fruit and vegetable nutrition education interventions in low-income women was assessed through dietary assessment 3 weeks after a fruit and vegetable intervention in a federally funded program. Amount and variety of intake were compared to intentions expressed immediately following intervention. Findings suggested intentions did not approximate self-reported intake. For example, of 85 women indicating little baseline fruit variety, 47 intended to increase variety following the intervention; only two met the anticipated improvement. In all, only 25 participants met one or more intentions to improve intake.

a2019-12-05  aThe population structure of the blast pathogen, Pyricularia grisea, was analyzed at two field sites used for evaluating blast resistance in rice. During 1992, 1,516 monoconidial isolates of the pathogen were collected from 38 rice cultivars and lines from the blast nursery of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI-BN) and from the upland screening site at Cavinti. Each isolate was subjected to DNA fingerprinting and phenetic analysis using the probe MGR586. Nine lineages were detected at Cavinti during the wet season. Although the same four lineages were collected from the IRRI-BN during the dry and wet seasons, the relative abundance of lineages differed in the two collections. While the lineage diversity was greater at Cavinti than at the IRRI-BN in either season, the haplotypic diversities of the collections were similar. Genetic differentiation and chi-square analysis indicated that populations of the fungus were differentiated geographically and temporally. The largest proportion of differentiation was attributable to host selection (G(ST) = 0.39). To assess how well field infection reflected compatibility, a subset of isolates was inoculated on their hosts of origin. Isolates were often unable to reinfect their hosts of origin, especially isolates belonging to the dominant pathogen lineage and when collected from young seedlings and those with low diseased leaf area. Our results provided insight into pathogen population structure, and provided useful information for rice improvement and management. 3adry season 3acultivars 3aOryza sativa 3apathogenicity 3adisease resistance 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3adisease surveys 3awet season 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aPhilippines 0asymptoms 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aZeigler, R.S.1 aLeung, H.1 aNelson, R.J.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Sept., v. 85, no. 9 p.1011-1020x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03052naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001800200500001500218520167900233650001801912650002001930650003701950650003901987650003402026650002502060650003102085650002602116650002802142650004002170650001802210653003402228653002902262653002102291653003002312653001702342653003202359700001602391700001702407700001502424773007502439852000902514930003302523945001302556946001302569655001202582IND2052665020221122175527.0960819e199510  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205266502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWijkamp, I.10aDistinct levels of specificity in thrips transmission of Tospoviruses  ap. 1069-1074.  a2019-12-05  aVarious thrips species were tested for their ability to transmit different tospovirus species using a petunia leaf disk assay system. Transmission efficiencies were determined for four species of thrips and four tospovirus species: tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), impatiens necrotic spot virus, tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV), and groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV). Frankliniella occidentalis appeared to be the most efficient vector for the four tospovirus species tested. A dark form of F. schultzei transmitted three (TSWV, TCSV, and GRSV) of the four tospoviruses, whereas a light form of this species transmitted TSWV and TCSV rather poorly. F. intonsa, which has been documented as vector of TSWV, although transmission data were not presented, transmitted TSWV efficiently and TCSV at a very low frequency. Strikingly, only one of four populations of Thrips tabaci from different geographic regions was able to transmit one of the tospoviruses tested (TSWV) and this at a low efficiency. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that virus could be readily detected in transmitting adult thrips. Viral antigen also could be detected in some individuals that did not transmit virus to petunia leaf disks, but the amount of virus detected was consistently lower than those of transmitters. Positive ELISA values were found only for thrips-tospovirus combinations in which virus transmission could occur, whereas negative ELISA scores were observed for all individuals from thrips-virus combinations in which no virus transmission took place, indicating that acquisition of the virus did not result in replication and accumulation of these viruses in thrips. 3aplant viruses 3adisease vectors 3aTomato chlorotic spot tospovirus 3aImpatiens necrotic spot tospovirus 3aGroundnut ringspot tospovirus 3adisease transmission 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aFrankliniella intonsa 3aFrankliniella schultzei 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3aThrips tabaci 0aImpatiens necrotic spot virus 0aGroundnut ringspot virus 0aPeribunyaviridae 0aTomato spotted wilt virus 0aBunyaviridae 0aTomato chlorotic spot virus1 aAlmarza, N.1 aGoldbach, R.1 aPeters, D.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.1069-1074x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01754naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245012000132520075400252650002501006650002201031650002201053650002301075650002101098650002401119650001901143650002001162651001001182700002701192773006801219852000901287856008601296939003301382946001301415655001201428IND4462390120221122142142.0111205e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446239012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassano, Louis V.10aStrategic Partnerships That Strengthen Extension's Community-Based Entrepreneurship Programs: An Example from Maine  aThis article explains how Extension can enhance and expand its nationwide community-based entrepreneurship programs by developing strategic partnerships with other organizations to create highly effective educational programs for rural entrepreneurs.

Design: We combined genome-wide linkage scans of six cohorts from Australia, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom with an 10-cM microsatellite marker map. Variance components linkage analysis was carried out with age, sex and country of origin as covariates. Subjects: The GenomEUtwin consortium consists of twin cohorts from eight countries (Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom) with a total data collection of more than 500 000 monozygotic and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Variance due to early-life events and the environment is reduced within twin pairs, which makes DZ pairs highly valuable for linkage studies of complex traits. This study totaled 4401 European-originated twin families (10 535 individuals) from six countries (Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Results: We found suggestive evidence for a quantitative trait locus on 3q29 and 7q36 in the combined sample of DZ twins (multipoint logarithm of odds score (MLOD) 2.6 and 2.4, respectively). Two individual cohorts showed strong evidence independently for three additional loci: 16q23 (MLOD=3.7) and 2p24 (MLOD=3.4) in the Dutch cohort and 20q13 (MLOD=3.2) in the Finnish cohort. Conclusion: Linkage analysis of the combined data in this large twin cohort study provided evidence for suggestive linkage to BMI. In addition, two cohorts independently provided significant evidence of linkage to three new loci. The results of our study suggest a smaller environmental variance between DZ twins than full siblings, with a corresponding increase in heritability for BMI as well as an increase in linkage signal in well-replicated regions. The results are consistent with the possibility of locus heterogeneity for some genomic regions, and indicate a lack of major common quantitative trait locus variants affecting BMI in European populations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3ahuman nutrition 3atwins 3acohort studies 3abody mass index 3alinkage (genetics) 3aloci 3agenetic variance 3aage 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3ageographical variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3aheritability 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 3xgenetics 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 7xgenetics 2aCohort Studies 2aWhite Peoplexgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkagexgenetics 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMiddle Aged 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aTwinsxgenetics 2aTwins, Dizygoticxgenetics 3aEurope 0aEurope 0amonozygotic twins 0adizygotic twins1 aPerola, M.1 aMartin, N.G.1 aCornes, B.K.1 aWilson, S.G.1 aMontgomery, G.W.1 aBenyamin, B.1 aHarris, J.R.1 aBoomsma, D.1 aWillemsen, G.1 aHottenga, J.J.1 aSlagboom, P.E.1 aChristensen, K.1 aKyvik, K.O.1 aSørensen, T.I.A.1 aPedersen, N.L.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2009 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.1235–1242-1235–1242dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2009.1683Available from publisher's Web site  a20100127b20100205c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/01/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02418naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009700128300001600225500001500241520124600256650002401502650000901526650001501535650001301550650001201563650002001575650001601595650001401611650001401625650001101639650001301650650001801663650002501681650001201706650001901718650001401737650002301751653002701774700001901801773007201820852000901892930003301901945001301934946001301947655001201960IND2052320320221122063944.0960726e199507  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205232032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenyagoub, M.10aDevelopment of a mutant strain of Sporothrix flocculosa with resistance to dodemorph-acetate  ap. 766-770.  a2019-12-05  aSeveral isolates of the powdery mildew biocontrol fungus Sporothrix flocculosa were screened for their resistance to the systemic fungicide dodemorph-acetate (Meltatox) by repeated exposure to increasing concentrations of the fungicide. Through this procedure, we obtained a new strain that was able to grow and form colonies on solid media amended with 300 micrograms of fungicide per ml, a concentration that exceeded the recommended dosage by 50% and totally inhibited the growth of the wild-type strain. This resistance trait was maintained after several subcultures on fungicide-free media. When tested for its biocontrol ability, the dodemorph-resistant strain was able to colonize conidia and mycelium of Sphaerotheca fuliginea as efficiently as the wild-type strain. In addition, the new strain was not hampered in its ability to control powdery mildew when applied in mixture with dodermorph-acetate, whereas the wild-type strain was unable to colonize the pathogen in the presence of the fungicide. This is the first report of resistance against dodemorph-acetate in a powdery mildew biocontrol agent and, to our knowledge, in a fungus. This new strain could have practical application in integrated control of rose powdery mildew. 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3aRosa 3aSporothrix 3aacetates 3aconidia 3aCucumis sativus 3aantagonists 3aphenotype 3adodemorph 3ahyphae 3abiotypes 3apathogenicity 3afungicide resistance 3amutants 3aultrastructure 3ascreening 3abiological control 0aSphaerotheca fuliginea1 aBelanger, R.R.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 July, v. 85, no. 7 p.766-770x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02615naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245013000134300001600264500001500280520156900295650002501864650002201889650001501911650001301926650002601939650002201965650002401987650001002011650004302021653001502064700002102079700001502100773006002115852000902175930003302184945001302217946001102230655001202241IND2035509120221121160911.0931022s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203550912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarvaez-Vasquez, J.10aProteinase-inhibitor synthesis in tomato plants: evidence for extracellular deposition in roots through the secretory pathway  ap. 257-266.  a2019-12-04  aThe cellular and subcellular localization of proteinase Inhibitors I and II proteins, synthesized in transgenic tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) plants from chimeric genes regulated by the 35S promoter, was investigated by immunocytochemical techniques. Newly synthesized inhibitor proteins were deposited in the cell vacuoles as in wild-type plants, but were also secreted into the cell walls of outer epidermal and secretory cells of the root cap. The Na ionophore monensin increased the levels of proteinase inhibitors found in rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi cisternae and in the cell walls of transgenic plants, supporting a role for the secretory pathway in the sorting and targeting of Inhibitor I and II proteins. The two inhibitor proteins were detected by Western-blot analysis in water-washes obtained from roots of transgenic tomato seedlings, confirming their extracellular presence. Wild-type tomato plants exhibited the presence of Inhibitor I and II proteins in the external cell walls, using silver-enhanced immunogold labelling, but not by Western-blot analysis. The extracellular Inhibitor I from transgenic plant roots migrated in electrophoretic gels with a slightly different apparent mass than the Inhibitor I isolated from tomato leaf vacuoles, indicating that specific structural features of this inhibitor protein have been altered during or after extracellular deposition. The presence of extracellular inhibitors in roots may help provide protection for the growing meristems against insects or microorganisms present in the soil. 3aintercellular spaces 3aprotein synthesis 3acell walls 3avacuoles 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aprotein secretion 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aroots 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aparenchyma1 aFranceschi, V.R.1 aRyan, C.A.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 189, no. 2 p.257-266x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02333naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100002000186245004500206300001400251500002400265500001500289520097000304650001501274650003701289650002401326650001601350650002101366650002101387650002501408650001701433650002301450650002101473651001101494653001801505653002501523653002601548773010901574852000901683856009001692930003301782945002501815946001101840655001201851IND4429507620221121092229.0091203e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442950762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2009.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE720 0aE700 0aT000 0aX3801 aHonkanen, Pirjo10aFood preference based segments in Russia  ap. 65-74.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe health situation of Russian consumers is alarming. Food consumption patterns are one of the main reasons for poor health among Russians. Although there have been studies about the relationship between poverty, food consumption and health, research on preferences among Russian consumers is lacking even though preferences have a strong influence on food choices and thereby (un)healthy consumption patterns. A survey of 1081 Russian consumers in four cities was conducted. The purpose of this paper was to identify segments among Russian consumers according to their food preferences. Five segments were identified, with different preference patterns for the following chosen food groups: fish lovers, fish haters, various food lovers, food indifferent and red meat lovers. The segments were profiled by means of food consumption, food choice motives, attitudinal variables and socio-demographic variables.

In this rapidly changing and increasingly competitive environment, successful production units utilize and embrace modern manufacturing concepts and principles to improve their competitive position and increase their efficiency and productivity. These concepts have not replaced the well-recognized concepts of commodity production that were used in the past, such as an emphasis on cost control through a combination of increased size, improved efficiency, and adoption of the latest technology in all phases of the production process. However, the traditional techniques of obtaining efficiency, reducing cost, and increasing margins are no longer sufficient to ensure successful agricultural production. The manufacturing concepts discussed in this paper suggest additional strategies that are necessary for success in modern agricultural production. 3amilk production 3adairy farming 3amarkets 3arisk 0ainformation needs 0asystems approach1 aSchiek, W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.1753-1761x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245017500168300001500343500002400358500001500382520160500397650002902002650001102031650002002042650001002062650004002072650002602112650001002138650002402148650001602172650001002188650001602198650001502214650001802229650001602247650001202263650001502275653001002290700002202300700001902322773009302341852000902434856004802443655001202491IND4423658220221121031959.0090724e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442365822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-009-9830-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aV.-Balogh, Katalin10aSpecific attenuation coefficients of optically active substances and their contribution to the underwater ultraviolet and visible light climate in shallow lakes and ponds  ap. 91-105.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSunlight penetration through the water column is controlled by the amount and kind of materials dissolved and suspended in the water. Understanding UV penetration in its complexity is essential for the prediction of the impact of UV radiation on aquatic ecosystems. However, only limited data are available on the penetration of UVR into shallow waters rich in inorganic suspended solids and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The same is true for the specific attenuation coefficients of light-absorbing components at the UV waveband. This study analyses the role of CDOM, algal-free suspended solids and algae in the formation of underwater UVR and PAR climate in 30 water bodies from clear gravel pit lakes trough the shallow Lake Balaton to turbid soda pans. Irradiance-depth profiles were obtained at 305, 313, 320 nm (UV-B), 340, 380, 395 nm (UV-A) and 400-700 nm (PAR) with a Biospherical PUV-2500 radiometer. Vertical attenuation coefficients (K d) were calculated. Water samples were taken for the laboratory measurement of the concentration of light-absorbing components: algae as chlorophyll a (CHL), chromophoric dissolved organic matter as colour (CDOM), and algal-free suspended solids (TSS-Alg) parallel with the in situ light measurements. Specific attenuation coefficient values were calculated by multiple regression analysis (n = 140). The obtained specific UV attenuation coefficient values of CHL, CDOM and TSS-Alg made it possible to establish light attenuation at different wavelengths based on the knowledge of the concentration of these light-absorbing components. 3adissolved organic matter 3agravel 3asolar radiation 3alakes 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aultraviolet radiation 3aponds 3aregression analysis 3aradiometers 3acolor 3awavelengths 3aecosystems 3asurface water 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3aprediction 0aAlgae1 aNémeth, Balázs.1 aVörös, Lajos0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 Oct., v. 632, no. 1 p.91-105dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9830-9 7aarticle02550naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007200131300001800203520151100221650002201732650002501754650001801779650003201797650002501829650001101854650001001865650002601875650002101901653001301922653001101935700001901946700002201965700001601987773009302003852000902096930003302105945001302138946001302151655001202164IND2057155720221120220822.0970516e199512  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205715572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaudreault, S.M.10aSoil water pressure and Verticillium dahliae interactions on potato  ap. 1542-1546.  aFoliar and root growth of potato (cv. Russet Burbank) and colonization of roots and stem vascular sap by Verticillium dahliae were monitored weekly for 4 weeks beginning at emergence in soils maintained at different water pressures. A significant soil water pressure X V. dahliae interaction resulted in reduced aerial biomass and increased root-to-shoot ratio under excessive soil moisture conditions (-0.01 MPa). At -0.01 MPa, the percent increase in root-to-shoot ratio of plants grown in infested compared with noninfected soil ranged from 40 to 82% over 2 years. In contrast, both root length and colonization of roots by V. dahliae were significantly suppressed at -0.01 MPa compared with the lowest soil water pressure (-0.15 MPa). Roots of plants grown at -0.01 compared with -0.15 MPa were 19.6 to 44% shorter at emergence, and suppression of root growth at this high soil water pressure persisted through the observation period. Root colonization by V. dahliae was suppressed consistently at -0.01 compared with -0.15 MPa. Reduction in CFU per 100 cm of root length for these respective soil water pressures ranged from 60 to 100%. Soil water pressure had no effect on the population size of V. dahliae in stem sap. High soil water pressures may enhance potato early dying caused by V. dahliae by slowing root growth and/or by indirectly increasing the rate of microsclerotial germination. Both would facilitate entry of the pathogen into the stele through the vulnerable tissue of the root apex. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3apathogenicity 3ahost-parasite relationships 3asoil water potential 3aleaves 3aroots 3aquantitative analysis 3aroot shoot ratio 0asymptoms 0agrowth1 aPowelson, M.L.1 aChristensen, N.W.1 aCrowe, F.J.0 tPhytopathology.g1995 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.1542-1546wJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02832naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012300128300001600251500001500267520162000282650003801902650001501940650002101955650001301976650001501989650001502004650001702019650001502036650001902051650001502070650001702085650002002102650001902122653002302141653001602164653001102180700002102191700001702212700001902229773006002248852000902308930003302317945001302350946001102363655001202374IND2035505820221120220740.0931022s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203550582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesford, R.T.10aEffect of polyamines on stabilization of molecular complexes in thylakoid membranes of osmotically stressed oat leaves  ap. 201-206.  a2019-12-04  aMonocotyledonous leaves subjected to osmotica used for protoplast isolation accumulate a massive amount of putrescine (Put), lose chlorophyll and senesce rapidly. Treatment with spermidine (Spd) or spermine (Spm) prevents the loss of chlorophyll, indicating preservation of the thylakoid membranes at the site of the chlorophyll-protein complexes. Using several recently produced antibody probes, the effects on the stabilization of thylakoid membranes of applying either difluoromethylarginine (DFMA), a specific inhibitor of putrescine synthesis via arginine decarboxylase, or the polyamines Spd, Spm, or diaminopropane (Dap) to osmotically shocked oat leaves (Avena sativa L.) have been investigated. High protein levels were maintained in thylakoid membranes of leaf tissue incubated in the dark in the presence of 0.6 M sorbitol when pretreated with DFMA. After 48 h incubation, the level of the thylakoid protein D1, at the core of photosystem II, was higher in the DFMA-pretreated leaves as was the stromal protein ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco; as indicated by the level of large subunits). Applications of Spd, Spm or Dap were effective in retarding the loss of D1, D2 and cytochrome f from the thylakoid membranes as well as Rubisco large subunits and chlorophyll from the leaf tissue. The effects of polyamine applications may be mediated through Dap since most of the added Spd or Spm was converted to Dap within 6 h. The possible mechanisms of action of polyamine applications and DFMA-pretreatment on stabilizing the composition of the thylakoid membrane are also discussed. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase

The physical equipment and data processing methodology for the calibration of the SMPS are described which quantify and control the sources of calibration error. Equipment is described for the control of calibration temperature and pressure. A statistically objective definition of equilibrium, based on correlation analysis between the SMPS measurements and applied calibration pressure, is presented. The proposed method results in SMPS calibrations within the accuracy limits of the components of the calibration system [+/- 0.001 MPa (0.01 bars) for pressure, and +/- 0.04 degrees C (0.07 degrees F) for temperature]. A step-by-step outline of the proposed calibration method and details of precautions to follow are also provided. 3astatistics 3aequipment 3acalibration 3adata analysis 3asoil water 0asensors1 aPhene, C.J.1 aClark, D.A.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1993 Mar., v. 9, no. 2 p.213-219x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdNNL  aOther US 7aarticle01259naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245005800152300001600210500001500226520005900241650001200300650001500312650002000327650001200347650002500359650002400384650002800408650002600436650004000462650002400502650002300526650002400549650003800573653002800611653001300639700001800652773009400670852000900764939003300773945000800806946001100814655001200825991604213450742620221120164536.0830429e198205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830044602DNAL7 a70992052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindmark, D.G.10aPyrimidine metabolism in Giardia lamblia trophozoites  ap. 291-296.  a2019-12-04  aGiardia lamblia, pyrimidine metabolism in trophozoites 3aenzymes 3ametabolism 3aGiardia lamblia 2aAnimals 2aCytidinexmetabolism 2aGiardiaxmetabolism 2aPyrimidinesxmetabolism 2aThymidinexmetabolism 2aThymidine Phosphorylasexmetabolism 2aThyminexmetabolism 2aUracilxmetabolism 2aUridinexmetabolism 2aUridine Phosphorylasexmetabolism 0aNucleic acids, Protozoa 0aProtozoa1 aJarroll, E.L.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1982 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.291-296x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830429c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle04897naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245010600144300001800250520280100268650003203069650001303101650002203114650001303136650002403149650002303173650001803196650001603214650001703230650001103247650001403258650002303272650001103295650001803306650002603324650001803350650001203368650002203380650001903402650001803421650001303439650001603452650001003468650002103478650002303499650001803522650001303540650002103553650001103574650002203585650001103607650002503618650000903643650004503652650002703697650001403724650002403738650003203762700001603794700002903810700001503839700001803854700001803872773019303890852000904083930003304092945001304125946001304138655001204151IND2321430920221120154519.0010608e200010  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232143092DNAL7 a110932942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHood, M.Y.10aParental eating attitudes and the development of obesity in children. The Framingham Children's Study  ap. 1319-1325.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the extent to which parents' degree of dietary self-control, as measured by self-reported dietary restraint, disinhibition, and perceived hunger, affects the development of excess body fat in the child. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SUBJECTS: Ninety-two 3-5 y old children and their parents, enrolled in 1987 in the Framingham Children's Study. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported levels of parental dietary restraint, disinhibition and perceived hunger were estimated using Stunkard and Messick's Three-Factor-Eating Questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight and skinfold measurements at five sites) were obtained yearly for children and parents. The child's activity level was measured on multiple days each year using Caltrac accelerometers. Energy intake and percentage of calories from total fat were estimated from multiple sets of food diaries, collected each year. All analyses were adjusted for the following potential confounders: child's sex and baseline values for age, height, mean physical activity level, total calories and percentage of calories from fat as well as the educational levels of the parents at baseline. RESULTS: Over 6 y, children's body fat increased linearly with increasing levels of self-reported parental disinhibition (eg 6 y increase in the child's sum of five skinfolds was 34.4, 45.8 and 59.2 mm across increasing tertiles of parental disinhibition, P = 0.012). Overall, children whose parents had higher dietary restraint scores had greater increases in body fatness than children whose parents had the lowest levels of restraint. When both parents had above average scores on dietary disinhibition or restraint, the children had greater increases in body fat (on all anthropometry measures) than when only one parent or when neither parent had high scores on those factors. Parental scores on the perceived hunger scale had no clear effect on body fat change of children. Since disinhibition and dietary restraint frequently co-exist, we then examined the joint effect of these two factors. The children with the greatest increases in body fat were those whose parents scored high on both factors. In the final analysis, we found that dietary restraint adversely affected the child's body fat only when associated with high parental disinhibition. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that parents who display high levels of disinhibited eating, especially when coupled with high dietary restraint, may foster the development of excess body fat in their children. This association may be mediated by direct parental role modeling of unhealthy eating behaviors, or through other indirect, and probably subconscious, behavioral consequences such as the suppression of the child's innate regulation of dietary intake. 3aanthropometric measurements 3abody fat 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adietary restriction 3aeducational status 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afood records 3ahunger 3aingestion 3ametabolic diseases 3amodels 3anormal values 3aobservational studies 3aparental role 3aparents 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 2aAnthropometry 2aAttitude 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aEatingxpsychology 2aEnergy Intake 2aExercise 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aObesityxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aParent-Child Relations 2aParenting 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires.1 aMoore, L.L.1 aSundarajan-Ramamurti, A.1 aSinger, M.1 aCupples, L.A.1 aEllison, R.C.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2000 Oct., v. 24, no. 10 p.1319-1325x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03128naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245010400144300001800248500001500266520155800281650001501839650002301854650001901877650001201896650002401908650001901932650002801951650001601979650001201995650002302007650000902030650004302039650004602082650001102128650001802139650001102157650001402168650002802182650002002210653001602230653001902246653001302265653003102278653001502309700001702324700001702341700002302358700001702381773008402398852000902482930003302491945001302524946001302537655001202550IND2196430320221120154405.0990112e199806  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219643032DNAL7 a96841702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, M.L.10aEffect of intake of pasture on concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid in milk of lactating cows  ap. 1630-1636.  a2019-12-05  aWe examined the effect of intake of fresh pasture on concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid in milk fat. Sixteen Holstein cows were paired and divided into either the control group or the grazing group. The study involved initial, transition, and final periods. During the initial period, all cows consumed a total mixed diet. Cows in the control group were fed the total mixed diet throughout the study, and cows in the grazing group were gradually adjusted to a diet consisting of intensively managed pasture. Performance of cows in the grazing group was significantly reduced from that of cows in the control group during the final period (dry matter intake, 19% less; milk yield, 29.6 vs. 44.1 kg/d; and live weight, 40 kg less). During the initial period, when both groups were consuming a total mixed diet, concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid in milk fat were similar (average = 5.1 mg/g of milk fat). As the grazing group was gradually adjusted to pasture, concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid in milk gradually increased. During the final period, when cows in the grazing group were consuming a diet consisting of pasture only, conjugated linoleic acid concentrations in the milk fat were doubled (10.9 vs. 4.6 mg/g of milk fat). Furthermore, results showed the individual consistency of the milk fat content of conjugated linoleic acid over time but also demonstrated substantial variation among this study indicated that the concentration of conjugated linoleic acid in milk fat is enhanced by dietary intake of fresh pasture. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3alinolenic acid 3agrazing 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein percentage 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDiet 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLinoleic Acidxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 0afatty acids 0acomplete feeds 0amilk fat 0aindividual characteristics 0amilk yield1 aKolver, E.S.1 aBauman, D.E.1 aAmburgh, M.E. van.1 aMuller, L.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.1630-1636x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01406naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100003000115245006200145300001600207500001500223520007900238650001300317650002600330650001200356650002500368650002000393650002200413653004000435653003300475653001300508653004600521653003500567653003100602653004300633653005200676653003300728653001400761700001600775700002500791773008100816852000900897939003300906945000800939946001300947655001200960991604211940742620221120154311.0830513e198208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830046142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoncalves de Lima, V.M.Q.10aComparison of six isoenzymes from 10 species of Crithidia  ap. 397-401.  a2019-12-04  aCrithidia, 10 spp., comparison of electrophoretic mobility of 6 isoenzymes 3ataxonomy 3aCrithidia fasciculata 3aenzymes 3aprotozoal infections 3aelectrophoresis 3adisease diagnosis 0aCrithidia acanthocephali (Protozoa) 0aCrithidia harmosa (Protozoa) 0aProtozoa 0aCrithidia luciliae thermophila (Protozoa) 0aCrithidia oncopelti (Protozoa) 0aCrithidia arili (Protozoa) 0aCrithidia luciliae luciliae (Protozoa) 0aCrithidia sp.

The enzyme purified from recombinant Escherichia coli had a molecular mass of about 35kDa on SDS-PAGE and only required NADPH as an electron donor. The K m value of PsCR for ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate was 4.9mg/mL and the corresponding V max was 337μmol/mgprotein/min. The catalytic efficiency value was the highest ever reported for reductases from yeasts. Moreover, PsCR exhibited a medium-range substrate spectrum toward various keto and aldehyde compounds, i.e., ethyl-3-oxobutanoate with a chlorine substitution at the 2 or 4-position, or α,β-diketones. In addition, the activity of the enzyme was strongly inhibited by SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, but not by ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid. 3aacetic acid 3aethylene 3aelectrons 3asubstrate specificity 3amolecular weight 3aenzymes 3achlorine 3aenzyme activity 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3ayeasts 3achromatography 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aammonium sulfate 3aaldehydes 3aEscherichia coli 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAldehyde Reductase 2aAldehydesxchemistry 2aAmmonium Sulfatexpharmacology 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aEdetic Acidxchemistry 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aMercaptoethanolxchemistry 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistry 2aPichiaxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistry 2aStereoisomerism 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aPichia stipitis1 aYan, Ming1 aYao, Zhong1 aXu, Lin1 aCao, Hou1 aLi, Zhengjiang1 aChen, Yong1 aLi, Shuya1 aBai, Jianxin1 aXiong, Jian1 aYing, Hanjie1 aOuyang, Pingkai0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Dec., v. 100, no. 23 p.6022-6027dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.014 7aarticle01223naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007600148300001600224520009600240650002600336650001500362650001300377650001200390650002700402650002900429650001900458650003200477650004900509650001700558653001700575653002100592653002100613700001600634700002000650773008000670852000900750939003300759945000800792946001300800655001200813991604210660742620221120134309.0830506e198205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830046082DNAL7 a70477302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVial, H.J.10aPhospholipid biosynthesis in synchronous Plasmodium falciparum cultures  ap. 258-263.  asynchronous Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in vitro, phospholipid biosynthesis 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3ametabolism 3aProtozoa 2aAnimals 2aCytological Techniques 2aErythrocytesxmetabolism 2aMalariaxblood 2aPhospholipidsxbiosynthesis 2aPlasmodium falciparumxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 0aLipids, Host 0aLipids, Protozoa 0aMetabolism, Host1 aThuet, M.J.1 aPhilippot, J.R.0 tJournal of protozoology.g1982 May, v. 29, no. 2 p.258-263x0022-39217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830506c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01511naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245009300177300001600270500001500286520052400301650003400825650001400859650001400873650001400887651001300901653001800914653002400932700001500956773009200971852000901063856005701072939003301129946001101162655001201173IND9301919420221120134348.0930402e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930191942DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0884812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueiredo, A.C.S.10aUltrastructural aspects of the nectary spur of Limodorum abortivum (L) Sw.

Cows were allocated to a treatment group receiving a slow-release intraruminal bolus containing 32 g of sodium monensin that was administered 40 d before and 50 d following the anticipated calving date or to a control group. Treatment did not significantly alter any reproductive outcome; 54.5% of cows treated with monensin and 58.2% of control cows were pregnant at first service, and days to conception were lower for cows treated with monensin. The hazard rate (0.95) was not significant for these cows. The percentage of cows pregnant was 83.8 for cows treated with monensin and 83.3 for control cows, and days to first estrus (hazard rate = 1.04) and first service (hazard rate = 1.04) were not significantly higher for treated cows. Treatment with monensin did not significantly alter the risk of any disease. The incidence of retained fetal membranes, pyometra, lameness, abortion, and infectious diseases was not significantly lower for cows in the treatment group, and the incidence of mastitis was not significantly higher for cows in the treatment group. Monensin significantly increased milk production by 0.75 L/d per cow and tended to increase milk fat and protein yields but had no significant effect on milk fat or milk protein percentages. Changes in the production of milk and milk constituents were consistent throughout lactation. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3apregnancy rate 3acalving 3aanimal health 3alameness 3auterine diseases 3abovine mastitis 3amilk fat yield 3amilk fat percentage 3amonensin 3amilk protein percentage 3apostpartum interval 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHealth Status 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMonensinxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aPregnancy 2aReproductionxdrug effects 3aAustralia 0arepeat breeders 0aparturition complications 0acontrolled release 0amilk yield1 aDyson, R.1 aTranter, W.1 aWade, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.1563-1573x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02554naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245007000172300001600242500001500258520156500273650001101838650001001849650001401859650001801873650001901891650002101910651001401931651001201945653001801957700001501975773009201990852000902082856005702091939003302148946001102181655001202192IND9301919320221120124204.0930402e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930191932DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0884802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauseth, J.D.10aCortical bundles in the persistant, photosynthetic stems of cacti  ap. 317-324.  a2019-12-04  aWe examined 62 species in 45 genera of the cactus subfamily Cactoideae; all had collateral cortical bundles that permeated the broad, water-storing inner cortex and extended to the base of the outer, photosynthetic palisade cortex. Mean distance between cortical bundles was 0.75 mm, similar to the mean spacing (0.74 mm) of veins in leaves of Pereskia, a genus of relict leaf-bearing cacti. In 16 species, both young and extremely old stem cortex was available for study: in all of these, older bundles had larger amounts of phloem than did younger bundles, indicating that phloem had been produced for many years. In ten species, older bundles also had more xylem than younger bundles. In two genera (Rhipsalis and Selenicereus) there were caps of primary phloem fibres, and in a single species (Pilosocereus mortensenii) cortical bundle xylem contained libriform fibres. All cortical bundle tracheary elements were narrow (radius range, 0.91-8.2 micrometer; mode, 1.8-2.7 micrometers), similar to Pereskia leaf vein elements (radius range, 1.8-2.7 micrometers), this was much narrower than stem wood vessels (radius range, 10-42 micrometers; mode, 23-28 micrometers). Longitudinal conduction of water and nutrients probably occurs predominantly in stem wood, with cortical bundles maintaining the broad, voluminous cortex, the outer part of which is the plant's photosynthetic tissue and the inner part of which stores water and starch. The cortex of the Cactoideae contains numerous leaflike characters; homeotic genes may be involved in its morphogenesis. 3acortex 3astems 3aCactaceae 3amorphogenesis 3aphotosynthesis 3avascular bundles 3aVenezuela 3aEcuador 0aplant anatomy1 aSajeva, M.0 tAnnals of botany.g1992 Oct., v. 70, no. 4 p.317-324wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a088480  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03081naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245012800143300001600271500001500287520135200302650002801654650002401682650002401706650001901730650001001749650002301759650002301782650001301805650001901818650001501837650001001852650000901862650002201871650001801893650002801911650003201939650001001971650001801981650001101999650001902010650001102029650000902040650001602049650002202065650002402087651001602111651002502127653001302152700001402165700001402179700001602193773019002209852000902399930003302408945001302441946001302454655001202467IND2331592320221120124126.0030325e200202  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233159232DNAL7 a118507552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJee, S.H.10aSegregation analysis of waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio in the Korean Nationwide Family Study  ap. 228-233.  a2019-12-05  aAIM: A central distribution of adipose tissue is frequently associated with cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. In this study, we investigated environmental, familial and genetic influences on waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in 2507 members of 435 families who had participated in the Korean Nationwide Health Examination Survey. METHOD: Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit several genetic and nongenetic models of inheritance to these data to determine whether an unobserved Mendelian major gene could explain the familial distribution of WC, HC and WHR. Adjustments for age, age2, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption and exercise were carried out separately for males and females by multiple regression procedures for WC, HC and WHR phenotypes prior to segregation analysis. Regression models were used to test genetic and non-genetic models in these 435 families. RESULTS: Segregation analysis did not provide statistical evidence of a major gene controlling either HC or WHR. Mendelian single-locus models with two underlying genotypic distributions were best supported by these data on WC, and this putative major gene explained the 22.4% of variance in adjusted WC. CONCLUSION: Future linkage studies may be worthwhile to further clarify the mechanisms controlling WC. 3aepidemiological studies 3aregression analysis 3awaist circumference 3ahuman genetics 3agenes 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3afamilial incidence 3abody fat 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnthropometry 2aAsian Peoplexgenetics. 2aBody Constitutionxgenetics 2aChild 2aFamily Health 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxgenetics 2aRegression Analysis 3aSouth Korea 0aKoreaxepidemiology. 0afamilies1 aKim, M.T.1 aLee, S.Y.1 aBeaty, T.H.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2002 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.228-233x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle04278naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001900163245013300182300001800315500001500333520229700348650001702645650001702662650002902679650001802708650001702726650001602743650001702759650001202776650002802788650002302816650001202839650002602851650001402877650001702891650001402908650001102922650001502933650001002948650000902958650004102967650005003008650001903058650001103077650001103088650001503099650000903114650001603123650002103139650004203160650002803202653001503230653002303245700001403268700001603282700002103298773019303319852000903512930003303521945002503554946001303579655001203592IND4375374020221120124224.0051021e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437537402DNAL7 a159972502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDouketis, J.D.10aSystematic review of long-term weight loss studies in obese adults: clinical significance and applicability to clinical practice  ap. 1153-1167.  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND: Obesity is a common health problem that requires a long-term care approach. We systematically reviewed long-term (greater than or equal to 2 y) studies investigating dietary/lifestyle, pharmacologic, and surgical weight loss methods to assess (1) weight loss efficacy, defined by absolute weight loss and the proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 5% weight loss, (2) effects of weight loss on cardiovascular risk factors, and (3) applicability of findings from studies to everyday clinical practice. METHODS: The MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials databases were searched for studies investigating the long-term efficacy of weight loss methods in overweight and obese adults. Data were extracted for (i) weight loss after 1 y (pharmacologic studies only), 2 y, 3 y, and 4 y, (ii) proportion of subjects with greater than or equal to 5% weight loss at the end of follow-up, and (iii) changes (end-of follow-up minus baseline values) in blood lipids, fasting blood glucose, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. RESULTS: Dietary/lifestyle therapy provides < 5 kg weight loss after 2-4 y, pharmacologic therapy provides 5-10 kg weight loss after 1-2 y, and surgical therapy provides 25-75 kg weight loss after 2-4 y. Weight loss of greater than or equal to 5% baseline weight is not consistently associated with improvements in cardiovascular risk factors and these benefits appear to be intervention specific and occur mainly in people with concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. Weight loss studies have methodologic limitations that restrict the applicability of findings to unselected obese people assessed in everyday clinical practice. These limitations include an inadequate study duration, large proportions of subjects lost to follow-up, a lack of an appropriate usual care group, and a lack of reporting of outcomes in high-risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary/lifestyle and pharmacologic weight loss interventions provide modest weight loss, and may improve markers of cardiovascular risk factors although these benefits occur mainly in patients with cardiovascular risks. Studies investigating weight loss have methodologic limitations that restrict the applicability of findings to obese patients assessed in clinical practice. 3ablood lipids 3adrug therapy 3adiastolic blood pressure 3ablood glucose 3arisk factors 3aweight loss 3ahuman health 3asurgery 3asystolic blood pressure 3aclinical nutrition 3aobesity 3acardiovascular system 3alifestyle 3adiet therapy 3adatabases 3aadults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxprevention & control 2aDiet, Reducing 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxtherapy 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aWeight Lossxphysiology 0aoverweight 0aliterature reviews1 aMacie, C.1 aThabane, L.1 aWilliamson, D.F.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2005 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.1153-1167x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2005/12/16  aOther US 7aarticle01102naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245010400132300001600236520024100252650002300493650001300516651002800529653002500557653002300582653006400605773008000669852000900749939003300758945000800791946001300799655001200812991604209020742620221120124208.0830504e198205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830046052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatson, B.S.12aA light and electron microscopical study of Trichoduboscqia epeori Leger (Microspora: Duboscqiidae)  ap. 202-212.  aTrichoduboscqia epeori, morphology and development, light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, pansporoblast appendages may contain collagen, taxonomic significance of finding of 32-spore as well as 16-spore pansporoblasts 3aanimal development 3aProtozoa 3aGerman Federal Republic 0aMorphology, Protozoa 0aProteins, Protozoa 0aTrichoduboscqia epeori (Protozoa)Rhithrogena iridina (Host)0 tJournal of protozoology.g1982 May, v. 29, no. 2 p.202-212x0022-39217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830504c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02023naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014100127300001200268520110900280650002101389650001001410650002201420650001401442650001801456650001801474650002101492650002301513700001901536773007601555852000901631930003301640945001301673946001101686655001201697IND2035513720221120114507.0931025e199305  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203551372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTillberg, E.10aEffect of red and far-red irradiation on ABA and IAA content in Pinus sylvestris L. seed during the escape time period from photocontrol  ap. 1-6.  aThe time-course of ABA and IAA dynamics in the photosensitive Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) seed was followed during the escape time period from photocontrol, with recordings of the respective hormone immediately before and after a 15-min red irradiation (R) stimulus and after subsequent dark incubation for periods of 10 min, 30 min, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h. The control treatment was exposure to R as above immediately followed by exposure to 5-min far-red irradiation (FR), and its effect was recorded in parallel. The hormones were identified on a gas chromatograph with a mass selective detector, and quantified on a high performance liquid chromatograph with UV detector and spectrofluorophotometer, respectively. Only ABA responded differently to the two irradiation treatments. The difference in ABA content between paired treatments with R and R + FR was significant after 6 to 8 h with an enhanced decrease in ABA content in seeds that received a dormancy-breaking R treatment. The IAA content in the seeds decreased during the experimental period regardless of the type of irradiation treatment. 3aPinus sylvestris 3aseeds 3adormancy breaking 3ared light 3afar-red light 3aabscisic acid 3aseed germination 3aindole acetic acid1 aBjorkman, P.O.0 tPlant growth regulation.g1993 May, v. 13, no. 1 p.1-6x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a19931104b19931109c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01800naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245012200150300001600272500001500288520020300303650001500506650002400521650001800545650002000563650003900583650001000622650002100632650002800653650002900681650001900710650001600729650002900745650003500774650001100809650003100820650003100851650002700882650004000909650002500949651000900974653003100983653001501014700001601029700001301045700002001058773011901078852000901197939003301206945000801239946001101247655001201258991604208400742620221120114504.0830429s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830045932DNAL7 a67619072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKharazmi, A.10aEvidence for the presence of circulating immune complexes in serum and C3b and C3d on red cells of kala-azar patients  ap. 793-796.  a2019-12-04  akala azar, children, presence of immune complexes in serum and IgG, C3b, and C3d on surface of red cells, both Leishmania antigen and anti-Leishmania antibody were detected in immune complexes: Iran 3acomplement 3aLeishmania donovani 3aleishmaniasis 3aimmunoglobulins 2aAntigen-Antibody Complexxanalysis 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aComplement C3xanalysis 2aComplement C3bxanalysis 2aComplement C3d 2aCoombs Test 2aErythrocytesximmunology 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxanalysis 2aImmunoglobulin Mxanalysis 2aLeishmaniaximmunology 2aLeishmaniasis, Visceralximmunology 2aPlatelet Aggregation 3aIran 0aImmunity, Immune complexes 0aLeishmania1 aRezai, H.R.1 aFani, M.1 aBehforouz, N.C.0 tTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.g1982, v. 76, no. 6 p.793-796x0035-92037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830429c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01217naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245010700152300001600259520009400275650002600369650002100395650001300416650002800429650001800457650001600475650002100491650003400512650004800546700001900594700002600613700002400639773011900663852000900782939003300791945000800824946001100832655001200843991604207750742620221120114456.0830429s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830045982DNAL7 a67619102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonnudurai, T.10aCultivation of fertile Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in semi-automated systems. 1.

Serum concentrations of IGF-I are increased in lactating cows that were treated with bST, and IGF-I receptors are present in bovine mammary tissue. In addition, close arterial infusion of IGF-I into the mammary gland of goats increases milk yield. Little evidence exists to support a direct galactopoietic effect of IGF-I in ruminants. However, IGF-I is a potent mitogen for mammary epithelial cells and may also influence the inhibition of apoptosis of this cell type. The IGF are found in association with a family of individual binding proteins. The high affinity of the IGF for these proteins relative to the IGF receptor allows them to modulate IGF-I bioactivity in the mammary gland at the cellular level. Mammary epithelial cells synthesize multiple forms of IGF binding proteins, and one of these, IGF binding protein-3, is specifically regulated by the IGF. Stimulation of DNA synthesis by IGF-I is enhanced in bovine mammary epithelial cells that overexpress the IGF binding protein-3. These data indicate that IGF-I can stimulate the synthesis of an IGF binding protein, which enhances its own mitogenic activity. However, whether this mechanism is operative in the lactating mammary gland in vivo is unknown. Given the complexity of the interactions between the IGF and their binding proteins, more information is needed before the role of these growth factors in regulating growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells is delineated. 3adairy cows 3abinding proteins 3amammary glands 3alactation 3asomatotropin 3ablood serum 3anutritional status 3amitosis 3aapoptosis 3ahormone receptors 3amessenger RNA 3aDNA replication 3amechanism of action 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHomeostasis 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteinsxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixbiosynthesisxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmetabolism 2aNutritional Status 0aliterature reviews 0ain vitro 0ainsulin-like growth factor0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 June, v. 81, no. 6 p.1769-1777x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02522naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013400127300001400261520159600275650002801871650001201899650001301911650002501924650002101949650001901970650001601989650002302005651001602028651001502044773008202059852000902141939003302150946001302183655001202196IND9301923420221120082853.0930405e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930192342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, S.C.10aFloral ontogeny in Sophoreae (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae). I. Myroxylon (Myroxylon group) and Castanospermum (Angylocalyx group)  ap. 65-75.  aFloral ontogeny is described and documented using scanning electron microscopy in Myroxylon balsamum and Castanospermum australe, representatives respectively of Polhill's Myroxylon and Angylocalyx groups (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae), groups exhibiting relatively unspecialized flower structure for the tribe Sophoreae. Both are woody tropical trees with axillary or terminal racemes or panicles. Bracteoles are present in both Myroxylon and Castanospermum. Flowers are initiated singly in bract axils, which are produced in acropetal order by the inflorescence apical meristem. The flower structure of both includes a broad calyx tube, five petals lacking any fusion (only the vexillary distinctive), ten free homogeneous stamens in two whorls, and a long-stipitate carpel. The two taxa are alike in early organogenetic stages with essentially acropetal order of initiation: sepals, petals, outer stamens plus carpel, inner stamens. Within each whorl the order is unidirectional from the abaxial side. They are alike through middevelopment with one exception. There is accelerated vexillar enlargement in Castanospermum by middevelopment, not found in Myroxylon. Both have a hypanthium, which forms late in development. In both, large flower size, exserted stamens, and hypanthium are adaptations to bird-pollination. Differences between the two that are manifested in late development include strongly zygomorphic calyx and petal color change over time (Castanospermum), stamens sagittate and apiculate with some basal filament fusion (Myroxylon), stigma form differences, and fruit form. 3aCastanospermum australe 3aflowers 3aontogeny 3adevelopmental stages 3aplant morphology 3aultrastructure 3apollination 3aMyroxylon balsamum 3aEl Salvador 3aQueensland0 tAmerican journal of botany.g1993 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.65-75x0002-91227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01742naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245007700155300001600232520022900248650002400477650001300501650001500514650001000529650002000539650002900559650002400588650002400612650001100636650001100647650004900658650004400707650000900751650003700760650003300797650002300830650002400853650004900877650003500926651001100961700001600972700002000988700001801008700001801026773011901044852000901163939003301172945000801205946001101213655001201224991604205050742620221120082816.0830429s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830045852DNAL7 a67619052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambertucci, J.R.12aA double blind trial with oxamniquine in chronic schistosomiasis mansoni  ap. 751-755.  aSchistosoma mansoni, children, double blind trial with oxamniquine, concluded that oral oxamniquine in prescribed dosage has low toxicity and good therapeutic efficacy in children with chronic schistosomiasis mansoni: Brazil 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3atoxicity 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aChronic Disease 2aClinical Trials as Topic 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Diseases, Parasiticxdrug therapy 2aLiver Diseases, Parasiticxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aNitroquinolinesxtherapeutic use 2aOxamniquinextherapeutic use 2aParasite Egg Count 2aSchistosoma mansoni 2aSchistosomiasisxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aSplenic Diseasesxdrug therapy 3aBrazil1 aGreco, D.B.1 aPedroso, E.R.P.1 aRocha, M.O.C.1 aSalazar, H.M.0 tTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.g1982, v. 76, no. 6 p.751-755x0035-92037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830429c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02772naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009900145300001800244500001500262520121000277650001601487650001601503650001301519650001201532650001601544650002001560650000701580650002101587650002001608650002701628650002101655650001001676650002101686650002501707650002801732650004801760650002201808650002001830650003101850650004901881650002901930650001701959653001701976700001301993700001502006700001302021700002002034773008402054852000902138930003302147945001302180946001302193655001202206IND2196483120221120072422.0990114e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219648312DNAL7 a97107482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamsaran, H.10aSurvival of bioluminescent Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in soft cheeses  ap. 1810-1817.  a2019-12-05  aPasteurized and raw milks that had been inoculated at 10(4) cfu/ml with bioluminescent strains of Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were used in the manufacture of Camembert and Feta cheeses with or without nisin-producing starter culture. Survival of both organisms was determined during the manufacture and storage of Camembert and Feta cheeses at 2 +/- 1 degree C for 65 and 75 d, respectively. Bacterial bioluminescence was used as an indicator to enumerate the colonies plated on selective Listeria agar and on MacConkey agar. Escherichia coli O157:H7 survived the manufacturing process of both cheeses and was present at the end of the storage period in greater numbers than in the initial inoculum. At the end of 75 d of storage, E. coli O157: H7 was found in the brine of Feta cheese. The counts of L. monocytogenes increased as the pH of the Camembert cheese increased, and there were significant differences between the counts from samples taken from the inside and the counts from samples obtained near the surface of the cheese. The Feta cheese that contained nisin was the only cheese in which L. monocytogenes was at the level of the initial inoculum after 75 d of storage. 3acheese milk 3afeta cheese 3araw milk 3astorage 3aplate count 3acheese starters 3apH 3aCamembert cheese 3abioluminescence 3aListeria monocytogenes 3apasteurized milk 3anisin 3aEscherichia coli 2aCheesexmicrobiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFood Preservation 2aFood Technology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aTime Factors 0acheesemaking1 aChen, J.1 aBrunke, B.1 aHill, A.1 aGriffiths, M.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.1810-1817x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012400123300001600247520170400263650002301967650004001990650004202030650001002072650001802082650002602100650001802126650003002144650002102174650001502195650002302210700001602233700001602249700001602265700001602281773007202297852000902369930003302378945001302411946001302424655001202437IND2057703920221120041023.0970613e199604  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205770392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAudy, P.12aA rapid and sensitive PCR-based assay for concurrent detection of bacteria causing common and halo blights in bean seed  ap. 361-366.  aA quick polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based procedure was developed for concurrent detection of the causal agents of bean common blight, Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli, and bean halo blight, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, in bean seed. A rapid DNA extraction procedure, consisting of briefly wetting intact or crushed seeds with a solution of sodium hydroxide, was used to extract bacterial DNA from externally and internally blight-contaminated seeds. G+C-rich oligonucleotide primers were designed from the phaseolotoxin gene cluster of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola and tested under high-stringency conditions in PCR assays. The HB14 primers specifically directed the amplification of a 1,4-kb fragment from DNA of 19 P. syringae pv. phaseolicola isolates, whereas templates from 62 other bacterial strains, including the bean pathogens P. syringae pv. syringae and X. campestris pv. phaseoli, and plant-pathogenic species of Agrobacterium, Clavibacter, Erwinia, and Xanthomonas did not produce any discrete bands upon amplification. The HB14 primers for P. syringae pv. phaseolicola, and the previously reported G+C-rich X4 primers, specific for X. campestris pv. phaseoli, amplified discrete DNA fragments by soaking extracts of white bean seeds contaminated with halo and common blights, respectively. DNA extracts from blight-infested colored seeds were recalcitrant to PCR-amplification unless polyvinylpyrrolidone was added to the extraction buffer. In combination, X4 and HB14 primers successfully detected individual and mixed infections of bean common and halo blights and yielded distinctive DNA fragments from batches containing as few as 1 infected seed in 10,000 seeds. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 3aseeds 3apathogenicity 3adiagnostic techniques 3arapid methods 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseed-borne fungi 3apathotypes 3astrain differences1 aBratt, C.E.1 aSaindon, G.1 aHuang, H.C.1 aLaroche, A.0 tPhytopathology.g1996 Apr., v. 86, no. 4 p.361-366x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01441naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011600126300001400242520054300256650002200799650002500821650003200846650002000878650001700898650001600915650001700931700001500948700001700963773009400980852000901074939003301083946001101116655001201127IND9301918820221117180347.0930402e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930191882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJernejc, K.10aATP: citrate lyase and carnitine acetyltransferase activity in a citric-acid-producing Aspergillus niger strain  ap. 92-95.  aTwo enzymes are responsible for the transport of acetyl groups across the mitochondrial membrane, ATP:citrate lyase and carnitine acetyltransferase.

  1 aGenco, A.10aBioEnterics Intragastric Balloon (BIB): a short-term, double-blind, randomised, controlled, crossover study on weight reduction in morbidly obese patients  ap. 129-133.  aBackground: The BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon (BIB) System in association with restricted diet has been used for the short-term treatment of morbid obesity. Aim of this study was to evaluate the real, short term, efficacy of the BIB for weight reduction in morbidly obese patients by using a prospective, double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled, crossover study. Methods: Patients were recruited from January 2003 to December 2003. After selection, they were randomly allocated into two groups: BIB followed by sham procedure after 3 months (Group A), and sham procedure followed by BIB after 3 months (Group B). All endoscopic procedures were performed under unconscious intravenous sedation. The BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon (Inamed Health; Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was filled by using saline (500 ml) and methylene blue (10 ml). Patients were discharged with omeprazole therapy and diet (1000 kcal). Patients were followed up weekly by a physician blinded to randomisation. In both groups mortality, complications, BMI, BMI reduction and %EWL were considered. Data were expressed as mean+/-s.d., except as otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis was performed by means of Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test or chi2 with Yates correction; P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 32 patients were selected and entered the study (8M/24F; mean age: 36.2+/-5.6 years, range 25-50 years; mean BMI 43.7+/-1.5 kg/m2, range 40-45 kg/m2; mean %EW: 43.1+/-13.1, range: 35-65). All patients completed the study. Mortality was absent. Complications related to endoscopy, balloon placement and removal were absent. Mean time of BIB positioning was 15+/-2 min, range 10-20 min. After the first 3 months of the study, in Group A patients the mean BMI significantly (P<0.001) lowered from 43.5+/-1.1 to 38.0+/-2.6 kg/m2, while in Group B patients the decrease was not significant (from 43.6+/-1.8 to 43.1+/-2.8 kg/m2). The mean %EWL was significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (34.0+/-4.8 vs 2.1+/-1%; P<0.001). After crossover, at the end of the following 3 months, the BMI lowered from 38.0+/-2.6 to 37.1+/-3.4 kg/m2 and from 43.1+/-2.8 to 38.8+/-3.1 kg/m2 in Groups A and B, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this study show that treatment of obese patients with BioEnterics Intragastric Balloon is a safe and effective procedure. In association with appropriate diet it is significantly effective in weight reduction when compared to sham procedure plus diet. The BIB procedure can play a role in weight reduction in morbidly obese patients or in the preoperative treatment of bariatric patients. 3aadults 3apatients 3aobesity 3amorbidity 3arandomized clinical trials 3aweight loss 3aweight control programs 3aendoscopy 3amortality 3apostoperative complications 3abody mass index 3adiet therapy 3aintragastric administration 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aCombined Modality Therapy 2aDiet, Reducing 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aFemale 2aGastric Balloon 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesity, Morbidxdiet therapyxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Loss 0aintragastric balloon1 aCipriano, M.1 aBacci, V.1 aCuzzolaro, M.1 aMateria, A.1 aRaparelli, L.1 aDocimo, C.1 aLorenzo, M.1 aBasso, N.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2006 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.129-133x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/index.html3electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/08  aOther US 7aarticle01537naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245007300150300001600223520027700239650002700516650001300543650002300556650001700579650001000596650001200606650003200618650004100650650002800691650002600719650002500745650005200770650000900822650002500831650002700856653002400883700002100907700001900928773008100947852000901028939003301037945000801070946001301078655001201091991604196080742620221123034823.0830513e198208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830046222DNAL7 a67523942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, S.C.J.10aDirect infection of hepatocytes by sporozoites of Plasmodium berghei  ap. 448-454.  aPlasmodium berghei, infection of hepatocytes by sporozoites takes place rapidly, almost immediately after sporozoite injection into host rats, many sporozoites were also observed undergoing cytolysis within lysophagosomes of Kupffer cells as well as other phagocytic cells 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aProtozoa 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aphagocytosis 3aliver 2aAnimals 2aKupffer Cellsxparasitology 2aLiverxparasitologyxultrastructure. 2aLysosomesxparasitology 2aMalariaxparasitology 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPlasmodium bergheixphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aVacuolesxparasitology 0aInvasion mechanisms1 aVanderberg, J.P.1 aTerzakis, J.A.0 tJournal of protozoology.g1982 Aug., v. 29, no. 3 p.448-454x0022-39217nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830513c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02245naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245013300122300001600255500001500271520095900286650001601245650001701261650001601278650003601294650001301330650001501343650003101358650002501389650001801414650002701432650001101459650002001470650002201490650001101512653001701523653001301540653002801553700001801581700001801599700001801617773007201635852000901707930003301716945001301749946001301762655001201775IND2057699320221123005920.0970613e199603  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205769932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, H.10aCharacterization and purification of a phytotoxin produced by Fusarium solani, the causal agent of soybean sudden death syndrome  ap. 277-282.  a2019-12-05  aA phytotoxic polypeptide identified in culture filtrates of Fusarium solani, the causal agent of soybean sudden death syndrome, was heat unstable, negatively charged, absorbed by 10% charcoal, and destroyed by proteinase K. The toxicity of the culture filtrates and fractions obtained during purification was bioassayed by measuring browning of soybean calli. Purification of the phytotoxin was achieved by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography on a DE-52 column. The purified protein migrated as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an estimated molecular weight of 17,000. The sequence of the N-terminal 15 amino acids was determined and indicated that a peptide was present. Samples containing this single protein caused browning of soybean calli, necrosis on detached soybean cotyledons and leaves, and yellowing, curling, and drying of attached soybean cotyledons and leaves. 3aphytotoxins 3apolypeptides 3aGlycine max 3achemical constituents of plants 3anecrosis 3acotyledons 3aphysicochemical properties 3aamino acid sequences 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aleaves 3aFusarium solani 3aculture filtrates 3acallus 0apurification 0asymptoms 0amolecular sequence data1 aHartman, G.L.1 aNickell, C.D.1 aWidholm, J.M.0 tPhytopathology.g1996 Mar., v. 86, no. 3 p.277-282x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03764naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245014500130300001600275500001500291520265200306650002502958650002602983650002403009650002703033650002203060650001503082650001403097651001503111653002303126653001503149653001803164653001303182700001703195700001403212773007203226852000903298930003303307945001303340946001303353655001203366IND2057699420221122233949.0970613e199603  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205769942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, S.12aA multivariate analysis of pathogenic variation in Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infecting the tropical pasture legume, Stylosanthes scabra  ap. 283-289.  a2019-12-05  aMultivariate statistical analysis was used to characterize and classify pathogenic variation in isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides that cause anthracnose disease of the tropical pasture legume, Stylosanthes scabra. A total of 182 isolates collected from field sites in Queensland, Australia, over the past 15 years were tested for pathogenic variation on six differential genotypes of S. scabra using a seedling bioassay. Four reference isolates, representing the four pathogenic races, were included in the bioassay for comparison. Data on the disease severity of 172 field and four reference isolates (set 1) were used to classify the reference isolates into races and to determine if the field isolates belonged to an existing or new race. Linear discriminant functions were developed to classify the four reference isolates, and a cross-validation procedure was used to test the classification success of placing these isolates into the four races. Isolate sr4 was classified 76% of the time as race 1 and 17% of the time as race 4, isolate sr24 was classified 88% of the time as race 3, and isolates wrs20 and wrs32 were mainly classified as either race 4 or 4a. With one small cluster of weakly virulent isolates and the prior expectation of the four races, the field isolates were classified into five virulence groups using cluster analysis. Three of these clusters were associated with the existing races: race 1 in cluster 3, race 3 in cluster 1, and races 4 and 4a jointly in cluster 2. Cluster 1 isolates were avirulent on the differential cultivar Seca, cluster 3 isolates were virulent on 'Seca', and isolates in clusters 2 and 4 were virulent on accessions 36260 and Q10042. For an independent evaluation of the discriminant analysis, additional data were obtained on 14 isolates (set 2), of which eight had been previously classified. The five set 1 clusters were used to develop linear discriminant functions to classify the isolates in set 2. Five of the eight isolates common to both data sets were correctly classified; while isolates wrs20 and wrs32, previously in cluster 2, were classified in cluster 4 in set 2. However, clusters 2 and 4 were close neighbors with no striking differences in the overall disease severity levels on the six differentials for the isolates. In future analyses, three races, represented by the reference isolates sr4, sr24, and wrs20 and/or wrs32, may be used to account for the existing range of pathogenic variation. The usefulness of the multivariate approach to classify field isolates into races, in order to ascertain if isolates belong to an existing or novel race, was discussed. 3aGlomerella cingulata 3amultivariate analysis 3aStylosanthes scabra 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenetic variation 3apathotypes 3avirulence 3aQueensland 0ageographical races 0aGlomerella 0apathogenicity 0agenotype1 aThomas, M.R.1 aEllis, N.0 tPhytopathology.g1996 Mar., v. 86, no. 3 p.283-289x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02548naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012800129300001600257500001500273520110800288650001801396650002601414650002201440650002901462650001701491650001501508650002501523650003001548650001901578650002001597650002501617650001301642650002401655650002001679651001001699653001201709653005201721653001501773653002801788653003901816653002801855700001301883773009001896852000901986930003301995945001302028946001302041655001202054IND2057698620221122233847.0970613e199603  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205769862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuneyoshi, T.10aDifferentiation among garlic viruses in mixed infections based on RT-PCR procedures and direct tissue blotting immunoassays  ap. 253-259.  a2019-12-05  aA total of six viruses belonging to at least three distinct genera, Potyvirus, Carlavirus, and a novel unclassified genus, were identified from infected garlic plants in Japan based on partial cDNA cloning and sequencing of genomes. We developed procedures that combined reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with restriction analysis for identification of each of the six viruses. The respective viral coat protein genes were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and the products were used as immunogens for antibodies that reacted against viral particles. The antisera obtained specifically recognized each of three types of rod-shaped virus particles according to immunoelectron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, a convenient serological method based on direct tissue blotting immunoassay (DTBIA) was developed. Survey of virus incidence using both DTBIA and RT-PCR presented direct evidence for mixed infections of garlic plants with several viruses. In addition, DTBIA is suitable for large-scale and routine diagnosis of garlic viruses. 3acoat proteins 3adiagnostic techniques 3acomplementary DNA 3aLeek yellow stripe virus 3aimmunoassays 3aantibodies 3aShallot latent virus 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aAllium sativum 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3aGarlic mosaic virus 3amixed infection 3aJapan 0acloning 0areverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 0aCarlavirus 0amolecular sequence data 0adirect tissue blotting immunoassay 0agarlic mite-borne virus1 aSumi, S.0 tPhytopathology.g1996 Mar., v. 86, no. 3 p.253-259wJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03266naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001900184245010200203300001600305500002400321520174400345650001602089650001702105650003002122650002002152650003002172650001502202650002202217650002302239650002802262650002402290650002002314650002402334651002802358653001802386653003302404653002302437700002502460773010902485852000902594856008802603930003302691945002502724946001102749655001202760IND4429450420221122225207.0091130e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442945042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aF200 0aF300 0aK0011 aDering, Monika10aFinding the meeting zone: Where have the northern and southern ranges of Norway spruce overlapped  ap. 229-235.  aIncludes references  aThe goal of the work was to define where migration routes of Norway spruce running from its Weichselian refuges could have intersected and formed a hybrid zone. Based on available pollen data, we have hypothesized that the central European disjunction, also called the “spruceless zone”, could be an overlapping area of boreal and southern ranges. The refugial origin of 1353 trees from 58 Norway spruce stands was determined using the maternally inherited mitochondrial nad1 b/c marker. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the nad1 b/c marker revealed the presence of two mtDNA variants in Poland that we designated as the “northern” and “southern” haplotypes. The geographic distribution of these haplotypes corresponds to particular Norway spruce ranges and their refugial origins. The northern haplotype was mainly found within the boreal part of the range while the southern haplotype was noted in populations from the southern portion. Co-occurrence of the two haplotypes was noted in stands from the “spruceless zone”; however, the frequency of the southern haplotype was significantly higher in those populations. Our results combined with available fossil pollen data allow us to define the area of the Middle-Polish Plains as a hybrid zone for Norway spruce originating from Carpathian and Russian refuges. The domination of Norway spruce of Carpathian origin in the hybrid zone might be attributable to its earlier expansion from this refuge in contrast to the timing of its expansion from the Russian refuge. The findings presented here together with historical sources may also help explain the modern sparse distribution of Norway spruce in the Middle-Polish Plains. 3aPicea abies 3aforest trees 3ageographical distribution 3agenetic markers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3acolonizing ability 3apopulation distribution 3apopulation dynamics 3arefuge habitats 3apopulation genetics 3aCentral European region 0anatural range 0apost-glacial range expansion 0atransitional areas1 aLewandowski, Andrzej0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Dec. 15, v. 259, no. 2 p.229-235dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20091208b20100101c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02164naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001700162245007100179300001600250500002400266520050900290650001900799650002600818650003900844650001700883650000900900650002100909650001200930650004400942650001700986650001201003650002201015650002501037650001501062650002001077650001001097650002101107650002801128650002201156650002001178653002301198700001601221700001601237700001601253700001401269700001501283700001601298773010101314852000901415856009301424930003301517945002501550946001101575655001201586IND4429451320221122171110.0091130e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442945132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2009.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aFerrer, L.M.10aClinical diagnosis of visceral caseous lymphadenitis in a Salz ewe  ap. 126-127.  aIncludes references  aThis communication reports the possibility of clinical diagnosis of caseous lymphadenitis in sheep, using data obtained from clinical history, examination, haematological and biochemical analysis, ultrasonography and, finally, isolation of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in affected ewe urine culture.

DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study of VLCD with or without concomitant GH-treatment. SUBJECTS: Seventeen obese women (body mass index, BMI = 42.1 +/- 1.4 kg/m2 (range 31.8 - 54.5 kg/m2)) treated with VLCD for 4 weeks and randomized to concomitant placebo treatment (n = 9) or GH treatment (n = 8). MEASUREMENTS: Fat mass and lean body mass were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured by indirect calorimetry. UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA were measured in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies before VLCD and after VLCD +/- GH-treatment by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: VLCD treatment resulted in a mean weight loss of 5.23 kg +/- 0.8 (P < 0.01), a 4.1% decrease in EE (P < 0.05) and a 24% decrease in UCP3 mRNA in adipose tissue (P < 0.03), whereas adipose tissue UCP2 mRNA and skeletal muscle UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA levels were unchanged. GH-treatment had no effects on EE, changes in body weight or UCP mRNA level. In multiple regression analysis the change in EE caused by VLCD was significantly correlated with changes in adipose tissue UCP2 mRNA (r = 0.66, P < 0.02) and a tendency towards a significant association with the change in adipose tissue UCP3 mRNA (r = 0.45, P = 0.09), but not with change in body weight, skeletal muscle UCP2 or UCP3 mRNA levels. CONCLUSION: VLCD for 4 weeks decreased UCP3 mRNA expression in human adipose tissue, whereas GH-treatment had no effect on UCP expression. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that changes in adipose tissue UCP2 and probably UCP3 mRNA were correlated with the change in EE. These findings indicate that UCPs in adipose tissue in very obese individuals might play a role for the reduction in EE observed during energy restriction. 3aadipose tissue 3abiopsy 3abody mass index 3abody weight changes 3acalorimetry 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aenergy expenditure 3afasting 3agene expression 3ahumans 3alean body mass 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic diseases 3aobesity 3aplacebos 3aproteins 3aregression analysis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle 3asomatotropin 3avery low calorie diet 3aweight loss 3awomen 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAdult 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aCalorimetry, Indirect 2aCarrier Proteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Primers 2aDiet, Reducing 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aInjections, Subcutaneous 2aIon Channels 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aMitochondrial Proteins 2aMuscle, Skeletalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aObesityxdiet therapyxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aProteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRegression Analysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aBorglum, J.D.1 aKristensen, K.1 aNorrelund, H.1 aOtto, J.1 aJorgensen, L.1 aRichelsen, B.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2000 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.968-975x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02775naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245011000163300001400273500001500287520154600302650002501848650001401873650001601887650002601903650002501929650001701954650003801971650002902009650002202038650001802060653001802078700001602096700001802112700001702130700001802147773009002165852000902255856004502264939003302309946001102342655001202353IND9301921420221122060348.0930402e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930192142DNAL7 a10.1006/anbo.1993.10102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIannetta, P.P.M.13aAn ELISA procedure for quantification of relative amounts of intercellular glycoprotein in legume nodules  ap. 85-90.  a2019-12-04  aAn enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) method based on a monoclonal antibody (MAC236) is described in which relative amounts of an intercellular glycoprotein were quantified in extracts of whole legume nodules. This glycoprotein has recently been shown to be an important component of the cortical oxygen diffusion barrier. The ELISA method is demonstrated on three examples of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) nodule systems which have been the subject of previously published investigations: (a) cv. Clarke inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum RCR3442, nodulated root systems of which were subject to 10, 21 or 40% oxygen continuously for 28 d; (b), cv. Bragg and its supernodulating mutant derivative (nts382) inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110; (c), cv. Clarke inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum RCR3442 or RCR3407. ELISA results are related to oxygen diffusion characteristics defined in previous publications and show that increases in the amount of glycoprotein present correlated with increases in supra-ambient (40%) levels of rhizosphere pO2, in minimum gas diffusion resistance and in speed of diffusion barrier response. Area data of component parts of nodule inner cortices suggest that diffusion resistance control under sub-ambient (10%) oxygen levels also involves cell expansion. The amount of MAC236 antigen in nodules is affected by both host plant genotype and rhizobial strain and the latter also appears to be involved in determining the morphological development of the nodule inner cortex. 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3aGlycine max 3aquantitative analysis 3aspatial distribution 3aroot nodules 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3agenetic variation 3aglycoproteins 0aplant anatomy1 aJames, E.K.1 aMcHardy, P.D.1 aSprent, J.I.1 aMinchin, F.R.0 tAnnals of botany.g1993 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.85-90wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/anbo.1993.1010  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02016naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245009700152300001800249500002400267520114400291650001301435650001601448650002401464650002901488650001001517700001401527700001501541773011001556852000901666856003901675655001201714IND4437138920221122045055.0100514e20100530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443713892DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.76102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Y.C.10aTransient solution for radial two-zone flow in unconfined aquifers under constant-head tests  ap. 1496-1503.  aIncludes references  aThe constant-head test (CHT) is commonly employed to determine the aquifer parameters. This test is also applied to many environmental problems such as recovering light nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) and controlling off-site migration of contaminated groundwater in low-transmissivity aquifers. A well skin near the wellbore may be produced due to the well construction or development and its formation properties are significantly different from the original ones. A more appropriate description for the skin effect on the aquifer system should treat the well skin as a different formation instead of using a skin factor. Thus, the aquifer system becomes a two-zone formation including the skin and formation zones. This study presents a mathematical model developed for analyzing a two-zone unconfined aquifer system and the associated solution for CHTs at partially penetrating wells under transient state. The solution of the model may be used either to identify the in situ aquifer parameters or to investigate the effects of the wellbore storage and well skin on the head changes in unconfined aquifers under constant-head pumping. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3awells1 aYeh, H.D.1 aChen, G.Y.0 tHydrological processes.g2010 May 30, v. 24, no. 11 p.1496-1503dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7610 7aarticle03058naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002300128245010800151300001800259520145300277650001501730650001101745650001401756650002801770650001401798650002001812650002201832650002001854650001301874650002301887650002001910650002001930650001201950650002301962650003001985650001102015650001802026650005102044650002002095650001402115650001402129650001602143650001202159650002802171650001402199650001702213650001102230653001102241700001602252700001802268700001802286773008402304852000902388930003302397945001302430946001302443655001202456IND2196485520221122034718.0990114e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219648552DNAL7 a97107542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDransfield, M.B.G.10aTiming of insemination for dairy cows identified in estrus by a radiotelemetric estrus detection system  ap. 1874-1882.  aThe optimal time of artificial insemination (AI) was determined from data for 2661 AI in 17 herds utilizing a radiotelemetric system for estrus detection that has the potential for continuous 24-h surveillance to monitor behavioral events associated with estrus. The system consisted of pressure-sensitive radio frequency transmitters affixed over the sacrum region of cows. The activation of the sensor sent a radiotelemetric signal to a microcomputer via a fixed antenna. Cow identification, date, time, and duration of each standing event were recorded in the software program provided with the system. Each farm selected a 3-h interval to AI for cows that were identified in estrus during the previous 24 h. Pregnancy status was determined from data for return to estrus and palpation of the uterus 35 to 75 d following AI. Standing events during estrus averaged (+/- SD) 8.5 +/- 6.6 per cow, and the number of events per estrus across herds averaged from 6.2 +/- 5.1 to 12.8 +/- 9.9 per cow. The duration of estrus ranged from 5.1 +/- 3.8 to 10.6 +/- 6.8 h across herds; the mean was 7.1 +/- 5.4 h. The interval from the first standing event to AI affected the probability of pregnancy; the highest conception rates for AI occurred between 4 and 12 h after the onset of standing activity. The probability of pregnancy was higher for cows >100 d in milk, exhibiting >2 standing events during estrus, and inseminated during March, April, or May. 3adairy cows 3aestrus 3adetection 3aartificial insemination 3atelemetry 3astanding reflex 3amilking frequency 3amilk production 3aduration 3aseasonal variation 3alactation stage 3aconception rate 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEstrus Detectionxmethods 2aFemale 2aFertilization 2aInsemination, Artificialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aLogistic Models 2aPalpation 2aPregnancy 2aRadio Waves 2aSeasons 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aTelemetry 2aTime Factors 2aUterus 0atiming1 aNebel, R.L.1 aPearson, R.E.1 aWarnick, L.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.1874-1882x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02788naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001800137245008900155300001600244500002400260520152000284650001001804650003501814650001001849650002501859650001401884650002301898651000901921653005101930653002601981700001702007700001502024773013102039852000902170856012802179930003302307945002502340946001302365655001202378IND4446943420221122024234.0101228s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444694342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aW000 0aX1001 aTyndall, J.C.10aSwine Producer Appraisal of the Community Assessment Model for Odor Dispersion (CAM)  ap. 927-933.  aIncludes references  aThe community assessment model (CAM) for odor dispersion is a tool to assist in the siting of swine production facilities. CAM considers the size and type of a swine production system, local historical weather conditions, and odor control implementation. It predicts the number of hours of exposure to various levels of odor, by month, for each receptor in a given community. A follow-up survey of all CAM users since 2005 was conducted. The survey was designed to provide: 1) formative feedback for programming adjustments to improve Extension efficiency, usability, and reduce costs; and 2) summative feedback used to provide an indirect baseline assessment of the broader impact that CAM has had on reducing odor-related conflict. For the majority of producers who used CAM, the potential impacts to their neighbors factored heavily into decisions. CAM was believed to be very important to the siting process. A high majority (95%) of producers clearly understood the model results. Over half communicated these results to their neighbors where a third of these were considered positive interactions. Overall, for producers who went on to build at sites that were modeled there was a significant improvement in neighbor relations. CAM continues to evolve as a tool, with the addition of more refined odor dispersion parameters and the ability to include cattle and poultry. The state of Iowa has passed legislation that would, when funding is made available, integrate the use of CAM into odor management policy. 3aswine 3aagricultural management models 3aodors 3alivestock production 3aemissions 3aseasonal variation 3aIowa 0acommunity assessment model for odor dispersion 0aodor-related nuisance1 aHarmon, J.D.1 aHoff, S.J.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 5 p.927-933dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=5&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle02709naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001900137245005800156300001600214500002400230500001500254520147900269650003101748650001201779650002601791650002201817650002001839650001701859653003401876653001801910700001601928700001601944773013101960852000902091856012802100930003302228945002502261946001302286655001202299IND4446943120221122024056.0101228s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444694312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aP110 0aQ1151 aThompson, J.F.10aEnergy Use of Commercial Forced-Air Coolers for Fruit  ap. 919-924.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnalysis of utility bills, facility equipment and operation, and production records from seven forced-air cooling operations were used to document the range of electricity use for commercial forced-air cooling facilities, to evaluate the electricity use and conservation options for the major system components, and to estimate annual electricity use for forced-air cooled produce in California. Electricity use was greatest for fruit cooling, with nearly as much for direct operation of fans plus removing the heat they produce. Electricity for operating and cooling lights, removing heat gain through walls and operating and cooling lift trucks comprised the next largest energy uses in decreasing order of use. Options for reducing electricity use of each system are discussed. Efficiency of electricity use was measured by an energy coefficient (EC), an index calculated as the amount of cooling work accomplished divided by the amount of electricity purchased by the cooling facility. Monthly average EC varied widely at individual facilities and between facilities. Much of the variability was correlated with differences in product throughput. High throughput rates resulted in high energy efficiencies. Based on California's fresh market fruit and vegetable production in 2006, and the electricity use data from the commercial operations, the state's produce industry consumed 186 million kWh of electricity for forced-air cooling and short-term storage during 2006. 3aenergy use and consumption 3acooling 3aequipment performance 3aenergy efficiency 3acooling systems 3acold storage 0acommercial forced-air coolers 0afruits (food)1 aMejia, D.C.1 aSingh, R.P.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 5 p.919-924dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=5&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle02767naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001500146245006200161300001600223500002400239500001500263520141000278650001901688650002701707650002601734650001501760650002601775650002601801650001601827650002501843653004301868653001701911653001201928653001501940700001501955773013101970852000902101856012802110930003302238945002502271946001302296655001202309IND4446939520221122024235.0101228s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444693952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aN200 0aX620 0aJ7101 aThoele, H.10aBiomass Related Nitrogen Fertilization with a Crop Sensor  ap. 769-775.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn cereal crop production, approximately 30% of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions and 47% of total energy inputs are attributed to the use of mineral N fertilizers. Furthermore, leaching of surplus N can contaminate ground water and promote eutrophication. In recent years, sensor-based systems for variable-rate N fertilization have been developed to optimize the ratio of grain yield to N application rate. Most commercially available sensors are based on opto-electronics; however, a mechanical crop biomass sensor (Crop-Meter) has been recently developed. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the Crop-Meter for N application in cereal crops. The sensor was attached to conventional farm equipment, allowing on-the-go variable-rate N application and was evaluated during a three-year research project (2005-2007) on five large-scale farms in East Germany. In strip experiments, sensor-based crop biomass analysis and subsequent N fertilization contributed to a median increase in N efficiency of 14.4%. The observed increase in N efficiency was caused by a 10% to 15% reduction in N fertilizer and was not attributed to gains in yield. In field-scale experiments, a reduction in N of 17 kg N ha -1 was observed, which was similar to the value obtained in strip trials (21 kg N ha -1 ). Annual use of the biomass sensor on an area of 250 ha or more can increase profits of grain cultivation. 3aimage analysis 3afertilizer application 3aprecision agriculture 3acrop yield 3aequipment performance 3afield experimentation 3acontrollers 3anitrogen fertilizers 0abiomass related nitrogen fertilization 0acrop sensors 0asensors 0aCrop-Meter1 aEhlert, D.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v. 26, no. 5 p.769-775dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=26&issue=5&conf=aeaj&orgconf=aeaj20103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/27  aOther US 7aarticle03290naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002100181245015700202300001600359500009400375500002400469500001500493520142800508650001801936650003001954650002201984650001802006650002502024650001802049650002002067650002902087650001502116650001402131650001702145650001402162650002502176650001802201650001202219653002402231653002002255653001302275653001902288653001802307653001402325653002002339700002402359700001602383773011402399852000902513856008502522930003302607945002502640946001102665655001202676IND4446934120221122004106.0101228e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444693412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.asd.2010.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL001 0aL600 0aL2001 aKanayama, Masaki10aEarly embryonic development in the spider Achaearanea tepidariorum: Microinjection verifies that cellularization is complete before the blastoderm stage  ap. 436-445.  aIn the special issue: Evolution of patterning mechanisms / edited by Angelika Stollewerk.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe spider Achaearanea tepidariorum is emerging as a non-insect model for studying developmental biology. However, the availability of microinjection into early embryos of this spider has not been reported. We defined the early embryonic stages in A. tepidariorum and applied microinjection to its embryos. During the preblastoderm 16- and 32-nucleus stages, the energids were moving toward the egg periphery. When fluorochrome-conjugated dextran was microinjected into the peripheral region of 16-nucleus stage embryos, it was often incorporated into a single energid and inherited in the progeny without leaking out to surrounding energids. This suggested that 16-nucleus stage embryos consisted of compartments, each containing a single energid. These compartments were considered to be separate cells. Fluorochrome-conjugated dextran could be introduced into single cells of 16- to 128-nucleus stage embryos, allowing us to track cell fate and movement. Injection with mRNA encoding a nuclear localization signal/green fluorescent protein fusion construct demonstrated exogenous expression of the protein in live spider embryos. We propose that use of microinjection will facilitate studies of spider development. Furthermore, these data imply that in contrast to the Drosophila syncytial blastoderm embryo, the cell-based structure of the Achaearanea blastoderm embryo restricts diffusion of cytoplasmic gene products. 3amessenger RNA 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aprotein synthesis 3acell movement 3adevelopmental stages 3acell division 3agene expression 3aAchaearanea tepidariorum 3ablastoderm 3ainjection 3acell nucleus 3acytoplasm 3acell differentiation 3aembryogenesis 3adextran 0aapplication methods 0aembryo (animal) 0aenergids 0amicroinjection 0acell motility 0acell fate 0acellularization1 aAkiyama-Oda, Yasuko1 aOda, Hiroki0 tArthropod structure & development.g2010 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.436-445dElsevier Science Ltd.x1467-80397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2010.05.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/01/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03016naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013800168300001600306500001500322520170900337650001702046650001402063650001402077650002502091650001402116650001202130650002202142650001902164650002802183650002402211650001602235653001802251653002102269653001802290653001102308653002302319773011802342852000902460856006902469930003302538946001102571655001202582IND4388206820221121094333.0070225e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438820682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-006-0019-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Kleunen, Mark 10aAdaptive genetic differentiation in life-history traits between populations of Mimulus guttatus with annual and perennial life-cycles  ap. 185-199.  a2019-12-05  aThe optimal allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction as well as the optimal values of other life-history characteristics such as phenology, growth and mating system are likely to depend on the life-cycle of the organism. I tested whether plants of Mimulus guttatus originating from temporarily wet populations where the species has an enforced annual life-cycle have higher allocation to sexual reproduction, lower allocation to vegetative reproduction, more rapid phenology, faster growth, and floral traits associated with a self-fertilizing mating system than plants from permanently wet populations where the species has a perennial life-cycle. I grew a total of 1377 plants originating from three populations with an annual life-cycle and 11 populations with a perennial life-cycle in a greenhouse under permanently and temporarily wet conditions. Plants of M. guttatus in permanently wet conditions had significantly more vegetative reproduction and tended to have a faster growth than plants in the temporarily wet conditions, indicating plasticity in these life-history traits. Plants from populations with an annual life-cycle invested significantly more in sexual reproduction and significantly less in vegetative reproduction than the ones from populations with a perennial life-cycle. Moreover, this study showed that plants originating from populations with an annual life-cycle have a significantly faster development and floral traits associated with autonomous self-fertilization. In conclusion, this study suggests that there has been adaptive evolution of life history traits of M. guttatus in response to natural watering conditions that determine the life span of the species. 3alife history 3aflowering 3alongevity 3aasexual reproduction 3aphenology 3aselfing 3agenetic variation 3amating systems 3aevolutionary adaptation 3aErythranthe guttata 3agreenhouses 0aMating system 0aMimulus guttatus 0aClonal plants 0aGrowth 0aAdaptive evolution0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2007 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.185-199dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-006-0019-73electronic resource  a20070225b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02495naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002300167245011800190300001600308500002400324500001500348520102200363650002201385650001601407650001401423650001401437650001901451650002201470650001901492650002701511650002101538650001901559650002001578650002101598653000901619653001901628700002001647700002101667700001901688700002301707773009201730852000901822856008901831930003301920945002501953946001101978655001201989IND4429444520140725000000.0091130e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ400 0aQ5001 aSavary, Géraldine10aRelationship between the emulsifying properties of Acacia gums and the retention and diffusion of aroma compounds  ap. 178-183.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFive samples of Acacia senegal gum were selected because of their different emulsifying properties. Acacia gum samples were first characterized by various analytical methods including intrinsic viscosity and arabino-galactan protein amount as determined by gel permeation chromatography. In a second step, stability of emulsions containing orange essential oil and Acacia gums was evaluated by measurement of turbidity. In addition, flavour release of two different hydrophobic aroma compounds from Acacia gum aqueous solutions was studied. Retention was measured using the phase ratio variation method under equilibrium whereas diffusion was assessed by DOSY NMR. This study established the relationship between the emulsifying ability of Acacia gum and the behaviour of aroma compounds in the corresponding solution. Better emulsifying ability of Acacia gum sample appears strongly correlated to an increase in flavour retention and a decrease in molecular mobility as the result of mostly hydrophobic interactions. 3aaqueous solutions 3adiffusivity 3aturbidity 3aviscosity 3aessential oils 3aSenegalia senegal 3aodor compounds 3aemulsifying properties 3aarabinogalactans 3ahydrophobicity 3aprotein content 3aflavor compounds 0agums 0aAcacia senegal1 aHucher, Nicolas1 aBernadi, Estelle1 aGrisel, Michel1 aMalhiac, Catherine0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2010 , v. 24, no. 2-3 p.178-183dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20110608b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03820naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245016700205300001600372500002400388500001500412520212000427650001702547650001802564650001602582650001402598650001002612650001002622650002702632650002602659650001202685650001602697650002102713650001602734650001802750650002702768650003202795650001702827650001802844653002202862700001802884700001302902700001702915700001602932700001702948773009402965852000903059856009303068930003303161945002503194946001103219655001203230IND4383819320221120180548.0060921e20060228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438381932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aMonroig, O.10aEnrichment of Artemia nauplii in essential fatty acids with different types of liposomes and their use in the rearing of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) larvae  ap. 491-508.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study aimed to optimize the enrichment protocols of Artemia nauplii with highly unsaturated fatty acid liposomes. Three different types of liposomes formulated with krill phospholipid extract were tested, using a commercial emulsion as the control treatment. The incubation time of the nauplii in the enrichment medium was chosen as the first variable studied. Total lipid, lipid class and fatty acid profiles were analyzed in enriched nauplii after 18 and 21 h incubation in the enrichment media. A third sampling point at 24 h, where nauplii had been kept in clean seawater at 28 °C for 3 h, was established to emulate potential changes in the nutritional value of the nauplii after some hours in the larval rearing tank. A second objective of the study was the establishment of a suitable liposome-based diet for the rearing of gilthead sea bream larvae, as a model of marine fish. Differences in the enrichment efficiencies through time were found not only between liposome and emulsion based diets, but also among the different types of liposomes. Whereas nauplii enriched with multilamellar vesicles and unilamellar liposomes prepared by extrusion had maximum enrichment performance at 18 h of incubation, nauplii enriched with unilamellar liposomes prepared by the detergent solubilization method followed the enrichment pattern of the control emulsion, with an optimal incubation period closer to 21 h. Analyses of the diets of the larval nutrition trial seemed to confirm the results obtained in the first experiment, although changes in certain variables occurred among the enrichments carried out during the larval feeding trial. Biochemical characterization of body lipids of the larvae indicated differences in total lipid and essential fatty acid content, although no significant differences were found in growth and survival of the larvae. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), used to determine the peroxide content of the larvae, indicated a significant higher content of these compounds in larvae fed emulsion enriched nauplii compared to larvae fed liposome enriched prey. 3afish culture 3alipid content 3amarine fish 3aperoxides 3afeeds 3abream 3afatty acid composition 3aessential fatty acids 3aArtemia 3amariculture 3abody composition 3afish larvae 3aSparus aurata 3aliposomes (artificial) 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3afish feeding 3aphospholipids 0alipid composition1 aNavarro, J.C.1 aAmat, F.1 aGonzalez, P.1 aBermejo, A.1 aHontoria, F.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Feb. 28, v. 251, no. 2-4 p.491-508dElsevier Pub.

Therefore, earliness of B. rapa has been investigated as a source of variation for earliness in B. napus breeding programs. Variation for days to flower exists in B. oleracea; however, its earliest flowering variant B. alboglabra flowers 2-3 weeks later than B. napus. We hypothesized that the C genome of B. alboglabra carries alleles for early flowering which are different from the C-genome alleles of B. napus; and these alleles can be used for the improvement of B. napus. To test this, we examined flowering time in pedigree and DH populations from two B. napus × B. alboglabra crosses. A B. napus line with about a week earlier flowering than the B. napus parent was achieved through reconstitution of its C genome following pedigree selection. Introgression of the B. alboglabra allele in the early flowering pedigree lines is also evident from the presence of B. alboglabra-specific SSR alleles in this line. However, application of doubled haploidy failed to generate any line that flowered earlier than the B. napus parent, which is probably due to the difficulty of obtaining large numbers of euploid B. napus DH lines from this interspecific cross. Thus, we demonstrate that a trait of the diploid species, which apparently looks undesirable, might in fact be highly valuable for the improvement of amphidiploids; and knowledge from this research can also be applied for other traits. 3aBrassica oleracea var. alboglabra 3aplant breeding 3aflowering 3aalleles 3adiploidy 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenology 3aearly development 3apolyploidy 3agenetic markers 3aplant genetic resources 3agenomics 3aBrassica napus 3adoubled haploids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3arapeseed products 3apedigree 3aartificial selection 3aintrogression 0aamphidiploids 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data1 aBennett, Rick A.1 aYang, Rong-Cai1 aKebede, Berisso1 aThiagarajah, Mohan R.0 tEuphytica.g2011 Feb., v. 177, no. 3 p.365-374dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-010-0253-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03055naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009300164300001600257500002400273520143900297650001601736650001301752650002001765650001601785650002101801650002101822650000901843650002801852650002001880650001401900650001301914650003001927650002501957650001201982650001601994650003002010653001702040653002802057700002102085700001802106700001902124700001902143700001902162700002002181700001802201700001702219773009002236852000902326856008502335930003302420945002502453946001102478655001202489IND4446754720221120180540.0101224e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444675472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-010-0251-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sŭng-il.14aThe development of a co-dominant marker for the β-conglycinin α′ subunit in soybeans  ap. 355-363.  aIncludes references  aThe development of soybean varieties that lack the β-conglycinin α′ subunit is an attractive goal because the β-conglycinin α′ subunit exerts a negative influence on nutrition and tofu gelation, and is also a major allergen. We sought to develop a co-dominant DNA marker for the β-conglycinin α′ subunit (Cgy-1) gene for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). We identified a deleted sequence responsible for the null allele of Cgy-1 in a soybean variety lacking the β-conglycinin α′ subunit known as ‘Keburi'. The deletion spanned 12,998 bp and included Cgy-1 and its incomplete tandem duplicate on chromosome 10. Based on the Cgy-1 sequence from both the Williams 82 soybean reference sequence and the Keburi variety, a set of three allele-specific primers was designed for multiplex PCR assay. These primers enabled allelic discrimination by the sizes of PCR products. This amplified two distinct DNA fragments of 913 and 649 bp in Williams 82 and Keburi, respectively. The practicality of the developed co-dominant marker for Cgy-1 was also confirmed by amplification in five other soybean varieties including three wild types and two mutants. The heterozygosity of the F₁ plants at the Cgy-1 locus was ascertained using our novel co-dominant marker. This PCR-based co-dominant marker is capable of detecting the presence or absence of β-conglycinin α′ subunit for soybean marker assisted breeding system. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3agenetic markers 3acodominance 3abeta-conglycinin 3aprotein subunits 3atofu 3afood processing quality 3anutritive value 3aallergens 3agelation 3amarker-assisted selection 3anucleotide sequences 3aalleles 3aDNA primers 3apolymerase chain reaction 0anull alleles 0amolecular sequence data1 aKim, Moon Young 1 aVan, Kyujung 1 aLee, Yeong-Ho 1 aKim, Hong Sig 1 aCai, Chun Mei 1 aPark, Bong-Soo 1 aSeo, Hak-Soo 1 aLee, Suk-Ha 0 tEuphytica.g2011 Feb., v. 177, no. 3 p.355-363dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-010-0251-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20110510b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/04/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03440naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007300168300001600241500002400257500001500281520192600296650001702222650001602239650002702255650001902282650003002301650001202331650001802343650001602361650002802377650002302405650002302428650002002451653001102471653002302482653002802505653001102533653002702544700001902571700001902590700001902609700004102628773009002669852000902759856008502768930003302853945002502886946001102911655001202922IND4446754420221120164327.0101224e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444675442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-010-0286-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalia, Rajwant K. 10aMicrosatellite markers: an overview of the recent progress in plants  ap. 309-334.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn recent years, molecular markers have been utilized for a variety of applications including examination of genetic relationships between individuals, mapping of useful genes, construction of linkage maps, marker assisted selections and backcrosses, population genetics and phylogenetic studies. Among the available molecular markers, microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) which are tandem repeats of one to six nucleotide long DNA motifs, have gained considerable importance in plant genetics and breeding owing to many desirable genetic attributes including hypervariability, multiallelic nature, codominant inheritance, reproducibility, relative abundance, extensive genome coverage including organellar genomes, chromosome specific location and amenability to automation and high throughput genotyping. High degree of allelic variation revealed by microsatellite markers results from variation in number of repeat-motifs at a locus caused by replication slippage and/or unequal crossing-over during meiosis. In spite of limited understanding of the functions of the SSR motifs within the plant genes, SSRs are being widely utilized in plant genome analysis. Microsatellites can be developed directly from genomic DNA libraries or from libraries enriched for specific microsatellites. Alternatively, microsatellites can also be found by searching public databases such as GenBank and EMBL or through cross-species transferability. At present, EST databases are an important source of candidate genes, as these can generate markers directly associated with a trait of interest and may be transferable in close relative genera. A large number of SSR based techniques have been developed and a quantum of literature has accumulated regarding the applicability of SSRs in plant genetics and genomics. In this review we discuss the recent developments (last 4-5 years) made in plant genetics using SSR markers. 3abackcrossing 3aplastid DNA 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 3amarker-assisted selection 3aalleles 3aDNA libraries 3acodominance 3aexpressed sequence tags 3achromosome mapping 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic markers 0agenome 0aliterature reviews 0amolecular sequence data 0aplants 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aRai, Manoj K. 1 aKalia, Sanjay 1 aSingh, Rohtas 1 aDhawan, A.

  1 aGiesler, Loren J.10aIncidence of Alfalfa mosaic virus, Bean pod mottle virus, and Soybean mosaic virus in Nebraska Soybean Fields  aThe incidence of soybean viruses is increasing across the North Central Region of the United States as indicated by survey efforts and grower reports from several states. To determine the level of virus infection in Nebraska, we surveyed soybean fields for two consecutive years. Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) was detected in 52% of the fields in 2001 and in 56% of fields in 2002. The incidence of Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) varied more, with 54% of fields testing positive in 2001 and 91% testing positive in 2002. Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) was not detected in 2001, but it was detected in 31% of fields in 2002. The widespread distribution of detected SMV in 2002 is suggestive of introduction with seed. The incidence of BPMV was significantly higher in fields planted earlier than the recommended optimum planting date in one of the two years studied. The widespread incidence of AMV and BPMV and the irregular occurrence of SMV indicate that further studies of soybean viral diseases in Nebraska are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aNebraska 3aviruses 3asurveys 3asoybeans 3aplanting date 3aSoybean mosaic virus 3aBean pod mottle virus 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3asoybeans 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3aBean pod mottle virus 3aSoybean mosaic virus 3adisease incidence 3aetiology 3afields 3aNebraska1 aZiems, Amy D.0 tPlant health progress.g2006, v. 7, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2006-0424-01-HM3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2006-0424-01-HM3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100712b20100807c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/10/04  aOther US 7aarticle03299naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245016700205300001600372500002400388500001500412520156100427650001401988650002102002650001802023650002502041650000902066650001302075650001202088650001602100650001902116650001402135650001902149650001402168650001102182650002002193650002102213650001902234650002502253650001502278653002402293653002202317653002502339700001302364700001402377700001602391700001302407773009402420852000902514856009302523930003302616945002502649946001102674655001202685IND4383816220221120164443.0060921e20060228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438381622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aM001 0aM1201 aCheng, K.M.10aEffects of dietary calcium, phosphorus and calcium / phosphorus ratio on the growth and tissue mineralization of Litopenaeus vannamei reared in low-salinity water  ap. 472-483.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn 8-week feeding experiment was conducted to evaluate the response of juvenile Litopenaeus vannamei to dietary calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and their interaction between Ca and P in low-salinity water of 2 per thousand. Fifteen isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets, containing five graded levels of total P (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%) for each of three levels of Ca (0%, 1% and 2%), were fed to juvenile L. vannamei. Prior to the experiment, the postlarvae were gradually acclimated to low salinity and fed a basal diet (0.5% total Ca and 0.5% total P) for 2 weeks. After 8 weeks, survival, hepatopancreas alkaline phosphatase and protein content of muscle were significantly affected by dietary P levels (P < 0.05). The weight gain (WG), ranging from 505.44% to 1187.72%, was significantly affected by dietary Ca, P and the interaction between Ca and P (P < 0.05). In the absence of supplemental Ca, diets containing 0.77% estimated available phosphorus (EAP) (0.93% total P) were adequate for optimal growth. In the presence of 1% supplemental Ca, shrimp fed diets containing 1.22% EAP (2% total P) had better growth performance. The response to dietary P supplementation was dependent on dietary Ca level. Supplementation of 2% Ca to the basal diets yielded a significant reduction in growth, indicating that dietary Ca should be reduced to minimize dietary P supplementation. The Ca, P, magnesium, zinc and manganese content in tissues responded to dietary treatment. However, there was no clear relationship between growth and tissue mineralization. 3amanganese 3afeed composition 3aanimal growth 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3azinc 3asalinity 3acalcium 3amariculture 3ahepatopancreas 3amagnesium 3amuscle tissues 3amortality 3ashrimp 3aprotein content 3afeed supplements 3ashrimp culture 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aphosphorus 0aisonitrogenous diet 0aisoenergetic diet 0achemical composition1 aHu, C.Q.1 aLiu, Y.N.1 aZheng, S.X.1 aQi, X.J.0 tAquaculture.g2006 Feb. 28, v. 251, no. 2-4 p.472-483dElsevier Pub.

Population genetic approaches were used to study the structure of EM isolates in southeastern France and to identify factors involved in their spatial distribution. A population clustering method (SAMOVA) and a maximum-difference algorithm (Monmonier's algorithm) were combined to visualize and quantify barriers to gene flow between populations. Both methods yielded similar results and two main barriers were identified. A North/South oriented barrier may be related to physical obstacles to gene flow (Rhône River, presence of an area with few cucurbit crops). Although the barrier was very strong, some “crossing” events were detected. A second barrier, oriented Northwest to Southeast, was not correlated with obvious geographical features. The two methods used here are complementary and confirm the limited spread of WMV-EM isolates. This approach can be useful in epidemiology studies to characterize the structure of viral populations and identify barriers to gene flow. 3aplant viruses 3acrop acreage 3aWatermelon mosaic virus 3aepidemiology 3aspatial distribution 3ahost plants 3aemerging diseases 3astrain differences 3atemperate fruits 3agene flow 3aCucurbitaceae 3avegetables 3apopulation structure 3amicrobial genetics 3aFrance 0apopulation genetics1 aLavigne, C.1 aLecoq, H.1 aDesbiez, C.0 tPhytopathology.g2010 Dec., v. 100, no. 12 p.1373-1379dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-04-10-01183Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd2CTe2011/01/25  aOther US 7aarticle02272naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011400186300001600300520082800316650001701144650002001161650001001181650003101191650001801222650002501240650001401265650002601279650002001305650001201325650006001337650001801397650002701415650003101442650003101473653002501504700002001529700002001549773010501569852000901674856008501683930003301768946001301801655001201814IND4395498720221120155230.0070930e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439549872DNAL7 a174739052pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-007-9008-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoover, Cindi A. 12aA Functional Approach to Transcriptome Profiling: Linking Gene Expression Patterns to Metabolites that Matter  ap. 411-419.  aSecondary metabolites or natural products have been isolated from many marine organisms. These metabolites often have important bioactive functions; however, very little information is available regarding the biosynthesis and regulation of many secondary metabolites. At a time when use of marine-derived metabolites is rapidly expanding in industry and pharmacological fields, a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms controlling secondary metabolite production is necessary. We review the recent development of a novel transcriptome profiling methodology that allows for rapid and high-throughput screening of changes in mRNA sequence pools. The application of genomics-based techniques and the integration of both biochemical and molecular data sets in marine organisms complement ongoing drug discovery efforts. 3abiosynthesis 3adata collection 3adrugs 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3ascreening 3asecondary metabolites 3atranscriptomics 2aAnimals 2aBiological Factorsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxphysiology. 2aBiotechnology 2aDrug Industryxmethods 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aTechnology, Pharmaceutical 0asecondary metabolite1 aSlattery, Marc 1 aMarsh, Adam G. 0 tMarine biotechnology.g2007 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.411-419dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-007-9008-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03557naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245016100177300001600338520124100354650000801595650003201603650002101635650002401656650001701680650002101697650002501718650002001743650002301763650001001786650001301796650001401809650002301823650001401846650002401860650000701884650003001891650002301921650002501944650002201969650002401991650001802015650002302033650002702056650003102083650003002114650001102144650002802155650003902183650005802222650006202280650002302342650001602365650004002381653001202421653002202433653003202455700001602487700001602503700001702519700001502536700001502551773010502566852000902671856008502680930003302765946001302798655001202811IND4395499120221120155233.0070930e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439549912DNAL7 a175494472pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-007-9002-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Y. 10aCharacterization of a dUTPase from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 and Its Application in Polymerase Chain Reaction Amplification  ap. 450-458.  aGenomic analysis of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 (TNA1) revealed the presence of a 471-bp open reading frame with 93% similarity to the dUTPase from Pyrococcus furiosus. The dUTPase-encoding gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein hydrolyzed dUTP at about a 10-fold higher rate than dCTP. The protein behaved as a dimer in gel filtration chromatography, even though it contains five motifs that are conserved in all homotrimeric dUTPases. The dUTPase showed optimum activity at 80°C and pH 8.0, and it was highly thermostable with a half-life (t ₁/₂) of 170 min at 95°C. The enzymatic activity of the dUTPase was largely unaffected by variations in MgCl₂, KCl, (NH₄)₂SO₄, and Triton X-100 concentrations, although it was reduced by bovine serum albumin. Addition of the dUTPase to polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) run with TNA1 DNA polymerase significantly increased product yield, overcoming the inhibitory effect of dUTP. Further, addition of the dUTPase allowed PCR amplification of targets up to 15 kb in length using TNA1 DNA polymerase. This enzyme also improved the PCR efficiency of other archaeal family B type DNA polymerases, including Pfu and KOD. 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli 3aPyrococcus furiosus 3aThermococcus 3aammonium sulfate 3abovine serum albumin 3aenzyme activity 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahalf life 3amagnesium chloride 3aoctoxynol 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotassium chloride 3aprotein hydrolysates 3athermal stability 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPyrophosphatasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxanalysisxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTemperature 2aThermococcusxenzymologyxgenetics. 0adUTPase 0aPCR amplification 0aThermococcus onnurineus NA11 aLee, H.

Proximal to the fertile leaves there are several rows of sterile scale-like leaves. The pollen sacs (microsporangia) have thickened and dark, striate walls that are typical of the Arberiella type found in most pollen organs presumed to be of glossopterid affinity. An examination of pollen organs at several developmental stages, including those containing in situ pollen of the Protohaploxypinus type, provides the basis for a detailed analysis of these types of structures, which bear similarities to both compression/impression Eretmonia-type glossopterid microsporangiate organs and permineralized Eretmonia macloughlinii from Antarctica. These fossils demonstrate that at least some Late Permian pollen organs were simple microsporophyll-bearing shoot systems and not borne directly on Glossopteris leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopmental stages 3afossils 3aleaves 3apollen 3ashoots 2aBiological Evolution 2aFossils 2aGeography 2aCycadopsidaxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPlant Shootsxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPollenxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxgenetics. 3aQueensland 0aQueensland1 aPigg, Kathleen B.1 aKudo, Kensuke1 aRigby, John F.0 tJournal of plant research.g2014 Mar., v. 127, no. 2 p.233-240dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-013-0601-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245011300206520130500319592002801624650002301652650001101675650001801686650001701704651001201721651001601733651001001749653004301759653003501802653002101837653002201858700006401880700002201944700002101966773009401987856008402081852000902165655001202174IND60767144220221122024437.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076714422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1128332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurghard, Uta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6442-151510aCross-border concentrated solar power projects - opportunity or dead end? A study into actor views in Europe  aCross-border renewable energy projects (in particular those based on concentrated solar power (CSP)) could play an important role in the future EU energy systems. Be it by contributing to enhanced energy security, improving the management of the energy system or meeting the EU renewable energy target in a cost-effective manner. However, despite the expected benefits associated with the use of cooperation mechanisms set up under the Renewable Energy Directive, several barriers and, possibly, lack of active support have prevented a wide use of these mechanisms among Member States. This paper explores whether social acceptance, or lack thereof, can explain some of this lag in development. Collecting actor views on CSP cooperation mechanisms between EU Member States forms the basis of this analysis. The empirical basis consists of 43 interviews from Spain as a potential host for and Germany and the Netherlands as potential consumers of renewable energy (off-taker countries). The data analysis outlines that overall CSP cooperation mechanisms are seen positively; however, the complexity of implementation, heterogeneity of actor views, as well as high costs for CSP are perceived as downsides. Thus, overall, a societal impetus is missing and interest in further development seems limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3asolar energy 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aSpain 0aCross-border renewable energy projects 0aConcentrated solar power (CSP) 0aActor interviews 0aSocial acceptance1 aDütschke, Elisabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1882-19341 aCaldés, Natalia,1 aOltra, Christian0 tEnergy policy.g2022 Apr., v. 163 p.112833-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1128333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03773naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015600175300001600331520195200347592002802299650001802327650001102345650001202356650001402368650001802382650001402400650002002414650002202434650001102456650002302467650001202490650002302502650001202525650001302537650002202550650000902572650001602581650001602597650001402613650001802627650001702645651001802662653001302680653001202693653002602705653002202731653002302753653002102776653001602797700002502813700001802838700002302856700001802879700001802897700001902915773010602934856008603040852000903126655001203135IND60623172020221121181350.0200110e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062317202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClawson, Rebecca C.10aContinuous access to snacks from weaning onwards in female rats causes weight gain, insulin insensitivity, and sustained leptin resistance in adulthood  ap. 165-174.  aA large part of the daily intake of children in the U.S. consists of snacks, with the average child consuming three snacks per day. Despite this, little research has been conducted to determine the metabolic and behavioral effects of snacking. Using a developing female rat model, our studies aimed to determine the effects of snacking during development before the protective effects of estrogen on weight gain would be relevant. Additionally, to determine if snack composition is important, we created one healthy and one unhealthy snacking group provided with chow and three snacks each in addition to a chow-only group. We found that both snacking groups experienced increased weight gain, elevated abdominal fat pad mass, prolonged leptin resistance into adulthood, and insulin insensitivity that was not observed in their non-snacking counterparts. These physiological differences were measured despite both snacking groups having a similar caloric intake as the chow-only group throughout the study. In addition to physiological changes, both snacking groups showed a preference for snacks over chow and ate more often during the inactive light phase than typical for rats, with the unhealthy snacking group presenting this behavioral change earlier than the healthy snacking group. Our results suggest that constant access to palatable snacks, which is often the case for children in western countries, alters feeding behaviors in relation to food choice and time of day when eating occurs. Snacking during development seemed to promote signs of metabolic syndrome in adulthood even when excess caloric intake was not observed. Our work further suggests that development is a vulnerable time for palatable snack presentation when prepubertal females lack the protective effects of estrogen and exhibit reduced leptin feedback on food intake. Thus snacking from weaning onward could be a contributor to the current childhood obesity crisis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy intake 3aleptin 3apuberty 3aadulthood 3aabdominal fat 3aingestion 3abehavior change 3aprotective effect 3asnacks 3ainsulin resistance 3afemales 3ametabolic syndrome 3aweaning 3achildren 3achildhood obesity 3arats 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3aestrogens 3aanimal models 3afood choices 3aUnited States 0aSnacking 0aObesity 0aInsulin insensitivity 0aLeptin resistance 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aFood preferences 0aFemale rats1 adela Cruz, Leslie N.1 aAllen, Steven1 aWolgemuth, Tierney1 aManer, Amanda1 aDorsett, Anna1 aI'Anson, Helen0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 201 p.165-174dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03985naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016700170520234300337592002802680650004902708650002302757650001402780650001502794650001902809650002002828650003802848650001202886650001602898650001202914650002102926650002602947650001602973650001202989650002303001650002503024650002303049650002503072650001203097650001503109650001403124650001903138650002403157700001803181700002103199700001903220773013403239856008503373852000903458655001203467IND60672824520221120141140.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067282452DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz048.OR35-02-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindsay, Karen14aThe Interplay Between Diet Quality and Pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index on Glycemic Parameters in Pregnancy: A Comparison of Various Diet Quality Scores (OR35-02-19)  aNutrition in pregnancy plays an important role in maintaining glycemic control but there is no consensus on how to characterize maternal diet quality with respect to glycemic outcomes. The objective of this study is to compare the associations between 4 indices of diet quality with biomarkers of glycemic control (insulin, homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) in pregnancy, and to determine whether associations vary as a function of pre-pregnancy body mass index (pBMI). In a prospective longitudinal study of N = 220 pregnant women, dietary intakes were assessed at 3 time points across gestation by 3 × 24h-diet recalls per assessment, from which 4 validated diet quality scores were derived: Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Alternative Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy (AHEI-P), Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII). Fasting blood samples collected at each assessment were assayed for insulin and glucose and HOMA-IR was computed. pBMI was computed from self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height. Linear regression models predicting mean pregnancy values of insulin and HOMA-IR by diet quality score and pBMI and the diet quality*pBMI interaction term were computed. pBMI is strongly predictive of insulin and HOMA-IR and each diet quality score exerts similar significant main effects on glycemic parameters (Table 1). Only the DII*pBMI interaction term was significantly associated with insulin and HOMA-IR (Table 2). Figures 1A and 1B depict that the effect of DII on glycemic control is most pronounced for women with a pBMI < 25.0 Kg/m2, while levels among overweight and obese women remain relatively stable regardless of the inflammatory profile of the diet. Neither DASH, MDS or AHEI-P showed a significant effect on glycemic markers when analyzed as a function of pBMI. Although each of the examined diet quality scores may serve as crude predictors of glycemic control in pregnancy, only the DII detected significant differential effects as a function of pBMI. A more pro-inflammatory diet in normal weight pregnant women may exert a stronger influence on glycemic control compared to overweight and obese women, likely attributed to the overriding effects of excess adiposity on dysglycemia.

In this study, concentrations of Lp in a hospital hot water system were evaluated by profile sampling, collecting successive water samples to determine the prevalence at the faucet (distal) and upstream piping before and after a system intervention to increase temperature. Lp strain diversity was compared between different points of use and different areas of the hot water system (i.e., tap, intermediate piping and main upflow piping). In total, 47 isolates were recovered from 32 positive hot water samples collected from designated taps, showers and recirculation loops; these isolates were subsequently analyzed by sequence-based typing (SBT). Lp levels were comparable between first draw (500 mL) and flushed (2 and 5 min) samples, whereas a decrease was observed in the amount of culturable cells (1 log). Two sequence types (STs) were identified throughout the system. ST378 (sg4/10) was present in 91% of samples, while ST154-like (sg1) was present in 41%; both STs were simultaneously recovered in 34% of samples. Isolated STs displayed comparable tolerance to copper (0.8–5 mg/L) and temperature (55 °C, 1 h) exposure. The ability to replicate within THP1 cells and Acanthamoeba castellanii was similar between the two STs and a comparative environmental outbreak strain. The low Lp diversity and the detection of both Lp sequence types in repeated subsequent samples collected from positive faucets in a hospital wing suggest a minimal impact of the distal conditions on strain selection for the sampled points, as well as a possible adaptation to stressors present in the system, leading to the predominance of a few strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba castellanii 3aLegionella pneumophila 3acopper 3aenvironmental factors 3ahospitals 3apipes 3astrain differences 3atemperature 0aHot water system 0aLegionella pneumophila strain dominance 0aSequence-based typing 0aBacterial load profiles 0aBuilding plumbing 0aHospital1 aParanjape, Kiran1 aLalancette, Cindy1 aVillion, Manuela1 aQuach, Caroline1 aLaferrière, Céline1 aFaucher, Sebastien P.1 aPrévost, Michèle0 tWater research.g2019 June 01, v. 156 p.277-286dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245013300175300001400308520138700322592002801709650001501737650001201752650002401764650001301788650002201801650002801823650002401851650001801875650001601893650001901909650001101928650001301939650001601952650001001968653000901978653002601987653001602013653000902029653002702038700002102065700001902086700002302105700002302128773012802151856008402279852000902363655001202372IND60543807720221120181702.0190412e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054380772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRājiḥah, Hibah N.,10aElectrical, mechanical, and chemical effects of high-voltage electrical discharges on the polyphenol extraction from vine shoots  ap. 60-66.  aThe aim of this work was to study the mechanical, electrical and chemical effects of high-voltage electrical discharges (HVED) and their role in polyphenol extraction from vine shoots. Cutting and grinding pretreatments were conducted prior to HVED treatment. Thus, different initial specific surface areas (a0=6, 8.5, 11, 84 and 1885.19cm−1) of vine shoots were tested. When the initial specific surface areas were low (a0=6, 8.5, 11cm−1), the HVED induced damage degrees (D) were the highest, leading to a better enhancement of polyphenol extraction. However, no product fragmentation was found for the lowest particle size (a0=1885.19cm−1) before and after the HVED treatment, and despite it, an amelioration of polyphenol content in extract of 20mg/L was observed. The electrical arc generated H2O2 but did not lead to polyphenol degradation.This study gives significant information about the action mechanisms of high voltage electrical discharge treatment presenting relevant data for the design of the process. It shows the effectiveness of electrical discharges for the intensification of the extraction of bioactive molecules (polyphenols) from a specific byproduct (vine shoots). The paper also presents an energy-saving extraction process, relevant for industrial application, since no organic solvents were used. Process duration and temperature were also reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acutting 3aenergy conservation 3agrinding 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustrial applications 3amechanism of action 3aparticle size 3apolyphenols 3aprocess design 3ashoots 3asolvents 3atemperature 3avines 0aHVED 0aSpecific surface area 0aPolyphenols 0aH2O2 0aMaterial damage degree1 aBoussetta, Nadia1 aLouka, Nicolas1 aMaroun, Richard G.1 aVorobiev, Eugène,0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2015 Oct., v. 31 p.60-66dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2015.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01374naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245009500164300001600259520040300275592002800678650001400706650002300720650001000743650001200753650001500765650001300780650002200793700001900815773013900834856007800973852000901051655001201060IND60521425320221117225122.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052142532DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1973-5-6192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachlaus, M.

This species is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of many diseases such as allergies, hypertension, respiratory infections, diabetes, stomach pain, and intestinal antispasmodic.This work reports previous studies on O. majorana concerning its taxonomy, botanical description, geographical distribution, traditional use, bioactive compounds, toxicology, and biological effects.Different scientific data bases such as Web of Science, Scopus, Wiley Online, SciFinder, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink were consulted to collect data about O. majorana. The presented data emphasis bioactive compounds, traditional uses, toxicological investigations, and biological activities of O. majorana.The findings of this work marked an important correlation between the traditional use of O. majorana as an anti-allergic, antihypertensive, anti-diabetic agent, and its biological effects. Indeed, pharmacological investigations showed that essential oils and extracts from O. majorana exhibit different biological properties, particularly; antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, anticancer, nephrotoxicity protective, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-pyretic, hepatoprotective, and antimutagenic effects. Toxicological evaluation confirmed the safety and innocuity of this species and supported its medicinal uses. Several bioactive compounds belonging to different chemical family such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids were also identified in O. majorana.The results suggest that the pharmacological properties of O. majorana confirm its traditional uses. Indeed, O. majorana essential oils showed remarkable antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, nephroprotective, and hepatoprotective activities. However, further investigations regarding the evaluation of molecular mechanisms of identified compounds against human cancer cell lines, inflammatory process, and microbial infections are needed to validate pharmacodynamic targets. The toxicological investigation of O. Majorana confirmed its safety and therefore encouraged pharmacokinetic evaluation tests to validate its bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriganum majorana 3aanalgesics 3aanti-allergic agents 3aantimutagenic activity 3aantioxidants 3aantiparasitic agents 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3adatabases 3aessential oils 3aflavonoids 3ageographical distribution 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman diseases 3ahypoglycemic agents 3amedicinal plants 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anephroprotective effect 3anephrotoxicity 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3aphenolic acids 3aplant extracts 3ataxon descriptions 3aterpenoids 3atoxicity testing 3atraditional medicine 0aOriganum majorana 0aTraditional use 0aPharmacological actions 0aBioactive compounds 0aMechanism insights1 aChamkhi, Imane1 aBenali, Taoufiq1 aGuaouguaou, Fatima-Ezzahrae1 aBalahbib, Abdelaali1 aEl Omari, Nasreddine1 aTaha, Douae1 aBelmehdi, Omar1 aGhokhan, Zengin1 aEl Menyiy, Naoual0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Jan. 30, v. 265 p.113318-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1133183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010100158520143500259592002801694650001801722650000801740650001101748650001501759650002401774650001101798650002201809650001301831650001801844650002001862650001901882650001201901650002801913650002201941651001101963700002001974700003101994700002002025773012602045856007302171852000902244655001202253IND60651823620221121042242.0190712e20160709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065182362DNAL7 a10.3390/su80706522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shih-Hao10aPerformance Indicator Framework for Evaluation of Sustainable Tourism in the Taiwan Coastal Zone  aSurrounded by the ocean, Taiwan has been increasingly developing coastal tourism projects. Concerns that negative impacts might be brought about by prosperous tourism have resulted in a recent focus on sustainable tourism. Sustainable tourism involves policies that acknowledge the interdependences among the environment, the community, and the economy. The goal of sustainable tourism is to enhance and protect the environment while satisfying basic human requirements, as well as those of the contemporary and future tourism industries to improve quality of life. On the other hand, unsustainable coastal tourism might undermine the natural environment and society, resulting in air, water, and soil pollution, wildlife habitat disruption, and changes of local community cultural characteristics. Therefore, performance evaluation of coastal tourism, using an indicator framework to facilitate sustainable development and enhance the effectiveness of coastal resources exploitation, is critical. Through a literature review and expert surveys using the methods of the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), this study builds a performance indicator framework and identifies the key factors affecting the sustainable development of coastal tourism in Taiwan. The results can serve as a reference for the public sector to be used for the sustainable planning and development of coastal tourism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelphi method 3aair 3acoasts 3aecotourism 3ahabitat destruction 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3apublic sector 3aquality of life 3asoil pollution 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3awildlife habitats 3aTaiwan1 aLee, Meng-Tsung1 aChâteau, Pierre-Alexandre1 aChang, Yang-Chi0 tSustainability.g2016 July 09, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80706523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245012300191300001600314520071700330592002801047650002501075650001801100650001301118650001001131650000901141650000901150650001201159650003201171650005001203650003301253650001401286650000901300650002901309650002101338650003301359650001701392650003301409650000901442650001701451700002101468700002301489700002201512700002501534700001901559700001901578773008401597856008401681852000901765655001201774IND4476886420221120210342.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447688642DNAL7 a212623312pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCan, Özgür Devrim10aEffects of treatment with St. John's Wort on blood glucose levels and pain perceptions of streptozotocin-diabetic rats  ap. 576-584.  aThis present study was undertaken to examine treating effects of St. John's Wort (SJW) extract on nociceptive perception of STZ-diabetic animals based on its potential antidiabetic and antinociceptive activities. One week administrations of SJW extract (125 and 250mg/kg) induced significant decrease in high blood glucose levels of three weeks STZ-diabetic rats and improved their dysregulated metabolic parameters. In addition, SJW extract treatment caused restoration in the mechanical hyperalgesia of diabetic animals. These findings provide a rationale for the traditional use of SJW against diabetes and display the potential of this plant as a new drug candidate/source for the treatment of diabetic pain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum perforatum 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3apain 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxdrug therapy 2aDrug Evaluation, Preclinical 2aHypericum 2aMale 2aMetabolismxdrug effects 2aPain Measurement 2aPain Thresholdxdrug effects 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aÖztürk, Yusuf,1 aÖztürk, Nilgün,1 aSagratini, Gianni1 aRicciutelli, Massimo1 aVittori, Sauro1 aMaggi, Filippo0 tFitoterapia.g2011 June, v. 82, no. 4 p.576-584dElsevier B.V.x0367-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006400149245008100213506011700294506007600411520143200487592002801919506003701947650001701984650001902001650001402020650002702034650002002061650001802081650001102099650001902110650001602129651001402145653001902159653001902178653001402197653001502211653002802226653001702254773009302271856008402364852000902448655001202457IND60767144620221207084611.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076714462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1128492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlford-Jones, Kelsey1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7377-143710aHow injustice can lead to energy policy failure: A case study from Guatemala  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs global efforts to address climate change have intensified, incentivizing renewable energy development has become a pillar of Guatemala’s energy policy. Hydropower makes up over half of anticipated new electricity generation in the coming decade, yet these projects are heavily contested. Using energy justice as an analytical frame, I explore how the injustices embedded in policy design have led renewable energy development down the wrong path. I draw from a newly constructed database of hydropower conflicts between 2004 and 2018 to show that local opposition is not correlated to project size, but rather to the absence of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice. I discuss two interrelated policy decisions that give rise to justice concerns: a focus on private sector, incentive-based policies, and the absence of human rights protections as a pillar of national policy; international aid agencies have further exacerbated justice concerns. Community mobilization has successfully halted over 65% of contested projects—a third of all proposed capacity—demonstrating that injustice can have a measurable impact on goal attainment in the energy sector. Ultimately, this paper argues that as countries around the world attempt to speed the development of renewable energy, ensuring energy justice will be essential—both for the realization of human rights and for the success of national energy policy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy industry 3aenergy policy 3ahumans 3aprivate sector 3awater power 3aGuatemala 0aEnergy justice 0aPolicy failure 0aGuatemala 0aHydropower 0aRenewable energy policy 0aHuman rights0 tEnergy policy.g2022 May, v. 164 p.112849-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1128493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009400167300001800261520142800279592002801707650001801735650002301753650001901776650002101795650001301816650001701829650001201846650001901858650003301877650002401910650002201934650002001956650001101976650001601987650001602003651001202019651002102031700002002052700002402072700002002096700002202116773013602138856008302274852000902357655001202366IND60699932420221118203518.0200904e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069993242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-019-00983-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüney, Aylin,10aEnvironmental control of daily stem radius increment in the montane conifer Cedrus libani  ap. 1159-1171.  aGrowth response of conifers is species- specific and depends on site and climate conditions. Studies on daily radial stem growth use different analytical approaches to determine species reactions to environmental conditions. These results contribute to improve forecasts of tree growth under a changing climate. During 2013 and 2014, radial stem growth of 33 mature Cedrus libani individuals growing under different climatic conditions in Turkey and Germany was monitored hourly using high precision point dendrometers. Stem radius increments (SRI) were extracted from dendrometer readings. The annual course of SRI showed site-specific patterns with mean daily values ranging between 9.9 and 29.3 µm over the growing season. Correlation and principal component analyses indicated that humidity and low temperatures during the growing season favored SRI. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that precipitation and relative air humidity were the most important factors influencing daily SRI. Climate-growth relationships were further evaluated using the regression tree method. Precipitation was the most significant factor on daily SRI for all sites. The close coupling of SRI to relative air humidity and precipitation underlines the importance of stem water status for radial stem growth of C. libani which is native to regions with summer drought. It further explains the superior growth of C. libani in Germany.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrus libani 3aanalytical methods 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aconifers 3adendrometers 3adrought 3agrowing season 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3astem elongation 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree growth 3aGermany 3aTurkey (country)1 aGülsoy, Serkan1 aŞentürk, Özdemir1 aNiessner, Armin1 aKüppers, Manfred0 tJournal of forestry research.g2020 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.1159-1171dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-00983-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245007300212300002000285506007600305520102300381592002801404506003701432650001501469650001501484650002701499650001601526650002201542650001301564650002801577650001501605650001801620650001201638650001701650650001701667650001201684650001401696650001401710653002501724653001401749653001101763653002901774653003601803653000801839653001701847653002201864653002101886700001901907700001801926700003001944700002301974700001701997700001902014700002002033700001702053773010002070856008302170852000902253655001202262IND60672988820221207091135.0200412e20191017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067298882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.09.0222doi7 aPMC68386852pmcid7 a316267692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHampoelz, Bernhard10aNuclear Pores Assemble from Nucleoporin Condensates During Oogenesis  ap. 671-686.e17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe molecular events that direct nuclear pore complex (NPC) assembly toward nuclear envelopes have been conceptualized in two pathways that occur during mitosis or interphase, respectively. In gametes and embryonic cells, NPCs also occur within stacked cytoplasmic membrane sheets, termed annulate lamellae (AL), which serve as NPC storage for early development. The mechanism of NPC biogenesis at cytoplasmic membranes remains unknown. Here, we show that during Drosophila oogenesis, Nucleoporins condense into different precursor granules that interact and progress into NPCs. Nup358 is a key player that condenses into NPC assembly platforms while its mRNA localizes to their surface in a translation-dependent manner. In concert, Microtubule-dependent transport, the small GTPase Ran and nuclear transport receptors regulate NPC biogenesis in oocytes. We delineate a non-canonical NPC assembly mechanism that relies on Nucleoporin condensates and occurs away from the nucleus under conditions of cell cycle arrest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3abiogenesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acondensates 3aearly development 3agranules 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ainterphase 3amessenger RNA 3amitosis 3anuclear pore 3anucleoporins 3aoocytes 3aoogenesis 3areceptors 0anuclear pore complex 0aoogenesis 0aNup358 0anucleoporin condensation 0amicrotubule-dependent transport 0aRan 0aNPC assembly 0alocal translation 0aRNA localization1 aSchwarz, Andre1 aRonchi, Paolo1 aBragulat-Teixidor, Helena1 aTischer, Christian1 aGaspar, Imre1 aEphrussi, Anne1 aSchwab, Yannick1 aBeck, Martin0 tCell.g2019 Oct. 17, v. 179, no. 3 p.671-686.e17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015000156300002000306520180800326592002802134650001602162650001102178650001102189650003002200650003402230650003102264650002102295650001502316650001902331650001102350650001102361700001602372700001602388700001402404700001502418700001802433700001602451700001702467700001802484700001502502700001402517773014502531856007502676852000902751655001202760IND60780109020221120130419.0220615e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078010902DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta01636b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Feiyan10aNickel–cobalt bimetallic tungstate decorated 3D hierarchical porous carbon derived from lignin for high-performance supercapacitor applications  ap. 12679-12691.  aTransition-metal tungstates (MWO₄), which are high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitor use thanks to their intrinsically outstanding electrochemical properties, have recently emerged and drawn great attention. Herein, we synthesized materials consisting of bimetallic Ni₄₋ₓCoₓWO₄ (x = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) nanoparticles supported on enzymatic-hydrolysis-lignin-derived three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon (Ni₄₋ₓCoₓWO₄/HPC) and explored their usage as positive electrode materials for use in asymmetric supercapacitors. The Co/Ni ratio has a significant impact on the specific capacitance of the Ni₄₋ₓCoₓWO₄/HPC electrode, and the Ni₃Co₁WO₄/HPC electrode, which is the best performer among Ni₄₋ₓCoₓWO₄/HPC electrodes to the best of our knowledge, exhibits an optimal specific capacitance of 1084 F g⁻¹ (364.5 C g⁻¹) at a current density of 0.5 A g⁻¹ in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. This is attributed to the distinctive nanostructure and strong synergistic effects between nickel and cobalt ions. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the significant capacitance enhancement seen for Ni₄₋ₓCoₓWO₄/HPC is associated with enhanced conductivity. An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni₃Co₁WO₄/HPC can provide a high voltage of 1.6 V and deliver an excellent energy density of 105.6 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 400.5 W kg⁻¹, and it has excellent stability, showing 80.74% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles; this compares favorably with analogous supercapacitors. It is anticipated that the rational design of Ni₃Co₁WO₄/HPC will provide new paths for the synthesis of high-performance bimetallic oxide materials for application in energy-related fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acobalt 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3alignin 3anickel1 aZhao, Shuai1 aYang, Junyu1 aTong, Yao1 aLi, Jiajun1 aZhai, Shangru1 aZhao, Xinyu1 aWu, Shenghan1 aLi, Hongsheng1 aAn, Qingda1 aWang, Kai0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 June 14, v. 10, no. 23 p.12679-12691dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta01636b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013300165300001800298520157800316592002801894650002601922650002201948650002101970650002001991650002002011650001002031650001102041650002102052650001302073650001702086650002202103650002602125650001402151650001002165650001502175650002402190651001002214700001702224700001902241700001902260700001902279700001802298700001402316700001602330700001702346700001702363700001702380700001602397773013602413856008302549852000902632655001202641IND60699932520221118203513.0200904e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069993252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-019-01035-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaode14aThe effects of different nitrogen sources on camptothecin content and related gene expression in Camptotheca acuminata seedlings  ap. 1347-1357.  aCamptotheac acuminata Decne is a unique tree species in China with an important secondary metabolite, camptothecin (CPT), used in the treatment of cancer. Nitrogen (N) is an important element that affects plant growth and the accumulation of CPT. Reports on the effect of N on CPT synthesis from a genetic perspective are scarce. To explore the effects of different N sources and levels on CPT synthesis in C. acuminata, two-year-old seedlings were fertilized with different concentrations of pure ammonium sulphate, source of ammonium N (NH₄⁺–N), and potassium nitrate for nitrate N (NO₃⁻–N). Concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 g pot⁻¹ NH₄⁺–N and NO₃⁻–N were used. The results showed that 7.5 g NH₄⁺–N and NO₃⁻–N treatments were best for growth and fresh weight of leaves. Compared with the other treatments, the CPT content, tryptophan synthase and tryptophan decarboxylase activities, and expression of the CaTSB and CaTDC1 genes under the 2.5 g NH₄⁺–N and NO₃⁻–N treatments peaked significantly at 30 days. However, the expression of CaTDC2 surpassed that of the other two genes at 60 days. Therefore, compared with NH₄⁺–N source, the NO₃⁻–N source was more beneficial for growth, and NO₃⁻–N was better for CPT yield. Consequently, leaves of C. acuminata treated with 2.5 g NO₃⁻–N could be harvested after 30 days to obtain maximum CPT content. CaTDC1 is more closely linked to CPT synthesis. The results of this study improved the production of CPT in C. acuminata via fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamptotheca acuminata 3aammonium nitrogen 3aammonium sulfate 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenes 3aleaves 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3apotassium nitrate 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3atrees 3atryptophan 3atryptophan synthase 3aChina1 aBian, Sainan1 aChang, Pengjie1 aWang, Ninghang1 aXuan, Lingjuan1 aZhang, Mingru1 aDong, Bin1 aZhang, Chao1 aWu, Jiasheng1 aYing, Yeqing1 aLin, Xiazhen1 aShen, Yamei0 tJournal of forestry research.g2020 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.1347-1357dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-01035-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01586naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245014200165300001600307520050400323592002800827650001000855650001600865650001300881650001000894650001300904650001600917653001600933653002800949653001300977700001900990773015201009856007801161852000901239655001201248IND60521425620221117225104.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052142562DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1973-5-6222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlostermeyer, H.10aAbspaltung säurelabiler Aminoschutzgruppen durch Pyridiniumsalze / The Removal of Acid-labile Amino-protecting Groups by Pyridinum Salts  ap. 334-338.  aPyridinium salts of strong acids are usefull reagents in organic solvents, e. g. methanol, for the selective cleavage of acid labile amino-protecting groups as the trityl, o-nitrophenylsulfenyl, and the 2-(ρ-biphenyl)-isopropyloxycarbonyl residue.

Therefore, it could be interesting to predict the physical properties of the mixture using the single-component results. In this paper, we have focused on the prediction of the compressibility of binary mixtures using the Kawakita model. Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and l-alanine were compacted alone and mixed at different weight fractions. The volume reduction, as a function of the compaction pressure, was acquired during the compaction process (“in-die”) and after elastic recovery (“out-of-die”). For the pure components, the Kawakita model is well suited to the description of the volume reduction. For binary mixtures, an original approach for the prediction of the volume reduction without using the effective Kawakita parameters was proposed and tested. The good agreement between experimental and predicted data proved that this model was efficient to predict the volume reduction of MCC and l-alanine mixtures during compaction experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3acellulose 3acompressibility 3aequations 3amodels 3apharmaceutical industry 3aprediction1 aBusignies, Virginie1 aDuca, Stéphane1 aLeclerc, Bernard1 aTchoreloff, Pierre0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 May 30, v. 410, no. 1-2 p.92-98dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.03.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013500154300002000289520133400309592002801643650002201671650001501693650001101708650001401719650002301733650003001756650001701786650001101803650001301814650002401827650001801851650001701869650001301886650001701899650001401916700002101930700001801951700001501969700001701984700001402001700001402015700001202029700001602041773014502057856007502202852000902277655001202286IND60780109120221121233456.0220615e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078010912DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta01699k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qian10aNearly hollow Ru–Cu–MoO₂ octahedrons consisting of clusters and nanocrystals for high efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction  ap. 12341-12349.  aRegular hollow catalysts have aroused increasing attention in electrocatalysis owing to large surface area, many more active centers and fast mass transfer. Nevertheless, the structure regulation of regular hollow catalysts, especially octahedrons, is scarcely reported. Herein, by developing a facile strategy, we successfully integrate Ru clusters and Cu–MoO₂ nanocrystals into a fused nearly hollow Ru–Cu–MoO₂ octahedron encapsulated in carbon. Due to the synergic effect and the advantageous structure and composition, such a multiple-nanocomponent catalyst merely requires 22 and 48 mV overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H₂SO₄ solutions, respectively. More importantly, in alkaline seawater, nearly hollow Ru–Cu–MoO₂ octahedrons also present remarkable HER activity (23 mV @ 10 mA cm⁻²), indicating potential applications in hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation results unveil that the excellent catalytic activity of Ru–Cu–MoO₂ is on account of its relatively low hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) and water adsorption energy. The present work provides a new approach for designing advanced Ru-based catalysts for the HER and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amass transfer 3ananocrystals 3aseawater 3asurface area 3asynergism1 aZhang, Chengtian1 aWang, Pengyan1 aChen, Ding1 aXiao, Manjie1 aChen, Lei1 aLiu, Suli1 aYu, Jun1 aMu, Shichun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 June 14, v. 10, no. 23 p.12341-12349dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta01699k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245007900158300001800237500002000255500000900275520226100284592002802545650001302573650000902586650002002595650002302615650003002638650001302668650001802681650001102699650001502710650000902725650000902734650002402743650001202767650001302779700002202792700002302814700002702837773021902864856008003083852000903163655001203172IND60666345920221119003831.0220811e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066634592DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2017.11.04292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Ling12aA Global Meta‐Analysis to Predict Atrazine Sorption from Soil Properties  ap. 1389-1399.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aAtrazine (2‐chloro‐4‐ethylamino‐6‐isopropylamino‐1,3,5‐triazine) is one of the most widely used herbicides worldwide, and groundwater contamination is of concern, especially in heavily used regions and in edaphic conditions prone to leaching. Soil sorption plays an essential role in atrazine environmental fate, yet consistent atrazine risk prediction remains limited. A quantitative meta‐analysis was conducted to characterize the effect of soil properties on atrazine sorption, using 378 previous observations in 48 publications from 1985 to 2015 globally, which included data on soil properties and sorption parameters. A supplemental regional study was conducted to test the derived meta‐analysis models. The meta‐analysis indicated that percentage organic C (OC) was the most important parameter for estimating atrazine sorption, followed by percentage silt, soil pH, and percentage clay. Meta‐analysis and supplemental study models were developed for Freundlich sorption coefficients (Kf) and sorption distribution coefficients (Kd) as a function of OC. The global meta‐analysis models generated positive linear trends for OC with Kf and Kd (R² = 0.197 and 0.205, respectively). Organic C was highly correlated with Kf and Kd in supplemental experimental study models (R² = 0.93 and 0.92, respectively), indicating accurate prediction of sorption within the evaluated region. Continental models were investigated, which improved the goodness of fit. Models developed via meta‐analysis may be used to predict atrazine sorption over wide ranges of data, whereas more accurate and refined prediction can be achieved by specific regional models through experimental studies. However, such models could be improved if standardized agroclimatic conditions, soil classification, and other key variables were more widely reported. CORE IDEAS: Meta‐analysis quantified soil properties governing atrazine sorption. Organic C content had the highest correlation with atrazine soil sorption. Meta‐analysis models showed similar trends to independent experimental results. Continental and supplemental models improved fit compared with global models.

Individuals who currently commute long distances to work express a greater willingness to do so in the future. In terms of policy and planning, planners and policymakers often regard the willingness to commute long distances as an important indicator of a population's potential future commuting behavior. However, given the emphasis on cross-sectional studies in the existing literature, it is unclear whether a high willingness to commute actually has an influence on the decision to engage in commuting (selection hypothesis), or whether participating in long-distance commuting determines willingness to commute (adaptation hypothesis). We use unique longitudinal data from four European countries – Germany, France, Spain, and Switzerland – to examine the relationship between individual level willingness to commute long distances (i.e. at least 60 min one-way) and actual commuting behavior. Results show that there is considerable within-person variance in commuting willingness over time. We find novel evidence that is in line with the adaptation hypothesis, meaning that starting a long-distance commuting episode is associated with an increase in commuting willingness. There is also some evidence for a selection effect, yet this effect appears to be considerably weaker. Therefore, this study provides more support for adaptation theories of commuting suggesting that commuting willingness can be understood as an outcome capturing people's attitudes toward their current commuting arrangements. Future commuting research should incorporate such possibilities into their conceptualizations of the commuting willingness construct and explanatory models for commuting behavior and outcomes. We also address implications for policy and practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3apsychology 3avariance 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aSpain 3aSwitzerland 0aCommuting attitudes 0aCommuting tolerance 0aSelection 0aAdaptation 0aRational actor 0aHabituation1 aStawarz, Nico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8926-79881 aSkora, Thomas1 aWiernik, Brenton M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9560-63360 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2021 Oct., v. 77 p.101667-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1016673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005300149245013200202520130300334592002801637650001401665650002001679650001801699650001101717650001101728650002301739651001001762653002301772653003201795653003001827653002901857653002401886700002101910700001401931700001601945700005501961700001802016773009402034856008402128852000902212655001202221IND60767145120221122024740.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076714512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1128582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9777-944910aDoes the public support the construction of battery swapping station for battery electric vehicles? - Data from Hangzhou, China  aThis paper presents a preliminary estimation of Hangzhou citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the construction of battery swapping stations (BSSs) for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). This study also explored the factors that affect WTP.A total of 872 valid samples were obtained. As for the 202 families who refused to pay, the spike model was applied for data processing, The results showed that each family was willing to annually pay about 400.52 CNY to support the construction of BSS. The WTP is generally higher among families with an above-average income or among those who own BEVs and thus have an interest in BSS policy, as well as among interviewees who have experience or knowledge relating to BEVs or BSSs and believe that BSSs will improve the environment and provide convenient, efficient charging services to the public. Meanwhile, Theory of planned behaviour (TPB) also have a significant statistical relationship with the public's WTP. Therefore, decision-makers should consider formulating some policies that will help increase the public’s knowledge and experience relating to BSSs and BEVs. Furthermore, the publicity should be enhanced to raise the public’s awareness of policies. Finally, greater attention should be paid to the positive externality values of BSSs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3adecision making 3aenergy policy 3aincome 3amodels 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aWillingness to pay 0aContingent valuation method 0aBattery electric vehicles 0aBattery swapping station 0aInfluencing factors1 aFukuda, Hiroatsu1 aLi, Zhang1 aWang, Shuai1 aGao, Weijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0299-36861 aLiu, Zhonghui0 tEnergy policy.g2022 Apr., v. 163 p.112858-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2022.1128583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001700158245010200175300001600277520122300293592002801516650002701544650001501571650001801586650001001604650003201614650002301646650001901669650001701688650001701705650002201722650002701744650001201771650001001783653002201793653001201815653001001827653002501837700001901862700001701881700001901898700001801917700002001935700001901955700002001974773010701994856009302101852000902194655001202203IND60540544720221118025750.0190318e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054054472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Seul-Ki10aPolymerase subunit gamma 2 affects porcine oocyte maturation and subsequent embryonic development  ap. 121-130.  aDeoxyribonucleic acid polymerase subunit gamma (POLG) is an enzyme encoded by the mitochondrial Polg gene. Polymerase (DNA directed), gamma 2, accessory subunit, also known as POLG2, is involved in mitochondrial replication. In the present study, we examined the role of Polg2 in the maturation of porcine oocytes. After Polg2 knockdown, the mitochondrial DNA copy number was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in the control group. However, there was no decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. The decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number led to reductions in adenosine-5′-triphosphate content (P < 0.05) and the maturation rate (P < 0.05) of oocytes. Furthermore, in the Polg2-knockdown group, maturation-promoting factor activity was decreased (P < 0.05) and the percentage of oocytes displaying abnormal actin filaments and microtubules was significantly increased (P < 0.05). This likely led to the reduced development rate and number of cells per blastocyst in this group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Polg2 seems to be critical for mitochondrial replication and regulation of adenosine-5′-triphosphate content and affects porcine oocyte maturation and subsequent embryonic development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ablastocyst 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3amaturation-promoting factor 3amembrane potential 3amicrofilaments 3amicrotubules 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoocytes 3aswine 0aOocyte maturation 0aPorcine 0aPolg2 0aMitochondria content1 aZhao, Ming-Hui1 aZheng, Zhong1 aKwon, Jung-Woo1 aLiang, Shuang1 aKim, Seon-Hyang1 aKim, Nam-Hyung1 aCui, Xiang-Shun0 tTheriogenology.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 83, no. 1 p.121-130dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008200164300001400246520100000260592002801260650001801288650001801306650001401324650001401338650001901352650001901371650000901390650002801399650001301427653001001440653001701450653001401467653003101481653001401512653001001526653001001536653001001546653000801556653000801564653001001572653000801582653000901590700001501599700001801614700001801632700001801650773007301668856008501741852000901826655001201835IND60088507920221119202706.0161019e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008850792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yu10aMicrocystin-LR induces autophagy and apoptosis in rat Sertoli cells in vitro  ap. 84-93.  aAlthough microcystin-LR (MC-LR) produced by cyanobacteria has been demonstrated with strong reproductive toxicity, the mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to probe the effects of MC-LR on induction of autophagy in Sertoli cells, as well as the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. After exposure to various concentrations of MC-LR for 24 or 48 h, cell viability and membrane integrity were significantly decreased under high MC-LR conditions (50–500 nM). The autophagosome marker protein LC3 was increased at mild MC-LR concentrations (0.5–5 nM). However, autophagosomes accumulated to their peak level under high MC-LR conditions in parallel with significantly up-regulated apoptosis. Treatment with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) abrogated autophagosome accumulation and apoptosis. This study demonstrated that MC-LR had toxic effects on Sertoli cells by inducing autophagy and apoptosis. The autophagosome accumulation may be involved in the apoptosis induced by MC-LR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aSertoli cells 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell viability 3amicrocystin-LR 3arats 3areproductive toxicology 3atoxicity 0aMC-LR 0aSertoli cell 0aAutophagy 0aAutophagosome accumulation 0aApoptosis 0aMC-LR 0aCyt-C 0aCCK-8 0aLDH 0aTEM 0aANOVA 0aAVs 0a3-MA1 aZhou, Yuan1 aWang, Xueting1 aQian, Weiping1 aHan, Xiaodong0 tToxicon.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 76 p.84-93dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245006700215300001600282500001100298520169300309592002802002650002202030650001902052650002802071650001702099650001002116650000902126650001102135650001002146650001102156700002502167700001602192700002502208700002502233700002002258700002302278700001902301700002902320700001902349700002302368700002302391700002402414700001402438700002302452700002102475700001802496700002002514700002002534700001902554700002502573700001802598700002002616700002102636700002002657773011102677856008302788852000902871655001202880IND60779490620221116152145.0220609e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077949062DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-021-00383-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCappuccio, Francesco P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7842-549310aSodium and Health: Old Myths and a Controversy Based on Denial  ap. 172-184.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW : The scientific consensus on which global health organizations base public health policies is that high sodium intake increases blood pressure (BP) in a linear fashion contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). A moderate reduction in sodium intake to 2000 mg per day helps ensure that BP remains at a healthy level to reduce the burden of CVD. RECENT FINDINGS : Yet, since as long ago as 1988, and more recently in eight articles published in the European Heart Journal in 2020 and 2021, some researchers have propagated a myth that reducing sodium does not consistently reduce CVD but rather that lower sodium might increase the risk of CVD. These claims are not well-founded and support some food and beverage industry’s vested interests in the use of excessive amounts of salt to preserve food, enhance taste, and increase thirst. Nevertheless, some researchers, often with funding from the food industry, continue to publish such claims without addressing the numerous objections. This article analyzes the eight articles as a case study, summarizes misleading claims, their objections, and it offers possible reasons for such claims. Our study calls upon journal editors to ensure that unfounded claims about sodium intake be rigorously challenged by independent reviewers before publication; to avoid editorial writers who have been co-authors with the subject paper’s authors; to require statements of conflict of interest; and to ensure that their pages are used only by those who seek to advance knowledge by engaging in the scientific method and its collegial pursuit. The public interest in the prevention and treatment of disease requires no less.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverage industry 3ablood pressure 3acardiovascular diseases 3acase studies 3aheart 3arisk 3asodium 3ataste 3athirst1 aCampbell, Norm R.

Under Salinity Stress  ap. 435-444.  aParsley (Petroselinum crispum L.) is widely used in food, medicine, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. This research was conducted to determine the effect of six different irrigation water salinities (S₁ = 0.38, S₂ = 1.5, S₃ = 2.5, S₄ = 4, S₅ = 7 and S₆ = 10 dS m⁻¹) and two levels of foliar application of salicylic acid (SA₁ = 0 mM and SA₂ = 2 mM) on yield, yield parameters, and antioxidant enzyme activity of parsley. Increasing salinity reduced the fresh weight, plant height, evapotranspiration, chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance (gₛ), whereas foliar salicylic acid application positively affected the vegetative growth parameters. Salinity and foliar application of salicylic acid significantly affected total protein, peroxidase (POD), and glutathione S‑transferase (GST) activities. The POD and GST activities increased as salinity increased to 4.0 dS m⁻¹ and 2.50 dS m⁻¹, respectively. Fresh weight highly correlated with stomatal conductance (gₛ) (r = 0.725**), chlorophyll content (r = 0.366*) and GST (r = 0.646**). The application of 2 mM salicylic acid to parsley under salinity stress decreased the negative effect on growth and increased its fresh weight.  aPublisher supplied data  aPYO.ZRT.1904.17.041cOndokuz Mayis Üniversitesi 3aPetroselinum crispum 3aantioxidant enzymes 3achlorophyll 3acosmetics 3aenzyme activity 3aevapotranspiration 3afoliar application 3aglutathione transferase 3airrigation water 3amedicine 3aparsley 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant height 3aprotein content 3asalicylic acid 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3astomatal conductance 3avegetative growth1 aArslan, Hakan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9677-60350 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2021 Dec., v. 73, no. 4 p.435-444dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl28332x0367-42237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-021-00565-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012100155300001800276500002000294520169600314592002802010650003102038650001202069650001902081650001502100650001302115650000902128650001302137650001302150650000902163650001602172650001502188650001502203650001802218650002002236650001502256700003202271700001602303700001502319700001902334773011002353856007302463852000902536655001202545IND60576295120221118234142.0170731e20170730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057629512DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.112312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrinh, Toan10aProjected 21st century climate change on snow conditions over Shasta Dam watershed by means of dynamical downscaling  ap. 2887-2901.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSnow is an important component of the Earth's climate system and is particularly vulnerable to global warming. It has been suggested that warmer temperatures may cause significant declines in snow water content and snow cover duration. In this study, snowfall and snowmelt were projected by means of a regional climate model that was coupled to a physically based snow model over Shasta Dam watershed to assess changes in snow water content and snow cover duration during the 21st century. This physically based snow model requires both physical data and future climate projections. These physical data include topography, soils, vegetation, and land use/land cover, which were collected from associated organizations. The future climate projections were dynamically downscaled by means of the regional climate model under 4 emission scenarios simulated by 2 general circulation models (fifth‐generation of the ECHAM general circulation model and the third‐generation atmospheric general circulation model). The downscaled future projections were bias corrected before projecting snowfall and snowmelt processes over Shasta Dam watershed during 2010–2099. This study's results agree with those of previous studies that projected snow water equivalent is decreasing by 50–80% whereas the fraction of precipitation falling as snowfall is decreasing by 15% to 20%. The obtained projection results show that future snow water content will change in both time and space. Furthermore, the results confirm that physical data such as topography, land cover, and atmospheric–hydrologic data are instrumental in the studies on the impact of climate change on the water resources of a region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3aland cover 3aland use 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asoil 3atemperature 3atopography 3avegetation 3awater content 3awater resources 3awatersheds1 aKavvas, M.

Agricultural soils dominate anthropogenic N₂O emissions but there is very limited information specifically relating relative soil gas diffusivity (Dp/Do) to N₂O emissions. This study was conducted to determine the effects of soil bulk density (ρb) and matric potential (ψ) on Dp/Do and the associated N₂O fluxes in the presence of denitrification substrates. The interaction between soil ρb and ψ on Dp/Do and N₂O fluxes was investigated using 880 repacked soil cores that were saturated with a nitrate (NO₃–) solution and placed on tension tables at 11 levels of ψ and 5 levels of soil ρb. After equilibration (4 d) N₂O fluxes, Dp/Do, inorganic-N concentrations, and soil physical characteristics were determined. Emissions of N₂O peaked at increasingly lower levels of ψ(–1.5 to –6.0 kPa) as soil ρb increased (1.1 to 1.5 Mg m–³) due to increasing microporosity. Peak N₂O emissions occurred across a relatively wide range of water-filled pore space (WFPS) and volumetric water content. A Gaussian fit of N₂O-N fluxes against ψ showed maximum fluxes were related to the soil’s air-entry potential (r² = 0.96). Maximum N₂O emissions occurred at a Dp/Do value of 0.006 that was independent of soil ρb. Log N₂O-N flux was a function of log Dp/Do (r² = 0.82) when Dp/Do was >0.006. Soil Dp/Do is a key indicator of N₂O emission potential and needs to be further explored as a predictor of N₂O emissions in a range of soil textures and denitrification substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3adenitrification 3adiffusivity 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3aozone depletion 3asoil air 3asoil density 3asoil texture 3astratosphere 3avolumetric water content1 aClough, Tim J.1 aBeare, Mike H.1 aThomas, Steven M.,1 aMeenken, Esther D.1 aRoss, James G.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2013 Sept., v. 77, no. 5 p.1496-1505dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2013.04.01413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245008800175300002000263520069000283592002800973650002501001650001701026650001901043650001901062650002401081650002501105653003901130653003301169653003601202700002701238700002701265700006801292700006801360773015001428856008101578852000901659655001201668IND60759316620220304000000.0220304e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075931662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c055842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuadros-Rodríguez, Luis10aChromatographic Fingerprinting and Food Identity/Quality: Potentials and Challenges  ap. 14428-14434.  aChromatograms are a valuable source of information about the chemical composition of the food being analyzed.

In this paper, we specifically underscore how a life-threatening disease—malaria—is experienced and bio-cyclically understood and managed in relation to seasonal hunger, food insecurities, and livelihood vulnerabilities. The study, conducted June–July 2013, draws on field data and interviews with 60 women farmers of the Luhya community along the Yala River in Kakamega County, Western Province, Kenya. Major findings suggest the following: (1) women’s perceived desired quality of life is shaped by priorities for children’s education, nutrition, food security, and economic security in their rural communities; (2) malaria emerged as a challenging household health problem that curtails livelihood opportunities for most study participants; and (3) local understandings of malaria transmission, particularly how and when female mosquitoes become infected with malaria-causing protozoans, was low, but malaria symptoms were relatively well-understood. The interest and motivation to institute new malaria risk reduction practices at the community level are explored, including attention to building upon the Luhya tradition of oral storytelling in order to promote actions to eliminate malaria. This analysis of local narratives of health risks illustrates these points and demonstrates how women’s constructions of health risks and well-being provide a basis for developing interventions targeting income generation and microloan opportunities that could support Kenyan women in their intersecting approaches to malaria, securing nutritious diets, and enhancing the local health environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aProtozoa 3achildren 3adiet 3aeducation 3afemales 3afood security 3ahunger 3aincome 3ainterviews 3alivelihood 3amalaria 3amotivation 3aquality of life 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3arural communities 3awomen in agriculture 3aKenya1 aHansen, Leanna M.1 aHalvorson, Sarah J.1 aBangert, Arthur0 tGeoJournal.g2017 Aug., v. 82, no. 4 p.841-865dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-016-9701-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245006200180300001800242500000900260520149500269592002801764650002201792650001901814650002101833650001801854650001101872650001501883650002201898650002101920650001901941650001201960650001301972650001901985650001502004650001202019650001002031650002302041650000902064650002402073650002002097650001202117650001902129650001002148651001302158700001902171773015002190856009602340852000902436655001202445IND60667815020221122140020.0191125e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066781502DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300040018x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFollett, R. F.10aEffect of Tillage Practices on Microbial Biomass Dynamics  ap. 1091-1096.  aepub  aChanges in microbial biomass dynamics and N cycling were studied in soils from a site derived from native grassland in western Nebraska managed under three tillage systems: no-till, stubble mulch, and moldboard plow (bare fallow). A treatment of native sod was maintained in each replication. The site was in native sod until 1970 when it was plowed and an alternate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow rotation established. After 16 yr of cultivation, total N concentration in the top 10 cm of soil had decreased to 73, 68, and 50% of native sod in the no-till, stubble mulch, and plow treatments, respectively. Soil microbial biomass levels were decreased to 57, 52, and 36% for the corresponding tillage treatments as compared to the native sod. In laboratory incubation studies, CO₂ respiration was proportional to microbial biomass. Nitrogen mineralization, however, was not proportional to microbial biomass. Immobilization of added ¹⁵N was highest for the native sod treatment and amounts of ¹⁵N extracted by KCl were inversely related to microbial biomass. Respiration rates per unit of mineralized N (r/Nₘᵢₙ ratio) increased in the order of plow, stubble mulch, no-till, and sod treatments, suggesting that C availability for microbial growth declined with increased tillage intensity. In these tillage experiments, increased tillage intensity decreased the ability of soil to immobilize and conserve mineral N.

Roosters were 35 wk old and housed with hens in two conventional broiler breeder houses on a farm in western North Carolina. Morbidity was approximately 10% in one house and less than 2% in the other house. Mortality and flock fertility were not affected. Three birds from the most affected house were examined. All birds had white adherent material on their combs that presented as crusty patches or lighter diffuse areas. Often, lesions were roughly circular or had a defined margin. Small black scabs were present in a few lesions. Similar but less extensive lesions were located on the wattles, facial skin, ear lobes, and rictus. In one bird, lesions extended down the neck, and they were accompanied by hyperemia and feather loss. Hyperkeratosis with little to no inflammation and intralesional fungi occurring as yeast and pseudohyphae were seen microscopically. High numbers of C. albicans were isolated and identified from the lesions. 3acomb (integument) 3acandidiasis 3aroosters 3abroiler breeders 3aflocks 3alesions (animal) 3acase studies 3ahistopathology 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3adermatitis 2aAnimals 2aCandidiasisxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aComb and Wattlesxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxmicrobiologyxpathology. 3aNorth Carolina1 aFletcher, O.1 aDykstra, M.J.1 aPost, K.1 aBarnes, H.J.0 tAvian diseases.g2007 June, v. 51, no. 2 p.618-622dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086(2007)51[618:CCARIA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle03344naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006500170300001600235520173700251592002801988650001802016650002302034650002702057650001102084650001102095650001702106650001502123650001402138650001402152650001802166650001502184650001802199650001302217650001702230651001102247651002802258651001802286653001602304653001402320653002302334653001302357653001402370653000902384653001702393653001702410653001402427653001202441653001602453653001802469653001002487700002502497700002102522700001802543773007502561856008502636852000902721655001202730IND60088508120221119202531.0161019e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008850812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerel, Sylvain10aSpatial and thematic distribution of research on cyanotoxins  ap. 118-131.  aCyanobacteria in surface water are well known for their ability to form toxic blooms responsible for animal mortality and human poisoning. Accompanying major progress in science and technology, the state of knowledge of cyanotoxins has dramatically increased over the last two decades. The bibliometric approach applied in this study shows the evolution of research and identifies major gaps to be filled by future work. Although the publication rate has gradually increased from one hundred to three hundred articles per year since the 1990s, half of the literature available focuses on microcystins and another quarter on saxitoxins. Other cyanotoxins such as beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine or cylindrospermopsin remain vastly disregarded. Moreover, most of the publications deal with toxicity and ecology while other research areas, such as environmental and public health, require additional investigation. The analysis of the literature highlights the main journals for the communication of knowledge on cyanotoxins but also reveals that 90% of the research is originated from only ten countries. These countries are also those with the highest H-index and average number of citation per article. Nonetheless, the ranking of these countries is significantly altered when the amount of publications is normalized based on the population, the number of universities, the national gross domestic product or the government revenue. However, the lower amount of publications from Eastern Europe, Africa and South America could also reflect the lack of monitoring campaigns in these regions. This lack could potentially lead to the underestimation of the prevalence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and the diversity of toxins worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3acylindrospermopsin 3agross domestic product 3ahumans 3aincome 3amicrocystins 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apoisoning 3apublic health 3asaxitoxins 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3auniversities 3aAfrica 3aEastern European region 3aSouth America 0aMicrocystin 0aNodularin 0aCylindrospermopsin 0aAnatoxin 0aSaxitoxin 0aBMAA 0aAplysiatoxin 0aLyngbyatoxin 0aGeography 0aEconomy 0aBibliometry 0aCyanobacteria 0aBloom1 aVillarín, María C.1 aChung, Khrystyne1 aSnyder, Shane0 tToxicon.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 76 p.118-131dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002300142245003300165300001800198520120700216592002801423650002001451650002101471650002101492650001101513700002101524773013301545856004501678852000901723655001201732IND4468080220221119101343.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446808022DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2011000512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthenstaedt, Karin10aLipid storage: Yeast we can!  ap. 1188-1197.  aWaste not, want not! This saying also applies to the yeast. In times of excess this microorganism synthesizes nonâpolar lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters (SE), which serve as energy source and/or as a source of building blocks for the formation of membrane phospholipids when nutriments become limiting. Due to the lack of charged groups substantial amounts of nonâpolar lipids cannot be incorporated into cellular membranes, whereas the hydrophobic nature of these molecules also deprives cytosolic localization. Consequently, TAG and SE are stored in specialized compartments known as lipid particles or lipid droplets. TAG synthases and SE synthases which catalyze the final steps in storage lipid formation occur redundantly. Hydrolytic enzymes, TAG lipases and SE hydrolases, initiate the breakdown of storage lipids and make sterols, diacylglycerols, and free fatty acids available for anabolic processes and energy production. In this paper we describe routes of nonâpolar lipid metabolism, focus on molecular properties of enzymes involved and discuss regulatory aspects of the respective pathways. The value of the yeast as a eukaryotic model system is advocated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3alipid metabolism 3atriacylglycerols 3ayeasts1 aDaum, GÃ¼nther0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2011 Oct., v. 113, no. 10 p.1188-1197dWILEYâVCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.201100051  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007000166300001600236520123300252592002801485650002301513650001001536650001401546650001201560650001201572650002101584650001501605650001401620650001001634650001301644650001701657650000901674650000701683650001701690650001201707650001301719650002301732653001601755653001701771653001701788653002201805653002001827653001001847653001001857653002501867653002101892653000901913653001201922700002301934700002101957700002001978700005601998773012502054856008302179852000902262655001202271IND60597083420221119205915.0181002e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059708342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shengye10aPraseodymium sorption on Laminaria digitata algal beads and foams  ap. 780-789.  aAlgal (Laminaria digitata) beads and algal foams have been prepared by a new synthesis mode and the sorbents were tested for praseodymium sorption in batch and fixed-bed like systems (recirculation or one-pass modes), respectively. Metal binding occurs through ion-exchange with Ca(II) ions used for ionotropic gelation of alginate contained in the algal biomass and eventually with protons. Sorption isotherms at pH 4 are described by the Langmuir and the Sips equations with maximum sorption capacities close to 110–120mgPrg⁻¹. Uptake kinetics are fitted by the pseudo-second order reaction rate equation for both beads and foams; in the case of beads the Crank equation also gives good fit of experimental data. Metal is successfully desorbed using 2M HCl/0.05M CaCl2 solutions and the sorbent can be efficiently re-used for a minimum of 5 cycles with negligible decrease in sorption/desorption properties and appreciable concentrating effect (around 8–10 times the initial metal concentration). Tested in continuous mode, the algal foam shows typical breakthrough curves that are fitted by the Yan method; desorption is also efficient and allows under the best conditions to achieve a concentration factor close to 8.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaminaria digitata 3aalgae 3aalginates 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3adesorption 3aequations 3afoams 3agelation 3aion exchange 3aions 3apH 3apraseodymium 3aprotons 3asorbents 3asorption isotherms 0aBrown algae 0aPraseodymium 0aIon-exchange 0aSorption isotherm 0aUptake kinetics 0aBeads 0aFoams 0aBreakthrough columns 0aMetal desorption 0aFTIR 0aSEM-EDX1 aHamza, Mohammed F.1 aVincent, Thierry1 aFaur, Catherine1 aGuibal, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2767-63050 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 504 p.780-789dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245012200168300001800290500001900308500002000327520157300347592002801920650001701948650002501965650001301990650001402003650002202017650001202039651001102051700003102062700007502093700007102168773012202239856007202361852000902433655001202442IND60699605220221120115215.0200620e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069960522DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.33222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiñán‐Rico, Viridiana10aRescue and relocation of benthic organisms during an urban‐port development project: Port of Manzanillo, case study  ap. 1137-1148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study originated with the expansion of the boardwalk within the urban and port area of Manzanillo, México. Prior to civil works related to the placement of tetrapods, surveys of potential sites for the relocation of benthic organisms in alternative areas were carried out. Based on indicators of the physical–chemical environment and biotic factors, nine areas with potential for relocation were evaluated. The areas of greatest potential were associated with environments located away from the influence of the port environment. A total of 13,559 benthic organisms belonging to 68 species associated with three main substratum types (rocky, sandy, and mixed) were collected. There were no differences in the ecological indices between the three substrata. The proximity of the collection area to the influence of port traffic and sources of pollution associated with the physical environment could be an important factor that affects ecological indices and the reduction in the abundance of some protected species and species of commercial interest. The success of collection and relocation processes depends on minimizing possible errors, especially during transportation, when overcrowding, handling, and damage resulting from variable physico‐chemical conditions should be avoided. Through a scheme of actions based on ecological principles, management actions, and civil engineering technology, it was possible to carry out mitigation, conservation, and habitat improvement actions in coastal marine environments exposed to anthropogenic impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adevelopment projects 3ahabitats 3apollution 3aprotected species 3atraffic 3aMexico1 aCruz‐Ramírez, Angélica1 aMichel‐Morfín, Jesús Emilio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9861-33601 aLiñán‐Cabello, Marco A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9930-421X0 tAquatic conservation.g2020 June, v. 30, no. 6 p.1137-1148dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.33223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007200171300001600243520131600259592002801575650001801603650001601621650001501637650001501652650001001667650001501677650001401692650001701706650001201723650002301735773009001758856008101848852000901929655001201938IND60574534520221117033606.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057453452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-016-9717-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristian, Michelle10aProtecting tourism labor? Sustainable labels and private governance  ap. 805-821.  aThis paper examines the application of private governance through certification labels and industry initiatives in the tourism industry. These efforts are sold as a way to achieve decent working conditions for tourism workers who participate in global value chains in the global South. The question at hand is, are these mechanisms an effective way to support tourism labor? Specifically, this research documents two main findings. First, I evaluate the programs through a tourism global value chain approach and demonstrate how tour operators use language about sustainability and the certification of accommodation suppliers for brand product differentiation and marketing. My findings demonstrate that these programs do not support tourism workers. Second, even with certification and recommendations, the standards are limited and do not include measures to protect against precarious employment, gendered divisions of labor, and emotional labor demands. Thus, these initiatives do not fully protect tourism workers. Finally, I argue a new governance research approach focused on workers’ rights and empowerment provides insights into achieving a more equitable international tourism landscape. This has implications for a governance analysis focused on rights and ‘synergistic’ governance strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acertification 3aecolabeling 3aemployment 3agovernance 3alabor 3alandscapes 3amarketing 3asupply chain 3atourism 3aworking conditions0 tGeoJournal.g2017 Aug., v. 82, no. 4 p.805-821dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-016-9717-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245006800177300001800245500000900263520163500272592002801907650002901935650002401964650002301988650002702011650002702038650002202065650001902087650000902106700001802115700001402133773015102147856009602298852000902394655001202403IND60667815220221122140118.0191125e198709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066781522DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100050037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Hur, M.10aVariability of Infiltration in a Field with Surface-sealed Soil  ap. 1299-1302.  aepub  aThe infiltration rates (IR) for water were measured at 30 random sites within a 1-ha field by sprinkler and flood infiltrometers. A portable rainfall infiltrometer was used to measure the infiltration rate under water-drop impact conditions, and double-ring infiltrometers were used to measure IR in flooded conditions. No spatial dependence of the steady-state IR values measured with the two methods was found. The mean steady-state IR measured with the flood infiltrometer was 57.8 mm h⁻¹ with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 41.8%. The mean steady-state IR measured with the sprinkler infiltrometer was 8.6 mm h⁻¹ with a CV of 14.7%. This difference was due to the formation of a soil surface seal from the impact of falling drops. The seal's hydraulic conductivity was much lower and less variable than that of bulk soil. Frequency distributions of the steady-state IRs measured with the two methods were different; that from the double-ring infiltrometer had a small deviation to the left, while that of the sprinkler infiltrometer had a large deviation to the right. The distribution of steady-state sprinkler IR values corresponds with the distribution in the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) in the field, verifying the known dependence between surface seal formation and the soil CEC and ESP relationship. This dependence was not found for the IR values measured by flooding. No correlation was found between the IR values measured by the two methods. Thus, for soils that seal, it is impossible to predict IR under water drops from measurements under flooding conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange capacity 3aexchangeable sodium 3aflooded conditions 3afrequency distribution 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ainfiltration rate 3ainfiltrometers 3arain1 aShainberg, I.1 aMorin, J.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1987 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.1299-1302dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1987.03615995005100050037x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007100172520235600243592002802599650001902627650000802646650001102654650001902665650001102684650001802695650001302713650001102726651001102737653002402748653001402772653002602786653003302812653001702845653001302862700002202875700001902897773009702916856008703013852000903100655001203109IND60767844520221120134722.0220706e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076784452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1187302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, Carlos14aThe role of power-to-gas in the integration of variable renewables  aLimiting the rise in global temperatures requires the rapid, and massive deployment of solutions to reduce carbon emissions at all levels. The development of intermittent renewable energy resources has received significant support from governments, and its production will considerably increase. The introduction of this high electrical production presents some challenges, in particular, the allocation of high production in low consumption periods. One of the most promoted solutions to cope with this challenge is the integration of power-to-gas technologies (P2G). In this area, the European Union and some of its members have presented plans supporting the production and consumption of hydrogen. At the same time, it should be noted that the development strategies for these technologies are largely deployed at the local level. To allow local territories to contribute to the decarbonization of the energy system, national governments are extending the application of their energy policy to local areas. This is the case in France, which over the last decades has adopted laws to extend the application of its energy policy at local level, with the objective of ensuring better, faster deployment of its energy transition and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. As a result, the French regions have targeted objectives for the development of their local energy resources. The SUD Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region (PACA) in southern France, in response to these air, energy, environment, and climate change adaptation responsibilities, has set a target to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. This will involve the massive development of solar photovoltaic production as the region has considerable access to solar resources. The region has also presented a hydrogen plan to support the development of this energy in the region and contribute to national efforts. This study, conducted with TIMESPACA a bottom-up optimization model representing the energy system of the PACA region, analyzes how P2G technologies contribute to the development of solar resources. Results show that P2G technologies are essential for the decarbonization of the regional energy system and the deployment of renewables, that they are required to reach national and global decarbonization objectives, and that they are expected to structure the whole hydrogen chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aFrance 0aLong-term modelling 0aTIMESPACA 0aLow-carbon transition 0aRenewable energy integration 0aPower-to-gas 0aHydrogen1 aSelosse, Sandrine1 aMaïzi, Nadia,0 tApplied energy.g2022 May 01, v. 313 p.118730-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.1187303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012700170500001900297520182600316592002802142650002602170650002802196650001202224650001602236650001002252650002002262650001302282650001302295650001102308650001902319650001902338650001902357650001102376650001102387651002102398651001502419653002902434653003102463653001702494653001702511700001402528700001602542700001502558700001302573700002302586700001702609773011902626856008802745852000902833655001202842IND60716010120221119083852.0210305e20210325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071601012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1430892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Junjun10aMolecular markers for fungal spores and biogenic SOA over the Antarctic Peninsula: Field measurements and modeling results  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiogenic organic aerosols are important components of atmospheric organic aerosols and play vital roles in atmospheric chemistry, global climate, and biogeochemical cycles of carbon. However, studies on biogenic organic aerosols in the vast regions of the Southern Ocean and over the coastal waters of the Antarctic, especially Antarctic Peninsula, are still extremely limited. To understand the concentrations, molecular composition and seasonality of biogenic organic aerosols in Antarctica, atmospheric aerosols were collected at the Palmer Station on the west Antarctic Peninsula experiencing dramatic climate warming. Molecular marker compounds of fungal spores and secondary organic aerosols formed from the photooxidation of isoprene and monoterpene were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Concentrations of sugar alcohols and biogenic SOA tracers both presented seasonal patterns with higher average concentrations in summer (90.7 and 122 pg m⁻³) than in winter (8.88 and 57.2 pg m⁻³). Sugar alcohols and biogenic SOA tracers were predominated by mannitol and isoprene oxidation products. Relative contributions of fungal-spore organic carbon (OC), isoprene-derived secondary OC (SOC) and monoterpene-derived SOC estimated with tracer-based methods were 26.2%, 55.6% and 18.2%, respectively. The observed seasonality of total biogenic SOA and some molecular species at the Antarctic Peninsula was further supported by the results from the global model CESM/IMPACT. Model results also suggest higher biogenic SOA in East Antarctica than that in West Antarctica, which is attributed to the influence of vertical atmospheric circulation. Our results of air-mass trajectory indicate the potential influence of marine emissions on the biogenic organic aerosols over the Antarctic Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aatmospheric circulation 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3afungi 3agenetic markers 3aisoprene 3amannitol 3amodels 3amonoterpenoids 3aorganic carbon 3aphotooxidation 3asummer 3awinter 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aPrimary organic aerosols 0aSecondary organic aerosols 0aFungal spore 0aIsoprene SOA1 aGao, Yuan1 aZhu, Jialei1 aLi, Linjie1 aYu, Shun1 aKawamura, Kimitaka1 aFu, Pingqing0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143089-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1430893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006900172520077500241592002801016650002201044650002901066650002001095653003101115653002801146653001101174653001401185653000701199653001901206653001901225653001401244773011501258856008201373852000901455655001201464IND60735555120221120145605.0220207e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073555512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2021.1020412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiacomello, Stefania12aA new era for plant science: spatial single-cell transcriptomics  aTo achieve a complete understanding of how organisms function, there is a need to study their fundamental unit, the cell, in its spatial context.

Subcanopy vapour fluxes and energy budgets represent key controls on water level and understorey climate but are not well understood. In a permanently flooded forest in south‐eastern Louisiana, USA, an energy balance approach was used to address (a) whether evaporation from floodwater under a forest canopy is solely energy limited and (b) how energy availability was modulated by radiation and changes in floodwater heat storage. A 5‐month continuous measurement period (June–November) was used to sample across seasonal changes in canopy activity and temperature regimes. Over this period, the subcanopy airspace was humid, maintaining saturation vapour pressure for 28% of the total record. High humidity coupled with the thermal inertia of surface water altered both seasonal and diel energy exchanges, including atypical phenomena such as frequent day‐time vapour pressure gradients towards the water surface. Throughout the study period, nearly all available energy was partitioned to evaporation, with minimal sensible heat exchange. Monthly mean evaporation ranged from 0.7 to 1.7 mm/day, peaking in fall when canopy senescence allowed greater radiation transmission; contemporaneous seasonal temperature shifts and a net release of stored heat from the surface water resulted in energy availability exceeding net radiation by 30% in October and November. Relatively stable energy partitioning matches Priestley–Taylor assumptions for a general model of evaporation in this ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aenergy balance 3aevaporation 3aforest canopy 3aheat transfer 3ahumidity 3alowland forests 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avapor pressure 3avapors 3aLouisiana1 aReba, Michele L.1 aEdwards, Brandon L.1 aKeim, Richard F.0 tHydrological processes.g2017 July 30, v. 31, no. 16 p.2860-2871dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0885-60877nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/57629563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.112273Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Allen_et_al-2017-Hydrological_Processes.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03817naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010600177300001300283500001500296520195800311592002802269650001402297650001602311650001402327650001202341650001202353650001402365650001702379650001102396650001902407650003002426650000902456650001602465650001902481650001402500650002602514650001202540650002002552650002502572650001402597651001302611651001002624653001602634653000902650653001702659653002602676653002402702700002002726700002502746700002002771700002702791700001702818700002002835700002102855700002302876700002202899700002202921773012002943856008303063852000903146655001203155IND60584509420221118110835.0190412e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058450942DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2017.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenriques, Ana Margarida10aAves polyomavirus 1 in ara chloroptera and eclectus roratus with disclosure of full genomic sequences  ap. 4-10.  a2019-12-06  aAves polyomavirus 1 (APyV) is the causative agent of acute disease in birds and causes high mortality rates in nestlings. Infections have been reported worldwide in a significant number of caged bird species, such as parrots, caiques, budgerigars, lovebirds, and macaws. However, the number of complete viral sequences available in public databases is scarce, especially those with associated clinical histories. In this study, the clinical, pathological, epidemiological, and molecular characteristics of 2 APyV strains detected in Portugal are described. In the autumn of 2015, a 2-month-old female green-winged macaw (Ara chloroptera) from a small breeder died with signs of dehydration, weight loss, and depression, raising the suspicion of polyomavirus infection. Histopathological analysis revealed lesions compatible with APyV infection, and the presence of polyomavirus in several organs was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. From the cohabitants tested (n = 14), 1 eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus), which was more than 1-year-old, was also APyV DNA-positive. The full genomic sequences of the 2 strains were obtained and found identical, suggesting a single introduction in the premises and the occurrence of subsequent infections by the same virus. When compared with sequences of other APyVs available in public databases, high nucleotide similarity percentages were obtained, confirming the close genetic relationship among polyomaviruses worldwide. Interestingly, strain APV7, detected in a white-bellied parrot in 2008 in Japan, was the closest strain to those isolated in this report. Attempts to isolate the virus in eggs and cell lines failed. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by the Bayesian method to determine the phylogenetic classification of the macaw and parrot strains. Both clustered into group V, together with other strains from different bird species with no host or spatial-temporal relationships being observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphylogeny 3abudgerigars 3aAgapornis 3aviruses 3afemales 3adatabases 3aacute course 3aautumn 3aPolyomaviridae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aeggs 3aweight loss 3ahistopathology 3amortality 3agenetic relationships 3aparrots 3aBayesian theory 3anucleotide sequences 3anestlings 3aPortugal 3aJapan 0apsittacines 0aAPyV 0aPolyomavirus 0aphylogenetic analysis 0aAves polyomavirus 11 aFagulha, Teresa1 aBarros, Silvia Carla1 aRamos, Fernanda1 aDuarte, Margarida Dias1 aLuís, Tiago1 aCarvalho, Paulo1 aMendonça, Paula1 aMonteiro, Madalena1 aCraveiro, Hélder1 aFevereiro, Miguel0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2018 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.4-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000103x1557-50637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2017.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007400161300001600235520120000251592002801451650002501479650002101504650001501525650001101540650001001551650001301561650001701574653002201591653001101613653003101624653001501655700005501670700001501725700001501740700001301755700001601768700002801784700002001812700005101832773012501883856008302008852000902091655001202100IND60597083620221119205905.0200628e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059708362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.07.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yu10aThree-dimensional carbon architectures for electrochemical capacitors  ap. 529-545.  aThree-dimensional (3D) carbon-based materials are emerging as promising electrode candidates for energy storage devices.

Despite the broad distribution of this species across South America, its low population density and the spatial isolation of its populations may compromise its response to the expected climate change. Using species distribution models, we increased our knowledge of the historical, current, and future spatial distribution patterns of this species. Considering past [last glacial maximum (LGM) and middle Holocene], current, and future climatic scenarios for the South American extent, we used MaxEnt, random forest (RF), and support vector machine methods to model the distribution of V. spectrum over time and identify/quantify climatically stable areas. We observed that our models achieved good performances for all algorithms, especially for RF. The spatial distribution patterns obtained from the models made it possible to identify areas where V. spectrum was more stable over time. From the LGM to the current and future scenarios, the overall balance is the loss of areas in the species distribution range. By using multitemporal analyses, we may be able to identify repeated historical patterns where some conservation areas may be effective in the future if the spatial patterns of distribution are similar to past distributions.

This research focuses on demonstrating a process for effectively delineating redox transition zones at a site with historical contamination. An 18.3 meter core was collected, subsampled, and preserved under anoxic conditions to maintain its original redox status. To ensure a high vertical resolution, sampling increments of 5.08 cm in length were analyzed for elemental concentrations with X-ray fluorescence (XRF), sediment pH, sediment oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), total volatile organic carbon (TVOC) concentration in the sample headspace, and abundant bacteria (16S rRNA sequencing). Over the core's length, gradients observed ranged from 3.74 to 8.03 for sediment pH, −141.4 mV to +651.0 mV for sediment ORP, and from below detection to a maximum of 9.6 ppm TVOC concentration (as chlorobenzene) in the headspace. The Fe and S gradients correlated with the presence of Fe and S reducing bacteria. S concentrations peaked in the Upper Zone and Zone 1 where Desulfosporosinus was abundant, suggesting precipitation of iron sulfide minerals. In Zone 2, Fe concentrations decreased where Geobacter was abundant, potentially resulting in Fe reduction, dissolution, and precipitation of minerals with increased solubility compared to the Fe(III) minerals. Using complementary geochemical and microbial data, five redox transition zones were delineated in the core collected. This research demonstrates a systematic approach to characterizing redox transition zones in a contaminated environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfosporosinus 3aGeobacter 3aX-radiation 3achlorobenzene 3afluorescence 3aheadspace analysis 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aredox potential 3asediments 3asolubility 3asulfides 3avolatile organic compounds 0aReactive iron mineral coatings 0aIron cycling 0aScreening analyses 0aRedox transition zone1 aHua, Han1 aBurns, Frank1 aFennell, Donna1 aDyer, James1 aLandis, Richard1 aAxe, Lisa0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 25, v. 762 p.143105-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1431053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013600169300001600305520130400321592002801625650002301653650002501676650001001701650003001711650001401741651001101755651002801766653001501794653002401809653001801833653001801851653001501869653003201884653001801916653001601934700002001950700001801970700002001988700002102008700002502029700002102054773014102075856008302216852000902299655001202308IND60527242120221121122746.0190415e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052724212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crvi.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukhikh, Natalia10aGenetic and morphological heterogeneity among populations of Eurytemora affinis (Crustacea: Copepoda: Temoridae) in European waters  ap. 197-206.  aOur understanding of the systematics of the Eurytemora affinis complex developed at a fast pace over the last decades. Formerly considered as a complex of cryptic species, it is now believed to include three valid species: E. affinis, Eurytemora carolleeae, and Eurytemora caspica. American and European representatives have been studied in detail with respect to fine-scale geographic distribution, levels of genetic subdivision, evolutionary and demographic histories. Morphological components have been less explored. In this study, an analysis of the phylogeny and morphology of E. affinis was done, with a special focus on European populations. A total of 447 individuals of E. affinis from Europe were analyzed with genetic tools and 170 individuals according to morphological criteria. Common and new morphological and genetic features were analyzed. For this, we used ML and Bayesian methods to analyze the bar coding mt-DNA gene cytochrome c oxidase I subunit. Both genetic and morphological analyses showed high heterogeneities among the E. affinis populations from Europe. As a result, three local populations of E. affinis in Western Europe, including the European part of Russia, were established. Their genetic and morphological heterogeneity corresponded to the subspecies level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEurytemora affinis 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3aphylogeny 3aRussia 3aWestern European region 0aEurytemora 0aCopepod systematics 0aMorphometrics 0aPhylogenetics 0aEurytemora 0aSystématique de copépodes 0aMorphométrie 0aPhylogénie1 aSouissi, Anissa1 aSouissi, Sami1 aWinkler, Gesche1 aCastric, Vincent1 aHoll, Anne-Catherine1 aAlekseev, Victor0 tComptes rendus.g2016 May,  June, v. 339, no. 5-6 p.197-206dElsevier Masson SASaAcadémie des scienceswJournal:12404x1631-06917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245019900204506007600403520078800479592002801267506003701295650000901332650001601341650001901357650001401376650001901390650001101409650002201420650002801442700002001470700002301490700001901513700002101532700002201553700002301575700002201598700002401620773012101644856007301765852000901838655001201847IND60650187520221207070133.0190709e20170825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065018752DNAL7 a10.3390/nu90909362doi7 aPMC56226962pmcid7 a288411652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNeill, Shalene H.12aA Research Communication Brief: Gluten Analysis in Beef Samples Collected Using a Rigorous, Nationally Representative Sampling Protocol Confirms That Grain-Finished Beef Is Naturally Gluten-Free  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKnowing whether or not a food contains gluten is vital for the growing number of individuals with celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Questions have recently been raised about whether beef from conventionally-raised, grain-finished cattle may contain gluten. To date, basic principles of ruminant digestion have been cited in support of the prevailing expert opinion that beef is inherently gluten-free. For this study, gluten analysis was conducted in beef samples collected using a rigorous nationally representative sampling protocol to determine whether gluten was present. The findings of our research uphold the understanding of the principles of gluten digestion in beef cattle and corroborate recommendations that recognize beef as a naturally gluten-free food.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3aceliac disease 3adigestion 3aexpert opinion 3agluten 3agluten-free foods 3arepresentative sampling1 aCifelli, Amy M.1 aRoseland, Janet M.1 aBelk, Keith E.1 aWoerner, Dale R.1 aGehring, Kerri B.1 aSavell, Jeffrey W.1 aBrooks, J.

The latitudinal distributions of Mn and Fe were very similar; however, the concentration in the dissolved phase was lower, whereas that in the particulate phase was higher in the northern regime. The higher percentage of Fe than Mn that was associated with particles resulted in a two-order of magnitude higher particle–water partition coefficient for Fe, Kd(Fe), than that for Mn, Kd(Mn). The removal fluxes of Mn and Fe could be estimated by multiplying the particulate ²³⁴Th removal flux with the Mn/²³⁴Th and Fe/²³⁴Th ratios in suspended particles, which ranged from 0.1 to 3.8mmolm⁻²d⁻¹ for Mn, and from 3.4 to 194.5mmolm⁻²d⁻¹ for Fe. Residence times ranged from 1 to 20days for Mn and Fe were estimated in the nearshore.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3airon 3amanganese 3aparticles 3apartition coefficients 3aradionuclides 3athorium 3awater pollution 3aTaiwan1 aJiann, Kuo-Tung1 aWen, Liang-Saw1 aTsai, Jing-Ru1 aSheu, David D.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2011 May, v. 62, no. 5 p.1081-1087dElsevier Ltdx0025-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.01.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002400161245007300185300001800258500000900276520076500285592002801050650001601078650001701094650001401111650001501125650002101140650001901161650001301180650001801193650001201211650001901223650001801242651002701260651001101287773015101298856009601449852000901545655001201554IND60667815720221122140106.0191125e198609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066781572DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1986.03615995005000050052x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllbrook, Robert F.10aEffect of Skid Trail Compaction on a Volcanic Soil in Central Oregon  ap. 1344-1346.  aepub  aA skid trail in the Ochoco National Forest, Oregon, was examined to assess the degree of compaction that had occurred as a result of traffic during log harvesting. The soil, classified as a Lithic Cryorthent is a sandy loam derived from rhyolitic and tuffaceous colluvium. Measurements of bulk density and shear strength were made at five positions across the trail and two locations in undisturbed soil. Cores were taken to measure bulk density, moisture content, and moisture retention. Compaction resulted in increases in bulk density of up to 25%, in shear vane strength up to 157%, and in cone index up to 220% along with a decrease in pore space > 10 µm of 69%.

This article reviews the current evidence regarding maternal and early childhood nutritional exposures and their role in epigenetic aging. RECENT FINDINGS : Maternal and early life consumption of diets higher in fiber, antioxidants, polyphenols, B vitamins, vitamin D, and ω-3 fatty acids is associated with slower epigenetic aging. Conversely, diets higher in glycemic load, fat, saturated fat, and ω-6 fatty acids demonstrate a positive association with epigenetic aging. Maternal and early life nutrition directly and indirectly influences epigenetic aging via changes in one-carbon metabolism, cardiometabolic health, and the microbiome. Clinical trials are warranted to determine the specific foods, dietary patterns, and dietary supplements that will normalize or lower epigenetic aging across the life course.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3achildhood 3aepigenetics 3aglycemic load 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3apolyphenols1 aSkilton, Michael R.0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2022 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.318-328dSpringer USwJournal:21580x2161-33117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-022-00402-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024004300134040001800177100001600195245012500211300001600336520088700352592002801239650002401267650001101291650001201302650001501314650001201329650002101341650001401362650000701376650002701383650002501410650001101435650001601446650001601462653002901478653003601507653001101543653001901554653001601573700001501589700005201604773010601656856008701762852000901849655001201858IND60536494620221122112111.0190409e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053649462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.0202doi7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.0202chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yunqin10aSolid-state anaerobic co-digestion of spent mushroom substrate with yard trimmings and wheat straw for biogas production  ap. 468-474.  aSpent mushroom substrate (SMS) is a biomass waste generated from mushroom production. About 5kg of SMS is generated for every kg of mushroom produced. In this study, solid state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) of SMS, wheat straw, yard trimmings, and their mixtures was investigated at different feedstock to effluent ratios. SMS was found to be highly degradable, which resulted in inhibition of SS-AD due to volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation and a decrease in pH. This issue was addressed by co-digestion of SMS with either yard trimmings or wheat straw. SS-AD of SMS/yard trimmings achieved a cumulative methane yield of 194L/kg VS, which was 16 and 2 times higher than that from SMS and yard trimmings, respectively. SS-AD of SMS/wheat straw obtained a cumulative methane yield of 269L/kg VS, which was 23 times as high as that from SMS and comparable to that from wheat straw.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3amethane 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3apH 3aspent mushroom compost 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastes 3awheat straw 3ayard wastes 0aSpent mushroom substrate 0aSolid-state anaerobic digestion 0aBiogas 0aYard trimmings 0aWheat straw1 aGe, Xumeng1 aLi, Yebo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6198-52240 tBioresource technology.g2014 Oct., v. 169 p.468-474dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007100165300001400236520082200250592002801072650002301100650001401123650001101137650001901148650001601167650001701183650001001200650001501210650002301225651001101248653001701259653001401276653002201290653001401312653002001326700001701346700002001363700001801383773012101401856008301522852000901605655001201614IND60584509820221118110913.0190412e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058450982DNAL7 a10.1053/j.jepm.2017.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ju-Chi10aParacloacal gland carcinoma in a sugar glider (petaurus breviceps)  ap. 36-40.  aA male sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) was presented to the National Taiwan University Veterinary hospital for repeated self-mutilation of the cloacal region. After correction of husbandry deficiencies and medical management of the lesion, the condition improved but a pericloacal mass was found. Surgical removal of the mass resolved the self-mutilation, and a dorsal paracloacal gland carcinoma was diagnosed on histopathological examination. Straining to defecate and a pericloacal mass could indicate neoplasia in sugar gliders. A tumor should be differentiated from chronic inflammation, infection, paracloacal gland impaction, and hyperplasia. Surgical removal is recommended as a treatment for paracloacal gland carcinoma in sugar gliders. Further monitoring is suggested after surgical removal of the tumor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetaurus breviceps 3acarcinoma 3acloaca 3ahistopathology 3ahyperplasia 3ainflammation 3amales 3amonitoring 3aveterinary clinics 3aTaiwan 0asugar glider 0amarsupial 0aparacloacal gland 0acarcinoma 0aself-mutilation1 aYu, Pin-Huan1 aLiu, Chen-Hsuan1 aChi, Chau-Hwa0 tJournal of exotic pet medicine.g2018 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.36-40dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000103x1557-50637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2017.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009000157300002000247500001900267520080100286592002801087650001301115650002001128650001301148650001401161650001201175650002101187650001301208650001301221650001901234700001501253700001901268700001801287700002501305773012501330856007401455852000901529655001201538IND60699605920221120115158.0200620e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069960592DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00619j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Snigdha13aAn aluminium fluorosensor for the early detection of micro-level alcoholate corrosion  ap. 23245-23249.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe detection of the dry alcoholate corrosion of aluminium is vital to design a corrosion resistive aluminium alloy for the storage and transportation of biofuel (methanol or ethanol). By synthesizing an Al³⁺ fluorescent probe operable in an alcoholic medium, we quantified the alcoholate corrosion in terms of the fluorometrically estimated soluble alkoxide (Al(OR)₃) generation under nitrogen atmosphere. With time, a linear increase in corrosion with specific aluminium dissolution rate constants ∼2.0 and 0.9 μg per day per cm² were estimated for aluminium and Al-7075 alloy, respectively. During open atmosphere monitoring, the adsorbed moisture converted small extent of Al(OR)₃ to the insoluble Al(OH)₃ at the alloy surface which retarded the alcoholate corrosion appreciably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum alloys 3abiofuels 3acorrosion 3aethanol 3afluorescent dyes 3amethanol 3anitrogen 3atransportation1 aDas, Sanju1 aMajumder, Rini1 aRay, Ambarish1 aParui, Partha Pratim0 tRSC advances.g2020 June 17, v. 10, no. 39 p.23245-23249dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00619j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245009500215300001900310506007600329520101400405592002801419506003701447650000801484650001201492650003101504650001001535650002101545650001201566650001701578650002201595650002901617653001801646653001701664653002201681653001001703653001001713653001601723653001101739700001901750700001601769700002101785700002501806700001901831700002701850700001501877700002101892700002001913700001901933700002201952700002701974700002502001700002502026773010802051856008402159852000902243655001202252IND60678662020221207052542.0191214e20191205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067866202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2019.09.0102doi7 aPMC69007372pmcid7 a315880222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholls, Thomas J.10aDinucleotide Degradation by REXO2 Maintains Promoter Specificity in Mammalian Mitochondria  ap. 784-796.e6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOligoribonucleases are conserved enzymes that degrade short RNA molecules of up to 5 nt in length and are assumed to constitute the final stage of RNA turnover. Here we demonstrate that REXO2 is a specialized dinucleotide-degrading enzyme that shows no preference between RNA and DNA dinucleotide substrates. A heart- and skeletal-muscle-specific knockout mouse displays elevated dinucleotide levels and alterations in gene expression patterns indicative of aberrant dinucleotide-primed transcription initiation. We find that dinucleotides act as potent stimulators of mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro. Our data demonstrate that increased levels of dinucleotides can be used to initiate transcription, leading to an increase in transcription levels from both mitochondrial promoters and other, nonspecific sequence elements in mitochondrial DNA. Efficient RNA turnover by REXO2 is thus required to maintain promoter specificity and proper regulation of transcription in mammalian mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3aheart 3aknockout mutants 3amammals 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3atranscription initiation 0atranscription 0aRNA turnover 0aoligoribonuclease 0aREXO2 0amtDNA 0adegradosome 0aPOLRMT1 aSpåhr, Henrik1 aJiang, Shan1 aSiira, Stefan J.1 aKoolmeister, Camilla1 aSharma, Sushma1 aKauppila, Johanna H.K.1 aJiang, Min1 aKaever, Volkhard1 aRackham, Oliver1 aChabes, Andrei1 aFalkenberg, Maria1 aFilipovska, Aleksandra1 aLarsson, Nils-Göran1 aGustafsson, Claes M.0 tMolecular cell.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 76, no. 5 p.784-796.e6dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245005100171300001600222520105200238592002801290650002601318650002901344650002301373650001301396650003501409650001301444650002501457650001201482650001101494653001401505653001501519653001701534653001501551653001601566653002401582653001001606653001501616653001601631653001801647653001701665653001601682653002801698653001101726773013501737856008301872852000901955655001201964IND60527242720221121122802.0190415e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052724272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crvi.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchacherer, Joseph10aBeyond the simplicity of Mendelian inheritance  ap. 284-288.  aElucidating the underlying rules that govern the phenotypic diversity observed in natural populations is an old but still unaccomplished goal in biology. In 1865, Gregor Mendel paved the way for the dissection of the underlying genetic basis of traits by setting out to understand the principles of heredity. To date, we still lack a global overview of the spectrum and continuum existing between Mendelian and complex traits within any natural population. In this respect, we recently performed a species-wide survey of Mendelian traits across a large population of isolates using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By analyzing the distribution and the inheritance patterns of the trait, we have clearly shown that monogenic mutations can display a significant, variable, and continuous expressivity across different genetic backgrounds. Our study also demonstrated that combining the elegancy of both classical genetics and high-throughput genomics is more than valuable to dissect the genotype–phenotype relationship in natural populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMendelian inheritance 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agenetic background 3agenomics 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3amutation 3aphenotypic variation 3asurveys 3ayeasts 0aGenotypes 0aPhenotypes 0aExpressivity 0aPenetrance 0aInheritance 0aMonogenic mutations 0aYeast 0aGénotypes 0aPhénotypes 0aExpressivité 0aPénétrance 0aHérédité 0aMutations monogéniques 0aLevure0 tComptes rendus.g2016 July,  Aug., v. 339, no. 7-8 p.284-288dElsevier SASaAcadémie des scienceswJournal:12404x1631-06917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2016.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245013300173500001900306520108900325592002801414650001601442650001801458650001601476650001701492650001401509650001401523650001901537650001701556650002001573650001201593650001501605650001201620650001801632650001701650650001601667650001201683650001301695650001601708650002501724653001601749653001801765653001901783653002801802700002201830700002501852700003401877700002501911700002301936700003101959700002101990700002802011700002102039773013002060856008402190852000902274655001202283IND60735556020221120145528.0210610e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073555602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1026972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Grazielle10aExtraction of bioactive compounds from Curcuma longa L. using deep eutectic solvents: In vitro and in vivo biological activities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, deep eutectic solvents (DES-based menthol and cholinium chloride) and the ethanol, temperature, and times were selected to extract bioactive compounds from the rhizome, leaves, and flowers Curcuma longa L., using ultrasound-assisted extraction.

Although H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub) is well known as a prerequisite histone mark for COMPASS activity, how H2Bub activates COMPASS remains unclear. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of an extended COMPASS catalytic module (CM) bound to the H2Bub and free nucleosome. The COMPASS CM clamps onto the nucleosome disk-face via an extensive interface to capture the flexible H3 N-terminal tail. The interface also sandwiches a critical Set1 arginine-rich motif (ARM) that autoinhibits COMPASS. Unexpectedly, without enhancing COMPASS-nucleosome interaction, H2Bub activates the enzymatic assembly by packing against Swd1 and alleviating the inhibitory effect of the Set1 ARM upon fastening it to the acidic patch. By delineating the spatial configuration of the COMPASS-H2Bub-nucleosome assembly, our studies establish the structural framework for understanding the long-studied H2Bub-H3K4me histone modification crosstalk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalytic activity 3acryo-electron microscopy 3ahistone code 3ahistones 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3anucleosomes 3aprototypes 3atranscription (genetics) 0aepigenetics 0achromatin 0aCOMPASS 0aMLL 0aH3K4 0aubiquitin 0ahistone crosstalk 0anucleosome1 aShi, Hui1 aLeonen, Calvin1 aKang, Jianming1 aChatterjee, Champak1 aZheng, Ning0 tMolecular cell.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 76, no. 5 p.712-723.e4dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245007300208300002000281520131000301592002801611596008601639596009801725596009801823596009801921596009802019596012802117596008202245596006102327650002202388650001602410650001102426650001202437650001702449700001902466700005402485700001802539700005602557700005502613700005502668773012502723856008402848852000902932655001202941IND60779492220221116152042.0220609e20211208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077949222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c003012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadke, Shreyash1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0964-484110aEmerging Chalcogenide Thin Films for Solar Energy Harvesting Devices  ap. 10170-10265.  aChalcogenide semiconductors offer excellent optoelectronic properties for their use in solar cells, exemplified by the commercialization of Cu(In,Ga)Se₂- and CdTe-based photovoltaic technologies. Recently, several other chalcogenides have emerged as promising photoabsorbers for energy harvesting through the conversion of solar energy to electricity and fuels. The goal of this review is to summarize the development of emerging binary (Sb₂X₃, GeX, SnX), ternary (Cu₂SnX₃, Cu₂GeX₃, CuSbX₂, AgBiX₂), and quaternary (Cu₂ZnSnX₄, Ag₂ZnSnX₄, Cu₂CdSnX₄, Cu₂ZnGeX₄, Cu₂BaSnX₄) chalcogenides (X denotes S/Se), focusing especially on the comparative analysis of their optoelectronic performance metrics, electronic band structure, and point defect characteristics. The performance limiting factors of these photoabsorbers are discussed, together with suggestions for further improvement. Several relatively unexplored classes of chalcogenide compounds (such as chalcogenide perovskites, bichalcogenides, etc.) are highlighted, based on promising early reports on their optoelectronic properties. Finally, pathways for practical applications of emerging chalcogenides in solar energy harvesting are discussed against the backdrop of a market dominated by Si-based solar cells.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcNational Research Foundation Singaporedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001381  a61722402cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a61725401cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a61904058cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a91833302cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2019YFE0118100cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a19XD1421300cShanghai Academic/Technology Research Leaderdhttps://doi.org/NA  aTZ2018004cScience Challenge Projectdhttps://doi.org/NA 3acommercialization 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3amarkets 3asolar energy1 aHuang, Menglin1 aChen, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8706-53461 aTay, Ying Fan1 aChen, Shiyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4039-85491 aTang, Jiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2574-29431 aWong, Lydia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-17450 tChemical reviews.g2021 Dec. 08, v. 122, no. 11 p.10170-10265dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c003013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001200283520163500295592002801930650001601958650001001974650001101984650002001995650002102015650002002036650002602056650002202082650002702104650002502131650001202156650001902168650002002187651001902207651001502226651001402241651002202255651001202277651001302289651001002302700002002312700002302332700002902355700002702384700001502411700003502426773009002461856008102551852000902632655001202641IND60574535720221117034336.0170901e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057453572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-017-1942-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrese, Lothar10aGenetic diversity of Patellifolia patellaris from the Iberian Peninsula, a crop wild relative of cultivated beets  ap. 187.  aThe genetic diversity of Patellifolia patellaris has been investigated to generate information required for the organisation of a systematic genetic resources conservation action combining the best elements of the ex situ and in situ conservation concept. To this end, ten occurrences of the species were sampled on the Iberian Peninsula in Portugal and Spain. A total of 271 individuals was analysed using 24 microsatellite markers. The factorial analysis separated the material into two occurrences from Portugal, two occurrences sampled east of Gibraltar and six occurrences from the eastern Spanish coast. The pairwise genetic distance between occurrences and the complementary compositional differentiation among occurrences were calculated. The genetic distance values were used to construct an Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean tree, which can be separated into four equidistant clusters. Two clusters are located in Portugal and two further clusters in Spain. The factorial analysis as well as the genetic distance and differentiation analysis indicate that the two occurrences from Portugal are clearly genetically different from the Spanish group of occurrences. Both occurrences have low population sizes and are therefore highly endangered. In situ conservation actions are urgently required for both occurrences. Further investigations are needed to organise better informed conservation actions for P. patellaris, namely to study genetic relationships between occurrences on the Spanish mainland and occurrences distributed on the Canary Islands, Madeira and Cape Verde Islands as well as in Morocco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3abeets 3acoasts 3afactor analysis 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3ain situ conservation 3aislands 3aplant breeding 3apopulation size 3aCanary Islands 3aCape Verde 3aGibraltar 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMorocco 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aBülow, Lorenz,1 aNachtigall, Marion1 aRubio Teso, María Luisa1 aDuarte, Maria Cristina1 aRey, Elena1 aIriondo Alegría, José María0 tEuphytica.g2017 Aug., v. 213, no. 8 p.187-187dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-1942-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009700156300001800253500002000271520169900291592002801990650004302018650001502061650002602076650003402102650001402136650001102150650001202161650001802173650001702191650001402208650001402222650001102236650002002247651001202267700002102279700001902300700002302319773010202342856007302444852000902517655001202526IND60576296520221118234309.0170731e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057629652DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.141592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Eva L.10aHigh gene flow despite opposite chirality in hybrid zones between enantiomorphic door snails  ap. 3998-4012.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe studied differentiation and geneflow patterns between enantiomorphic door‐snail species in two hybrid zones in the Bucegi Mountains (Romania) to investigate the effects of intrinsic barriers (complications in copulation) and extrinsic selection by environmental factors. A mitochondrial gene tree confirmed the historical separation of the examined populations into the dextral Alopia livida and the sinistral Alopia straminicollis in accordance with the morphological classification, but also indicated gene flow between the species. By contrast, a network based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) markers revealed local groups of populations as units independent of their species affiliation. Admixture analyses based on AFLP data showed that the genomes of most individuals in the hybrid zones are composed of parts of the genomes of both parental taxa. The introgression patterns of a notable fraction of the examined markers deviated from neutral introgression. However, the patterns of most non‐neutral markers were not concordant between the two hybrid zones. There was also no concordance between non‐neutral markers in the two genomic clines and markers that were correlated with environmental variables or markers that were correlated with the proportion of dextral individuals in the populations. Neither extrinsic selection by environmental factors nor intrinsic barriers resulting from positive frequency‐dependent selection of the prevailing coiling direction were sufficient to maintain the distinctness of A. straminicollis and A. livida. Despite being historically separated units, we conclude that these taxa now merge where they come into contact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acopulation 3aenvironmental factors 3afrequency dependent selection 3agene flow 3agenome 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amitochondria 3amountains 3aphylogeny 3asnails 3astereoisomerism 3aRomania1 aNeiber, Marco T.1 aWalther, Frank1 aHausdorf, Bernhard0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Aug., v. 26, no. 15 p.3998-4012dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.141593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245018700169500001900356520102400375592002801399650001801427650001201445650001201457650001101469650001701480650001201497650002701509650001201536653002601548653002301574653001101597653002801608653002501636700001701661700002101678700002501699773013001724856008401854852000901938655001201947IND60735556320221120145601.0210610e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073555632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1027002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoens, Lucie G.10aEffect of pulsed electric field and mild thermal processing on texture-related pectin properties to better understand carrot (Daucus carota) texture changes during subsequent cooking  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPulsed electric field (PEF) and/or mild thermal (60 °C) processing distinctly affect the texture degradation of carrot tissues during subsequent cooking. The impact of PEF and/or mild thermal processing on texture-related pectin properties was studied in terms of pectin extractability, degree of methylesterification (DM) and Ca²⁺ crosslinking in carrot cortex and vascular tissue. In the case of cortex tissue, the treatments significantly (α = 0.05) reduced the extractability of pectin in water and alkali; the pectin DM and ionic crosslinking were not affected. In the case of vascular tissue, mainly the PEF and combination treatment reduced the extractability of pectin in water and alkali, reduced the pectin DM (approx. 60 to 50%), and improved its ionic crosslinking. Addition of Ca²⁺ ions may help preserve the texture of both tissues during subsequent cooking. Further research is necessary to investigate the effect of the treatments on covalent pectin crosslinking, especially in cortex tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3acalcium 3acarrots 3acortex 3acrosslinking 3apectins 3apulsed electric fields 3atexture 0aPulsed electric field 0aThermal processing 0aPectin 0aCell wall fractionation 0aCalcium crosslinking1 aHuang, Wenzi1 aVan Loey, Ann M.1 aHendrickx, Marc E.G.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2021 June, v. 70 p.102700-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1027003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245009700163300001800260520067800278592002800956650001100984650001700995650001701012700002901029700001601058700001901074773013401093856007501227852000901302655001201311IND60780106220221120232956.0220615e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078010622DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc01720b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorath, Anthony J.12aA Ni(COD)₂-free approach for the synthesis of high surface area porous aromatic frameworks  ap. 6841-6844.  aPorous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are attractive materials for applications where high surface area and material stability govern performance. Most of the highest surface area PAFs are synthesized using poorly scalable and costly methods involving super-stoichiometric bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)Nickel(0) (Ni(COD)₂). This communication describes a general approach for the synthesis of high surface area PAFs that does not use isolated Ni(COD)₂.

This study focused on their solar-mediated degradation to understand better their fate in aquatic environment, for the realistic concentrations in the range of 1 μg/L. Results showed that both antibiotics (ABs) are degradable by simulated sunlight (1 kW/m²), with half-lives of 32 and 93 h in ultrapure water, for LIN and TED, respectively. LIN showed similar photolytic behaviour in pure solution and in surface water, whereas sunlight enhanced the degradation of LIN in pure solutions, but not in surface water. Structure elucidation by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry provided information about seven transformation products for LIN and five for TED. The morpholinyl-ring was identified as the target site for most transformation reactions of LIN. TED was prone to oxidation and cleavage of the oxazolidinone ring. Results of a growth inhibition test on Bacillus subtilis exposed to UV light showed antibacterial efficacy of transformation products of LIN and no significant efficacy of degradation products of TED for the concentration range of 100 μg/L-10 mg/L of parent compounds. Photolytically treated solutions of the ABs maintained their inhibitory effect on the bioluminescence of Aliivibrio fischeri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aVibrio fischeri 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic environment 3abioluminescence 3aenvironmental factors 3ahalf life 3alighting 3alinezolid 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3asolar radiation 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 0aPhotolysis 0aTransformation products 0aOxazolidinone antibiotics 0aLC-HRMS 0aSimulated sunlight1 aAbendschön, Patrick1 aTölgyesi, László1 aHorn, Harald1 aBorowska, Ewa0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.125111-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1251113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008700164300001800251500000900269520182300278592002802101650001602129650001502145650002502160650002202185650001302207650002102220650001402241650000902255650001602264650002402280650000702304650001502311650001902326650001502345650002102360650001802381650002002399650002002419650002102439650002002460650002102480650002902501651002602530700001502556700001702571700001602588700001402604773019302618856008102811852000902892655001202901IND60666342820221119005824.0191028e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066634282DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2001.3031023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, R.O.10aRelationships between Biosolids Treatment Process and Soil Phosphorus Availability  ap. 1023-1033.  aepub  aLaws mandating phosphorus (P)-based nutrient management plans have been passed in several U.S. Mid-Atlantic states. Biosolids (sewage sludge) are frequently applied to agricultural land and in this study we evaluated how biosolids treatment processes and biosolids P tests were related to P behavior in biosolids-amended soils. Eight biosolids generated by different treatment processes, with respect to digestion and iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and lime addition, and a poultry litter (PL), were incubated with an Elkton silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Endoaquult) and a Suffolk sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult) for 51 d. The amended soils were analyzed at 1 and 51 d for water-soluble phosphorus (WSP), iron-oxide strip–extractable phosphorus (FeO-P), Mehlich-1 P and pH. The biosolids and PL were analyzed for P, Fe, and Al by USEPA 3050 acid–peroxide digestion and acid ammonium oxalate, Mehlich-1, and Mehlich-3 extractions. Biosolids and PL amendments increased extractable P in the Suffolk sandy loam to a greater extent than in the Elkton silt loam throughout the 51 d of the incubation. The trend of extractable WSP, FeO-P, and Mehlich-1 P generally followed the pattern: [soils amended with biosolids produced without the use of Fe or Al] > [PL and biosolids produced using Fe or Al and lime] > [biosolids produced using only Fe and Al salts]. Mehlich-3 P and the molar ratio of P to [Al + Fe] by either the USEPA 3050 digestion or oxalate extraction of the biosolids were good predictors of changes in soil-extractable P following biosolids but not PL amendment. Therefore, the testing of biosolids for P availability, rather than total P, is a more appropriate tool for predicting extractable P from the biosolids-amended soils used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEndoaquults 3aHapludults 3aMehlich-3 phosphorus 3aagricultural land 3aaluminum 3aammonium oxalate 3abiosolids 3airon 3airon oxides 3anutrient management 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apoultry manure 3aprediction 3asandy loam soils 3asewage sludge 3asilt loam soils 3asoil amendments 3atotal phosphorus 3awaste treatment 3awater solubility 3awater soluble phosphorus 3aEastern United States1 aSims, J.T.1 aDentel, S.K.1 aCoale, F.J.1 aMah, J.T.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2001 May, v. 30, no. 3 p.1023-1033dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2001.3031023x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006900165300001600234520163200250592002801882650002701910650001201937650001501949650001601964650001901980650002501999650003802024650003002062650000802092650001302100650001102113650001002124700001802134700001402152700001802166700001402184773010002198856008102298852000902379655001202388IND60521422720221117225038.0160529e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052142272DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-015-0437-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohoutova, D.10aAnti-Outer membrane protein C antibodies in colorectal neoplasia  ap. 295-299.  aSporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) represents an enormous problem worldwide. Large intestinal microbiota play an important role in the colorectal carcinogenesis. The aim of the study was to investigate anti-Outer membrane protein C (anti-OmpC) antibodies, aimed at porin C, which is embedded in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, in patients with colorectal adenoma (CRA), CRC and controls. The study included 22 patients with CRA (11 men, 11 women, aged 26–79, mean 65 ± 12), 11 patients with CRC (9 men, 2 women, aged 50–83, mean 66 ± 11) and 45 controls, blood donors (24 men, 21 women, aged 20–58, mean 38 ± 10). Serum anti-OmpC antibodies were investigated by means of ELISA. Values of 0–20 U/mL were considered to be negative; values >25 U/mL were assessed as positive. A total of 9/11 (82 %) patients with CRC had positive anti-OmpC antibodies. Anti-OmpC antibodies were negative or grey-zone in 37/45 (82 %) controls. Serum anti-OmpC were found to be significantly higher in patients with CRC (median 42.4, interquartile range (IQR) 22.2) compared to controls (median 18.3, IQR 12.4), p < 0.001. No statistically significant difference in anti-OmpC was found between controls (median 18.3, IQR 12.4) and CRA patients (median 17.7, IQR 16.5), p = 0.326. Anti-OmpC were significantly higher in patients with CRC (median 42.4, IQR 22.2) compared to patients with CRA (median 17.7, IQR 16.5), p = 0.011. Positivity of anti-OmpC antibodies was found in patients with CRC, which supports the contribution of gram-negative large intestinal microbiota to the pathogenesis of CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aadenoma 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acarcinogenesis 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amen 3apatients 3aporins 3awomen1 aDrahosova, M.1 aCihak, M.1 aMoravkova, P.1 aBures, J.0 tFolia microbiologica.g2016 July, v. 61, no. 4 p.295-299dSpringer Netherlandsx0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-015-0437-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245011100179300001400290520097800304592002801282650001801310650001101328650002401339650001701363650001301380650001801393650001301411650001801424650002401442650001201466650001401478653002201492653001901514653001701533653002601550653002501576700002001601700002501621700002401646700002901670700002701699700006201726773010401788856008701892852000901979655001201988IND60526690320221117232644.0190409e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052669032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutinas, Apostolis A.10aTechno-economic evaluation of a complete bioprocess for 2,3-butanediol production from renewable resources  ap. 55-64.  aThis study presents the techno-economic evaluation of 2,3-butanediol (BDO) production via fermentation using glycerol, sucrose and sugarcane molasses as carbon sources. Literature-cited experimental data were used to design the fermentation stage, whereas downstream separation of BDO was based on reactive extraction of BDO employing an aldehyde to convert BDO into an acetal that is immiscible with water. The selected downstream process can be used in all fermentations employed. Sensitivity analysis was carried out targeting the estimation of the minimum selling price (MSP) of BDO at different plant capacities and raw material purchase costs. In all cases, the MSP of BDO is higher than 1$/kg that is considered as the target in order to characterize a fermentation product as platform chemical. The complex nutrient supplements, the raw material market price and the fermentation efficiency were identified as the major reasons for the relatively high MSP observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprocessing 3acarbon 3adietary supplements 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3amarket prices 3amolasses 3araw materials 3arenewable resources 3asucrose 3asugarcane 0aBioprocess design 0a2,3-Butanediol 0aFermentation 0aMinimum selling price 0aSensitivity analysis1 aYepez, Bernardo1 aKopsahelis, Nikolaos1 aFreire, Denise M.G.1 ade Castro, Aline Machado1 aPapanikolaou, Seraphim1 aKookos, Ioannis K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9339-42020 tBioresource technology.g2016 Mar., v. 204 p.55-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014200155520129900297592002801596650001101624650001101635650001601646650001301662650001101675650001901686650001701705650001901722650001601741650001201757651001001769700001601779700002001795773012601815856007301941852000902014655001202023IND60651821620221120092614.0190712e20160705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065182162DNAL7 a10.3390/su80706282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guang10aUrban Heat Island Simulations in Guangzhou, China, Using the Coupled WRF/UCM Model with a Land Use Map Extracted from Remote Sensing Data  aThe Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with an Urban Canopy Model (UCM) was used for studying urban environmental issues. Because land use data employed in the WRF model do not agree with the current situation around Guangzhou, China, the performance of WRF/UCM with new land-use data extracted from Remote Sensing (RS) data was evaluated in early August 2012. Results from simulations reveal that experiments with the extracted data are capable of reasonable reproductions of the majority of the observed temporal characteristics of the 2-m temperature, and can capture the characteristics of Urban Heat Island (UHI). The “UCM_12” simulation, which employed the extracted land-use data with the WRF/UCM model, provided the best reproduction of the 2-m temperature data evolution and the smallest minimum absolute average error when compared with the other two experiments without coupled UCM. The contributions of various factors to the UHI effect were analyzed by comparing the energy equilibrium processes of “UCM_12” in urban and suburban areas. Analysis revealed that energy equilibrium processes with new land use data can explain the diurnal character of the UHI intensity variation. Furthermore, land use data extracted from RS can be used to simulate the UHI.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aenergy 3aheat island 3aland use 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3asuburban areas 3atemperature 3aweather 3aChina1 aZhao, Lihua1 aMochida, Akashi0 tSustainability.g2016 July 05, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80706283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100006000193245008600253300001600339506007600355520105400431592002801485506003701513650001501550650001501565650001501580650002001595650001701615650001901632650001301651650000701664650001401671650002701685650001901712653003701731653003301768653005201801653004701853653005101900653002301951653001301974653002501987653002402012653002002036700001902056700002102075700002002096773010002116856008702216852000902303655001202312IND60526090020221207121405.0190402e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052609002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.0342doi7 aPMC49118882pmcid7 a272836432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchweitz, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0107-323110aQuercetin solubilisation in bile salts: A comparison with sodium dodecyl sulphate  ap. 356-364.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo understand the bioaccessibility of the flavonoid quercetin we studied its interaction with bile salt micelles. The environmental sensitivity of quercetin’s UV–visible absorption spectrum gave information about quercetin partitioning. Two quercetin absorption peaks gave complementary information: Peak A (240–280nm) on the intermicellar phase and Peak B (340–440nm) on the micellar phase. Thus, by altering pH, we showed that only non-ionised quercetin partitions into micelles. We validated our interpretation by studying quercetin’s interaction with SDS micelles. Pyrene fluorescence and the quercetin UV–visible spectra show that the adsorption site for pyrene and quercetin in bile salt micelles is more hydrophobic than that for SDS micelles. Also, both quercetin and pyrene reported a higher critical micelle concentration for bile salts than for SDS. Our method of using a flavonoid as an intrinsic probe, is generally applicable to other lipophilic bioactives, whenever they have observable environmental dependent properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3abile salts 3abioavailability 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3apH 3aquercetin 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asolubilization 0aQuercetin (PubChem CID: 5280804) 0aPyrene (PubChem CID: 104853) 0aSodium glycodeoxycholate (PubChem CID: 3035026) 0aSodium taurocholate (PubChem CID: 3035026) 0aSodium dodecyl sulphate (PubChem CID: 3423265) 0aQuercetin’s pKa1 0aMicelles 0aUV–visible spectra 0aPyrene fluorescence 0aBioavailability1 aKroon, Paul A.1 aRich, Gillian T.1 aWilde, Peter J.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 211 p.356-364dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04000naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013700168300001400305520160900319592002801928650001101956650001801967650003101985650002402016650001002040650001902050650001402069650002002083650001702103650001202120650001902132650001002151650002002161650002302181650000902204650001602213650001302229650002002242650001602262650004302278650004402321650001702365650002902382650003202411650001502443650001102458653003002469653003202499653001902531653001602550653001602566653000802582653000902590653001102599653001002610653001002620653000902630653001002639653000702649653000802656653000802664653000802672653000802680653000802688653000802696653001002704653000902714653000702723653000802730653000802738653000902746653000802755700001702763700002102780700003202801700002302833700006302856773008402919856008603003852000903089655001203098IND60633541020221117223457.0210820e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063354102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDizaji, Rana10aInduction of two independent immunological cell death signaling following hemoglobinuria -induced acute kidney injury: In vivo study  ap. 23-31.  aThe main important clinical signs in acute kidney injury (AKI) after sever Hemiscorpius lepturus envenomation in patients is associated with proteinuria, hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Unfortunately, our limited knowledge of molecular cell death mechanism in H. lepturus induced AKI restricts the development of desirable therapeutics. So, in the present study, the potential role of necroptosis and ferroptosis in H. lepturus induced AKI were investigated in male albino mice. The animals were administrated by SC injection of venom (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg₎ based on LD₅₀ determination. After 1 and 7 days, urinalysis, stereological assessments and gene expression of Ngal, Tnf-α, Tlr-4, Ripk3, Mlkl and Acsl4 were evaluated by real time PCR. Our data revealed that upregulation of renal Ngal expression is associated with the gene over expression of Tnf-α, Tlr-4, Ripk3 and Mlkl in venom treated kidneys. We observed that the Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was increased in dose-dependent manner similar to Acsl4 gene over expression suggesting a main role of ferroptosis in hemoglobinuria mediated AKI following envenomation. Moreover, transcriptional enhancement of Tlr-4and Tnf-α receptor can cause phosphorylation of Ripk3-Mlkl complex, collapse of membrane potential and DAMPs release which intensified the inflammation cytokines in kidney. Taken together, it supposes co-existence of two separate pathways of regulated necrosis and inflammatory environment provides a promising outlook in prevention and management of hemoglobinuria induced AKI following envenomation in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3adose response 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahemoglobinuria 3ahemolysis 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3alethal dose 50 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amembrane potential 3amice 3anecroptosis 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aproteinuria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurinalysis 3avenoms 0aAcute kidney injury (AKI) 0aHemiscorpius lepturus venom 0aHemoglobinuria 0aNecroptosis 0aFerroptosis 0aAKI 0aNgal 0aTnf-α 0aTlr-4 0aRipk3 0aMlkl 0aAcsl4 0aAA 0aLPO 0aROS 0aMDA 0aPCT 0aDCT 0aUPR 0aNADPH 0aPUFA 0aAA 0aTBA 0aTMP 0aLD50 0aGSH1 aSharafi, Ali1 aPourahmad, Jalal1 aAbdollahifar, Mohammad-Amin1 aVatanpour, Hossein1 aHosseini, Mir-Jamal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4469-94880 tToxicon.g2019 May, v. 163 p.23-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245015100190300001600341520161800357592002801975650001402003650002402017650002202041650002002063650002002083650002002103650001402123650002302137650001702160650002302177650001802200650004302218650002102261650001402282650004402296650002502340650006702365650003202432650001102464650002602475650003302501650002202534650006002556650001502616650001202631651001002643700001902653700001902672700001602691700001902707700002002726700002102746773011202767856008102879852000902960655001202969IND50060531420221116153551.0141111e20130213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006053142DNAL7 a232289162pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Seedi, Hesham R.14aThe traditional medical uses and cytotoxic activities of sixty-one Egyptian plants: Discovery of an active cardiac glycoside from Urginea maritima  ap. 746-757.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants from the Sinai desert are widely used in traditional Bedouin medicine to treat a range of conditions including, cancers, and may thus be useful sources of novel anti-tumor compounds. Information on plants used in this way was obtained through collaboration with Bedouin herbalists. AIM OF THE STUDY: To document the traditional uses of 61 species from 29 families of Egyptian medicinal plants and to investigate their biological activity using a cytotoxicity assay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MeOH extracts of the 61 plant species investigated were dissolved in 10% DMSO and their cytotoxic activity was evaluated. The extracts were tested in duplicate on three separate occasions at three different concentrations (1, 10 and 100μg/ml) against human lymphoma U-937 GTB. The most active extract was subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation using HPLC and LC/ESI–MS to isolate and identify its active components. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The most potent extracts were those from Asclepias sinaica, Urginea maritima, Nerium oleander and Catharanthus roseus, followed by those from Cichorium endivia, Pulicaria undulate and Melia azedarach. Literature reports indicate that several of these plants produce cardiac glycosides. Bioassay-guided fractionation of alcoholic U. maritima extracts led to the isolation of a bioactive bufadienolide that was subsequently shown to be proscillaridin A, as determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy. This result demonstrates the value of plants used in traditional medicine as sources of medicinally interesting cytotoxic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsclepias 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aCichorium endivia 3aDrimia maritima 3aMelia azedarach 3aNerium oleander 3aPulicaria 3acardiac glycosides 3acytotoxicity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afractionation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atraditional medicine 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProscillaridinxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aU937 Cells 2aDrimia. 0aEgypt1 aBurman, Robert1 aMansour, Ahmed1 aTurki, Zaki1 aBoulos, Loutfy1 aGullbo, Joachim1 aGöransson, Ulf,0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Feb. 13, v. 145, no. 3 p.746-757dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04157naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012800168300001500296500001500311520231500326592002802641650001802669650001002687650001202697650001202709650001202721650000902733650002102742650001802763650001202781650002302793650001202816650001902828650001202847650001802859650002602877650001702903650002202920650001502942650002002957650001602977650001802993650001903011650001403030650001903044650001303063653001903076653001803095653000903113653002503122653001203147653001203159653001803171700001503189700001203204700001403216700001603230700001503246773012903261856008403390852000903474655001203483IND60543805720221120200559.0190412e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054380572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2015.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastías, J.M.10aEffect of ohmic heating on texture, microbial load, and cadmium and lead content of Chilean blue mussel (Mytilus chilensis)  ap. 98-102.  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of ohmic heating (OH) on the texture, microbial load, and cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) content was evaluated in Chilean blue mussel (Mytilus chilensis) at shucking and subsequent canning. Mussel samples were processed by OH and blanching (BLAN) at 50±1°C, 70±1°C and 90±1°C for shucking and then canning at 115°C for 20min. The Cd and Pb content in fresh mussels was 2.47±0.18μgg−1 and 5.26±0.55μgg−1 dry weight (dw). The greatest reduction in Cd content was reached at 90±1°C by OH with 1.67±0.06μgg−1 (dw) and 1.69±0.08μgg−1 (dw) by BLAN. At the same temperature, the Pb content was reduced to 4.18±0.24μgg−1 dw for OH and 4.14±0.30μgg−1 dw for BLAN. The cutting strength of fresh samples (21.35±2.44N) significantly decreased in samples processed by OH (15.65±1.36N) at 90±1°C compared with BLAN samples (20.41±3.16N) at the same temperature. The initial mean count for mesophilic aerobic microorganisms and Enterobacteriaceae was 3.8log cfu/g and 2.5log cfu/g, respectively. The mesophilic aerobic microorganism count was reduced by 1.7 logarithmical units, while Enterobacteriaceae counts were reduced to undetectable levels by OH at 90±1°C.High temperature short time (HTST) processes rely on rapid convection heat transfer and are thus well suited to liquid foods. But, they are, however, limited in application to particulates since, for particles more than a couple of millimeters thick, the processing time is insufficient for heat to transfer to the center to give sterility. Ohmic heating is an emerging technology and very promising in food industries. It is a thermal process in which heat is generated internally in food and acts as a resistance to the flow of alternating electric current. This type of treatment prevents overheating by producing less deterioration in food components. It is a rapid procedure that allows food to conserve its natural properties; microorganisms and enzymes are also inactivated. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the effect of Ohmic heating on mechanical properties, microbial load, Cd and Pb content in the opening and subsequent canning of Chilean blue mussel (Mytilus chilensis). This information could be used for the seafood industries in order to improve thermal heating processes in mussels.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood spoilage 3afoods 3amussels 3aenzymes 3acanning 3alead 3aelectric current 3afish industry 3atexture 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3acadmium 3amicrobial load 3acutting 3aohmic heating 3amechanical properties 3aparticulates 3aMytilus chilensis 3aconvection 3aflow resistance 3atemperature 3afood industry 3amicroorganisms 3ablanching 3aMytilus edulis 3ashelling 0aMicrobial load 0aOhmic heating 0aLead 0aChilean blue mussels 0aCadmium 0aTexture 0aheat transfer1 aMoreno, J.1 aPia, C.1 aReyes, J.1 aQuevedo, R.1 aMuñoz, O.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2015 Aug., v. 30 p.98-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2015.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009700171300001600268520087700284592002801161650002201189650001201211650001201223650001101235650001301246650001801259650001901277650004401296650001301340650001701353650001801370650001701388650001601405653001201421653001701433653001901450653000801469700002601477700002401503700002001527700002601547700001801573773010601591856008701697852000901784655001201793IND60526690520221117232632.0190409e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052669052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMafu, Lihle D.10aStructural and chemical modifications of typical South African biomasses during torrefaction  ap. 192-197.  aTorrefaction experiments were carried out for three typical South African biomass samples (softwood chips, hardwood chips and sweet sorghum bagasse) to a weight loss of 30wt.%. During torrefaction, moisture, non-structural carbohydrates and hemicelluloses were reduced, resulting in a structurally modified torrefaction product. There was a reduction in the average crystalline diameter (La) (XRD), an increase in the aromatic fraction and a reduction in aliphatics (substituted and unsubstituted) (CPMAS 13C NMR). The decrease in the aliphatic components of the lignocellulosic material under the torrefaction conditions also resulted in a slight ordering of the carbon lattice. The degradation of hemicelluloses and non-structural carbohydrates increased the inclusive surface area of sweet sorghum bagasse, while it did not change significantly for the woody biomasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abagasse 3abiomass 3acarbon 3ahardwood 3ahemicellulose 3alignocellulose 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asoftwood 3asurface area 3asweet sorghum 3atorrefaction 3aweight loss 0aBiomass 0aTorrefaction 0aCP-MAS 13C NMR 0aXRD1 aNeomagus, Hein W.J.P.1 aEverson, Raymond C.1 aCarrier, Marion1 aStrydom, Christien A.1 aBunt, John R.0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Feb., v. 202 p.192-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245008900188300001400277520209300291592002802384650001602412650002002428650001502448650001502463650001402478650001602492650001602508650001702524650001102541650001302552650001902565650001502584653002902599653001602628653001602644653001602660653002302676653002302699700003202722700002702754700002302781700004102804700007102845773008402916856008603000852000903086655001203095IND60633541120221117223348.0210820e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063354112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, Rita Carolina Figueiredo10aThrombin generation test for evaluating hemostatic effects of Brazilian snake venoms  ap. 36-43.  aSnake venoms as well as their components have been tested worldwide to find new molecules for prophylaxis and treatment of several pathologies or even for diagnostic purposes. It is widely known that snake venoms contain enzymes and non-enzymatic proteins that interfere with hemostasis leading to hemorrhage or even thrombosis. The treatment of snake envenoming and the development of new drugs. The thrombin generation test (TGT) is a highly sensitive tool for investigation of hemostatic changes, overlapping with existing coagulometric techniques. The aim of this study was to use TGT to evaluate in vitro hemostatic changes caused by venom of Brazilian snakes B. jararacussu, B. alternatus, B. moojeni and C. durissus terrificus in a normal pool of platelet-poor plasma, comparing results to those obtained by the classical coagulation assays, at the same concentrations of venom. B. moojeni venom showed to be more hypercoagulable, with a greater ability to activate coagulation, evidenced by increased values of Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP), even in the reactions in which the triggering reagent (tissue factor) was not added. On the other hand, the lowest ETP values were observed in plasma incubated with C. durissus terrificus venom. As a new finding of great importance, all venoms at the same concentrations assessed by TGT did not promote changes in a pool of platelet-poor plasma by classic coagulometric assays, such as prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), whose results were within the reference range. Thus, TGT showed to be more sensitive than the coagulometric assays to evaluate the hemostatic effect of venom components in vitro. Our preliminary results indicate a potential role for TGT in improving the laboratory investigation of hemostatic changes due to snakebite. In addition, elucidation of hemostatic changes induced by different Brazilian snake venoms related to hypocoagulability or hypercoagulability represents an important approach to improving the treatment of snake envenoming and the development of new drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3adisease control 3ahemorrhage 3ahemostasis 3anew drugs 3aprothrombin 3asnake bites 3asnake venoms 3asnakes 3athrombin 3athromboplastin 3athrombosis 0aThrombin generation test 0aSnake venom 0aBothrops sp 0aCrotalus sp 0aHemostatic changes 0aHypercoagulability1 aRios, Danyelle Romana Alves1 aLeite, Paula Mendonça1 aAlves, Luan Carlos1 aMagalhães, Henrique Pimenta Barroso1 aCarvalho, Maria das Graças1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1669-33020 tToxicon.g2019 May, v. 163 p.36-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2019.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008700169300001600256520073700272592002801009650001601037650002501053650000701078650001101085653001901096653002401115653003101139653001701170653002701187700001701214700001401231700001301245700005801258773010601316856008701422852000901509655001201518IND60526690620221117232807.0190409e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052669062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Hongyan10aPerformance of sodium bromate as cathodic electron acceptor in microbial fuel cell  ap. 220-225.  aThe potential of using sodium bromate as a cathodic electron acceptor in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was determined in this study.

The MFC performance improved with increasing sodium bromate concentration and decreasing catholyte pH. The maximum voltage output (0.538V), power density (1.4908Wm−3), optimal open circuit potential (1.635V), coulombic efficiency (11.1%), exchange current density (0.538Am−3) and charge transfer resistance (4274.1Ω) were obtained at pH 3.0 and 100mM sodium bromate. This work is the first to confirm that sodium bromate could be used as an electron acceptor in MFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apH 3asodium 0aSodium bromate 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aCathodic electron acceptor 0aCatholyte pH 0aOpen circuit potential1 aYang, Huimin1 aLiu, Xian1 aZhao, Yu1 aLiang, Zhenhai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2338-29400 tBioresource technology.g2016 Feb., v. 202 p.220-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001600262500001500278520137000293592002801663650001401691650002101705650001601726650002801742650001301770650001501783650001101798650001301809650001401822650001901836650002001855650003401875653002601909700002001935700002201955700002301977700002602000773010002026856008102126852000902207655001202216IND60521423020221117224835.0160529e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052142302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-015-0440-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyazanova, Lubov10aManganese tolerance in yeasts involves polyphosphate, magnesium, and vacuolar alterations  ap. 311-317.  a2019-12-06  aBasidiomycetous and ascomycetous yeast species were tested for manganese tolerance. Basidiomycetous Cryptococcus humicola, Cryptococcus terricola, Cryptococcus curvatus and ascomycetous Candida maltosa, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kuraishia capsulata, Lindnera fabianii and Sacharomyces cerevisiae were able to grow at manganese excess (2.5 mmol/L), while the growth of basidiomycetous Rhodotorula bogoriensis was completely suppressed. The lag phase duration increased and the exponential growth rate decreased at manganese excess. The increase of cell size and enlargement of vacuoles were characteristics for the cells grown at manganese excess. The alterations in inorganic polyphosphate content and cellular localization were studied. L. fabianii, K. capsulata, C. maltosa, and Cr. humicola accumulated the higher amounts of inorganic polyphosphates, while Cr. terricola and Cr. curvatus demonstrated no such accumulation. The polyphosphate content in the cell wall tested by DAPI staining increased in all species under the study; however, this effect was more pronounced in Cr. terricola and Cr. curvatus. The accumulation of Mg²⁺ in the cell wall under Mn²⁺ excess was observed in Cr. humicola, Cr. curvatus and Cr. terricola. The accumulation of polyphosphate and magnesium in the cell wall was supposed to be a factor of manganese tolerance in yeasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aVanrija humicola 3aRhodotorula 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3astaining 3acell walls 3ayeasts 3avacuoles 3amagnesium 3apolyphosphates 3aCandida maltosa 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 0aCryptococcus humicola1 aZvonarev, Anton1 aRusakova, Tatiana1 aDmitriev, Vladimir1 aKulakovskaya, Tatiana0 tFolia microbiologica.g2016 July, v. 61, no. 4 p.311-317dSpringer Netherlandsx0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-015-0440-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010800167500002200275520049800297592002800795650001300823650002300836650001900859653003000878653003300908653004000941653002900981700001401010700001301024700001401037700001601051700001501067773006401082856008401146852000901230655001201239IND60580970520221122055826.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058097052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Lingling13aAn Improved Pfitzinger Reaction: Eco-efficient Synthesis of Quinaldine-4-carboxylates by TMSCl-Mediated  aPre-press version  aWe report herein an improved Pfitzinger reaction for the synthesis of highly functionalized quinaldines from 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, isatins and alcohols mediated by TMSCl.

A novel biogas-pH automation control strategy using the combined gas-liquor phase monitoring was developed for an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) treating high COD (27.53g·L−1) starch wastewater. The biogas-pH strategy was proceeded with threshold between biogas production rate >98Nml·h−1 preventing overload and pH>7.4 preventing underload, which were determined by methane production kinetics and pH titration of methanogenesis slurry, respectively. The OLR and the effluent COD were doubled as 11.81kgCOD·kgVSS−1·d−1 and halved as 253.4mg·L−1, respectively, comparing with a constant OLR control strategy. Meanwhile COD removal rate, biogas yield and methane concentration were synchronously improved to 99.1%, 312Nml·gCODin−1 and 74%, respectively. Using the biogas-pH strategy, AnMBR formed a “pH self-regulation ternary buffer system” which seizes carbon dioxide and hence provides sufficient buffering capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aautomation 3abiogas 3abioreactors 3abuffering capacity 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical oxygen demand 3amethane 3amethane production 3amonitoring 3apH 3aslurries 3astarch 3atitration 3awastewater 0aAnaerobic membrane bioreactor 0aHigh COD wastewater 0aOnline monitoring 0aAutomation control strategy 0aAlkalinity1 aLiu, Jibao1 aSui, Qianwen1 aWei, Yuansong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0900-74120 tBioresource technology.g2016 Mar., v. 203 p.62-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012700171300001600298520156800314592002801882650002401910650001601934650002301950650000901973650002401982650002502006650001102031650002402042650002402066650002202090650001702112650001102129650001902140650001202159650001702171650001402188653002302202653002102225653002002246653002602266653001802292700002402310700001602334700001402350773013002364856008402494852000902578655001202587IND60543806020221120213509.0190412e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054380602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2015.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBermejo-Prada, A.10aEffect of hyperbaric storage at room temperature on pectin methylesterase activity and serum viscosity of strawberry juice  ap. 170-176.  aHyperbaric storage at room temperature (HS-RT) has been lately proposed as a promising technology for food preservation. In this paper, the effect of HS-RT on pectin methylesterase (PME) activity and viscosity decay was evaluated in strawberry juice. To do so, two complementary studies were performed: one in crude strawberry PME extract and the other in strawberry juice. The results showed that, at the assayed conditions, the catalytic activity of the PME extract was not affected by pressure up to 200MPa. Moreover, in strawberry juices, no pressure PME inactivation was observed during storage, at 0.1–200MPa and 20°C, for 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15days. HS-RT enhanced viscosity decay, especially at the beginning of storage, although no increase in PME activity was observed in this phase. Therefore, chemical and/or enzymatic reactions, other than PME de-esterification, could be pressure enhanced and affect pectin characteristics and serum viscosity.Hyperbaric storage at room temperature (HS-RT) can involve substantial energy savings in food preservation. As food is preserved with no temperature control, the only energy consumption is produced at the beginning of storage, during compression. HS-RT could be applied in different sections of the cold chain in industrialized countries but also in developing countries in which the continuous supply of electric energy is difficult. However, before industrial implementation, much more research is needed to clarify the effect of the storage pressure on mechanisms implied in food quality degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3ablood serum 3acatalytic activity 3acold 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenzymatic reactions 3afood preservation 3afood quality 3ajuices 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3astrawberries 3aviscosity 0aHyperbaric storage 0aStrawberry juice 0aSerum viscosity 0aPectin methylesterase 0aHigh pressure1 aSegovia-Bravo, K.A.1 aGuignon, B.1 aOtero, L.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2015 Aug., v. 30 p.170-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001300158245009700171300001400268520137900282592002801661650001801689650001801707650003401725650001201759650003901771650000901810650002401819650002701843650002101870653001101891653002001902653001701922653001701939700001801956700001701974700002101991700002102012700002002033700001302053700001702066773010502083856009302188852000902281655001202290IND60540542620221118025611.0190318e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054054262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yan10aThyroid hormone inhibits the proliferation of piglet Sertoli cell via PI3K signaling pathway  ap. 86-94.  aAccumulating researches show that thyroid hormone (TH) inhibits Sertoli cells (SCs) proliferation and stimulates their functional maturation in prepubertal rat testis, confirming that TH plays a key role in testicular development. However, the mechanism under the T3 regulation of piglet SC proliferation remains unclear. In the present study, in order to investigate the possible mechanism of T3 on the suppression of SC proliferation, the expression pattern of TRα1 and cell cycle–related molecules, effect of T3 on SC proliferation, and the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway on the T3-mediated SC proliferation in piglet testis were explored. Our results demonstrated that TRα1 was expressed in all tested stages of SCs and decreased along with the ages. T3 inhibited the proliferation of SCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and T3 treatment downregulated the expressions of cell cycling molecules, such as cyclinA2, cyclinD1, cyclinE1, PCNA, and Skp2, but upregulated the p27 expression in SCs. Most importantly, the suppressive effects of T3 on SC proliferation seemed dependent on the inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and pre-stimulation of PI3K could enhance such suppressive effects. Together, our findings demonstrate that TH inhibits the proliferation of piglet SCs via the suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSertoli cells 3adose response 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3apiglets 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atesticular development 3athyroid hormones 0aPiglet 0aThyroid hormone 0aSertoli cell 0aPI3K pathway1 aYang, WeiRong1 aLuo, HongLin1 aWang, Xianzhong,1 aChen, ZhongQiong1 aZhang, JiaoJiao1 aWang, Yi1 aLi, Xiaomin,0 tTheriogenology.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 83, no. 1 p.86-94dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013100165500002200296520088500318592002801203650001701231650001401248650001401262650001301276650002301289650002301312650002001335650001001355650002101365650004401386650002201430653001801452653001801470653002301488653002701511653002701538653002201565700001401587700001701601700001901618700001601637773006401653856008401717852000901801655001201810IND60580970720221122055902.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058097072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Siwen10aEutypellazines N−S, new thiodiketopiperazines from a deep sea sediment derived fungus Eutypella sp. with anti-VRE activities  aPre-press version  aChemical investigation of a deep sea sediment derived fungus Eutypella sp.

Their structures were elucidated on the basis of the extensive NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis, including the ECD data for the determination of absolute configuration. The structures of eutypellazines N-P (1-3) were characteristic of unique spirocyclic skeletons, while eutypellazines N-O bearing a spirocyclic tetrahydrobenzothiophene motif were found from wide type fungus for the first time. The biogenetic generation of the spirocyclic skeletons was postulated. Compounds 3-5 exhibited inhibitory effects against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), suggesting that they may be the potential inhibitors toward drug resistant pathogenic bacteria after the structural modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aEutypella 3aalkaloids 3abacteria 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adrug resistance 3afungi 3amarine sediments 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 0aMarine fungus 0aEutypella sp. 0aEutypellazines N-S 0aBiogenetic postulation 0aStructural elucidation 0aAnti-VRE activity1 aLiu, Dong1 aShao, Zongze1 aProksch, Peter1 aLin, Wenhan0 tTetrahedron letters.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2017.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013600172300001600308520094700324592002801271650002301299650001901322650002701341650002501368650002101393650001501414650002001429650001001449650002501459650001301484650001401497650002501511653003201536653002401568653001801592653003501610653001901645700001701664700001601681700002001697700002501717700001901742700002501761700001901786773010601805856008701911852000901998655001202007IND60526690920221117232833.0190409e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052669092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOon, Yoong-Ling10aSynergistic effect of up-flow constructed wetland and microbial fuel cell for simultaneous wastewater treatment and energy recovery  ap. 190-197.  aThis study demonstrated a successful operation of up-flow constructed wetland–microbial fuel cell (UFCW–MFC) in wastewater treatment and energy recovery.

The average influent of COD, NO3− and NH4+ were 624mg/L, 142mg/L, 40mg/L, respectively and their removal efficiencies (1day HRT) were 99%, 46%, and 96%, respectively. NO3− removal was relatively higher in the closed circuit system due to lower dissolved oxygen in the system. Despite larger electrode spacing, the voltage outputs from Anode 2 (A2) (30cm) and Anode 3 (A3) (45cm) were higher than from Anode 1 (A1) (15cm) as a result of insufficient fuel supply to A1. The maximum power density and Coulombic efficiency were obtained at A2, which were 93mW/m3 and 1.42%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3abioelectricity 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrodes 3aenergy recovery 3afuels 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrates 3asynergism 3awastewater treatment 0aUp-flow constructed wetland 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aMembrane-less 0aActivated carbon as electrodes 0aBioelectricity1 aOng, Soon-An1 aHo, Li-Ngee1 aWong, Yee-Shian1 aDahalan, Farrah Aini1 aOon, Yoong-Sin1 aLehl, Harvinder Kaur1 aThung, Wei-Eng0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Mar., v. 203 p.190-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008600166300001800252520084000270592002801110650001701138650001801155650001901173650001901192650002501211650002301236650001501259700001801274700001501292700001801307700001801325773013601343856008301479852000901562655001201571IND60699930620221118204153.0200904e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069993062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-019-00898-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haigang10aEffect of an antioxidant on the life cycle of wood flour/polypropylene composites  ap. 1435-1443.  aThis study assessed the life cycle of biocomposites with antioxidants by repeated processing. The effects of antioxidants on the life cycle of wood flour/polypropylene (PP) composites were determined by analyzing their mechanical and thermal properties. The composites were repeatedly processed for seven times with pelletizing and extruding. An antioxidant, pentaerythritoltetrakys 3-(3,5-ditert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, was used. The mechanical strength of the biocomposites decreased after reprocessing. Fourier transformed infrared analysis showed that thermo-oxidative aging occurred during reprocessing. The thermal performance of the resulting composites decreased because of reprocessing. Wood flour/PP has a long lifetime and antioxidants can slow the thermo-oxidative and mechanical degradation during reprocessing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiocomposites 3apolypropylenes 3apropionic acid 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal properties 3awood flour1 aZhang, Jingfa1 aFu, Haitao1 aWang, Weihong1 aWang, Qingwen0 tJournal of forestry research.g2020 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.1435-1443dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000106x1007-662X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-00898-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03983naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245016700167500001900334520235300353592002802706650002102734650002502755650002002780650001502800650002302815650001502838650001202853650000902865650001702874650001702891650001802908650001102926650001002937650002302947650002102970650001502991650001503006651001303021653003503034653002103069653002003090653003003110653002703140700003503167700002103202700002103223773011603244856008403360852000903444655001203453IND60709455320221122143204.0201206e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070945532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1064762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetros, Welay10aEffectiveness of water-saving techniques on growth performance of Mango (Mangifera Indica L.) Seedlings in Mihitsab-Azmati Watershed, Rama Area, Northern Ethiopia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEven though mango productivity in Ethiopia is low due to moisture stress, there is no report on how such constraint could alleviate using Cocoon water-saving technology. Cocoon is small water reservoir technology which uses for plant growth in dry season. The objectives of this study were to introduce and evaluate effectiveness of water-saving techniques on mango seedlings survival and growth in Mihitsab-Azmati watershed, northern Ethiopia. In this experiment, five treatments of water-saving techniques with mango seedlings were evaluated. These were: Cocoon sprayed by tricel (T1), Cocoon painted by used engine oil (T2), Cocoon without tricel and oil (T3), manually irrigated seedlings (T4) and mango seedlings planted during rainy season (T5). The survival and growth performance of mango seedlings were recorded at six months and one-year after transplanting. Data on plant survival, height, number of leaves per plant, shoot length, stem diameter and crown width were subjected to analysis of variance and t-test. There were significant differences in the treatment effects on mango seedlings transplanted survival, plant height, number of leaves per plant, shoot length, stem diameter and crown width measured at six months and one-year after transplanting. The lowest survival rate (20 %) was found during both data collection time in T5. Six months after transplanting, the highest growth parameters were measured from T1 whereas the lowest was from T5. However, one-year after transplanting, the highest growth parameters were measured from T3. Plant heights increments between the two measurement periods for T3, T2, T1, T4 and T5 were 45.1, 38.5, 24.8, 9.8 and 7.0 cm, respectively; indicating that T3 performed better than the other treatments. The t-test on mean differences between the same growth parameter measured at 12 and six months after transplanting also showed significant differences. The Cocoon water-saving technology was superior in improving mango seedlings survival and growth in the study area. This study generalized that Cocoon seems promising, sustainable and highly scalable with mango seedlings at large-scale in the study area conditions. However, this technology should not be assumed to perform uniformly well in all environmental conditions and with all tree species before demonstrated on a pilot study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aanalysis of variance 3adata collection 3adry season 3agrowth performance 3airrigation 3amangoes 3aoils 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3asurvival rate 3at-test 3atrees 3awater conservation 3awater reservoirs 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aEthiopia 0aCocoon water-saving technology 0aGrowth parameter 0aMoisture stress 0aMihitsab-Azmati watershed 0aWater-saving technique1 aTesfahunegn, Gebreyesus Brhane1 aBerihu, Mulugeta1 aMeinderts, Johan0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 243 p.106476-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1064763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01576naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245021000163300001600373520032800389592002800717650002300745650001100768650001200779650001200791650001200803650001100815650001400826650001300840650000900853653001500862653002400877653001800901700002600919700001900945773013900964856007801103852000901181655001201190IND60521423520221117224958.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052142352DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1973-5-6012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Wolfgang10aSchwingunsspektren von Tetrafulminato-Komplexen von Pt(II), Pd(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II) und Hg(II) / Vibrational Spectra of Tetrafulminate Complexes of Pt(II), Pd(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II)  ap. 229-233.  aThe IR and Raman spectra of the anionic fulminate complexes [M (CNO) ₄] ²- (M =.

One potentially high-quality feed water for desalination is saline groundwater (SGW) from coastal aquifers, which has lower fouling propensity than seawater. This study examines the effect of pumping SGW from a phreatic coastal aquifer on fresh groundwater, particularly on the dynamics of the fresh–saline water interface (FSI). Initially, we constructed a 3D finite-element model of a phreatic coastal aquifer by using the FEFLOW software, which solves the coupled variable density groundwater flow and solute transport equations. Then, we compared and validated the results of the model to those of a field-scale pumping test. The model indicates that pumping SGW from a coastal aquifer freshens the aquifer and rehabilitates parts that were salinized due to seawater intrusion – an effect that increases with increasing pumping rate. In addition, when simultaneously pumping fresh groundwater further inland and SGW from below the FSI, the freshening effect is less pronounced and the salinity of the aquifer is more stable. In line with the results of the model, the field experiment revealed that salinity in the observation well decreases over the course of pumping. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that, in addition to providing a high-quality source feed water for desalination, pumping SGW does not salinize the aquifer and even rehabilitates it by negating the effect of seawater intrusion. These findings are important for planning shoreline desalination facilities and for managing arid coastal regions with lack of water supply and over exploited aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3adesalination 3aequations 3afield experimentation 3afouling 3afreshwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3aplanning 3asaline groundwater 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3aseawater 3asemiarid zones 3ashorelines 3asolutes 3awater supply 0aSeawater intrusion 0aDesalination 0aSaline groundwater 0aCoastal aquifers management1 aYechieli, Yoseph1 aShalev, Eyal1 aKasher, Roni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6429-95531 aSivan, Orit0 tWater research.g2019 June 01, v. 156 p.46-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008500175300001600260520130700276592002801583650000801611650001601619650001301635650001701648650002401665650001101689650001101700650002101711650000701732650001701739650001701756650003101773700003001804700002901834700002701863700002601890773009901916856008502015990002302100852000902123655001202132IND60099891520221119180738.0141105e20110530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009989152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpanasopit, Praneet10aChitosan enhances transfection efficiency of cationic polypeptides/DNA complexes  ap. 161-168.  aThe aim of this research was to investigate the effect of cationic polypeptides mixed with chitosan (CS) on in vitro transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity in human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa cells). The polypeptides/DNA complexes and ternary complexes (CS, polypeptides and DNA) at varying weight ratios were formulated and characterized by using gel electrophoresis. Their particle sizes and charge were evaluated. The effect of the type and molecular weight (MW) of polypeptides, the weight ratio, order of mixing, the pH and serum on transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity were evaluated in HeLa cells. Three types of polypeptides (poly-l-lysine; PLL, poly-l-arginine; PLA and poly-l-ornithine; PLO) were able to form complete complex with DNA at weight ratio above 0.1. The PLA MW >70kDa showed the highest transfection efficiency. The order of mixing between CS, PLA and DNA affected the transfection efficiency. The highest transfection efficiency was observed in ternary complexes of PLA/DNA/CS (2:1:4) equal to PEI/DNA complex. For cytotoxicity studies, over 80% the average cell viabilities of the complexes were observed by MTT assay. This study suggests that the addition of CS to PLA/DNA is easy to prepare, safe and exhibits significantly improved DNA delivery potential in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood serum 3achitosan 3acytotoxicity 3agel electrophoresis 3ahumans 3amixing 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apolypeptides 3atransfection 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aTragulpakseerojn, Jintana1 aApirakaramwong, Auayporn1 aNgawhirunpat, Tanasait1 aRojanarata, Theerasak0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 May 30, v. 410, no. 1-2 p.161-168dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013300159520100000292592002801292650002301320650002001343650002401363650002201387650001701409650001501426650001301441650001501454651002101469773012601490856007301616852000901689655001201698IND60651822220221120092658.0190712e20160707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065182222DNAL7 a10.3390/su80706382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Myeonggil10aLeadership of Information Security Manager on the Effectiveness of Information Systems Security for Secure Sustainable Computing  aInformation security has been predicted as a barrier for future sustainable computing. Regarding information security of secure sustainable computing, the role of information security managers has received attention. In particular, transformational leadership by information security managers should be stressed for persuading, directing, and controlling management and employees. This study shows that the transformational leadership (in forms such as idealized influence, individualized consideration, and inspirational motivation) of information security managers can improve the effectiveness of information security. The enforcement and relevance of information security policies could be mediating effects on the effectiveness of information security. This study collects data from governmental and public institutions in Korea. This study suggests the need for leadership education programs, and indicates that job training for information security managers should be conducted regularly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation programs 3ahuman resources 3ainformation systems 3aissues and policy 3ajob training 3aleadership 3amanagers 3amotivation 3aKorean Peninsula0 tSustainability.g2016 July 07, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80706383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03814naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011800167500001900285520220200304592002802506650002202534650001902556650001702575650000902592650001602601650002302617650001602640650001502656650002102671650001502692650002202707650000902729650001502738650001902753650001602772650001602788650001502804650001002819651001702829653003402846653002102880653001602901653001902917700001102936700001902947700002102966700001702987700001603004700001903020773011603039856008403155852000903239655001203248IND60709455420221122143202.0201206e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070945542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1064812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Dongyang12aA comprehensive analysis of water productivity in natural vegetation and various crops coexistent agro-ecosystems  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater productivity (WP) expressed as the yield produced per unit volume of water is an important indicator of water use in arid and semi-arid areas. Due to complex plant cover and hydrological processes, the quantification and assessment of WP are usually difficult to determine, especially at the regional scale. In this study, an arid irrigated agro-ecosystem in the upper Yellow River basin was selected as a case study area. Based on field observation and model simulation results, the WP of irrigation water (WPI), water applied (WP₍I₊P₎) and evapotranspiration (WPET) were calculated. Equivalent water productivity (EWP) of irrigation water (EWPI), water applied (EWP₍I₊P₎) and evapotranspiration (EWPET) were proposed and calculated to unify the disparate WP for various crops and natural vegetation. Results showed WPI and WP₍I₊P₎ decreased with the increase of water application for all plants except watermelon, indicating supplemental irrigation to watermelon is urgent to improve its production and WP₍I₊P₎. The spatially averaged WPET (kg m⁻³) was 2.47 for maize, 0.80 for sunflower, 12.3 for watermelon, 1.39 for wheat and 0.65 for natural vegetation. WPET for natural vegetation was usually lower in this salt stressed area compared with other water stressed areas. The EWP revealed the rank order of WP for different crops and natural vegetation: watermelon > wheat > maize > sunflower for EWPI; natural vegetation > wheat > watermelon > maize > sunflower for EWP₍I₊P₎; and wheat > sunflower > watermelon > maize > natural vegetation for EWPET. The relationship between EWP₍I₊P₎ and EWPET was scale dependent due to the water reuse phenomena among different land cover types and the canals through the shallow groundwater system. Ignoring natural vegetation will result in considerable bias in the estimation of the regional scale water productivity (16 % in this study). WP improvement strategies such as transferring irrigation water from less productive (sunflower) areas to productive (vegetable and natural vegetation) areas, reducing bare soil evaporation and constructing a timely and accurate irrigation-drainage system were provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagroecosystems 3acase studies 3acorn 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aland cover 3asimulation models 3asoil 3avegetables 3awater analysis 3awater reuse 3awatermelons 3awatersheds 3awheat 3aYellow River 0aEquivalent water productivity 0aModel simulation 0aField scale 0aRegional scale1 aXu, Xu1 aEngel, Bernard1 aHuang, Quanzhong1 aXiong, Yunwu1 aHuo, Zailin1 aHuang, Guanhua0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 243 p.106481-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1064813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012100164300001700285500000900302520128900311592002801600650001201628650002001640650001201660650001201672650001101684650001501695650001301710650000901723650001801732650000701750650001901757650001301776650002001789650000901809700001801818773021701836856008002053852000902133655001202142IND60666343920221119005220.0191028e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066634392DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2015.05.02222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Seok-Young10aBiochar Amendment for Reducing Leachability of Nitro Explosives and Metals from Contaminated Soils and Mine Tailings  ap. 993-1002.  aepub  aThe mobility and bioavailability of nitro explosives (2,4-dinitrotoluene [DNT], 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene [TNT], and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine [RDX]) in biochar-amended soils and toxic metals (As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in biochar-amended mine tailings were investigated via various types of leaching procedures in laboratory-scale batch experiments. The results from the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) extraction showed that approximately 55 to 95% of the explosives were released from the contaminated soils and would thus be considered as mobile. With the addition of biochar, the extracted concentrations of explosives were reduced to less than 10% of the initial concentrations after 10 d. According to the results from a Korean waste leaching method, the TCLP method, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extraction, adding biochar to mine tailings reduced the extractability and bioavailability of metals. The chemical forms of the metals, types of extractants, pH, and curing period strongly affected the extractability of metals from mine tailings. The results suggest that biochar is a promising immobilizer of explosives and metals in contaminated soils and mine tailings under limited conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3abiochar 3acadmium 3acopper 3aexplosives 3aleaching 3alead 3amine tailings 3apH 3apolluted soils 3atoxicity 3atrinitrotoluene 3azinc1 aYoon, Hyun-Su0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2016 May, v. 45, no. 3 p.993-1002dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2015.05.02223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014900169300001400318520083800332592002801170650002301198650001801221650001901239650001501258650001201273650001301285650002701298650002001325650001401345650001601359653001501375653002601390653001601416653001401432653002901446700001501475700001701490700001801507700001901525700001901544700001701563700001601580773010401596856008701700852000901787655001201796IND60526691020221117232625.0190409e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052669102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPostma, P.R.10aSelective extraction of intracellular components from the microalga Chlorella vulgaris by combined pulsed electric field–temperature treatment  ap. 80-88.  aThe synergistic effect of temperature (25–65°C) and total specific energy input (0.55–1.11kWhkgDW−1) by pulsed electric field (PEF) on the release of intracellular components from the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris was studied.

Regulating the amount and time of irrigation at different crop growth stages could provide a solution to optimize the irrigation water amid drought periods. This study evaluated the effect of different deficit irrigation levels on maize (Zea mays L.) at several growth phases over two growing seasons (2012 and 2013) in Yangling, Shaanxi province of China. Total nine irrigation treatments incorporated three irrigation amount ratios, i.e., control irrigation (CK, 100 % of crop evapotranspiration), and 80 % and 60 % of control irrigation; named as T2–T9. Among the irrigation treatments, grain yield ranged from 6392 to 9362 kg ha–¹ and seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) varied from 20.3 to 34.9 kg ha–¹ mm–¹, whereas the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) ranged between 32.0 and 58.1 kg ha–¹ mm–¹. T2 that received 80 % irrigation between V8 and R6 growth stage had overall higher yield than CK, and this was closely followed by T4 that received 80 % irrigation at growth phase V3-V8 and V11-Tasseling, full irrigation at V8-V11, and 60 % irrigation between Tasseling and Maturity. Due to near optimum growing season temperature in 2013, larger WUE was noted in comparison to 2012, that resulted 16 % larger yield with 10 % lesser ETc, on an average, whereas 2012 growing season had better IWUE because of 37.5 % smaller irrigation consumption. Maize grain yield in response to water stress (Ky, the yield response factor) was 0.66, suggesting that the environmental conditions of the study area favor the application of deficit irrigation. The maize yield response to reduced irrigation supply in this experiment indicated that regulated deficit irrigation might help growers to cope with decline in water availability during growing season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adecline 3adeficit irrigation 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3agrain yield 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation water 3asemiarid zones 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater stress 3awater supply 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aMaize yield 0aWater deficit1 aSaddique, Qaisar1 aAli, Ajaz1 aXu, Jiatun1 aK̲h̲ān̲, Muḥammad ʻImrān,1 aQing, Mu1 aAzmat, Muhammad1 aCai, Huanjie1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.0 tAgricultural water management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 243 p.106483-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.1064833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011400169520236100283592002802644650001502672650002002687650001302707650002502720650002002745650001202765650001602777650001002793650002202803650001302825651001902838700002002857700001802877700001802895700001402913700002102927773013402948856008503082852000903167655001203176IND60672823420221120192048.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067282342DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz048.OR03-01-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTovar, Alison10aExploratory Factor Analysis of Observed Feeding Practices Among Family Child Care Home Providers (OR03-01-19)  aFamily childcare homes (FCCH) are a commonly used form of childcare in the US, yet little is known about this setting, particularly the practices that Hispanic providers use when feeding children. Therefore, the goal was to examine the validity of the Environmental Policy Assessment Observation Tool (EPAO) to assess provider feeding practices. Data from an ongoing cluster-randomized trial were used. FCCH provider feeding practices were assessed over 2 days using a modified version of the EPAO (adapted for use in FCCH with expanded assessment of feeding practices). The EPAO captures nutrition and physical activity environments in child-care (e.g., provisions, practices, policies); however, only the 44 feeding practices items recorded during meals were used in this study. For each meal and snack occasion, a weighted factor, which accounted for frequency and time spent in each meal for each feeding practice was created and then averaged across the two observation days to obtain a weighted average score. Exploratory factor analysis investigated the underlying factor structure of the feeding practices. All FCCH providers were female (n = 119) and the majority (72%) were Hispanic. A final 3-factor solution, which captured 34% of the variance, was examined. Factor 1 appeared to capture autonomy support practices with 14 items (e.g., Enthusiastic role modeling, eating the same foods, talking about foods being served, reasoning with children) with loadings ranging from 0.455-0.875 (eigenvalue = 7.3). Factor 2 appeared to capture coercive control and indulgent feeding practices and emerged with 5 items (e.g., Insisting child eat foods on plate, pressuring child to eat, rushing child to eat) with loadings ranging from 0.410-0.817 (eigenvalue = 3.7). Factor 3 appeared to capture a mix of overt control and negative structure behaviors with 5 items (e.g., Enforcing table manners, encouraging children to sit at the table, removing the plate before child was done) with loadings ranging from 0.37-0.66 (eigenvalue = 3.2). The emerging autonomy supportive and coercive controlling factors are consistent with recent research conducted with FCCH providers in North Carolina. Future research should continue to refine this model and explore associations with child diet.

However, biologically treatment should be further applied after heterogeneous electro-Fenton process in order get better effluent quality. In the present study, a simple electropolymerization method using poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and graphene oxide (GO) was applied for graphite felt (GF) electrode modification as cathode in EF system, and coupling subsequently aerobic granular sludge (AGS) biological treatment for dye wastewater treatment. The modified electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectrum, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Data implied that much higher H₂O₂ productivity, current response and coulomb efficiency (CE) were achieved by using GO/PEDOT:NaPSS modified GF. The results could be ascribed to the synergistic effect between PEDOT and GO that accelerated the electron transfer rate. Moreover, the H₂O₂ production capacity remained over 84.2% after 10-times reuses for GO/PEDOT:NaPSS modified GF, indicating that GO significantly improved the stability and life of electrode. Compared with the single system, the total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of the combined system degradation methylene blue (MB) wastewater were significantly improved. Therefore, this modified GF could be used as a potentially useful cathode in heterogeneous EF technology for actual wastewater treatment and the combined system have a promising engineering application value in MB wastewater degradation field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiological treatment 3acathodes 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amethylene blue 3apollutants 3asludge 3asynergism 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aHeterogeneous electro-Fenton 0aElectrode modification 0aPoly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) 0aGraphene oxide 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aTotal organic carbon1 aLi, Kai1 aXu, Weiying1 aDu, Bin1 aWei, Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3034-80461 aLiu, Bing1 aWei, Dong0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 700 p.134536-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1345363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017700165520141700342592002801759650001301787650001501800650001701815650002401832650002401856650002301880650001301903650001801916650001401934650001701948650001601965650001801981650001101999650001002010650001202020650002402032650001302056650001502069650002502084653001802109653001302127653001602140653001802156653000902174700002802183700001902211700001902230700001802249700002002267773011202287856008202399852000902481655001202490IND60767143120221122024736.0220404e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076714312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2022.1128622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyo-Geun10aDietary fucoidan from a brown marine algae (Ecklonia cava) attenuates lipid accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells and alleviates high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice  aFucoidan from marine algae is used as a functional ingredient in the food. Here, we purified fucoidan fractions from a crude polysaccharide obtained after the crude polysaccharide of celluclast-assisted hydrolysate from Ecklonia cava (ECC). We evaluated the effect of ECC on lipid accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and investigated its anti-obesity effects in vivo in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. In vitro Oil Red O staining revealed that treatment with ECC and its purified fucoidan fractions of celluclast assisted hydrolysate from Ecklonia cava (ECFs) remarkably reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. ECF3 contained the highest contents of polysaccharides and sulfate compared with other fucoidan fractions. ECF3 treatment significantly reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Oral administration of ECC significantly reduced body weight, body weight gain, serum lipid content, and total white adipose tissue mass. Histological analysis revealed that ECC reduced lipid accumulation in EAT and liver tissues. Our findings suggest that the anti-obesity effects of ECC are associated with suppressing lipid accumulation in white adipose tissues and increased energy expenditure by upregulating the expression of thermogenic UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT. These results indicate that ECC and its ECFs possess anti-obesity properties and can be used in food and nutraceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia 3aadipocytes 3ablood lipids 3abody weight changes 3adietary supplements 3aenergy expenditure 3afucoidan 3ahigh fat diet 3ahistology 3ahydrolysates 3aingredients 3alipid content 3alipids 3aliver 3aobesity 3aoral administration 3asulfates 3atoxicology 3awhite adipose tissue 0aEcklonia cava 0aFucoidan 0aAntiobesity 0aThermogenesis 0aUCPs1 aJayawardena, Thilina U.1 aSong, Kyung-Mo1 aChoi, Yun-Sang1 aJeon, You-Jin1 aKang, Min-Cheol0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 Apr., v. 162 p.112862-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2022.1128623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014000169300001600309520130500325592002801630650002401658650002101682650002101703650001201724650001601736650001701752650001501769650000901784650001701793650001801810650001401828650000901842650002401851650001201875650002501887650001401912653002101926653002101947653002001968653002301988653000902011700001702020700001502037700001902052700001602071700001902087700001502106700001702121773010602138856008602244852000902330655001202339IND60623171220221120173146.0190129e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062317122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xiaoxian10aDepression caused by long-term stress regulates premature aging and is possibly associated with disruption of circadian rhythms in mice  ap. 100-110.  aDepression has been associated with circadian disruption and premature aging. Nevertheless, mechanisms underlying the link between long-term stress with premature aging and possible associations with circadian rhythms remain elusive. Here, mice were exposed to chronic mild stress for 16 weeks to induce depression-like symptoms, which were confirmed with the open field test, tail suspension test, and sucrose preference test. Then, the circadian rhythms of age-related indexes were compared between control and stressed mice. Long-term stress resulted in decreased body weight gain and locomotor activities, accompanied by losses of subcutaneous backside fat, decreased amounts of thigh muscle fibers, and shortened telomere length in hepatocytes. Stressed mice showed increased oxidative damage, causing impaired mitochondrial function and inflammatory responses, which may be mediated by the sirtuin 3 (SIRT3)-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) signaling pathway. These changes may be associated with partial disruption of circadian rhythms or shifting phase values of some age-related indicators induced by long-term stress. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to stress may increase the risk of depression and regulate age-related phenotypes through associations with circadian rhythms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3achronic exposure 3acircadian rhythm 3aenzymes 3ahepatocytes 3ainflammation 3alocomotion 3amice 3amitochondria 3amuscle fibers 3aphenotype 3arisk 3asignal transduction 3asucrose 3atail suspension test 3atelomeres 0aLong-term stress 0aCircadian rhythm 0aPremature aging 0aSIRT3-SOD2 pathway 0aMice1 aShen, Qichen1 aCao, Lisha1 aChen, Yangyang1 aMa, Lingyan1 aXiao, Qingfeng1 aYu, Chunan1 aFu, Zhengwei0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 199 p.100-110dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010500170500001900275520070000294592002800994650002301022650003001045650001301075653002401088653002501112653002501137653003101162700006601193773011001259856008501369852000901454655001201463IND60695324520221120091922.0200614e20200625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069532452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1520362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonik, Yulia A.10aAsymmetric synthesis with titanacyclopropane reagents: From early results to the recent achievements  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe discovery of titanium alkoxide-catalyzed cyclopropanation of carboxylic esters with Grignard reagents in the late 1980s (Kulinkovich reaction) commenced the era of titanacyclopropanes [titanium(II)-alkene complexes] in organic synthesis.

Bismuth tungstate mediated photocatalysis has been effective in the removal of these organics from water. Bismuth tungstate (Bi₂WO₆) has proven to be an excellent visible light active photocatalyst because of its non-toxicity, low band gap energy and ease of preparation. It has been widely applied for the removal of a wide array of organic pollutants, particularly dyes, from wastewater. However, recently, much attention has been channelled to its application for the degradation of pharmaceuticals. In this present review, the recent trends in the applications of Bi₂WO₆ based photocatalysts for the removal of pharmaceuticals in wastewater are comprehensively discussed. The fabrication of Bi₂WO₆ based photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic performances through morphology control, doping and formation of heterojunctions are highlighted. Much discussion centres on the mechanisms and possible degradation pathways of antibiotic pharmaceuticals in wastewater. Finally, areas needing more attention and investigation on the use of Bi₂WO₆ based photocatalysts for removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater especially towards real-life applications are presented for future research directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abismuth 3aenergy 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aBismuth tungstate 0aWastewater treatment 0aDegradation pathways1 aIdris, Azeez Olayiwola1 aFeleni, Usisipho1 aMamba, Bhekie0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 289 p.117891-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1178913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163072001700180100002100197245013300218300001400351500002400365500001500389520146500404650002001869650001901889650002201908650001601930650002201946650002301968650002701991650001602018650001902034650002002053650002202073650001602095650002102111650002402132650001002156651001202166651001202178653001302190700002202203700002102225700002002246700002102266773011902287852000902406856008602415856004902501930003302550945002502583946001102608655001202619IND4418979720221122184527.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2008.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The impact of climate change will vary strongly across regions depending on pre-existing climatic, agronomic, and political conditions. Most of the present modeling approaches, which aim to analyze the impact of global change on agriculture, deliver aggregated results both with regard to content and spatial resolution. To deliver results with a higher spatial resolution and to produce a more detailed picture of agricultural production, the county-based agro-economic model known as ACRE-Danube was developed. The German and Austrian part of the Upper Danube basin, a study area with great diversity in agricultural landscapes and climatic conditions, was chosen for study. For the analysis, two scenarios of climatic and socio-economic change were derived. The first and more economically and globally oriented scenario, termed “Full Liberalization,” included significant temperature increases. The second and more environmentally and regionally oriented “Full Protection” scenario included a moderate temperature increase. Both scenarios produce different results regarding agricultural income and land use. While the developments in the Full Protection scenario are small, the Full Liberalization scenario yields extreme regional changes in agricultural income, an increase in cereal production and extensive grassland farming. 3aland use change 3aagroecosystems 3asimulation models 3aland policy 3aagricultural land 3asocial environment 3ageographical variation 3afarm income 3aclimate change 3apolicy analysis 3aspatial variation 3aagriculture 3aclimatic factors 3aagricultural policy 3acrops 3aGermany 3aAustria 0aland use1 aWirsig, Alexander1 aHerrmann, Sylvia1 aKrimly, Tatjana1 aDabbert, Stephan0 tAgricultural systems.g2009 Apr., v. 100, no. 1-3 p.31-42dElsevier Science Ltd.wJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2008.12.0023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2008.12.002  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02736naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010800166300001600274520153600290650002401826650001901850650002001869650001501889650001301904650001601917650001101933651001001944653002301954653002501977653001202002700002302014700002002037700002302057773012002080852000902200856008502209930003302294946001102327655001202338IND4414216920221122184553.0081226e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441421692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-007-9283-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Satoshi 10aEffect of seawater temperature on the productivity of Laminaria japonica in the Uwa Sea, southern Japan  ap. 833-844.  aRecent studies on global climate change report that increase in seawater temperature leads to coastal ecosystem change, including coral bleaching in the tropic. In order to assess the effect of increased seawater temperature on a temperate coastal ecosystem, we studied the inter-annual variation in productivity of Laminaria japonica using long-term oceanographic observations for the Uwa Sea, southern Japan. The annual productivity estimates for L. japonica were 2.7 ± 2.5 (mean ± SD) kg wet wt. m⁻¹ (length of rope) (2003/2004), 1.0 ± 0.6 kg wet wt. m⁻¹ (2004/2005) and 12.1 ± 12.5 kg wet wt. m⁻¹ (2005/2006). Our previous study using the same methodology at the same locality reported that the productivity was estimated for the 2001/2002 (33.3 ± 15.2 kg wet wt. m⁻¹) and 2002/2003 (34.0 ± 8.7 kg wet wt. m⁻¹) seasons. Productivity in 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 was significantly lower than in years 2001/2002, 2002/2003 and 2005/2006. A comparison of oceanographic conditions among the 5 years revealed the presence of threshold seawater temperature effects. When the average seawater temperature during the first 45 days of each experiment exceeded 15.5°C, productivity was reduced to about 10 % of that in cooler years. Moreover the analysis of growth and erosion rates indicates that when the seawater temperature was over 17.5°C, erosion rate exceeded growth rate. Thus, an increase of seawater temperature of just 1°C during winter drastically reduces the productivity of L. japonica in the Uwa Sea. 3aSaccharina japonica 3aclimate change 3acoral bleaching 3aecosystems 3aseawater 3atemperature 3awinter 3aJapan 0aLaminaria japonica 0aSeawater temperature 0aUwa Sea1 aFuruya, Kazushige 1 aKawai, Tadashi 1 aTakeuchi, Ichirō.0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2008 Oct., v. 20, no. 5 p.833-844dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-007-9283-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20081226b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03762naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191072000900200072000900209100001700218245009100235300001600326500002400342500001500366520208000381650001502461650001602476650002002492650002002512650002202532650002402554650002302578650001802601650001702619650002602636650001902662650002602681650002002707650002302727650002102750653002302771653001802794700001702812700001402829700001702843700001702860700001702877773009102894852000902985856008502994930003303079945002503112946001103137655001203148IND4434427020221122184534.0100323e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443442702DNAL7 a224438802pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311099910662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aJ710 0aL800 0aL200 0aL500 0aL1051 aMarley, C.L.10aAligning health and welfare principles and practice in organic dairy systems: a review  ap. 259-271.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis review provides an assessment of research findings into the current practices and standards and the principles and aspirations for organic dairy production, with respect to the health and welfare of the dairy cow. The relationships between the four main factors: management, environment, genetics and nutrition and their impact on the health and welfare status of organic dairy cows are considered. The concept that good animal health and welfare is more than merely the absence of disease, with behavioural aspects of health and welfare such as physiological and psychological needs, is also discussed. These factors are inter-related and important in all dairy systems, irrespective of whether the system is organic, low-input or intensive. Incidences of individual clinical and sub-clinical diseases that are recorded in conventional dairy systems also occur in organic dairy systems, with infertility, lameness and mastitis being the major problems. However, the magnitude of the incidence of many of these diseases may be either lower or higher in organic systems due to different management practices and the standards defined for organic milk production that, for example, prohibit the routine use of conventional medicines and require the feeding of high-forage diets. In relation to different systems, it is important to note that contrary to a common assumption, good welfare does not necessarily occur with more extensive systems. The type of organic system (self-sufficient, purchased-feed) also has the potential to have a major influence on the incidence of health problems and the reproductive status of organic dairy herds. Health status is also influenced by environmental and welfare factors, including the method of rearing replacement animals, type of housing and the geographical and climatic conditions of individual farms. Overall, this review identifies where conflicts arise between current practice and the organic principles and standards, and aims to provide suggestions to bring about further improvement in organic dairy health and welfare. 3adairy cows 3acow feeding 3acattle diseases 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal well-being 3aanimal reproduction 3adisease prevention 3aanimal stress 3atherapeutics 3adairy farm management 3aanimal housing 3adairy herd management 3aanimal breeding 3aorganic production 3astress tolerance 0aliterature reviews 0adairy farming1 aWeller, R.F.1 aNeale, M.1 aMain, D.C.J.1 aRoderick, S.1 aKeatinge, R.0 tAnimal.g2010 Feb., v. 4, no. 2 p.259-271dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311099910663Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02039naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005200174300001600226500002800242520113100270650001101401650001601412653001201428653002901440700002101469700002101490773011401511852000901625856009201634946001101726655001201737IND4418950720221122184624.0090410s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441895072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00493.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlstorpe, Matilda10aScreening of yeast strains for phytase activity  ap. 478-488.  aPublisher supplied data  aA screening method was developed to elucidate the ability of different yeast strains to utilize phytic acid as sole phosphorus source. The growth test in liquid culture in a microtiter plate with phytic acid as sole phosphorus source was shown to be a reliable, fast and easy-to-use screening method. We tested 122 strains from 61 species with our method and observed growth differences among species and strains that were not detectable on solid medium. Specific phytase activities were measured for 10 yeasts strains, selected due to their strong growth in the liquid medium. Strains of Arxula adeninivorans and Pichia anomala reached the highest volumetric phytase activities. Arxula adeninivorans also displayed the highest intra- and extracellular specific activities. There were large differences in both extra- and intracellular phytase activities among species. Strain-specific extracellular phytase activities were detected in P. anomala. The presence of free phosphate in the media completely suppressed the extracellular phytase activity and also reduced intracellular phytase activity for all tested yeast strains. 3ayeasts 3aphytic acid 0aphytase 0aspecific enzyme activity1 aSchnürer, Johan1 aPassoth, Volkmar0 tFEMS yeast research.g2009 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.478-488dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00493.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03768naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245018500156300001600341520225700357650001402614650001202628650001602640650001602656650001802672650001402690650002302704650001102727650004302738650002002781650001702801650001402818650001202832650003402844650001702878700001502895700001302910700001602923700001502939700001602954773010102970852000903071856008103080856008103161939003303242946001103275655001203286IND4482832420221122152926.0140630e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448283242DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2007.3402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, L.J.10aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ??Is involved in weaning to Estrus of Primiparous sows by regulating the expression of hormone genes in Hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis  ap. 340-350.  aThe objective of this study was to determine whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is involved in the regulation of weaning to estrus of primiparous sows. Twelve sows composed of 6 groups of 2 full-sibs in a similar age (325.2 d), body weight (BW; 152.4 kg) and backfat thickness (BFT; 27.0 mm) at start of lactation, were allocated to accept 31 MJ (restricted group, R-group) or 53 MJ (control group, C-group) DE/d treatment, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the low energy intake resulted in excessive losses of BW and BFT during lactation in R-group sows, which may be related to decrease of serum 15- deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a ligand of PPARγ. The obvious peak and the frequency of LH, FSH and estradiol (E2) were only observed in C-group sows. Except for E2 at d 1 and 2, serum FSH, LH and E2 concentrations in R-group were lower than those in C-group sows after weaning. However, the serum progesterone (P4) level in R-group sows was always more than that in C-group. The expression abundances of PPARγ and GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) in pituitary, FSH receptor (FSH-R), LH receptor (LH-R), estrogen receptor (ES-R) and aromatase in ovary of anestrous sows were lower than those of estrous sows. Neither the BFT nor the BW was associated with the mRNA abundance of PPARγ in hypothalamus during lactation. Expressions of PPARγ in pituitary and ovary were affected evidently by the BFT changes and only by the loss of BW of sows during and after lactation. Furthermore, PPARγ mRNA level in ovary was significantly related to the expression abundances of GnRH-R, FSH-R, ES-R and aromatase, and GnRH-R was obviously associated with PPARγ expression in pituitary. However, PPARγ expression in hypothalamus likely has no effects on these genes expression and no obvious difference for all sows. Not serum E2 or P4 alone but the ratios of E2 to P4 and 15d-PGJ2 to P4, and serum FSH and LH were evidently related to PPARγ expression in pituitary and ovary. It is concluded that PPARγ is associated with body conditions, reproduction hormones and their receptor expression, which affected the functions of pituitary and ovary and ultimately the estrus after weaning of primiparous sows. 3aaromatase 3abackfat 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aenergy intake 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrus 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3agene expression 3ahypothalamus 3alactation 3aligands 3aluteinizing hormone receptors 3aprogesterone1 aWang, A.G.1 aFu, J.L.1 aLai, Ch.

Serum samples were collected from 60 each of healthy and PHU affected buffaloes randomly selected from field cases. Serum samples were collected from each animal. Fifty composite soil samples were collected where PHU was prevalent. Fifty samples of fodders including leaves and stems being fed to the diseased buffaloes were collected. The difference in the levels of calcium and potassium between upper and lower soil surface of disease prone areas under study were statistically non-significant. The mean values of phosphorous, copper, iron, selenium and molybdenum in upper soil surface were significantly (p<0.05) higher than in lower soil surface. None of the fodders offered to the diseased animals met the dietary requirements of phosphorus and copper whereas none of the fodders was deficient in potassium, iron and selenium rather were having excess of potassium, iron and selenium. The concentration of calcium was adequate in lucerne, berseem, sarson and sorghum, while maize, sugarcane and wheat straw did not meet the required levels for dairy animals. Molybdenum contents in all fodders were adequate to meet the dietary requirements of the dairy buffaloes. Serum phosphorus, copper and selenium were significantly (p<0.001) lower whereas potassium, iron and molybdenum in buffaloes suffering from PHU were significantly (p<0.001) higher than in healthy buffaloes. It was concluded that phosphorous deficient soils play a major role by transferring this deficiency to plants and ultimately reaching to animals where hypophosphataemia is a consistent finding. 3aBubalus bubalis 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aalfalfa 3ablood serum 3abuffaloes 3acalcium 3acopper 3acorn 3aforage 3airon 3amolybdenum 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aselenium 3asoil 3asugarcane 3awheat straw1 aKhan, A.1 aSarwar, M.1 aJavaid, A.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2007 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.393-398wJournal:18450x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2007.3933Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajas.info/index.php?v_type=33Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140701  aNon-US 7aarticle01682naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002600115245015200141300001600293300002400309520059500333650002300928650002500951650001600976650002000992650001301012650002001025650001801045651001001063653001901073653002201092700002401114700001601138773009301154852000901247939003301256945000801289946001101297655001201308991609116730742620221122152952.0850717e198309  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850074612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThimmayamma, B.

To assess the influence of oral contraceptives, menstrual cycle phase, and also physical exercise (acute and chronic such as training) on these metabolites excretions, a collection of 28 female urine specimens was organized. A three-extraction-step method was developed, and the analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using deuterated 19-noretiocholanolone as the internal standard. Sample hydration state was found to be of great importance for kinetic studies, as it directly influenced the concentrations. No influence of menstrual cycle and training was found for androsterone and DHEA. However, oral contraceptive intake lowered DHEA excretion in urine and A seems to be slightly affected by exercise. 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aandrosterone 3aprasterone 3aexercise 0aDoping 0aFemale physiology1 aEnea, C.1 aGoetinck, P.1 aLafay, F.1 aBoisseau, N.1 aDugué, B.1 aFlament-Waton, M.-M.1 aGrenier-Loustalot, M.-F.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2009 Feb., v. 393, no. 4 p.1315-1325dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-008-2549-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03502naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002400165245013800189300001600327500002400343500001500367520119000382650002001572650002001592650001501612650002801627650001601655650005001671650002401721650002201745650002701767650001401794650002901808650001301837650001001850650001201860650001401872650001401886650002101900650002401921650004601945650001801991650002302009650004102032650003002073650002502103650004202128650002802170650001302198650005702211650003602268650004602304650002702350650003402377650003602411650001402447653002702461700002002488700002202508700002502530700002002555773012202575852000902697856008602706655001202792IND4477900820221122115800.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790082DNAL7 a127445092pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.5.3892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, Hiroyuki10aPeh Production, Flagellum Synthesis, and Virulence Reduced in Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora by Mutation in a Homologue of cytR  ap. 389-397.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aErwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora is a causal agent of soft-rot diseases in a wide variety of plants. Here, we have isolated a new regulatory factor involved in the virulence of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora by in vivo insertional mutagenesis using a transposon Tn5. The gene was homologous to cytR encoding a transcriptional repressor of nucleoside uptake and catabolism genes in Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio cholerae. Phenotypic characterization of a nonpolar deletion mutant of the cytR homologue (ΔcytR) revealed that the ΔcytR mutant produced a reduced level of polygalacturonase (Peh) and lost its motility compared to that in the parental strain. With electron microscopy, the ΔcytR mutant was shown to be aflagellate. Furthermore, the expression of fliA and fliC (encoding σ28 and flagellin, respectively) was also reduced in ΔcytR mutant. The virulence of ΔcytR mutant was reduced in Chinese cabbage and potato compared to that of the parental strain. These results suggest that the CytR homologue of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora positively controls Peh production and flagellum synthesis and plays an important role in its pathogenicity. 3aChinese cabbage 3aVibrio cholerae 3ametabolism 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3atransposons 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 3aelectron microscopy 3apolygalacturonase 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aflagellum 3atranscription (genetics) 3apotatoes 3agenes 3amutants 3avirulence 3aflagellin 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aFlagellaxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPectobacterium carotovorumxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPolygalacturonasexbiosynthesis 2aRepressor Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aVirulence 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aMuroi, Hironobu1 aUmehara, Masahiro1 aYoshitake, Yoshimasa1 aTsuyumu, Shinji0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.389-397dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.5.3893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03148naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100002000173245007100193300001600264500002400280500001500304520155100319650000901870650001501879650001901894650002601913650001401939650002101953650002101974650001901995650002002014650001802034650001302052650002202065650001902087650002602106650002702132650001102159650000902170650001602179651001202195653001302207653003002220653002902250700001902279773010802298852000902406856008602415930003302501945002502534946001102559655001202570IND4418970020221122115739.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP200 0aJ5001 aNiedermeier, A.10aPhosphorus dynamics in the ditch system of a restored peat wetland  ap. 161-169.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe restoration of wetlands as bird habitats often involves the maintenance of a fluctuating water regime by careful, localised ditch water management using pumps and sluices. However, there is evidence in the literature to suggest that alternate flood/drainage cycles can accelerate nutrient cycling and transport within the soil and, therefore, pose a threat to water quality through the process of eutrophication. This study focused on the dynamics and losses of soil P in a recently re-wetted, eutrophic fen peat developed on alluvium in south west England. During the 2-year study (2001 and 2002), soil water tensiometry revealed that the field water table (fluctuating annually between +20 and -60cm relative to ground level) was extensively influenced across most of the 8.4ha field site by the management of the adjacent ditch water levels. This conservation-led, prescribed water balance was facilitated by the high hydraulic conductivity (1.1x10⁻⁵ ms⁻¹) of the lower (70-140cm), degraded layer of peat. However, only during a 7-day period of water table drawdown by intermittent pump drainage, approximately 45gha⁻¹ of dissolved reactive P (DRP) entered the pumped ditch from the field via this degraded layer. Summer rainfall events >35mmd⁻¹ also coincided with significant peaks in ditch water P concentration (up to 200μgL⁻¹ DRP). Even larger peaks (up to 700μgL⁻¹ DRP) occurred with the annual onset of autumn reflooding. These episodic P loss events pose a serious potential threat to biological water quality. 3apeat 3aphosphorus 3adrainage water 3abiogeochemical cycles 3apeatlands 3alosses from soil 3aland restoration 3asoil fertility 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aleaching 3adrainage channels 3aeutrophication 3asoil matric potential 3ahydraulic conductivity 3afloods 3arain 3awater table 3aEngland 0awetlands 0asoil hydraulic properties 0asoil transport processes1 aRobinson, J.S.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.161-169dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03032naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245013100191300001500322500002400337520133200361650002601693650002101719650002501740650001401765650001001779650002401789650001801813650001401831650001201845650003801857650003801895650001901933650003401952650004001986650004002026650004102066650004202107650003802149650003802187650003302225650003502258700001802293700001702311773010402328852000902432856008502441655001202526IND4477901820221122092507.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790182DNAL7 a125757432pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.2.992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiriart, Jean-Baptiste10aDynamics of the VIGS-Mediated Chimeric Silencing of the Nicotiana benthamiana ChlH Gene and of the Tobacco Mosaic Virus Vector  ap. 99-106.  aIncludes references  aThe ChlH gene, encoding for the H subunit of the magnesium chelatase enzyme, was silenced in Nicotiana bentahamiana plants by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), using tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) expression vector. Strong silencing of the ChlH target gene was initiated only in the apical tissues, in which the endogenous transcription level of the target gene and the level of TMV vector RNA were both very high. The virus vector was also targeted by VIGS, and its suppression was correlated with the silencing of the ChlH mRNA. In the apical tissues, the suppression of both the virus vector and the ChlH mRNA led to a reduction of the silencing pressure and, consequently, to partial recovery of the new growth from the silencing. As the virus vector and the target mRNA levels increased, silencing was reestablished. The feedback regulation system, caused by the transient increase and reduction in levels of the virus vector and ChlH mRNA, led to a fluctuation of the silenced and recovered phenotypes in the plant apex. This TMV-vector mediated silencing system differed from previously analyzed VIGS systems; although the TMV vector was initially targeted by the silencing system, it was not permanently suppressed, indicating that, in this system, TMV was able to effectively escape post-transcriptional gene silencing. 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aRNA interference 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3achimerism 3agenes 3amagnesium chelatase 3amessenger RNA 3aphenotype 3aviruses 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGene Silencing 2aLyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Virusesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxvirology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxgenetics1 aAro, Eva-Mari1 aLehto, Kirsi0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.99-106dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.2.993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02509naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245008900184300001600273500002400289520113900313650002401452650001301476650002001489650004301509650001201552650001901564650001401583650001401597650001001611650001301621650003801634650004101672650001601713650006201729700001901791700002301810700002301833773012401856852000901980856008601989655001202075IND4477898320221122092450.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447789832DNAL7 a129716062pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.9.8272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Mengsheng10aProduction of Substances by Medicago truncatula that Affect Bacterial Quorum Sensing  ap. 827-834.  aIncludes references  aEarlier work showed that higher plants produce unidentified compounds that specifically stimulate or inhibit quorum sensing (QS) regulated responses in bacteria. The ability of plants to produce substances that affect QS regulation may provide plants with important tools to manipulate gene expression and behavior in the bacteria they encounter. In order to examine the kinds of QS active substances produced by the model legume M. truncatula, young seedlings and seedling exudates were systematically extracted with various organic solvents, and the extracts were fractionated by reverse phase C18 high-performance liquid chromatography. M. truncatula appears to produce at least 15 to 20 separable substances capable of specifically stimulating or inhibiting responses in QS reporter bacteria, primarily substances that affect QS regulation dependent on N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signals. The secretion of AHL QS mimic activities by germinating seeds and seedlings was found to change substantially with developmental age. The secretion of some mimic activities may be dependent upon prior exposure of the plants to bacteria. 3aMedicago truncatula 3abacteria 3agene expression 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alegumes 3aquorum sensing 3asecretion 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asolvents 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGermination 2aMedicagoxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aTeplitski, Max1 aRobinson, Jayne B.1 aBauer, Wolfgang D.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Sept., v. 16, no. 9 p.827-834dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.9.8273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04052naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002300182245008700205300001600292500002400308500001500332520253800347650001302885650001802898650002402916650001502940650002902955650001702984650002203001650001403023650001203037650002603049650001303075651001303088653002203101653002403123653001003147653002003157700001703177700001803194700002603212773010803238852000903346856008603355930003303441945002503474946001103499655001203510IND4418970820221122092456.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE110 0aJ200 0aF100 0aJ7001 aAumtong, Supathida10aRelating soil carbon fractions to land use in sloping uplands in northern Thailand  ap. 229-239.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study from Khun Samun Watershed in northern Thailand we investigate land use and soil carbon relationships in 99 sloping upland soils that pertain to soil degradation/conservation and carbon storage/loss. Approximately 35% of the variability in total soil carbon could be explained by the available quantitative and semi-quantitative information, primarily clay content and CEC, and to a lesser degree by factors concerning land management. When categorical information such as land-use class and location was included, the explanatory power increased to 65% for total soil carbon, whereas for particulate and soluble carbon fractions the model predicted 71-95% of the total variability. The water soluble carbon fractions were high in systems with input of high C-to-N ratio material, whereas the permanganate oxidizable fraction was somewhat increased in the predominantly anoxic wetland rice site, and in fruit tree plantations. Coarse particulate organic matter carbon was strongly affected by land use. A causal relationship between land use and soil carbon or carbon fractions cannot be firmly established since historical data from these soils are lacking, but the significance of the various carbon fractions is discussed. It is proposed that the communities have selected land for particular purposes based on suitability, i.e. perceived inherent quality, accessibility and possibly other factors. Thus, the best land is apt to be used for the cultivation of fruit trees, teak and annual crops, leaving the poorest land for secondary forest. This study did not indicate that the cultivation of land is rapidly degrading the soil quality, either by carbon content, carbon fractions, or the profile gradients of total carbon or particulate carbon through the topsoil (0-20cm). Profile carbon gradients were significantly explained by land-use class, but not by the position in the landscape which indicates that erosion is not an overriding force. While the secondary forest had the strongest profile gradient of total carbon, it was not much higher than fallow and fruit tree plantations, and only significantly different from wetland rice, which had a very small gradient due to the frequent ploughing of the soil. The similarities in profile carbon gradients is ascribed to the actual land management, where planting of crops is commonly done by punching holes in the otherwise undisturbed topsoil, and subsequent weeding is done by manual slashing or with herbicides, thus effectively forming a zero-till practice. 3aorchards 3aclay fraction 3asoil organic carbon 3ano-tillage 3acation exchange capacity 3asoil quality 3asecondary forests 3ahighlands 3atopsoil 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aland use 3aThailand 0aagricultural land 0asoil organic matter 0aslope 0aland management1 aMagid, Jakob1 aBruun, Sander1 ade Neergaard, Andreas0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.229-239dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02966naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100001800164245008100182300001600263500002400279520135200303650001501655650001701670650002101687650001901708650002401727650001101751650001801762650002901780650002201809650002001831650001501851650002101866650002301887650001901910650002401929650002301953650001801976650001101994651001502005700001802020700001602038700001502054700001502069700001602084700001602100773010802116852000902224856008602233930003302319945002502352946001102377655001202388IND4418971120221122092427.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aW0001 aCabrera, V.E.10aSoil and runoff response to dairy manure application on New Mexico rangeland  ap. 255-262.  aIncludes references  aManure disposal is a major challenge for the fast-growing dairy industry in New Mexico. There are currently over 355,000 milking cows in the state and limited cropland on which to use the manure generated by these cows. On the other hand, 80% of the state lands classified as rangelands are suffering from a lack of organic matter and nutrients. Application of dairy manure to rangelands could serve a dual purpose: (1) manure disposal from dairies and (2) soil amendment to improve soil characteristics and promote herbaceous production. Manure was applied at two rates according to phosphorus (P) content: (1) a recommended (light) rate (54kgPha⁻¹) to enhance blue grama growth and (2) a gross over-application (heavy) rate (493kgPha⁻¹) to determine the effects on runoff and soil properties. Light applications enhanced soil properties including decreased sediment runoff, increased soil organic matter, increased extractable P, and increased soil moisture, whereas heavy applications increased soil salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, and runoff water. Dairy manure can be safely applied at light rates to conserve and enhance rangeland soil properties and their herbaceous productivity. Manure disposal at heavy rates are unsafe. Further study is required to find out if other safe disposal exists between the light and heavy treatments. 3arangelands 3adairy manure 3aland application 3asoil fertility 3aorganic fertilizers 3arunoff 3awater quality 3aanimal manure management 3aagricultural land 3asoil amendments 3aphosphorus 3afertilizer rates 3asediment transport 3asediment yield 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water content 3asoil salinity 3asodium 3aNew Mexico1 aStavast, L.J.1 aBaker, T.T.1 aWood, M.K.1 aCram, D.S.1 aFlynn, R.P.1 aUlery, A.L.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.255-262dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.01.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02345naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245006000155300001600215520132600231650002101557650000901578650001401587650001101601650002301612650002001635650001601655650001101671650001501682650002901697650000901726700001601735773008601751852000901837856008101846939003301927946001101960655001201971IND4464269220221122092441.0121009e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446426922DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.8802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, I.B.14aThe Use of High-oil Corn in Young Broiler Chicken Diets  ap. 880-883.  aThe objective of this study was to measure performance of young broiler chickens fed three varieties of high-oil corn (HOC 1, 2, and 3) compared with eight varieties of normal corn (NC). HOC varieties contained about 80% more oil than NC (average crude fat; 6.71% vs 3.72%) and about 29% more protein (average CP; 9.54% vs 7.38%). Each experimental diet was formulated with the same amount (55.205%) of each corn hybrid. Experiment 1 had by six dietary treatments (HOC1 and five NC varieties, 360 chickens) and Experiment 2 had five treatments (HOC2, HOC3, and three NC varieties, 250 chickens). In Exp. 1, for feed efficiency (F/G), the treatment contained HOC1 had better performance (p<0.05) than other NC varieties except NC5. As expected, there was no significant difference in average daily feed intake (p>0.05) among dietary treatments. The dietary treatment of HOC1 gave an improvement of 4.3% in F/G that came from 6% higher gross energy (GE) value of HOC1. Compared with Exp. 2, the dietary treatments contained HOC hybrids gave 4.4% higher F/G than NC dietary treatments, which came from a 5% increase in GE value. HOC varieties had superior nutrients content to NC for poultry, due to the fact that HOC contained higher concentrations of energy, protein, lysine, and methionine, thus improving growth and F/G. 3abroiler chickens 3acorn 3acrude fat 3aenergy 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3alysine 3amethionine 3anutritional intervention 3aoils1 aAllee, G.L.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 June, v. 16, no. 6 p.880-883x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.8803Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20121009  aNon-US 7aarticle02735naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245013500157300001600292520148200308650002001790650001401810650001301824650001301837650001201850650001401862650001901876650001601895650002201911650002001933650002501953650001001978653001501988653002902003700001502032700001602047773009102063852000902154856008102163930003302244945001302277946001102290655001202301IND2196031420221122092518.0981216e199805  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603142DNAL7 a10.1007/s0035900502052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosse, A.A.10aNeurons discovered in male Helicoverpa zea antennae that correlate with pheromone-mediated attraction and interspecific antagonism  ap. 585-594.  aResponses of single receptor neurons in the antennae of male Helicovrpa zea to sex pheromone components and to behavioral antagonists were recorded using a cut-sensillum extracellular recording technique. Three types of sensilla were identified from sampling 325 male-specific sensilla tnchodea located at the lateral edge of antennomeres. The majority of these sensilla (71%) contained a receptor neuron tuned to the principal sex pheromone component (Z)-11-hexadecenal. A second sensillar type (10%) contained a receptor neuron that responded only to (Z)-9-tetra-decenal. A third sensillar type (19%) contained a large-spiking neuron tuned to the secondary pheromone component (Z)-9-hexadecenal, but this neuron also could be stimulated to equivalent spike frequencies by the same emitted amounts of (Z)-9-tetradecenal. A smaller-spiking neuron in this sensillar type responded to two compounds known to act only as behavioral antagonists. (Z)-11-hexadecen-l-ol and (Z)-l 1-hexadecenyl acetate, and to (Z)-9-tetradecenal. Cross-adaptation studies confirmed the presence of one large-and one small-spiking neuron in the third sensillar type. Dose-response studies correlated to collected stimuli amounts showed that the large-spiking neuron in the third sensillar type was equally tuned to (Z)-9-hexadecenal and (Z)-9-tetradecenal, whereas the smaller-spiking neuron was far more sensitive to (Z)-11-hexadecen-l-ol and to (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate than to (Z)-9-tetradecenal. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aHeliothis 3aantennae 3asensilla 3aneurons 3areceptors 3asex pheromones 3aantagonists 3aelectrophysiology 3aneurophysiology 3aanimal communication 3amales 0aantagonism 0ainterspecific pheromones1 aTodd, J.L.1 aBaker, T.C.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1998 May, v. 182, no. 5 p.585-594x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900502053Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03197naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002600182245007200208300001600280500002400296500001500320520144900335650001801784650001201802650002601814650001901840650002401859650002001883650002301903650001701926650002601943650001401969650002201983650002402005650002502029650001102054650001102065650002202076650001502098650002302113651001002136653001702146653001302163653001702176700002802193700002302221700002702244700002802271773010802299852000902407856008602416930003302502945002502535946001102560655001202571IND4418971820140725000000.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aK120 0aJ700 0aK0011 aMosquera-Losada, M.R.10aBiodiversity and silvopastoral system use change in very acid soils  ap. 315-324.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMost biodiversity studies endeavour to put forward strategies for its short-term enhancement, seeking to understand the spatial scale. However, biodiversity preservation strategies should also take into account temporal scales, in order to fulfil the main biodiversity preservation objectives. Biodiversity variability also depends on the structural heterogeneity of the land on which this strategy is developed. Agroforestry systems have a tree component that makes this heterogeneity more important than in exclusively agronomic systems. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of different soil fertility management (application of lime and fertiliser in both organic and inorganic nitrogen forms) on tree and pasture growth, as well as on the pasture richness in a silvopastoral systems developed on a 5-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don plantation over 6 years. Temporal scale, as well as spatial biodiversity scale, should be taking into account in biodiversity studies in forests. Tree development as well as fertility soil modifications modified species richness, the relative dominance between species and the type of species. The lack of management caused an undesirable development of shrubs, main resource of forest fires development in the region. Lower tree densities than those currently used combined with authocthonous breed grazing, to reduce shrub biomass is the best option to sustain biodiversity and productivity from the area. 3aPinus radiata 3agrazing 3asilvopastoral systems 3asoil fertility 3anutrient management 3aland use change 3atemporal variation 3aforest trees 3abotanical composition 3alivestock 3aspatial variation 3aorganic fertilizers 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aliming 3ashrubs 3aplant communities 3aacid soils 3aforest plantations 3aSpain 0aagroforestry 0aland use 0abiodiversity1 aRodríguez-Barreira, S.1 aLópez-Díaz, M.L.1 aFernández-Núñez, E.1 aRigueiro-Rodríguez, A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.315-324dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02743naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100003200146245017900178300001600357500002400373520147600397650000801873650003801881650001601919650001601935650001001951650001201961650002401973650001401997650002202011650002202033650002602055650001402081700002302095700002102118773012302139852000902262856008602271655001202357IND4477899420221122060310.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447789942DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.4.2712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholz-Schroeder, Brenda K.14aThe sypA, sypB, and sypC Synthetase Genes Encode Twenty-Two Modules Involved in the Nonribosomal Peptide Synthesis of Syringopeptin by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae B301D  ap. 271-280.  aIncludes references  aSyringopeptin is a necrosis-inducing phytotoxin, composed of 22 amino acids attached to a 3-hydroxy fatty acid tail. Syringopeptin, produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, functions as a virulence determinant in the plant-pathogen interaction. A 73,800-bp DNA region was sequenced, and analysis identified three large open reading frames, sypA, sypB, and sypC, that are 16.1, 16.3, and 40.6 kb in size. Sequence analysis of the putative SypA, SypB, and SypC sequences determined that they are homologous to peptide synthetases, containing five, five, and twelve amino acid activation modules, respectively. Each module exhibited characteristic domains for condensation, aminoacyl adenylation, and thiolation. Within the aminoacyl adenylation domain is a region responsible for substrate specificity. Phylogenetic analysis of the substrate-binding pockets resulted in clustering of the 22 syringopeptin modules into nine groups. This clustering reflects the substrate amino acids predicted to be recognized by each of the respective modules based on placement of the syringopeptin NRPS (nonribosomal peptide synthetase) system in the linear (type A) group. Finally, SypC contains two C-terminal thioesterase domains predicted to catalyze the release of syringopeptin from the synthetase and peptide cyclization to form the lactone ring. The syringopeptin synthetases, which carry 22 NRPS modules, represent the largest linear NRPS system described for a prokaryote. 3aDNA 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aamino acids 3afatty acids 3agenes 3aligases 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3asequence analysis 3asubstrate specificity 3avirulence1 aSoule, Jonathan D.1 aGross, Dennis C.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.271-280dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.4.2713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02577naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245010500155300001600260500001500276520135700291650002801648650002701676650001201703650002501715650001201740650002301752653002401775653001701799653001801816653001001834653001801844653001801862700002301880700001401903773009101917852000902008856008102017930003302098945001302131946001102144655001202155IND2196032820221122060143.0981216e199805  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603282DNAL7 a10.1007/s0035900502132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchul, J.10aSelective phonotaxis in Tettigonia cantans and T. viridissima in song recognition and discrimination  ap. 687-694.  a2019-12-04  aThe selectivity of female phonotaxis in Tettigonia cantans and T. viridissima was investigated on a Kramer treadmill,. with respect to the specific differences in temporal pattern and spectrum of the songs of both species. In choice situations. both species preferred the conspecific song over the heterospecific one. The courses of both species were deflected by about 15-20 degrees from the position of the conspecific song, that of T. viridissima being away from, that of T. cantans in the direction of the heterospecific song. In no-choice situations, song models with the temporal pattern of T. cantans' did not attract T. viridissima.. Models with the conspecific time pattern but heterospecific spectrum were as attractive as the conspecific model. In contrast. T. cantans was attracted by T. viridissima song presented alone. In choice situations, either spectral or temporal differences were sufficient for discrimination. The preference for the conspecific model gradually disappeared with stepwise reduction of its intensitv and was reversed at -12 dB. Acoustic communication alone can serve species isolation in T. viridissima; however, premating isolation in T. cantans must involve other mechanisms. The orientation during the choice situations suggests a serial processing of song recognition and localization for the Tettigonia species. 3ainterspecific variation 3aTettigonia viridissima 3ahearing 3aanimal communication 3afemales 3ataxis (physiology) 0aspecies differences 0asong pattern 0aTettigoniidae 0asongs 0acommunication 0acalling songs1 aHelversen, D. von.1 aWeber, T.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1998 May, v. 182, no. 5 p.687-694x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035900502133Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03890naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245020700180300001600387500002400403520173900427650003602166650003002202650004102232650001402273650001702287650001102304650001202315650001302327650001602340650002202356650001202378650003802390650003102428650004802459650004302507650002502550650003702575650001302612650005302625650005002678650005302728650003302781650002202814650005502836650004502891650004302936700001502979700001802994700001703012700001503029700001403044700001803058773010503076852000903181856008603190655001203276IND4477898620221122060139.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447789862DNAL7 a126504502pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.3.1882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsogai, M.14aThe 50-kDa Protein of Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus Interferes with Intracellular and Intercellular Targeting and Tubule-Inducing Activity of the 39-kDa Protein of Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus  ap. 188-195.  aIncludes references  aTo understand why transgenic Nicotiana occidentalis plants expressing a functional movement protein (MP) of Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) show specific resistance to Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus (GINV), the MPs of ACLSV (50KP) and GINV (39KP) were fused to green, yellow, or cyan fluorescent proteins (GFP, YFP, or CFP). These fusion proteins were transiently expressed in leaf cells of both transgenic (50KP) and nontransgenic (NT) plants, and the intracellular and intercellular trafficking and tubule-inducing activity of these proteins were compared. The results indicate that in epidermal cells and protoplasts from 50KP plant leaves, the trafficking and tubule-inducing activities of GINV-39KP were specifically blocked while those of ACLSV-50KP and Apple stem grooving virus MP (36KP) were not affected. Additionally, when 39KP-YFP and 50KP-CFP were coexpressed in the leaf epidermis of NT plants, the fluorescence of both proteins was confined to single cells, indicating that 50KP-CFP interferes with the cell-to-cell trafficking of 39KP-YFP and vice versa. Mutational analyses of 50KP showed that the deletion mutants that retained the activities described above still blocked cell-to-cell trafficking of 39KP, but the dysfunctional 50KP mutants could no longer impede cell-to-cell movement of 39KP. Transgenic plants expressing the functional 50KP deletion mutants showed specific resistance against GINV. In contrast, transgenic plants expressing the dysfunctional 50KP mutants did not show any resistance to the virus. From these results, we conclude that the specific resistance of 50KP plants to GINV is due to the ability of the 50KP to block intracellular and intercellular trafficking of GINV 39KP. 3aApple chlorotic leaf spot virus 3aApple stem grooving virus 3aGrapevine berry inner necrosis virus 3aNicotiana 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3amutants 3aproteins 3aprotoplasts 3atransgenic plants 3aviruses 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteins 2aLuminescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMalusxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicrotubule Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aPlant Epidermisxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aPlant Virusesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Transport 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aVitisxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology.1 aSaitou, Y.1 aTakahashi, N.1 aItabashi, T.1 aTerada, M.1 aSatoh, H.1 aYoshikawa, N.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.188-195dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.3.1883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02640naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245011000191300001600301500002400317520086100341650002101202650002401223650001501247650001001262650001701272650001101289650002401300650001301324650002301337650002101360650002901381650002701410650001201437650001801449650002901467650002801496650002501524650002601549650002901575650002501604650003701629650001301666650003101679650005501710650002701765700002501792700001701817700001601834700001401850700001401864773010801878852000901986856005501995655001202050IND4447965020221122041106.0110125e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444796502DNAL7 a207354932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01040.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Leeuwen, T.10aParallel evolution of cytochrome b mediated bifenazate resistance in the citrus red mite Panonychus citri  ap. 135-140.  aIncludes references  aBifenazate is a recently developed acaricide that is mainly used to control spider mites on a variety of crops. Although first thought to be a neurotoxin, genetic evidence obtained from bifenazate resistant Tetranychus urticae strains suggested an alternative mode of action as a Qo pocket inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex III. In this study, we reveal how bifenazate resistance in strains of Panonychus citri is maternally inherited and can confer cross-resistance to the known Qo inhibitor acequinocyl. The mitochondrial genome of P. citri was sequenced and Qo pocket mutations were shown to be linked with the resistant trait. Parallel evolution of cytochrome b mediated bifenazate resistance corroborates the alternative mode of action and yet again illustrates that care should be taken when employing Qo inhibitors as crop protection compounds. 3aPanonychus citri 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacaricides 3acrops 3acytochrome b 3agenome 3amechanism of action 3amutation 3aparallel evolution 3aplant protection 2aAcaricidesxpharmacology 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbamatesxpharmacology 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenome, Mitochondrial 2aHydrazinesxpharmacology 2aInheritance Patterns 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aMutation 2aNaphthalenesxpharmacology 2aTetranychidaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUbiquinonexmetabolism1 aVan Nieuwenhuyse, P.1 aVanholme, B.1 aDermauw, W.1 aNauen, R.1 aTirry, L.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2011 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.135-140dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01040.x 7aarticle02530naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006200127300001600189520174800205650001201953650001501965650001501980650004101995653001102036700001602047700001702063773010502080852000902185939003302194946001302227655001202240IND9205836120221122011118.0920918e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalton, L.R.10aCuring burley tobacco from an automated harvesting system  ap. 230-234.  aIf burley tobacco can be successfully cured at high density under waterproof covers in the field, a producer can expand production without the necessity of building new curing barns and can thereby more easily justify investment in the automated burley tobacco harvesting system (Wells et al., 1990 a, b). Curing under waterproof covers in the field and curing on frames in the barn were evaluated over three curing seasons using two varieties (KY 14 and TN 86), two plant densities (32 and 43 plants/m2, 3 and 4 plants/ft2), position of tobacco on the frame (four levels ranging from edge to center) and stalk position (bottom, middle and top). Conventionally cured tobacco was used as the standard of comparison and grade index was used as the assessment of quality. Averaged over a three-year period, burley tobacco cured in the field over sod and under waterproof covers and conventionally cured tobacco were of equal quality (56.0 and 55.8 grade index, respectively) and were both superior to tobacco cured on frames in the barn (52.0). During the dry curing season, burley tobacco cured under the covers had a higher grade index (54.9) than that cured conventionally (43.5) or on frames in the barn (43.7) but during the moderately wet and wet curing seasons, conventionally cured burley tobacco had a higher grade index (62.3 and 61.5, respectively) than that cured under covers (58.9 and 54.2, respectively) or on frame in the barn (59.0 and 53.4, respectively). During the wet curing season, leaf tips near the sod in the field and near the concrete in the barn cured dark red resulting in a lowered grade index. Burley tobacco from the automated harvesting system is better cured outside under waterproof covers than cured in a barn. 3atobacco 3aharvesting 3aautomation 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 0acuring1 aWells, L.G.1 aCasada, J.H.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 Mar., v. 7, no. 2 p.230-234wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01702naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010600127300001600233500001500249520093300264650002501197653001401222653001401236653001301250653001601263773009001279852000901369939003301378946001301411655001201424IND9205836920221122004821.0920918e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParish, R.L.10aEffect of material bouncing into and out of collection pans on observed spreader distribution pattern  ap. 311-315.  a2019-12-04  aASAE Standard S341.2 (ASAE, 1990) specifies that collection trays for pattern evaluation must have internal subdivisions to partially prevent material from bouncing out of the pans. The problem of material bouncing into the pans is not addressed in the standard. A laboratory experiment was conducted in which test runs were made: in the normal manner, with bounce into the pans eliminated by elevating the pans and spreader, and with bounce in and out completely eliminated by using deep pans and an elevated spreader. With large, spherical particles, there were significant differences in the amount of material collected under the three conditions. This resulted in significant differences in apparent application rate and smaller differences in apparent pattern quality. With large, spherical particles, over twice as much material was collected per pan in the standard test on concrete due to particle bounce into the pans. 3afertilizer spreaders 0aspreaders 0astandards 0apatterns 0aapplicators0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g1991 May, v. 7, no. 3 p.311-315x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01520naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001600219520076500235650004301000650002001043651001201063700001701075700001701092773009001109852000901199939003301208946001301241655001201254IND9205837320221122004814.0920918e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920583732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitts, D.J.14aThe effects of lateral tubing placement and number on drip irrigated tomatoes in Florida  ap. 338-342.  aAn experiment was conducted for two crop seasons (fall and spring) to determine the influence of location and number of drip irrigation lateral tubes on the growth and yield of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.).

We hypothesise that algae cultured under high nitrate concentrations can accumulate intracellular nitrite, which is produced by nitrate reductase (NR) and can inhibit the growth of algae. To assess the validity of this hypothesis, Microcystis aeruginosa was grown under different nitrate concentrations from 3.57 to 21.43 mM in low CO₂ and high CO₂ conditions for 15 days. We observed that, with increasing nitrate concentrations, the intracellular nitrite concentrations of the alga increased and the growth rates and photosynthesis declined. When grown under high CO₂ conditions, M. aeruginosa showed lower intracellular nitrite concentrations and higher growth rates and [graphic removed] , [graphic removed] , αchla than under low CO₂ conditions. These results suggest that the accumulation of intracellular nitrite could be the cause of inhibition of algal growth under high nitrate concentrations. 3acarbon dioxide 3aphytoplankton 3anitrate reductase 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3anitrites 3anitrates 0aGrowth characteristics 0aAlgae 0aIntracellular nitrite1 aZhang, Qingmin 1 aDai, Shugui 0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2009 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.701-706dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-009-9405-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20091120b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02183naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245003600126300001600162520155500178650000901733650002301742700001601765773008201781852000901863930003301872945001301905946001101918655001201929IND2061694520221121224548.0980205e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206169452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYau, N.J.N.10aSensory analysis of cooked rice  ap. 263-270.  aFour rice varieties, TNu 67, TNu 70, TC 189 and TC Sen 10, were tested, each was served at 18 degrees C and 60 degrees C. In total, eight samples were evaluated by 20 trained assessors using a modified quantitative descriptive analysis. Thirteen attributes were developed: glossiness, whiteness, looseness, hot-rice aroma, cold-rice aroma, brown-rice aroma, sweetness, kernelness, hardness, cohesiveness, stickiness, chewiness and roughness. Both the weakest and the strongest reference samples for each attribute were presented to assessors for general consensus. Intensity of each attributes was rated on a 15-point category scale (1 = weakest, 7 = moderate, 15 = strongest). The 18 degrees C and 60 degrees C samples were significantly different in nine attributes. Assessors found that the 60 degrees C samples were rated higher in looseness, hot-rice aroma, brown-rice aroma and sweetness but lower in cold-rice aroma, hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness and roughness. Across the four varieties there were significant differences in eleven attributes. TNu 67 samples were rated higher in cohesiveness and stickiness; TNu 70 samples were rated higher in hot-rice aroma, brown-rice aroma, hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness and roughness; TC 189 samples were rated higher in whiteness, kernelness, cohesiveness and stickiness; TC Sen 10 samples were rated higher in cold-rice aroma, kernelness, hardness and roughness but lower in glossiness. Therefore, both temperature and variety effects were significant on the sensory properties of cooked rice. 3arice 3asensory evaluation1 aHuang, J.J.0 tFood quality and preference.g1996 , v. 7, no. 3/4 p.263-270x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01585naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001600207520078900223650001701012651001101029653002001040653001101060653003101071700001601102700001501118773008401133852000901217930003301226945001301259946001101272655001201283IND2151386420221121224617.0980812e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215138642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGummeson, L.10aPredicting intentions and behaviour of Swedish 10-16-year-olds at breakfast  ap. 297-306.  aThe study applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to study the determinants of Swedish children's intentions and actual breakfast choices, the focus being upon healthy vs. unhealthy choices.

In addition, non-crop ditch sites were also sampled. Three species assemblages in the fields were strongly related to crop type, with two others consisting of non-crop sites, one dominated by field margins, the other by ditch sites. Species activity and richness in fields were also strongly, and significantly, associated with crop type, with most in organic Brassica crops (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli), less in organic leeks and least in conventional calabrese. Some species were significantly more active in weedier fields but others preferred more open ground. Considerably more species were recorded from first-year planted field margins, with fewest species active in unplanted margins. Activity was also relatively low in densely vegetated second-year margins. There appeared to be little relationship between species activity in the margins and that in the crop fields. Ground beetle species are important for the predation of cabbage root fly eggs in Brassica crops, especially in organic fields. In order to enhance and maximise appropriate ground beetle species activity and predation within vegetable fields, it is likely that management within both fields and margins would be required, as well as some method for increasing movement of predators from margins into fields. 3ainterspecific variation 3ainsect pests 3apredatory insects 3apitfall traps 3afields 3avegetable crops 3aedge effects 3aplant pests 3aintensive cropping 3aspecies diversity 3aorganic production 3anatural enemies 3acrop management 3aCarabidae 3aEngland 0aspecies differences1 aLabanowska-Bury, D.1 aAvayanos, J.G.1 aWhite, R.1 aLeifert, C.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.340-346dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01846naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007900128300001200207500001500219520099500234650001401229650001701243650002101260650002101281653002401302700001701326700001701343700001401360773008001374852000901454930003301463945001301496946001101509655001201520IND2138060420221121211936.0980807e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213806042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmstrong, G.10aSensory analysis and assessor motivation: can computers make a differences  ap. 1-7.  a2019-12-05  aThe potential value of using computerised systems in sensory analysis is discussed in this preliminary study. This included assessing the impact on panel motivation, and on the consistency of responses made through a comparison of manual and computerised methods. Accuracy and consistency appeared to improve significantly as the tests progressed, and on completing the session computer accuracy was superior. Hedonic tests provided substantial variation, although generally deviations in computer responses were lower. The affective tests produced a more erratic response pattern, although this may have been expected, due to the greater subjectivity involved. Finally, a focus group provided valuable reinforcement of results and clarification of assessor preferences. The computerised sensory system was unanimously preferred and may provide an effective tool in maintaining motivation levels. However, careful and consistent management is still required if results are to be meaningful. 3alibraries 3afood quality 3afood composition 3acomputer science 0ainformation science1 aMcIlveen, H.1 aMcDowell, D.1 aBlair, I.0 tFood quality and preference.g1997 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.1-7x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155100002000164245009200184300001600276500002400292500001500316520188900331650002502220650001302245650002502258650002002283650001502303650002202318650001202340650002302352650001902375650001602394650002902410650002202439650002002461650002802481651001202509653002302521653001702544700002102561773010802582852000902690856008602699930003302785945002502818946001102843655001202854IND4418972220221121211909.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aP2001 aWithers, P.J.A.14aThe effect of farming practices on phosphorus transfer to a headwater stream in England  ap. 347-355.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCharacterization of phosphorus (P) sources in catchments is critical to the restoration of stream integrity following eutrophication. To better understand the effects of farming practices on P transfer in a small rural mixed farming catchment (Rosemaund), spatial and temporal patterns in P delivered from a field-drain (Foxbridge, 6ha), and to two downstream stations (Jubilee, 31ha and Belmont, 150ha) were investigated in relation to detailed records on cultivation practices and fertilizer/manure P inputs over a 3-year period (1997-2000) with above-average rainfall. The Belmont catchment also included a farmstead and a small sewage treatment works (STW). The main source of P in drainflow (December-April) was the soil with flow-weighted concentrations of particulate P (PP) up to 2mgL⁻¹ and concentrations of dissolved-reactive P (DRP) (0.1-0.4mgDRPL⁻¹) above current riverine targets to limit eutrophication. Agricultural operations carried out in autumn/early winter sporadically increased concentrations of DRP (fertilizer/manure applications) and PP (cultivations) in drain/stream discharge, but only during events that produced small amounts of stormflow. Occasionally large DRP and PP concentrations in drainflow were also recorded during the ecologically sensitive summer months, but this was unrelated to any farming practice. Stream P concentrations were further influenced by processes of baseflow dilution, in-stream retention/release and discharges from the STW and farmstead. The results highlight the disparity between the timing of farming operations at this site (autumn/early winter), the main period of land drainage (winter/spring) and the main period of biological activity (spring and summer). A greater understanding of the ecological significance of variably timed P inputs to headwater streams is needed to develop effective catchment management. 3aenvironmental impact 3adrainage 3awatershed management 3afarming systems 3aphosphorus 3adrainage channels 3astreams 3aseasonal variation 3aeutrophication 3arural areas 3asoil transport processes 3aspatial variation 3acrop management 3aagricultural watersheds 3aEngland 0atemporal variation 0astream water1 aHodgkinson, R.A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2009 June, v. 131, no. 3-4 p.347-355dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2009.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02138naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006400125300001400189520129700203650002501500650002301525650001001548650001601558653002001574653001901594653001601613700001701629700001801646773008201664852000901746930003301755945001301788946001101801655001201812IND2138061120221121160954.0980807e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213806112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisvik, E.10aEvaluation of sensory profiling and projective mapping data  ap. 63-71.  aThis paper deals with the method of projective mapping and its use in sensory analysis. Projective mapping is a method which allows naive consumers to map products on a two dimension space, based on similarities and differences in the products. An experiment was carried out on seven blueberry soups, whereby sensory profiling was undertaken using a trained panel and projective mapping. Preference assessment was undertaken using a small group of consumers. Results indicated that the three replicates of the mapping exercise produced visually very similar maps, at least on the first two dimensions. However, it was found that consumers perceived the samples in somewhat different ways as highlighted by RV coefficients. The consensus mapping dimensions were compared to those from the profile data, and it was apparent that the best similarity was found when comparing the first dimension, thus suggesting good agreement on the obvious aspects of the product. The internal preference map also revealed major product contrasts along this dimension with some weak evidence of segmentation. The overall conclusion of this paper raises further fundamental questions about consensus spaces with consumers, and the question of dimensionality of consumer perception as compared to trained panels. 3aconsumer preferences 3asensory evaluation 3asoups 3adried foods 0aconsumer panels 0atrained panels 0adried soups1 aMcEwan, J.A.1 aRodbotten, M.0 tFood quality and preference.g1997 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.63-71x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03679naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002300175245006200198300001600260500002400276500001500300520202800315650001702343650002002360650002702380650002202407650002402429650001802453650002002471650002002491650002602511650001802537650001702555650001202572650003102584650001302615650002202628653001202650653001602662653001602678700002602694700001902720700001902739700001502758700001902773700001602792773011502808852000902923856008802932930003303020945002503053946001103078655001203089IND4418972720221121160927.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2009.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aP050 0aX6001 aMoll, Remington J.12aA terrestrial animal-borne video system for large mammals  ap. 133-139.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnimal-borne video and environmental data collection systems (AVEDs) are integrated sensor systems that collect video from the animal's perspective and combine it with data from other sensors, including audio, location, temperature, acceleration, and other data. By placing sensor data within the context of video, AVEDs provide a unique perspective not offered by other methods and facilitate research into animal behavior and foraging tactics, animal energetics, wildlife damage issues, and inter- and intra-specific interactions. Marine AVEDs have outpaced their terrestrial counterparts in technological sophistication and store all data onboard. Terrestrial systems have been transmission-based and thus have been deployed on species that are easily tracked or habituated to humans. We present the first terrestrial, store-onboard AVED developed for large mammals and demonstrate the utility of our AVEDs by quantifying and describing contacts among white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Our system was largely developed from commercially available equipment and included a camera, microcomputer, and a sensor board attached to a neck collar with affixed battery packs. We deployed the system on 2 semi-wild and 2 free-ranging deer. We collected 12.2, 12.3, 30.3, and 41.6h of video during our deployments; the 2 lowest recording durations were the result of blown fuses in the battery packs. We observed 11 contacts among white-tailed deer during 4 deployments. Contacts comprised a total of 22.8min (mean = 2.1 min / contact , SE=0.7). Our AVEDs revealed several behaviors during contacts between individual white-tailed deer, including inspection, avoidance, and grooming. These data are not captured by other techniques (e.g., radio telemetry) and demonstrate the utility of continuous video and other sensors from the animal's perspective. Although AVEDs are a powerful new tool for wildlife research and management, their use should be preceded by careful formulation of research and management objectives. 3aacceleration 3aanimal behavior 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aenergy metabolism 3awildlife management 3avideo cameras 3aair temperature 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3adata analysis 3awild animals 3amammals 3aglobal positioning systems 3aforaging 3aexperimental rigs 0asensors 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aMillspaugh, Joshua J.1 aBeringer, Jeff1 aSartwell, Joel1 aHe, Zhihai1 aEggert, Jay A.1 aZhao, Xiwen0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2009 May, v. 66, no. 2 p.133-139dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2009.01.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02470naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002100166245011900187300001600306500002400322500001500346520102000361650001201381650002301393650002201416650001901438650002201457650002701479650002501506650001801531650001701549651001101566653001601577653001601593653001801609653001601627653002501643653003901668773011501707852000901822856008801831930003301919945002501952946001101977655001201988IND4418973220221121161017.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2009.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK810 0aX1001 aMagnussen, Steen12aA Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to joint simulation of regional areas burned annually in Canadian forest fires  ap. 173-180.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA simulation of regional and national forest carbon balance in Canada requires, due to regional correlations, a joint simulation of areas burned (BA) in regional fires. Regional correlations of BA are largely determined by concurrent years of relatively large (LF) and small fires (SF). A binary Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure (MCMC) is constructed for forecasting regional LF(SF) status on an annual basis. For each forecast year the regional BA-value is obtained by a random draw from region-specific empirical quantile functions for LF and SF years. In the MCMC the conditional likelihood of a regional allocation of nLF* LF-years is maximized; whereby nLF* is drawn from a distribution fitted to LF(SF) classified data of area burned in 29 Canadian forest fire regions between 1959 and 1999. Regional allocation is governed by region-specific autologistic functions. MCMC results confirmed regional and national means and variances while regional correlations were generally somewhat lower than in the data. 3ahistory 3aMonte Carlo method 3asimulation models 3aboreal forests 3atemperate forests 3ageographical variation 3acarbon sequestration 3adata analysis 3aforest fires 3aCanada 0alarge fires 0aarea burned 0aMarkov chains 0asmall fires 0astatistical analysis 0aMarkov Chain Monte Carlo procedure0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2009 May, v. 66, no. 2 p.173-180dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2009.01.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090824b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02056naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245017100123300001600294500001500310520102500325650001101350650002001361650001501381650001001396650002901406650002201435650002001457650001201477653002501489700001801514700001701532773007901549852000901628930003301637945001301670946001101683655001201694IND2327698320221121135025.0020625e200111  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232769832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoco, T.10aDetermination of the neutral and acidic glycosyl-residue compositions of plant polysaccharides by GC-EI-MS analysis of the trimethylsilyl methyl glycoside derivatives  ap. 249-259.  a2019-12-05  aA method, using GC-EI-MS analysis of the trimethylsilyl methyl glycoside derivatives, has been developed to identify the neutral and acidic glycosyl-residue compositions of plant polysaccharides. Monosaccharides (15) including four pentoses (arabinose, xylose, 2-O-methylxylose, and apiose), three hexoses (galactose, glucose, and mannose), three 6-deoxy hexoses (rhamnose, fucose, and 2-O-methylfucose), two hexuronic acids (galacturonic and glucuronic acids), two 2-keto-3-deoxy sugars (Kdo and Dha), and aceric acid were quantified. The monosaccharide derivatives were identified by their retention times and by their characteristic GC-MS fragmentation patterns. These monosaccharides are components of plant cell wall polysaccharides and red wine polysaccharides. Thus, GC-MS analysis of trimethylsilyl methyl glycoside derivatives is suitable for determining the neutral and acidic glycosyl-residue compositions of plant cell wall polysaccharides and of polysaccharides present in plant-derived foods and beverages. 3aapples 3amonosaccharides 3acell walls 3awines 3acarbohydrate composition 3aplant-based foods 3apolysaccharides 3acarrots 0achemical composition1 aO'Neill, M.A.1 aPellerin, P.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2001 Nov., v. 46, no. 3 p.249-259x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02259naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245008800161300001800249520112200267650002301389650001701412650002701429650001601456650002101472650000901493650001201502650001201514650001401526650001101540650001301551650002301564650002901587700002101616773008901637852000901726856008201735939003301817946001101850655001201861IND4464064320221121135100.0120910e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446406432DNAL7 a10.5713/ajas.2003.17772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jeong-Dae10aDietary Lysine Requirement of Juvenile Yellowtail Flounder Pleuronectes Ferrugineus  ap. 1777-1781.  aThe lysine requirements of juvenile yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferrugineus) having 19.5 g initial body weight were estimated by feeding six practical-type diets containing graded levels of lysine (1.21 to 2.69% of dry diet). Dietary amino acid profile simulated that of whole body of yellowtail flounder. Most of amino acids in the diets were provided by corn gluten meal, herring meal and gelatin. Protein efficiency ratio (PER) improved significantly until lysine level increased up to 2.1% (4.3% of protein). Same trend was observed in feed:gain ratio (FGR) which maintained constant in fish groups fed diets containing lysine above 2.1%. The highest nitrogen gain (0.34 g/fish) in whole body was found in fish fed 2.1% lysine, though the value was not different from those of fish fed above the level of lysine. Fish fed 2.1% lysine also showed the best nitrogen retention efficiency of 24.6%. The broken-line analysis of protein efficiency ratio and body nitrogen gain against dietary lysine level yielded an estimated lysine requirement of 2.2% (4.5% of protein) and 2.3% (4.7% of protein), respectively. 3aLimanda ferruginea 3aPleuronectes 3aamino acid composition 3abody weight 3acorn gluten meal 3adiet 3agelatin 3aherring 3ajuveniles 3alysine 3anitrogen 3anitrogen retention 3aprotein efficiency ratio1 aLall, Santosh P.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.1777-1781x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.17773Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120910  aNon-US 7aarticle02215naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002000159245010500179300001600284500002400300520080200324650002001126650001901146650001401165650001601179650002001195650001501215650001701230650001001247650001301257650001801270650001901288653002301307653002601330653002101356653002901377700001701406700001501423700001501438773011201453852000901565856009001574930003301664945002501697946001101722655001201733IND4418974720221121135116.0090410e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441897472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2009.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1001 aJayasundera, M.10aSurface modification of spray dried food and emulsion powders with surface-active proteins: A review  ap. 266-277.  aIncludes references  aSpray drying is a well-established and widely used method for transforming a wide range of liquid food products into powder form. Stickiness is the limitation in spray drying of different sugar and acid-rich food products. To minimize this problem process and material science based approaches are in place. However, these remedies have their own drawbacks. Surface modification of droplets/particles is a novel way to minimize stickiness. It is timely that the research efforts on surface modification of droplets/particles be reviewed. Therefore, this review highlights the recent research dealing with surface modification of emulsions and spray dried powders. The theoretical foundation, mechanisms and methods used to achieve surface modification of food and emulsion powders are highlighted. 3aliquified foods 3asugar products 3aemulsions 3asurfactants 3aprotein content 3astickiness 3aspray drying 3aacids 3adroplets 3aparticle size 3apowdered foods 0aliterature reviews 0aspray-dried emulsions 0asugar-rich foods 0aspray-dried food powders1 aAdhikari, B.1 aAldred, P.1 aGhandi, A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2009 Aug., v. 93, no. 3 p.266-277dElsevier Science Pub.

Yields were 4.70% and 6.12%, respectively. Both pectin-enriched products were water soluble fibers and only the latter showed important thickening effect at 20gdm⁻³-concentration in water. This product was a highly methylated (methylation degree, DM, 72.6) pectin with 45.2g/100g of galacturonic acid and 11g/100g of neutral sugars. Cellulase produced intense hydrolysis leading to a less methylated (DM: 54.2) A-fraction. It was observed that not only average molecular weight, but also the molecular structure derived from chemical composition affected flow behavior and viscosity enhancing capacity. As A-fraction was enriched in rhamnogalacturonan I, probably, rhamnose kinks were responsible for the poor thickening effect at 20gdm⁻³-concentration in water, in spite of its homogeneous molecular weight profile, which showed only one peak at 793,000. This fraction presented the lowest density of macromolecular interactions in water, behaving as a diluted hydrocolloid solution as confirmed by its fitting to the Cox-Merz rule. Both isolated soluble fractions produced a delay in the glucose dialysis assay. 3aCucurbita moschata 3acell wall components 3achemical constituents of plants 3amesocarp 3afood processing wastes 3acellulases 3apectins 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3asoluble fiber 3amethylation 3aviscosity 0ahemicellulase1 aPonce, Nora M.1 aWider, Eva A.1 aStortz, Carlos A.1 aGerschenson, Lía N.1 aRojas, Ana M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2009 Aug., v. 93, no. 3 p.293-301dElsevier Science Pub.

Gravid does (18) were allotted to 3 dietary treatments HH, HL and LH in a completely randomized block design. All does were provided wheat straw ad libitum and supplemented with concentrate mixture at the rate of 20 g/kgW0.75 from 0-60 days post-mating. Subsequently, HH group was given concentrate at the rate of 40 g/kgW0.75 from 61 d post-mating to term. HL group was offered concentrate from 61-90 d post-mating and 121d post mating to term at the rate of 20 g/kg W0.75 and from 91-120 d post-mating at the rate of 40 g/kg W0.75. LH group was provided with concentrate from 61 to 120 d post-mating and 121 to term at the rate of 20 g and 40 g/kgW0.75, respectively. Mean total dry matter and concentrate intake (g/kgW0.75) was significantly higher on HH in comparison to comparable intake of HL and LH treatments, however, wheat straw followed the reverse trend. Haematological and biochemical parameters except serum glucose, total serum protein and A:G ratio did not differ significantly among dietary treatments. The gross gain in weight, products of pregnancy at 21 weeks of gestation, pregnant does average daily gain, birth weight of kids and survivability of kids were significantly lower in treatment HL in comparison to comparable values for HH and LH treatments. The net gain in gravid does was significantly higher in treatment HH than the comparable values obtained in HL and LH treatments. The last month of pregnancy was found to be nutritionally most sensitive period of gestation for native goats. 3aaverage daily gain 3abirth weight 3ablood glucose 3ablood proteins 3afeed supplements 3apregnancy 3areproductive performance 3aweight gain 3awheat straw1 aDutta, Narayan1 aSharma, K.0 pAsian-Australas. j. anim. scig2003 Dec., v. 16, no. 12 p.1725-1731x1011-23677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5713/ajas.2003.17253Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120910  aNon-US 7aarticle01969naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245007900186300001800265520064300283650001600926650001300942650002400955650001400979650001900993650003901012650001201051650002501063650004301088650002301131650002301154650001701177653001601194700001701210700002101227700001201248773013001260852000901390856009201399930003301491946001101524655001201535IND4411585920221121055141.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441158592DNAL7 a187177492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01598.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGANDON, S.10aHost-parasite coevolution and patterns of adaptation across time and space  ap. 1861-1866.  aThe description of coevolutionary dynamics requires a characterization of the evolutionary dynamics of both the parasite and its host.

We propose that measures of adaptation (mean population fitness) across time or space may represent a feasible alternative approach for characterizing important features of the coevolutionary process. We discuss recent experimental work in the light of simple mathematical models of coevolution to demonstrate the potential power of this phenotypic experimental approach. 3acoevolution 3agenetics 3amathematical models 3aparasites 3aspace and time 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTime Factors 0aadaptations1 aBUCKLING, A.1 aDECAESTECKER, E.1 aDAY, T.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2008 Nov., v. 21, no. 6 p.1861-1866dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01598.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081017b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03900naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014000183300001800323520187800341650001302219650001202232650005302244650001202297650001402309650001502323650002002338650002202358650004502380650002302425650005602448650003902504650004002543650003602583650000902619650002502628650002002653650001302673650004602686650002702732650001702759653001602776653001902792653003202811653002102843653003302864653002102897700001502918700001602933700001702949700001602966700001602982700001602998773011003014852000903124856008503133930003303218946001103251655001203262IND4411305720221121055231.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441130572DNAL7 a187629082pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-008-1134-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, M. 10aLoss of insulin-induced inhibition of glucagon gene transcription in hamster pancreatic islet alpha cells by long-term insulin exposure  ap. 2012-2021.  aAims/hypothesis Diabetes mellitus type 2 is characterised by hyperglucagonaemia, resulting in hepatic glucose production and hyperglycaemia. Considering that insulin inhibits glucagon secretion and gene transcription, hyperglucagonaemia in the face of hyperinsulinaemia in diabetes mellitus type 2 suggests that there is insulin resistance also at the glucagon-producing pancreatic islet alpha cells. However, the molecular mechanism of alpha cell insulin resistance is unknown. Therefore, the effect of molecules implicated in conferring insulin resistance in some other tissues was investigated on insulin-induced inhibition of glucagon gene transcription in alpha cells. Methods Reporter gene assays and biochemical techniques were used in the glucagon-producing hamster pancreatic islet alpha cell line InR1-G9. Results From among 16 agents tested, chronic insulin treatment was found to abolish insulin-induced inhibition of glucagon gene transcription. Overproduction of constitutively active protein kinase B (PKB) still inhibited glucagon gene transcription after chronic insulin treatment; together with a markedly reduced insulin-induced phosphorylation and, thus, activation of PKB, this indicates that targets upstream of PKB within the insulin signalling pathway are affected. Indeed, chronic insulin treatment markedly reduced IRS-1 phosphorylation, insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation and IR content. Cycloheximide and in vivo labelling experiments attributed IR downregulation to enhanced degradation. Conclusions/interpretation These results show that an extended exposure of alpha cells to insulin induces IR downregulation and loss of insulin-induced inhibition of glucagon gene transcription. They suggest that hyperinsulinaemia, through IR downregulation, may confer insulin resistance to pancreatic islet alpha cells in diabetes mellitus type 2. 3aglucagon 3ainsulin 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aCricetinae 2aDown-Regulation 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlucagonxgenetics 2aGlucagon-Secreting Cellsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aInsulinxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aInsulin Receptor Substrate Proteins 2aInterleukin-1betaxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlasmids 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransfection 0aAlpha cells 0aDownregulation 0aGlucagon gene transcription 0aInsulin receptor 0aInsulin receptor substrate-1 0aProtein kinase B1 aBöer, U. 1 aDickel, C. 1 aQuentin, T. 1 aCierny, I. 1 aOetjen, E. 1 aKnepel, W. 0 tDiabetologia.g2008 Nov., v. 51, no. 11 p.2012-2021dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-008-1134-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02355naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008200176300001600258500002400274520139500298650002601693650001501719650001101734650002201745650001701767650002201784650002301806650002301829700002301852773009001875852000901965856005501974655001202029IND4421064120221121044338.0090529e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442106412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17514.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaughlin, Daniel C.10aClimate-induced temporal variation in the productivity-diversity relationship  ap. 897-902.  aIncludes references  aSpatial scales are known to influence the form of the productivity-diversity relationship, but less attention has been given to the influence of temporal scales. Interannual climatic variation in semi-arid ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystems causes significant year-to-year differences in herbaceous production. We hypothesized that unimodal (or 'hump-backed') relationships would be detected between herbaceous production and species richness in wet years, whereas positive logarithmic relationships would be detected in dry years. We analyzed nine years of herbaceous production and species richness data and used Akaike's information criterion (AICc) to determine the weight of evidence for each model in each year. As predicted, species richness exhibited a unimodal relationship to herbaceous production in wet years; however, richness exhibited a logarithmic relationship with herbaceous production in dry years. These results suggest that competitive exclusion occurred within this semi-arid plant community in years of high production when enough moisture was available to drive abundant plant growth. Thus, just as it is important to sample broad spatial variation in production to detect the full unimodal productivity-diversity relationship, it is also important to recognize that the full unimodal curve may be undetectable in less productive dry years in semi-arid ecosystems. 3acompetitive exclusion 3aecosystems 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aplant growth 3aspecies diversity 3atemporal variation 3aweight-of-evidence1 aMoore, Margaret M.0 tOikos.g2009 June, v. 118, no. 6 p.897-902dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17514.x 7aarticle02567naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245013900184300001600323520095800339650003301297650001201330650002001342650003201362650004301394650001001437650000901447650004401456650003801500650002601538650001801564653003501582653002801617653002701645653003401672653002101706653003201727700001701759700001301776700001701789700001601806773010601822852000901928856009201937930003302029946001102062655001202073IND4416843120221121044321.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441684312DNAL7 a192504562pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03140.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPLUK, H.10aAdvantages of indium-tin oxide-coated glass slides in correlative scanning electron microscopy applications of uncoated cultured cells  ap. 353-363.  aA method of direct visualization by correlative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence light microscopy of cell structures of tissue cultured cells grown on conductive glass slides is described. We show that by growing cells on indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides, secondary electron (SE) and backscatter electron (BSE) images of uncoated cells can be obtained in high-vacuum SEM without charging artefacts. Interestingly, we observed that BSE imaging is influenced by both accelerating voltage and ITO coating thickness. By combining SE and BSE imaging with fluorescence light microscopy imaging, we were able to reveal detailed features of actin cytoskeletal and mitochondrial structures in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We propose that the application of ITO glass as a substrate for cell culture can easily be extended and offers new opportunities for correlative light and electron microscopy studies of adherently growing cells. 3ascanning electron microscopy 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxcytology 2aFibroblastsxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aGlass 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanningxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescencexmethods 2aScattering, Radiation 2aTin Compounds 0aBackscattered electron imaging 0aconductive glass slides 0acorrelative microscopy 0afluorescence light microscopy 0aindium-tin oxide 0amouse embryonic fibroblasts1 aSTOKES, D.J.1 aLICH, B.1 aWIERINGA, B.1 aFRANSEN, J.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2009 Mar., v. 233, no. 3 p.353-363dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03140.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02675naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245009400159300001800253500002400271500001500295520156800310650001401878650001001892650001601902650001701918650001401935650002201949650002401971650001201995650001002007650002702017650001602044650001302060650002302073653001102096700001802107773008302125852000902208856004802217655001202265IND4419952020221121034406.0090501e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441995202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-009-0912-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hao14aThe short-rooted vitamin B₆-deficient mutant pdx1 has impaired local auxin biosynthesis  ap. 1303-1310.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. Auxin often acts distantly from the site of its biosynthesis and this long-distance-transported auxin is well known to play a critical role in eliciting physiological responses including regulating root development. Auxin can be produced in roots, yet the function of locally synthesized auxin in root growth is unclear. The major auxin in plants, indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), is mainly synthesized through tryptophan (Trp)-dependent pathways that require pyridoxal phosphate (an active form of vitamin B₆)-dependent enzymes. We previously reported that the Arabidopsis vitamin B₆ biosynthesis mutant pdx1 has stunted root growth although the underlying cause is unknown. Here we showed that the pdx1 root is deficient in auxin biosynthesis. By reciprocal grafting of pdx1 and the wild type, we demonstrated that the stunted root growth in pdx1 is caused by a locally generated signal(s) in roots. To test whether auxin might be one such signal, the auxin responsive DR5::GUS reporter was introduced into the mutant. The DR5::GUS activity in pdx1 root tips was greatly reduced compared with that in the wild type although the auxin response was unaltered. pdx1 also suppresses the root hair growth defects in the auxin overproduction mutant yucca. These data indicate that pdx1 is impaired in Trp-dependent auxin biosynthesis, which may contribute to the short-root phenotype of pdx1. We suggest that locally synthesized auxin may play a critical role in postembryonic root growth. 3aroot tips 3aYucca 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3aphenotype 3aplant development 3apyridoxal phosphate 3aenzymes 3aacids 3aphysiological response 3aroot growth 3avitamins 3aindole acetic acid 0aplants1 aXiong, Liming0 tPlanta.g2009 May, v. 229, no. 6 p.1303-1310dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-0912-8 7aarticle03968naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001500193245020400208300001800412520169000430650002502120650005102145650007402196650004502270650004102315650004102356650004102397650001102438650004102449650002302490650004502513650003002558650004402588650005102632650002802683650004802711650004802759650005502807650006602862653001802928653000802946653004102954700001602995700002003011700001903031700001503050700002203065700001903087773012503106852000903231856009203240930003303332946001303365655001203378IND4415292720221121023047.0090123e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441529272DNAL7 a191964302pmid7 aPMC26469092pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05856.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuelin10aMutant copper-zinc superoxide dismutase associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis binds to adenine/uridine-rich stability elements in the vascular endothelial growth factor 3'-untranslated region  ap. 1032-1044.  aVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a neurotrophic factor essential for maintenance of motor neurons. Loss of this factor produces a phenotype similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently showed that ALS-producing mutations of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) disrupt post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF mRNA, leading to significant loss of expression [ Lu et al., J. Neurosci.27 (2007), 7929 ]. Mutant SOD1 was present in the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with adenine/uridine-rich elements (ARE) of the VEGF 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Here, we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that mutant SOD1 bound directly to the VEGF 3'-UTR with a predilection for AREs similar to the RNA stabilizer HuR. SOD1 mutants A4V and G37R showed higher affinity for the ARE than L38V or G93A. Wild-type SOD1 bound very weakly with an apparent Kd 11- to 72-fold higher than mutant forms. Mutant SOD1 showed an additional lower shift with VEGF ARE that was accentuated in the metal-free state. A similar pattern of binding was observed with AREs of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8, except only a single shift predominated. Using an ELISA-based assay, we demonstrated that mutant SOD1 competes with HuR and neuronal HuC for VEGF 3'-UTR binding. To define potential RNA-binding domains, we truncated G37R, G93A and wild-type SOD1 and found that peptides from the N-terminal portion of the protein that included amino acids 32-49 could recapitulate the binding pattern of full-length protein. Thus, the strong RNA-binding affinity conferred by ALS-associated mutations of SOD1 may contribute to the post-transcriptional dysregulation of VEGF mRNA. 3aRNA-binding proteins 2a3' Untranslated Regionsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosisxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aAntigens, Surfacexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aELAV Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-8xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPeptide Fragmentsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Bindingxgenetics 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxphysiology 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptionalxgenetics 2aRNA Stabilityxgenetics 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Axbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aRNA stability 0aHuR 0aelectrophoresis mobility shift assay1 aLü, Liang.1 aBush, Donald J.1 aZhang, Xiaowen1 aZheng, Lei1 aSuswam, Esther A.1 aKing, Peter H.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Feb., v. 108, no. 4 p.1032-1044dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05856.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090123b20090206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03170naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245015400163300001600317500002400333520201000357650002602367650001502393650002202408650001202430650002002442650002002462650001002482650001602492650001802508650002202526650002202548651001202570700001402582700002102596773011002617852000902727856004802736655001202784IND4419088120221121015028.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441908812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-009-0258-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Dajana10aRegional employment trends of wood-based industries in Germany's forest cluster: a comparative shift-share analysis of post-reunification development  ap. 205-219.  aIncludes references  aAfter reunification in 1990, Germany's forest cluster developed anew and employment in the wood-based industries differentiated very quickly. With more than 900,000 employees, it is now considered one of the most important industrial sectors in the country. This paper analysed general trends in the development of employment of wood-based industries in the German forest cluster between 1999 and 2006. Shift-share analysis was considered to be the most appropriate way to determine regional differences in the subsection DD/20 'Manufacture of wood and wood products' of the code “Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, Revision 1.1” (NACE): the sawmill industry, the wood-based panel industry, the wood construction industry, the wood-based packaging industry, and the miscellaneous wood products industry. This method decomposed the change of employment into three different components that are due to that change: national trends, (industrial) sectoral trends, and regional conditions. Employment in the selected wood-based industries showed a significantly larger decrease than overall trends in both the producing industries and the whole economy of Germany: a continual loss of employees could be observed over the time period, affecting almost all of the selected wood-based industries. However, federal states in western and eastern Germany experienced divergent trends between 1999 and 2006, as different absolute and relative regional share components indicated in the shift-share analysis. This method allows of identifying regional disparities and characterising regions with positive (mainly eastern federal states) and negative (mainly western federal states) rates of employment growth. The research suggests that positive employment trends in eastern Germany's wood-based industries can mainly be attributed to regional factors such as comparatively higher subsidies for new investments, lower labour costs, lower land values or infrastructural peculiarities. 3aconstruction industry 3aemployment 3aforest industries 3aforests 3ahuman resources 3aindustry trends 3alabor 3aland values 3amanufacturing 3awood construction 3awood-based panels 3aGermany1 aKies, Uwe1 aSchulte, Andreas0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2009 May, v. 128, no. 3 p.205-219dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-009-0258-6 7aarticle03252naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011500172300001600287500002400303520183100327650001902158650001302177650001202190650001602202650001402218650001302232650000902245650001402254650001802268650001602286650001702302650001902319650001302338650003102351650001902382650002002401650001302421650001802434650002702452650001102479700002602490700002602516700002502542773012702567852000902694856005502703655001202758IND4456365420221120233531.0110408e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445636542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2009.00472.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFUNDO, JOANA F.10aDevelopment of a safer formulation of egg yolk cream: physicochemical and sensorial characteristics assessment  ap. 220-235.  aIncludes references  aEgg yolk cream is a sweet confectioned with egg yolk, sugar and water. The use of raw egg products is a potential safety hazard in its production. In this work, a safer formulation is developed by using an easier to manipulate raw material - pasteurized liquid egg. Because of previous heat treatment, pasteurized liquid egg presents different sensorial, nutritional and physical properties. These changes may alter the final product's characteristics. In this work, a study on adding pasteurized egg white (as bulking agent) to the pasteurized liquid yolk was carried out. Samples made with shell eggs and with pasteurized liquid eggs were compared in terms of physical and chemical parameters. Results allowed characterizing the properties of typical egg cream and of alternative formulations using pasteurized egg yolk and white. A new formula of egg cream was developed and its sensorial acceptance was tested against the typical formulation. PRATICAL APPLICATIONS: In this article, research on substituting intact raw eggs by pasteurized ones in egg yolk cream typical production is presented. This kind of product can be used in pastry fillings and toppings, or consumed as a sweet desert and also as a basis for production of several different deserts, such as fruit and nut custards. Eggs are an extremely important ingredient for food industries because of its technological and sensorial characteristics. The use of pasteurized eggs in foods formulation is a powerful instrument to improve the product's safety. However, the product's quality attributes must be preserved. In this research, the effect of an ingredient's pasteurization in a food product's rheological properties is analyzed. Also, the importance of rheological studies in new food products development and quality control is once again demonstrated. 3abulking agents 3acustards 3adeserts 3aegg albumen 3aegg shell 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aequipment 3afood industry 3aingredients 3anew products 3apasteurization 3apastries 3aphysicochemical properties 3aproduct safety 3aquality control 3araw eggs 3araw materials 3arheological properties 3asugars1 aQUINTAS, MAFALDA A.C.1 aBRANDÃO, TERESA R.S.1 aSILVA, CRISTINA L.M.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2011 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.220-235dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2009.00472.x 7aarticle03739naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245013400165300001600299500002400315500001500339520183800354650001202192650001802204650003502222650001202257650001502269650001202284650002202296650001402318650002002332650002102352650001802373650002002391650001102411650002102422650001902443650001802462650002302480650002902503650001902532650001702551650000902568650001402577650002002591650002102611650001102632650001202643650002502655650001802680653002702698700002102725700002202746700002802768700002402796700002702820700002402847773012302871852000902994856008603003655001203089IND4477905220221120200936.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790522DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.8.7092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandon, Karine14aThe Sinorhizobium meliloti Glycine Betaine Biosynthetic Genes (betICBA) Are Induced by Choline and Highly Expressed in Bacteroids  ap. 709-719.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe symbiotic soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti has the capacity to synthesize the osmoprotectant glycine betaine from choline-O-sulfate and choline. This pathway is encoded by the betICBA locus, which comprises a regulatory gene, betI, and three structural genes, betC (choline sulfatase), betB (betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase), and betA (choline dehydrogenase). Here, we report that betICBA genes constitute a single operon, despite the existence of intergenic regions containing mosaic elements between betI and betC, and betB and betA. The regulation of the bet operon was investigated by using transcriptional lacZ (β-galactosidase) fusions and has revealed a strong induction by choline at concentrations as low as 25 μM and to a lesser extent by choline-O-sulfate and acetylcholine but not by osmotic stress or oxygen. BetI is a repressor of the bet transcription in the absence of choline, and a nucleotide sequence of dyad symmetry upstream of betI was identified as a putative betI box. Measurements of intracellular pools of choline, well correlated with β-galactosidase activities, strongly suggested that BetI senses the endogenous choline pool that modulates the intensity of BetI repression. In contrast to Escherichia coli, BetI did not repress choline transport. During symbiosis with Medicago sativa, S. meliloti bet gene expression was observed within the infection threads, in young and in mature nodules. The existence of free choline in nodule cytosol, peribacteroid space, and bacteroids was demonstrated, and the data suggest that bet regulation in planta is mediated by BetI repression, as in free-living cells. Neither Nod nor Fix phenotypes were significantly impaired in a betIΩ mutant, indicating that glycine betaine biosynthesis from choline is not crucial for nodulation and nitrogen fixation. 3acholine 3aarylsulfatase 3abetaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase 3acytosol 3anodulation 3abetaine 3anitrogen fixation 3aphenotype 3aregulator genes 3astructural genes 3aacetylcholine 3agene expression 3aoxygen 3aEscherichia coli 3aosmotic stress 3asoil bacteria 3abeta-galactosidase 3atranscription (genetics) 3aintergenic DNA 3abiosynthesis 3aloci 3asymbiosis 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aoperon 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aosmotolerance 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aØsterås, Magne1 aBoncompagni, Eric1 aTrinchant, Jean Charles1 aSpennato, Guillaume1 aPoggi, Marie Christine1 aLe Rudulier, Daniel0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.709-719dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.8.7093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002500160245008600185300001600271520141400287650002701701650001101728650001001739650001401749650001901763650001201782650002101794650002101815650003301836650002401869650004401893650001101937653001901948653001901967653001701986653001902003653002402022700001502046700001702061773009202078852000902170856008102179930003302260945001302293946001102306655001202317IND2327794820221120200917.0020630e200104  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232779482DNAL7 a114012012pmid7 a10.1007/s0035901001922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHempel de Ibarra, N.10aDetection of coloured patterns by honeybees through chromatic and achromatic cues  ap. 215-224.  aWe asked whether the detection range of two-coloured centre-surround patterns differs from that of single-coloured targets. Honeybees Apis mellifera were trained to distinguish between the presence and absence of a single-coloured disc or a coloured pattern at different visual angles. The patterns presented colours which were either different in chromatic and L-receptor contrasts to the background, equal in chromatic but different in L-receptor contrasts, or vice-versa. Patterns with colours presenting only chromatic contrast were also tested. Patterns with higher L-receptor contrast in its outer than in its inner element were better detected than patterns with a reversed L-contrast distribution. However, both were detected worse than single-coloured discs of the respective colours. When the L-receptor contrast was the same for both elements, the detection range of the two-coloured and single-coloured targets was the same. Patterns whose colours lacked L-receptor contrast were detected just as single-coloured targets of the same colours. These results demonstrate that both chromatic and L-receptor contrasts mediate the detection of coloured patterns and that particular distribution of L-receptor contrast within a target are better detected than others. This finding is consistant with the intervention of neurons with centre-surround receptive fields in the detection of coloured patterns. 3aApis mellifera carnica 3avision 3acolor 3adetection 3aphotoreceptors 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aBehavior, Animal 2aColor Perceptionxphysiology 2aEyexultrastructure 2aPattern Recognition, Visualxphysiology 2aPlants 0avisual stimuli 0acolor patterns 0acolor vision 0apattern vision 0al receptor contrast1 aGiurfa, M.1 aVorobyev, M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2001 Apr., v. 187, no. 3 p.215-224x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0035901001923Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02727naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002600184245009300210300001600303500002400319500001500343520113200358650002901490650001401519650001901533650001101552650001701563650001601580650001301596650002301609650001701632650001501649650001901664650001601683650001901699650001901718650003101737650002401768650001501792651001101807653001601818653002001834700002601854773011501880852000901995856008802004930003302092945002502125946001102150655001202161IND4434562120221120200859.0100326e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2010.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE110 0aX620 0aD500 0aX2001 aBlauth, Dante Augusto12aA Web-based system for vineyards management, relating inventory data, vectors and images  ap. 182-188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA Web-based system is presented, integrating spatial information from remote sensing images, GPS measurements and inventory data. Monitoring, research and management of the grape production at Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil (624,000 metric tons in 2006) can be done through a system entirely based in open-source codes. Information from three different sources are integrated: Information on production comes from the State's Viticultural Inventory, detailing the regional yearly grape production; positional information comes from field GPS measurements of vine parcels and the system's capabilities of making maps; imagery information comes from aerial or satellite images. Further capabilities on image classification leads to the identification of vine areas; this allows crossing this data with information provided by owners. This system allows both the monitoring of grape production for administrative purposes and investigations either on regional land and soil cover, or in other applications derived from image classification. The system concept can be readily extended to other applications in land use monitoring. 3adecision support systems 3avineyards 3aimage analysis 3agrapes 3acrop acreage 3acartography 3aland use 3aaerial photography 3aspatial data 3acrop yield 3aworld wide web 3afruit crops 3aVitis vinifera 3aremote sensing 3aglobal positioning systems 3aagricultural policy 3asatellites 3aBrazil 0aopen-source 0aland management1 aDucati, Jorge Ricardo0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2010 May, v. 71, no. 2 p.182-188dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.01.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100608b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002000193245010100213300001800314520121000332650001401542650001001556650002301566650002101589650004801610650001101658650001301669650001101682650000901693650001601702650002301718650004801741650000901789650002001798650001301818650002101831653002201852653001801874653002201892653000801914700002401922700002101946773009901967852000902066856009202075930003302167946001302200655001202213IND4412751220221120200911.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441275122DNAL7 a187959952pmid7 aPMC40493172pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01118.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, Noel T.14aThe Symmetry Rule: A Seven-Year Study of Symptoms and Explanatory Labels Among Gulf War Veterans  ap. 1737-1748.  aNoticing medical symptoms can cause one to search for explanatory labels such as "ate bad food" or even "exposed to anthrax," and perhaps these labels may cause new symptom reports. The present study examined whether there is empirical support for this symptom-label "symmetry rule." We interviewed veterans (N= 362) from the Gulf War Registry in 1995 and 2002 about their medical symptoms and about their exposure to war-related hazards and stressors. Health symptom reports were strongly correlated between the two time periods and showed relatively stable mean levels, whereas recall of war-related exposures was notably unstable. Veterans starting with fewer medical symptoms recalled fewer war-related exposures seven years later. Initial recollection of chemical and biological warfare exposure (but not other exposures) longitudinally predicted novel medical symptoms. The findings generally support the symmetry rule hypotheses, although the evidence for the label to symptom link was less strong. The findings account for some variability in symptoms and exposure recall over time, but they do not, on their own, account for the Gulf War veterans' elevated number of unexplained medical symptoms. 3aterrorism 2aAdult 2aBiological Warfare 2aChemical Warfare 2aCombat Disordersxcomplicationsxdiagnosis. 2aFemale 2aGulf War 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMilitary Personnel 2aPersian Gulf Syndromexdiagnosisxetiology. 2aRisk 2aRisk Assessment 2aVeterans 2aArmed Conflicts. 0aIllness cognition 0asymmetry rule 0asymptom reporting 0awar1 aHallman, William K.1 aKipen, Howard M.0 tRisk analysis.g2008 Dec., v. 28, no. 6 p.1737-1748dBlackwell Publishing Incx0272-43327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01118.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02572naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001700175245008400192300001600276500002400292520126500316650002301581650001501604650001401619650002401633650002201657650002401679650002001703650001301723650002001736653002901756653001301785653002401798700002301822773011501845852000901960856008801969930003302057945002502090946001102115655001202126IND4434561720221120191021.0100326e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2010.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aX100 0aX2001 aGocic, Milan10aSoftware for estimating reference evapotranspiration using limited weather data  ap. 158-162.  aIncludes references  aThe FAO-56 Penman-Monteith combination equation (FAO-56 PM) has been recommended as the standard equation for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET₀). The FAO-56 PM equation requires the numerous weather data that are not available in the most of the stations. The main goal of this paper is to present the software for estimating reference evapotranspiration, focusing on the feature of using limited weather data. This is simple Windows-based and user-friendly software provides methods to estimate extra-terrestrial radiation, maximum sunshine hours, daily net radiation and daily/monthly ET₀. The program is written in C# and includes comprehensive technical documentation. The software is available for free download. The weather data for this study were obtained from CIMIS for Davis weather station. The reduced-set FAO-56 PM approaches and adjusted Hargreaves equation were compared to the full-set FAO-56 PM equation. The FAO-56 reduced-set PM ET₀ estimates were in closest agreement with FAO-56 full-set PM ET₀ estimates. The adjusted Hargreaves equation (AHARG) was found to be in very good agreement with the full-set FAO-56 PM. This program is the first software facilitating calculation of ET₀ only with air temperature parameter. 3aevapotranspiration 3aestimation 3aequations 3ameteorological data 3acomputer software 3amathematical models 3asolar radiation 3aaccuracy 3aair temperature 0aPenman-Monteith equation 0afreeware 0aHargreaves equation1 aTrajkovic, Slavisa0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2010 May, v. 71, no. 2 p.158-162dElsevier Sciencex0168-16997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02086naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011900126300001600245520119700261650001301458650002501471650001301496650001401509650001601523650001201539650000801551650001001559650001201569700001601581773008501597852000901682930003301691945001301724946001101737655001201748IND2290665620221120181635.0010427e200007  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, W.E.10aDynamics of food breakdown during eating in relation to perceptions of texture and preference: a study on biscuits  ap. 259-267.  aCombined recording of masticatory muscle activity and jaw movement patterns during eating was used to examine the process of food breakdown in the mouth for a series of "Rich Tea"-type biscuits in 19 ordinary consumers. These data indicated an initial increase in chewing work from the masticatory muscles over the first 5-10 chews followed by a decline over the remainder of the chewing sequence. The work was concentrated in vertical closing of the jaw during the early chews but as this declined over the later chews there was an increase in the amount of work occurring with the teeth in near occlusion. The relative amount of work input into the chewing sequence, the duration of the sequence, and the degree of work undertaken at occlusion, differed among groups of the consumers who were classified according to their chewing efficiency (CE). Subjects from different CE groups appeared to have different understandings of the textural characteristics of the samples which they assessed as "hardness", "crunchiness" and "crumbliness". Differences in the oral breakdown patterns for different CE groups may provide an understanding of differences in consumer preferences for the samples. 3abiscuits 3aconsumer preferences 3ahardness 3aingestion 3amastication 3amuscles 3atea 3ateeth 3atexture1 aBraxton, D.0 tFood quality and preference.g2000 July, v. 11, no. 4 p.259-267x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02034naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245007600133300001600209520122600225650002501451650001501476650001901491650001101510650001601521700001901537700002401556773008601580852000901666930003301675945001301708946001101721655001201732IND2290666720221120181749.0010427e200009  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229066672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillanueva, N.D.M.10aPerformance of three affective methods and diagnosis of the ANOVA model  ap. 363-370.  aConsumer data arising from traditional scales frequently do not comply with ANOVA assumptions of normality, independence and homoscedasticity. Differential expansiveness of scoring between assessors is also a limitation in the use of scales. The self-adjusting scale was designed to minimize some of these problems but its performance with consumers has not been reported. This study compared the performance of the 9-point hedonic scale, the self-adjusting scale and the ranking test with respect to: differential expansiveness between assessors, discriminating power and compliance of data with ANOVA assumptions. Candies were evaluated by 288 consumers. Data normality was checked by normal probability plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. Homoscedasticity assumptions were evaluated by the Levene test and scatterplots. The self-adjusting scale was effective to deal with differential assessor expansiveness, produced homogeneous variances but its data showed gross deviations from normality. Hedonic scale data showed slight deviation from normality and lack of homoscedasticity. Rank and self-adjusting scale showed the highest and the lowest discriminating power, respectively. 3aanalysis of variance 3acompliance 3ahedonic scales 3amodels 3aprobability1 aPetenate, A.J.1 aSilva, M.A.A.P. da.0 tFood quality and preference.g2000 Sept., v. 11, no. 5 p.363-370x0950-32937nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02805naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245007000192300001800262500001500280520150900295650002401804650001501828650001401843650002501857650002701882650002401909650002001933650002901953650002001982653002002002653002302022653002002045700002502065700001802090700001702108773009902125852000902224856009202233930003302325946001302358655001202371IND4410368520221120173028.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441036852DNAL7 a188448612pmid7 a10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazir, Muddassir10aSubsea Release of Oil from a Riser: An Ecological Risk Assessment  ap. 1173-1196.  a2019-12-04  aThis study illustrates a newly developed methodology, as a part of the U.S. EPA ecological risk assessment (ERA) framework, to predict exposure concentrations in a marine environment due to underwater release of oil and gas. It combines the hydrodynamics of underwater blowout, weathering algorithms, and multimedia fate and transport to measure the exposure concentration. Naphthalene and methane are used as surrogate compounds for oil and gas, respectively. Uncertainties are accounted for in multimedia input parameters in the analysis. The 95th percentile of the exposure concentration (EC₉₅%) is taken as the representative exposure concentration for the risk estimation. A bootstrapping method is utilized to characterize EC₉₅% and associated uncertainty. The toxicity data of 19 species available in the literature are used to calculate the 5th percentile of the predicted no observed effect concentration (PNEC₅%) by employing the bootstrapping method. The risk is characterized by transforming the risk quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of EC₉₅% to PNEC₅%, into a cumulative risk distribution. This article describes a probabilistic basis for the ERA, which is essential from risk management and decision-making viewpoints. Two case studies of underwater oil and gas mixture release, and oil release with no gaseous mixture are used to show the systematic implementation of the methodology, elements of ERA, and the probabilistic method in assessing and characterizing the risk. 3aexposure assessment 2aAlgorithms 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Health 2aFossil Fuelsxanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOceans and Seas 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aWater Pollution 0arisk assessment 0aoil spill modeling 0aEcological risk1 aK̲h̲ān, Faiṣal.1 aAmyotte, Paul1 aSadiq, Rehan0 tRisk analysis.g2008 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.1173-1196dBlackwell Publishing Incx0272-43327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01136.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01980naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245005800164300001400222520099300236653002001229653004501249653002301294700001301317700001501330700001601345700001901361700001701380773011901397852000901516856008501525930003301610946001101643655001201654IND4413989720221120172936.0081219e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441398972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00396-008-1953-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharatiya, B. 10aUrea-induced demicellization of Pluronic L64 in water  ap. 63-71.  aThe micellar behavior of a polyethylene oxide block-polypropylene oxide block-polyethylene oxide copolymer Pluronic L64 in aqueous urea solutions (urea concentrations 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 M) by physical methods, viz. cloud point and viscosity, spectral techniques (Fourier transform infrared, fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance), differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic light scattering is reported. The presence of urea causes an increase in the clouding temperature, critical micellization temperature, and the structural transition (spherical micelles to ellipsoid/rod) temperature; different methods showed good agreement. Urea induces demicellization of L64, enhancing accumulation of water molecules surrounding micelles. L64 micelles show growth at high temperatures, but this micellar transition is suppressed by urea, as proven by calorimetric and viscometric methods. The results are discussed in terms of the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of urea. 0aDemicellization 0aCritical micellization temperature (CMT) 0aAggregation number1 aGuo, C. 1 aMa, J.

Blue-fronted Parrots Amazona aestiva are secondary cavity nesters that live in subtropical forests and savannas of central South America. We examined the characteristics of the trees and cavities used by this species in a protected area of the dry Chaco of Argentina and estimated nest-site fidelity and cavity reoccupation. We also assessed whether the probability of cavity reoccupation was associated with cavity characteristics and nesting success during the previous year. Nest-site fidelity of banded females was 68% and cavity reoccupation by banded and unbanded individuals 62%. Probability of reoccupation was associated with wall thickness and depth of the cavity, and was lower if the nest failed the previous year than if it was successful. The high rate of cavity reoccupation in Blue-fronted Parrots is largely attributable to strong nest-site fidelity and may reflect preferences for cavities whose characteristics are associated with higher nesting success. 3aAmazona 3afemales 3aforests 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3aparrots 3aprobability 3aprotected species 3asavannas 3atree cavities 3aArgentina 0abreeding success 0acompetition 0anest characteristics 0aPsittacines1 aREBOREDA, JUAN C.0 tIbis.g2009 Jan., v. 151, no. 1 p.145-150dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2008.00896.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081219b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03321naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002700165245009200192300001600284500002400300500001500324520167400339650001902013650001702032650001202049650002202061650001602083650001402099650001902113650001602132650002502148650002102173650001702194650001302211650003002224650001202254650001202266650001502278650001802293650001302311650004702324650002902371650005802400650002502458650001402483653002702497700002602524700001702550773010502567852000902672856008602681655001202767IND4477903720221120160851.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790372DNAL7 a128484222pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.5672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Lara, Isabel M.10aMembrane Lipids in Plant-Associated Bacteria: Their Biosyntheses and Possible Functions  ap. 567-579.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMembrane lipids in most bacteria generally consist of the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). A subset of bacteria also possesses the methylated derivatives of PE, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine, dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine (PC). In Sinorhizobium meliloti, which can form a nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis with Medicago spp., PC can be formed by two entirely different biosynthetic pathways, either the PE methylation pathway or the recently discovered PC synthase pathway. In the latter pathway, one of the building blocks for PC formation, choline, is obtained from the eukaryotic host. Under phosphorus-limiting conditions of growth, S. meliloti replaces its membrane phospholipids by membrane-forming lipids that do not contain phosphorus; namely, the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, or-nithine-derived lipids, and diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine. Although none of these phosphorus-free lipids is essential for growth in culture media rich in phosphorus or for the symbiotic interaction with the legume host, they are expected to have major roles under free-living conditions in environments poor in accessible phosphorus. In contrast, sinorhizobial mutants deficient in PC show severe growth defects and are completely unable to form nodules on their host plants. Even bradyrhizobial mutants with reduced PC biosynthesis can form only root nodules displaying reduced rates of nitrogen fixation. Therefore, in the cases of these microsymbionts, the ability to form sufficient bacterial PC is crucial for a successful interplay with their host plants. 3amicrosymbionts 3abiosynthesis 3acholine 3anitrogen fixation 3amethylation 3asymbiosis 3aBradyrhizobium 3ahost plants 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aroot nodules 3aMedicago 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3amutants 3alegumes 3aphosphorus 3aculture media 3abacteria 2aBacteriaxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCell Membranexchemistry 2aMembrane Lipidsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aSymbiosis 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aSohlenkamp, Christian1 aGeiger, Otto0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.567-579dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.5673Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03280naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008300187300001800270500002400288520155200312650002201864650001501886650001801901650000901919650001201928650001301940650002601953650001201979650001301991650001502004650001902019650001302038650001402051650003602065650001502101650001702116650003502133650001402168650003102182650001902213650008002232650007402312650005602386700002202442700002002464700001902484700002002503700001502523773011202538852000902650856005502659655001202714IND4422673920221120151008.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442267392DNAL7 a195085522pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01904.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTait, Karen10aTurnover of quorum sensing signal molecules modulates cross-kingdom signalling  ap. 1792-1802.  aIncludes references  aN-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing molecules modulate the swimming behaviour of zoospores of the macroalga Ulva to facilitate the location of bacterial biofilms. Here we show that the intertidal surfaces colonized by Ulva are dominated by Alphaproteobacteria, particularly the Rhodobacteraceae family, and the Bacteroidetes family Flavobacteriaceae, and that this diverse assemblage both produces and degrades AHLs. N-acylhomoserine lactones could also be extracted from the surfaces of pebbles recovered from intertidal rock-pools. Bacteria representative of this assemblage were isolated and tested for the production and degradation of AHLs, and for their ability to modulate zoospore settlement at different biofilm densities. Of particular interest was a Shewanella sp. This strain produced three major AHLs (OC4, OC10 and OC12) in the late exponential phase, but the longer-chain AHLs were rapidly degraded in the stationary phase. Degradation occurred via both lactonase and amidase activity. A close relationship was found between AHL synthesis and Ulva zoospore settlement. The Shewanella isolate also interfered with AHL production by a Sulfitobacter isolate and its ability to enhance zoospore settlement in a polymicrobial biofilm. This influence on the attachment of Ulva zoospores suggests that AHL-degrading strains can affect bacterial community behaviour by interfering with quorum sensing between neighbouring bacteria. More importantly, these interactions may exert wider ecological effects across different kingdoms. 3aFlavobacteriaceae 3aShewanella 3aSulfitobacter 3aUlva 3aamidase 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3alactones 3amacroalgae 3aquorum sensing 3aswimming 3azoospores 2aAcyl-Butyrolactonesxmetabolism 2aAntibiosis 2aBiodiversity 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aQuorum Sensing 2aRhodobacteraceaexenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aShewanellaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aUlvaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology.1 aWilliamson, Holly1 aAtkinson, Steve1 aWilliams, Paul1 aCámara, Miguel1 aJoint, Ian0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.1792-1802dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01904.x 7aarticle03054naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245005900171300001600230500002400246520214300270650001202413650001902425650001202444650002102456650001602477650002502493650001602518651001902534700002002553773009402573852000902667856005202676655001202728IND4445083820221120151225.0101113e20101126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444508382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Eleanor J.10aRegional drought over the UK and changes in the future  ap. 471-485.  aIncludes references  aThis paper develops tools to assess regional drought events based on limited periods of record and applies them to regional climate model output to examine potential future changes in drought due to increased greenhouse gases. The drought metric was defined as a monthly time series of standardized 12-month precipitation accumulations. Regional drought events were characterised by determining the severity, area, duration and frequency of dry periods. In order to improve statistical inference of drought events, a drought generator was adopted to synthesis a large number of events trained on the available data. In nearly all cases, the drought generator produces synthetic events with drought characteristics statistically indistinguishable from the training data. Severity-Area-Frequency (SAF) curves and Area-Probability (Area-P) curves could then be constructed from the synthetic data to determine the return period of a drought event of a given severity covering a given area. These techniques were applied to observations and to output from the Hadley Centre regional climate model (HadRM3). HadRM3, when driven by climate reanalysis data, has good correlation with the observed drought metric. HadRM3 also captures the timing of observed dry periods but not the relative seriousness of any particular period. Natural variability is large with regional drought characteristics highly dependent on the time period covered by the training data. Although the synthetic drought characteristics of HadRM3 generally overlap with the observed natural variability; the model slightly overestimates the area of observed drought; underestimate its frequency; and underestimate the severity at any given area. HadRM3 projections of changes in drought characteristics over the second half of the 21st century under increased atmospheric greenhouse gases hint at an increase in the severity of drought. However, any changes are not readily distinguishable from natural variability or projection uncertainty. Therefore it is not yet possible to robustly predict changes in UK meteorological droughts arising from increased greenhouse gasses. 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3adrought 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBrown, Simon J.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 Nov. 26, v. 394, no. 3-4 p.471-485dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.10.003 7aarticle03004naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245010100184300001600285500002400301520132900325650002001654650002301674650001101697650001401708650001001722650003101732650001001763650001401773650002101787650000901808650004201817650001001859650002301869650003301892650002201925650003801947650002701985650003702012650002102049650002802070650004402098650003102142650004202173700001702215700002402232773012302256852000902379856008602388655001202474IND4477904320221120151124.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790432DNAL7 a128484282pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.6262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeu, Christina10aCytological and Molecular Analysis of the Hordeum vulgare-Puccinia triticina Nonhost Interaction  ap. 626-633.  aIncludes references  aCultivated barley, Hordeum vulgare L., is considered to be a nonhost or intermediate host species for the wheat leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina. Here, we have investigated, at the microscopic and molecular levels, the reaction of barley cultivars to wheat leaf rust infection. In the nonhost resistant cultivar Cebada Capa, abortion of fungal growth occurred at both pre- and posthaustorial stages, suggesting that defense genes are expressed throughout the development of the inappropriate fungus during the nonhost resistance reaction. In the two barley lines L94 and Bowman, a low level of prehaustorial resistance to P. triticina was observed and susceptibility was comparable to that of wheat control plants. Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify genes that are differentially expressed during the nonhost resistance reaction in Cebada Capa as well as during the successful establishment of the inappropriate wheat leaf rust fungus in L94. Northern analysis indicated that two candidate genes, including a barley ortholog of the rice resistance gene Xa21, are putatively involved in non-host and non-race-specific resistance reactions. In addition, a new gene that is specifically induced during the successful development of the inappropriate fungus P. triticina in barley has been identified. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aPuccinia recondita 3abarley 3acultivars 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaf rust 3amicrobial growth 3arice 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3awheat 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aFungixphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHordeumxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aImmunity, Innate 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKeller, Beat1 aFeuillet, Catherine0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.626-633dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.6263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03692naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245019000182300001600372520177600388650001102164650001602175650001302191650001402204650002002218650001802238650001502256650001002271650001102281650004102292650001502333650001402348650001302362650001602375650001102391650003402402650001202436650006302448650002502511650002002536650005102556650004202607650001402649653000902663653000902672653000802681653001402689700001902703700001702722700001902739700001702758700002002775773013102795852000902926856008502935930003303020946001303053655001203066IND4413488720221120120016.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441348872DNAL7 a187732182pmid7 a10.1007/s00427-008-0241-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lifeng 10aCharacterization of AGAT, GAMT and CT1 in amphioxus: implications for the evolutionary conservation of creatine metabolism related molecules at the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition  ap. 681-689.  aIn vertebrates, glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT), guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and creatine transporter (CT1) are three proteins involved in creatine synthesis. To provide insight into the molecular evolution mechanism of creatine metabolism, we have cloned and identified BbAGAT, BbGAMT, and BbCT1 homologous genes in amphioxus (Branchiostoma belcheri), whose predicted proteins show high identities with AGAT, GAMT, and CT1 proteins in vertebrates. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that amphioxus AGAT, GAMT, and CT1 are branched off at the base of the vertebrate homologous clade, respectively. Genomic structures of BfAGAT, BfGAMT, and BfCT1 show their comparability with the homologs in vertebrate and original characteristic of cephalochordate, which is consistent with animal classification. To determine the expression patterns of BbAGAT, BbGAMT, and BbCT1, whole-mount and section in situ hybridizations are carried out in embryos and adults of amphioxus. During embryogenesis, they are all expressed mainly in mesendoderm and late somites, but BbCT1 is also expressed in differentiating notochord and digestive tract, as well as in the cytoplasm of zygotes and the blastomeres at cleavage stage. In adult, the transcripts of BbAGAT and BbGAMT are detected in the neural cord, gill, nephridia, endostyle, gut, and gonads, while BbCT1 is expressed mainly in the epithelium of gut. The expression pattern of these three genes is similar to their vertebrate homologs. The result reveals that AGAT, GAMT, and CT1, the primary elements of vertebrate creatine metabolism, exist in cephalochordate amphioxus, and are highly conserved during evolution. It also suggests that similar mechanism of creatine synthesis in vertebrate may occur in amphioxus. 3aadults 3ablastomeres 3acreatine 3acytoplasm 3adigestive tract 3aembryogenesis 3aepithelium 3agenes 3agonads 3aguanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3avertebrates 3azygote 2aAmidinotransferasesxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aChordata, Nonvertebratexembryologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCreatinexmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aGuanidinoacetate N-Methyltransferasexgenetics 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 0aAGAT 0aGAMT 0aCT1 0aAmphioxus1 aChen, Dongyan 1 aZhang, Ying 1 aLin, Yushuang 1 aLi, Jianwei 1 aZhang, Hongwei 0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2008 Dec., v. 218, no. 11-12 p.681-689dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-008-0241-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02306naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245006500170300001800235500002800253520121300281650001601494650001701510650001701527650001601544653001901560653001201579700002001591700002201611700001701633700001801650700002201668700001801690773011201708852000901820856009201829946001101921655001201932IND4417631420221120105533.0090313s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441763142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03745.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrie, Chris10aApproaches to defining dual-targeted proteins in Arabidopsis  ap. 1128-1139.  aPublisher supplied data  aA variety of approaches were used to predict dual-targeted proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. These predictions were experimentally tested using GFP fusions. Twelve new dual-targeted proteins were identified: five that were dual-targeted to mitochondria and plastids, six that were dual-targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes, and one that was dual-targeted to mitochondria and the nucleus. Two methods to predict dual-targeted proteins had a high success rate: (1) combining the AraPerox database with a variety of subcellular prediction programs to identify mitochondrial- and peroxisomal-targeted proteins, and (2) using a variety of prediction programs on a biochemical pathway or process known to contain at least one dual-targeted protein. Several technical parameters need to be taken into account before assigning subcellular localization using GFP fusion proteins. The position of GFP with respect to the tagged polypeptide, the tissue or cells used to detect subcellular localization, and the portion of a candidate protein fused to GFP are all relevant to the expression and targeting of a fusion protein. Testing all gene models for a chromosomal locus is required if more than one model exists. 3aArabidopsis 3amitochondria 3achloroplasts 3aperoxisomes 0adual targeting 0anucleus1 aKuhn, Kristina.1 aMurcha, Monika W.1 aDuncan, Owen1 aSmall, Ian D.1 aO'Toole, Nicholas1 aWhelan, James0 tPlant journal.g2009 Mar., v. 57, no. 6 p.1128-1139dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03745.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03386naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245008300148300001600231500002400247520155200271650001301823650001701836650001101853650002001864650001301884650001801897650001601915650002101931650000801952650002601960650002201986650001402008650001802022650002402040650001802064650001102082650001402093650002402107650001002131650000902141650002102150650006002171650002002231650005402251650001102305650000902316650001602325650002402341650002402365650001702389650001202406650005602418651001802474651001802492700001502510700001602525700001602541700001802557700001602575773011202591852000902703655001202712IND4364960020221120095623.0041014e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436496002DNAL7 a147476862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerchant, A.T.10aVitamin intake is not associated with community-acquired pneumonia in U.S. men  ap. 439-444.  aIncludes references  aThe age-related decline in immune function may predispose individuals to increased infection risk. Nutrition is an important determinant of immunocompetence, but vitamin supplementation in relation to infection has not been evaluated extensively in well-nourished populations. We evaluated the associations between intakes of antioxidants and B vitamins and risk of community-acquired pneumonia in well-nourished, middle-aged and older men. This was a prospective study conducted between 1990 and 2000 among 38,378 male, U.S. health professionals, aged 44 to 79 y in 1990. Participants answered a detailed 131-item FFQ to assess diet and also provided information on vitamin supplement use. We included those who at the onset had no history of pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, other heart disease, arterial surgery, cancer or asthma, and also had complete dietary data. There were 446 new cases of nonfatal community-acquired pneumonia during 145,878 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, smoking, BMI, alcohol use, physical activity, diabetes and total energy intake, there were no associations between total intakes of antioxidants or B vitamins and pneumonia risk. After excluding men who took vitamin E supplements, vitamin E intake from food sources only was inversely associated with pneumonia risk (multivariate relative risk comparing extreme quintiles = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.39-0.86, P-value test for trend = 0.01). Vitamin supplements are unlikely to reduce pneumonia risk in well-nourished, middle-aged and older men. 3aalcohols 3aantioxidants 3aasthma 3abody mass index 3adiabetes 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3aimmunocompetence 3amen 3amyocardial infarction 3aphysical activity 3apneumonia 3aprofessionals 3aprospective studies 3arelative risk 3astroke 3avitamin E 3avitamin supplements 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlcohol Drinking 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aBody Mass Index 2aCommunity-Acquired Infectionsxchemically induced 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPneumoniaxetiology 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSmoking 2aVitaminsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aCurhan, G.1 aBendich, A.1 aSingh, V.N.1 aWillett, W.C.1 aFawzi, W.W.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Feb., v. 134, no. 2 p.439-444dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04414naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001900197245010100216300001600317500002400333500001500357520183900372650001602211650001502227650001602242650002602258650002002284650001502304650002202319650002302341650001402364650002102378650002102399650002002420650001402440650004802454650002502502650001202527650001202539650001802551650001002569650004202579650001202621650002302633650001102656650002002667650002802687650005702715650001102772650004202783650003002825650001102855650000902866650001602875650007402891650005802965650003203023650003003055651001003085651001003095651001803105651002503123653004403148700001803192700001503210700001803225700001703243700001803260773010103278852000903379856009103388930003303479945002503512946001103537655001203548IND4434555120221120095647.0100326e20100501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455512DNAL7 a201027832pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL810 0aL1001 aBenjamin, L.A.10aAttitudes towards biosecurity practices relevant to Johne's disease control on beef cattle farms  ap. 222-230.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe success of control programs can be improved when producers' attitudes towards these programs are positive. Implementation of control programs for chronic diseases are more challenging than those for acute diseases because of the absence of the “cues-to-action” that are associated with acute diseases. Johne's disease (JD) is a chronic diarrheal disease of ruminants, and national voluntary control programs exist in several countries. We used a mailed cross-sectional survey to describe the attitudes of producers towards biosecurity practices and veterinarians' beliefs relevant to the control of JD on beef farms. Another objective was to describe and compare the attitudes of producers and veterinarians towards specific measures recommended by the Texas Voluntary Johne's Disease Program (TVJDP) for cattle. Questionnaires were mailed to 1100 producers and 840 veterinarians in the state of Texas, USA. Two hundred and eighty-five producers (26%) and 153 veterinarians (18%) returned questionnaires for analysis. Fifty-nine percent of producers and 50% of veterinarians agreed that JD is responsible for substantial losses in beef cattle production. Sixty-four percent of veterinarians had educated producers on management strategies for the control or elimination of JD. However, only 36% had participated in the training program and 29% were certified to develop risk assessments and implement testing. Only 20% of producers reported that they were familiar with the TVJDP and 16% had considered participating in this program. There is a need for greater promotion of the control program among veterinarians and producers. Reasons for the apparent difference in opinions need to be understood to increase the likelihood of control measures adoption and to subsequently reduce the impact of JD on beef cattle operations. 3abeef cattle 3aguidelines 3avaccination 3alivestock biosecurity 3acattle diseases 3acompliance 3atraining (people) 3afarmers' attitudes 3ascreening 3aparatuberculosis 3achronic diseases 3acontrol methods 3aknowledge 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3adisease surveillance 3afarmers 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 2aAdult 2aAnimal Husbandryxeducationxmethods. 2aAnimals 2aAttitude to Health 2aCattle 2aChronic Disease 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHealth Promotionxmethods 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisxisolation & purification 2aParatuberculosisxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVeterinariansxpsychology 3aTexas 3aJapan 0aUnited States 0aTexasxepidemiology. 0aTexas Voluntary Johne's Disease Program1 aFosgate, G.T.1 aWard, M.P.1 aRoussel, A.J.1 aFeagin, R.A.1 aSchwartz, Al.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 May 1, v. 94, no. 3-4 p.222-230dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.01.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02221naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245014100155300001400296520119300310650002501503650001701528650001401545650001601559650002301575650001301598653002601611700001701637773008501654852000901739856007801748930003301826945001301859946001101872655001201883IND2039852820221120085917.0940526s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203985282DNAL7 a10.1007/BF001920042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteullet, P.10aIdentification of vertebrate volatiles stimulating olfactory receptors on tarsus I of the tick Amblyomma variegatum Fabricius (Ixodidae)  ap. 39-47.  aBovine odour excites olfactory receptor(s) in a wall-pore olfactory sensillum on the anterior pit of Haller's organ in Amblyomma variegatum. Gas chromatography-coupled electrophysiology recordings from this sensillum reveal the presence of 4 active compounds in bovine odour. The two strongest stimulants were identified as 2-nitrophenol and 4-methyl-2-nitrophenol by gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry, and by matching electrophysiological activity of synthetic analogues. Synthetic analogues of known vertebrate-associated volatiles also stimulate other olfactory receptors in sensilla on the surface of tarsus I: a lactone receptor responding to gamma-valerolactone and 6-caprolactone; different fatty acid receptor types responding best to either pentanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid or to butanoic acid; three receptors responding to NH3; and one receptor responding to 3-pentanone. Gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry analysis of vertebrate volatiles revealed presence of a number of these olfactory stimulants in concentrates of rabbit and steer odour, i.e. 2-methylpropanoic acid, butanoic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid, pentanoic acid, and gamma-valerolactone. 3aAmblyomma variegatum 3ainsect pests 3areceptors 3avertebrates 3avolatile compounds 3asensilla 0aolfactory stimulation1 aGuerin, P.M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1994, v. 174, no. 1 p.39-47x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001920043Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US 7aarticle03059naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001500215245008700230300001600317520134400333650001901677650002201696650001101718650001001729650002501739650002301764650001201787650000901799650002101808650003301829650002501862650002401887650003801911650003901949650003501988650004002023650003102063650000902094650003202103650001302135653001702148653002502165653001902190700001702209773009202226852000902318856008502327930003302412945002502445946001102470655001202481IND4373862020221120085947.0050901e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437386202DNAL7 a158710262pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-005-0622-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDyer, A.G.10aSimultaneous and successive colour discrimination in the honeybee (Apis mellifera)  ap. 547-557.  aThe colour discrimination of individual free-flying honeybees (Apis mellifera) was tested with simultaneous and successive viewing conditions for a variety of broadband reflectance stimuli. For simultaneous viewing bees used form vision to discriminate patterned target stimuli from homogeneous coloured distractor stimuli, and for successive discrimination bees were required to discriminate between homogeneously coloured stimuli. Bees were significantly better at a simultaneous discrimination task, and we suggest this is explained by the inefficiency with which the bees' brain can code and retrieve colour information from memory when viewing stimuli successively. Using simultaneous viewing conditions bees discriminated between the test stimuli at a level equivalent to 1 just-noticeable-difference for human colour vision. Discrimination of colours by bees with simultaneous viewing conditions exceeded previous estimates of what is possible considering models of photoreceptor noise measured in bees, which suggests spatial and/or temporal summation of colour signals for fine discrimination tasks. The results show that when behavioural experiments are used to collect data about the mechanisms facilitating colour discrimination in animals, it is important to consider the effects of the stimulus viewing conditions on results. 3aApis mellifera 3aworker honey bees 3avision 3acolor 3aconditioned behavior 3atraining (animals) 2aAnimals 2aBees 2aBehavior, Animal 2aColor Perceptionxphysiology 2aColorimetryxmethods 2aComputer Simulation 2aConditioning, Operantxphysiology 2aDifferential Thresholdxphysiology 2aDiscrimination, Psychological. 2aDiscrimination Learningxphysiology 2aFlight, Animalxphysiology 2aMale 2aPhotic Stimulationxmethods 2aSoftware 0acolor vision 0acolor discrimination 0avisual stimuli1 aNeumeyer, C.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 June, v. 191, no. 6 p.547-557x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-005-0622-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02798naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001400198245005400212300001600266500001500282520131700297650001701614650002201631650001201653650001801665650002101683650001501704650002001719650003201739650003401771650001201805650001101817650003301828650002401861650001801885650002401903653001501927653002101942653001201963653002201975700001701997773009102014852000902105856008502114930003302199945002502232946001102257655001202268IND4373862820221120073436.0050901e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437386282DNAL7 a157508182pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-004-0597-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHoger, U.10aSlow adaptation in spider mechanoreceptor neurons  ap. 403-411.  a2019-12-04  aSlow adaptation of action potential firing is a common but poorly understood property of sensory neurons. We quantified slow adaptation in a cuticular mechanoreceptor organ of the spider, Cupiennius salei, by stimulating with continuous pseudorandom mechanical displacements while recording action potentials intracellularly from the cell bodies. Firing rate declined over a period of several minutes before reaching a steady level at about half the initial rate. This slow adaptation was fitted by an exponential decay with mean time constant of 18.5 s. Recovery from slow adaptation was also fitted by an exponential process, but with a longer time constant of 167 s. The receptor potential produced by the same stimulation protocol did not change its amplitude or dynamics, showing that slow adaptation occurs during action potential encoding from the receptor potential. Experiments with chemical blockers of calcium entry or the known potassium currents failed to reduce the slow adaptation. The Na+/K+ pump blocker Ouabain decreased the time constant of slow adaptation, suggesting that ion accumulation is involved. In some experiments, a second class of small action potentials were observed, which were tentatively attributed to failed conduction from the sensory dendrite through the soma to the axon.. 3asense organs 3aaction potentials 3aouabain 3aion transport 3amechanoreceptors 3aCupiennius 3asensory neurons 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aAction Potentialsxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMechanoreceptorsxphysiology 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aReaction Time 2aSpidersxphysiology 0ainhibitors 0aCupiennius salei 0aAraneae 0aelectrophysiology1 aFrench, A.S.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 May, v. 191, no. 5 p.403-411x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-004-0597-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20060207b20060302c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02936naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001300198245008800211300001600299500001500315520114000330650002401470650001201494650001001506650002601516650002201542650002201564650002001586650002601606650001101632650001601643650001201659650002201671650004501693650002401738650002501762650001101787650002601798650001301824650003701837650003501874653002401909653001801933653002401951653001601975653002101991653000902012653002102021700001402042773009102056852000902147856008502156930003302241945002502274946001102299655001202310IND4373863320221120073233.0050901e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437386332DNAL7 a157762692pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-005-0605-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHaag, J.10aDye-coupling visualizes networks of large-field motion-sensitive neurons in the fly  ap. 445-454.  a2019-12-04  aIn the fly, visually guided course control is accomplished by a set of 60 large-field motion-sensitive neurons in each brain hemisphere. These neurons have been shown to receive retinotopic motion information from local motion detectors on their dendrites. In addition, recent experiments revealed extensive coupling between the large-field neurons through electrical synapses. These two processes together give rise to their broad and elaborate receptive fields significantly surpassing the extent of their dendritic fields. Here, we demonstrate that the electrical connections between different large-field neurons can be visualized using Neurobiotin dye injection into a single one of them. When combined with a fluorescent dye which does not cross electrical synapses, the injected cell can be identified unambiguously. The Neurobiotin staining corroborates the electrical coupling postulated amongst the cells of the vertical system (VS-cells) and between cells of the horizontal system (HS-cells and CH-cells). In addition, connections between some cells are revealed that have so far not been considered as electrically coupled. 3alabeling techniques 3asynapse 3abrain 3adifferential staining 3aelectrophysiology 3aCalliphora vicina 3asensory neurons 3asynaptic transmission 3avision 3afluorescein 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxphysiology 2aBiotinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aDipteraxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aFemale 2aFluoresceinxanalysis 2aMovement 2aNerve Netxcytologyxphysiology. 2aNeuronsxcytologyxphysiology. 0aelectrical synapses 0amotion vision 0aelectrical coupling 0aneurobiotin 0areceptive fields 0adyes 0afluorescent dyes1 aBorst, A.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 May, v. 191, no. 5 p.445-454x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-005-0605-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02723naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001500215245008300230300001600313500001500329520098600344650001401330650002801344650001101372650002201383650001001405650002001415650001101435650001901446650003101465650001201496650002601508650004801534650001301582650002701595650001001622650004801632650002101680650003601701650002901737650003101766653002401797653001601821653002501837700001601862773009201878852000901970856008501979930003302064945002502097946001102122655001202133IND4374237520221120073248.0050912e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437423752DNAL7 a158386522pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-005-0616-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A. gambiae has fused rhabdoms with huge acceptance angles, whereas T. brevipalpis has open rhabdoms with rhabdomere acceptance angles comparable with those of advanced (brachyceran) flies. Here, we show that the retina-lamina projections are consistent with these differences. The short receptor axons from each ommatidium in A. gambiae insert as a group between four lamina monopolar cell clusters. In T. brevipalpis axon bundles from each ommatidium undergo a twist in their passage through the nuclear layer of the lamina, and then fan out into a space the diameter of which is about twice the separation of the monopolar cell clusters. This arrangement is consistent with a neural superposition mechanism closely similar to that found in higher Diptera, but which must have evolved independently. 3aommatidia 3ainterspecific variation 3aretina 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aaxons 3asensory neurons 3avision 3aphotoreceptors 3aToxorhynchites brevipalpis 2aAnimals 2aAxonsxultrastructure 2aCulicidaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aDarkness 2aInterneuronsxcytology 2aLight 2aPhotoreceptor Cells, Invertebratexcytology 2aRetinaxcytology 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSynapsesxultrastructure 2aVision, Ocularxphysiology 0aspecies differences 0arhabdomeres 0aneural superposition1 aHorwood, J.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 July, v. 191, no. 7 p.639-647x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-005-0616-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050921b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02104naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245007600186300001400262500002400276500001500300520085000315650001401165650002301179650001101202650001201213650002301225650001301248650002401261650002001285653001801305700002201323700002201345700002501367773011001392852000901502856009001511930003301601945002501634946001101659655001201670IND4434565720221120065223.0100326e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ5051 aZdunek, Artur10aNew contact acoustic emission detector for texture evaluation of apples  ap. 83-91.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA new contact acoustic emission detector (CAED) was developed for the instrumental texture evaluation of apples. The goal of this work was to determine the relations between instrumental parameters and sensory texture attributes, and to develop calibration models for prediction of the sensory texture of apples with CAED. Seven apple cultivars were used for the construction and validation of the models. CAED is particularly useful for evaluation of sensory crispness, crunchiness and hardness. There is also a significant correlation of acoustic emission counts with juiciness, mealiness and overall texture. Validation of the models indicates better prediction of these sensory attributes by total acoustic emission counts than prediction by puncture firmness in terms of variance explained, root-mean-square of a model prediction, and bias. 3acultivars 3asensory evaluation 3aapples 3atexture 3aacoustic impedance 3ahardness 3aacoustic properties 3aMalus domestica 0afruits (food)1 aCybulska, Justyna1 aKonopacka, Dorota1 aRutkowski, Krzysztof0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 July, v. 99, no. 1 p.83-91dElsevier Science Pub.

The approach involves constant rate heating of powder under compression and measurement of changes in either gap distance (Method 1) or normal force (Method 2). Significant increases in the rate of change of these parameters was shown to correspond with T gr. The techniques were applied to skim milk, micellar casein and whey permeate powders and a range of fat-enriched micellar casein powders. T gr temperatures, so obtained, were compared with glass transition temperatures (T g) determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Methods 1 and 2 gave predictions for non-fat dairy powders of T g endset (T ge) with SEP of 8.8 and 4.4°C, respectively. These novel techniques provide an accurate means of determining glass transitions in dairy powders, including high protein and fat-containing powders, whose relaxation properties can be difficult to measure by DSC. 3aspray drying 3askim milk 3arheology 3aglass transition temperature 3acasein 3acasein hydrolysates 3amilk fat 3awhey powder 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3apowders 3apermeates 0amilk proteins 0adairy products1 aFamelart, M.H.1 aO'Callaghan, D.J.1 aSchuck, P.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 July, v. 99, no. 1 p.76-82dElsevier Science Pub.

Davis then concludes the adoption of an omnivorous diet would cause less harm than the adoption of a vegetarian diet. Davis’s argument fails on three counts: first, Davis makes a mathematical error in using total rather than per capita estimates of animals killed; second, he focuses on the number of animals killed in production and ignores the welfare of these animals; and third, he does not count the number of animals who may be prevented from existing. When we correct these errors, Davis's argument makes a strong case for, rather than against, adopting a vegetarian diet: vegetarianism kills fewer animals, involves better treatment of animals, and likely allows a greater number of animals with lives worth living to exist. 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3acrop production 3avegetarian diet0 tJournal of agricultural and environmental ethics.g2003, v. 16, no. 5 p.505-511dKluwer Academic Publishersx1187-78637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://link.springer.com/journal/10806/16/5/page/13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02127naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011000163300001600273500002400289520116400313650002001477650001501497650003201512650001301544650001301557650002401570650001101594651001101605773010301616852000901719856008501728655001201813IND4478148920221120053736.0140305s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447814892DNAL7 a10.1080/089419203901788652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaage, Sissel10aCollaborative Salmon Recovery Planning:Examining Decision Making and Implementationin Northeastern Oregon  ap. 295-307.  aIncludes references  aCollaborative and consensus-based approaches to natural resource management planning have become increasingly applied and analyzed in the United States (e.g., Barham 2001; Innes et al. 1994; Selin and Schuett 2000; Susskind and Cruikshank 1987; Wondelleck 2000). However, there has been insufficient attention on implementation (Imperial 1999, 452) and whether these efforts affect both decision-making processes and ecological goals. This article begins to address this gap by examining the implementation of a collaborative salmon recovery plan developed in northeastern Oregon's Wallowa County. Based on data gathered during seventeen months of sociological, anthropological and archival research, the article argues that the plan has not shaped resource management decision making due to preexisting institutional, socioeconomic, and ideological pressures. Nonetheless, the collaborative effort has had other important second-order effects, including the forging of a new alliance between the Nez Perce Tribe and residents of Wallowa County around land and natural resource issues that may, over time, change the local political and management landscapes. 3adecision making 3alandscapes 3anatural resource management 3aplanning 3apolitics 3aresource management 3asalmon 3aOregon0 tSociety & natural resources.g2003 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.295-307dTaylor & Francisx0894-19207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/089419203901788653Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03008naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002100198245008100219300001400300520130300314650002501617650002201642650002901664650001601693650001101709650001101720650001301731650001501744650001901759650002301778650002501801650002201826650001201848650001001860650002701870650003401897650003301931650006701964650002302031650002302054650002402077650001602101653001702117653001602134653002702150773009002177852000902267856008502276930003302361945002502394946001102419655001202430IND4373842320221120045413.0050831e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437384232DNAL7 a155493252pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-004-0573-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFlamarique, I.N.10aTemporal shifts in visual pigment absorbance in the retina of Pacific salmon  ap. 37-49.  aThe visual pigments and photoreceptor types in the retinas of three species of Pacific salmon (coho, chum, and chinook) were examined using microspectrophotometry and histological sections for light microscopy. All three species had four cone visual pigments with maximum absorbance in the UV (lambdamax: 357-382 nm), blue (lambdamax: 431-446 nm), green (lambdamax: 490-553 nm) and red (lambdamax: 548-607 nm) parts of the spectrum, and a rod visual pigment with lambdamax: 504-531 nm. The youngest fish (yolk-sac alevins) did not have blue visual pigment, but only UV pigment in the single cones. Older juveniles (smolts) had predominantly single cones with blue visual pigment. Coho and chinook smolts (>1 year old) switched from a vitamin A1- to a vitamin A2-dominated retina during the spring, while the retina of chum smolts and that of the younger alevin-to-parr coho did not. Adult spawners caught during the Fall had vitamin A2-dominated retinas. The central retina of all species had three types of double cones (large, medium and small). The small double cones were situated toward the ventral retina and had lower red visual pigment lambdamax than that of medium and large double cones, which were found more dorsally. Temperature affected visual pigment lambdamax during smoltification. 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aOncorhynchus keta 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3afarmed fish 3avision 3aretina 3apigments 3aabsorbance 3aphotoreceptors 3aseasonal variation 3adevelopmental stages 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aLight 2aMicrospectrophotometry 2aPhotoreceptor Cellsxcytology 2aRetinaxchemistryxcytology. 2aRetinal Pigmentsxanalysisxclassificationxradiation effects. 2aSalmonxphysiology 2aSensory Thresholds 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTemperature 0acolor vision 0achromophore 0amicrospectrophotometry0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 Jan., v. 191, no. 1 p.37-49x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-004-0573-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03727naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009100180300001600271520137400287650002101661650001601682650001901698650002201717650002101739650001301760650002401773650002201797650002501819650002501844650002301869650002201892650002401914650001401938650002001952650002201972650001001994650003602004650001202040650001402052650003302066650002302099650001502122650001802137650003502155650001302190650002002203650002802223650001002251650004402261650003302305650003302338650006102371650002902432650003202461650002702493650004002520650003402560650002402594653002802618700001402646700001302660700001502673700001402688773009202702852000902794856008502803930003302888945001302921946001102934655001202945IND2334267020221120045431.0031002e200307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233426702DNAL7 a128274202pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-003-0427-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrieger, J.12aA candidate olfactory receptor subtype highly conserved across different insect orders  ap. 519-526.  aCandidate olfactory receptors of the moth Heliothis virescens were found to be extremely diverse from receptors of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, but there is one exception. The moth receptor type HR2 shares a rather high degree of sequence identity with one olfactory receptor type both from Drosophila (Dor83b) and from Anopheles (AgamGPRor7); moreover, in contrast to all other receptors, this unique receptor type is expressed in numerous antennal neurons. Here we describe the identification of HR2 homologues in two further lepidopteran species, the moths Antheraea pernyi and Bombyx mori, which share 86-88% of their amino acids. In addition, based on RT-PCR experiments HR2 homologues were discovered in antennal cDNA of the honey bee (Apis mellifera; Hymenoptera), the blowfly (Calliphora erythrocephala; Diptera) and the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor; Coleoptera). Comparison of all HR2-related receptors revealed a high degree of sequence conservation across insect orders. In situ hybridization of antennal sections from the bee and the blowfly support the notion that HR2-related receptors are generally expressed in a very large number of antennal cells. This, together with the high degree of conservation suggests that this unique receptor subtype may fulfill a special function in chemosensory neurons of insects. 3aAntheraea pernyi 3aBombyx mori 3aApis mellifera 3aCalliphora vicina 3aTenebrio molitor 3aantennae 3aolfactory receptors 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence alignment 3asequence homology 3aconserved sequences 3aphylogeny 3agene expression 3ainsect physiology 3asmell 2aAmino Acid Sequencexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aAnopheles 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDrosophila 2aGenes, Insect 2aIn Situ Hybridizationxmethods 2aInsecta. 2aLarvaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMoths 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxphysiology 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aReceptors, Odorantxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSense Organsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignmentxmethods 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Analysis, Proteinxmethods 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 0amolecular sequence data1 aKlink, O.1 aMohl, C.1 aRaming, K.1 aBreer, H.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2003 July, v. 189, no. 7 p.519-526x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-003-0427-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03592naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100003100187245013000218300001600348500002400364500001500388520186300403650001702266650002602283650001702309650001902326650002302345650002202368650002502390650002002415650001902435650002102454650002802475650001902503650002202522650001202544650001802556650002602574651001002600653001802610653001202628653004302640700002102683700001902704773012002723852000902843856009102852930003302943945002502976946001303001655001203014IND4434563520221120045448.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aB200 0aX6201 aVicente-Serrano, Sergio M.10aAridification determines changes in forest growth in Pinus halepensis forests under semiarid Mediterranean climate conditions  ap. 614-628.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUsing a set of 16 Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ images from 1984 to 2006, we tested whether climate trends in the last three decades differentially controlled the vegetal activity of eight Pinus halepensis forests located across a marked bioclimatic gradient. Our results show spatial differences in trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between 1984 and 2006, which were highly related to the spatial distribution of aridity. There was a strong correlation between the change in the NDVI values and the climatic water balance in each forest (R =0.86, p =0.006). A large increment of the NDVI was observed in forests located in the most humid areas, whereas those located in the most arid areas showed a slight decrease in the NDVI. We used a forest growth simulation model (GOTILWA+) to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) in each of the eight analyzed forests, and found similar results to those obtained for the NDVI. Significant correlation was found between the spatial pattern of NDVI and LAI trends between 1984 and 2006 (R =0.82, p =0.01). The climate evolution in the last four decades explains the observed and modeled changes in the NDVI and the LAI. In agreement with other studies, we showed that the general response of the forests to more favorable conditions (in terms of temperature increment and CO₂ fertilization) is increased leaf activity and biomass. Nevertheless, in forests located in the most arid areas the positive trend observed in the potential evapotranspiration rates increased water stress, and had a negative effect on forest growth. Given the future predictions of warming and declining precipitation from global climate models for the Mediterranean region, an increase in stress conditions affecting these forests is expected, which will affect their growth and survival, mainly in the most arid areas. 3aplant stress 3aplant available water 3aforest trees 3aclimate models 3asoil water content 3atemperate forests 3aspatial distribution 3aleaf area index 3asemiarid zones 3aPinus halepensis 3adry matter accumulation 3abioclimatology 3aspatial variation 3aLandsat 3aforest growth 3aMediterranean climate 3aSpain 0aprecipitation 0aaridity 0anormalized difference vegetation index1 aLasanta, Teodoro1 aGracia, Carlos0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 150, no. 4 p.614-628dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.02.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/30  aOther US 7aarticle03353naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001200232245013200244300001600376500001500392520137500407650001901782650002601801650002201827650001901849650002101868650001001889650001701899650001801916650002001934650003401954650001201988650002102000650002902021650003002050650000902080650003502089650004302124650002702167650003402194650003202228650001502260650002602275653001702301653002302318653002402341653001702365653002202382700001802404700001402422773009202436852000902528856008502537930003302622945002502655946001102680655001202691IND4373860820221120045427.0050901e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437386082DNAL7 a158562572pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-005-0618-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHan, Q.10aInteractions of mechanical stimuli and sex pheromone information in antennal lobe neurons of a male moth, Spodoptera littoralis  ap. 521-528.  a2019-12-04  aMale moths respond to sex pheromone sources with up-wind flight behaviour. Localization of the odour source requires not only detection of the olfactory stimulus, but also other sensory input regarding, e.g. visual and mechanical stimuli. Thus, integration of different types of sensory input is necessary. It is, however, not known where in the central nervous system the integration of information regarding different sensory modalities takes place. Using intracellular recording and staining techniques, we investigated neurons in the antennal lobe of Spodoptera littoralis, during stimulation with a mechanical stimulus and a sex pheromone. Fifteen percent of all the neurons investigated responded to the mechanical stimulus and the majority of these neurons showed altered responses if the olfactory stimulus was added. A receptor neuron responding only to the wind stimulus was found to arborise in the antennal lobe. Most projection neurons responded with an enhanced action potential frequency to the combined stimulus. In local interneurons, enhancement, depression, or no change of the responses to the wind stimulus was found when the olfactory stimulus was added. The results suggest that neurons present in the antennal lobe integrate mechanosensory and olfactory input, possibly assisting the moths to orient during up-wind flight towards an odour source. 3ainsect anatomy 3aSpodoptera littoralis 3aaction potentials 3asex pheromones 3amechanoreceptors 3asmell 3ainterneurons 3aantennal lobe 3asensory neurons 2aAction Potentialsxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aInterneuronsxphysiology 2aIsoquinolinesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aOlfactory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aOlfactory Receptor Neuronsxphysiology 2aPheromonesxphysiology 2aPhysical Stimulationxmethods 2aSex Attractantsxphysiology 2aSpodoptera 2aStaining and Labeling 0aneuroanatomy 0aprojection neurons 0asensory integration 0awind stimuli 0aelectrophysiology1 aHansson, B.S.1 aAnton, S.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 June, v. 191, no. 6 p.521-528x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-005-0618-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20050907b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03348naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180100001800189245010100207300001600308500002400324500001500348520170100363650001602064650002202080650001602102650001102118650001402129650001502143650001102158650001402169650001202183650001702195650001402212650002302226650001702249650001002266650001102276650001702287650001202304650002002316653002602336653002902362653002002391700002202411700001902433700001702452773010602469852000902575856009302584930003302677945002502710946001102735655001202746IND4418984520221120045409.0090410e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441898452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.05.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL600 0aL300 0aP0501 aStrauss, Anna10aVaginal oestrus during the reproductive and non-reproductive period in European ground squirrels  ap. 362-370.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMost hibernating animals are thought to be monoestrous because reproductive activity is subject to strong time constraints. In previous studies, female European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus) turned out to have elevated oestradiol levels during late lactation and after weaning, indicating ovarian activity during summer. Therefore, we monitored vaginal cytology, endocrine changes, and vulval development in semi-free-living female European ground squirrels throughout one active season. Vaginal oestrus, defined by the predominance of cornified cells in smear samples, was found during the mating period shortly after vernal emergence. This phase was followed by metoestrus, characterised by the appearance of leukocytes, and a subsequent anoestrous phase. During weaning or postlactation, a second vaginal oestrus was documented in all experimental females, again followed by a metoestrous and an anoestrous phase lasting until hibernation. In line with the second vaginal oestrus, plasma oestradiol concentrations peaked during postlactation. Progesterone levels were elevated from gestation to postlactation, and titres were marginally higher during vaginal oestrus in summer than in spring. Vulval swelling was more pronounced during the first than the second vaginal oestrus. The second oestrous cycle was non-reproductive, as males were sexually inactive with regressed testes during summer. We assume that the second oestrous cycle and the accompanying endocrine changes have beneficial effects on prehibernatory fattening and reproductive performance in the subsequent season. This might allow females to become oestrous immediately after emergence from hibernation in spring. 3aperiodicity 3ahormone secretion 3ahibernation 3avagina 3asquirrels 3abiomarkers 3aestrus 3alactation 3aweaning 3aprogesterone 3aestrogens 3aseasonal variation 3aSpermophilus 3avulva 3asummer 3acell biology 3afemales 3abreeding season 0aSpermophilus citellus 0aEuropean ground squirrel 0aresting periods1 aHoffmann, Ilse E.1 aWalzl, Manfred1 aMillesi, Eva0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2009 June, v. 112, no. 3-4 p.362-370dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2008.05.0683Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02872naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001900215245013500234300001600369500001500385520092000400650002801320650001201348650001501360650002401375650002701399650001701426650001201443650002201455650001701477650002501494650002501519650001201544650001101556650002601567650002901593650000901622650001601631650003501647650002401682650002401706650003201730653001801762653002401780653002401804653002601828653002101854653002501875653002301900653001401923700001801937773009201955852000902047856008502056930003302141945002502174946001102199655001202210IND4373856620221120045501.0050831e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437385662DNAL7 a156687792pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-004-0591-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using information theory, we find that the ON1 of G. texensis encodes higher amplitude-modulation frequencies than that of T. oceanicus. Bilateral differences in ON1 responses are also more pronounced in G. texensis, particularly for rapid, G. texensis-like stimuli. We show that brief silent intervals in a pulse train, such as those that occur in the natural calling song of G. texensis, enhance the representation of the stimulus pulse pattern as well as bilateral differences in activity. Our results suggest that the characteristics of an identified neuron vary, across cricket species, in accordance with the temporal structures of their communication signals. 3ainterspecific variation 3ahearing 3aphonotaxis 3aacoustic properties 3aTeleogryllus oceanicus 3ainterneurons 3aGryllus 3aelectrophysiology 3astridulation 2aAcoustic Stimulation 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGryllidaexphysiology 2aInterneuronsxphysiology 2aMale 2aPeriodicity 2aSound Localizationxphysiology 2aSound Spectrography 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Perceptionxphysiology 0acalling songs 0aspecies differences 0atemporal processing 0aauditory interneurons 0aGryllus texensis 0ainsect communication 0asound localization 0aGryllidae1 aPollack, G.S.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2005 Apr., v. 191, no. 4 p.363-372x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-004-0591-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20050902b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/09/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03775naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245017600179300001600355500001500371520145700386650002001843650001801863650001401881650001201895650001501907650002201922650001401944650002401958650001801982650006202000650001202062650002402074650004502098650004202143650004302185650002602228650000902254650004002263650001602303650002102319650007102340650003102411650003202442650006302474650005502537650001802592650004002610650005202650653002302702653002602725653002002751653002402771653002002795700001602815700001402831773009302845852000902938856008502947930003303032945001303065946001103078655001203089IND2333357120221120025456.0030707e200211  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233335712DNAL7 a124669522pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-002-0364-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUreshi, M.10aSerotonin precursor (5-hydroxytryptophan) has a profound effect on the post-copulatory time-fixed sexually refractory stage in the male cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus DeGeer  ap. 767-779.  a2019-12-04  aThis study addresses a potentially general basis of measuring time in a biological timer. Here, we examined the effects of biogenic amines on the time-fixed post-copulatory sexually refractory stage (ca. 1 h) which is defined as the time interval between spermatophore protrusion and the onset of a calling or a mating response in the reproductive cycle of the male cricket. For subcuticular injection of amines (0.15 ml, 10(-2) mol l(-1)), the interval of the refractory stage was shortened by octopamine, serotonin, 5-hydoxytryptophan and N-acetyl-serotonin but was unchanged by tryptophan, melatonin or 5-hydroxyindol-3-acetic acid. The effect of 5-hydoxytryptophan was most potent (maximum shortening, 38%) and long lasting (ca. 4.5 h) while other amines effected only the injected cycle. Injection of 5-hydoxytryptophan (180 nl, 10(-2) mol l(-1)) into the terminal abdominal ganglion also decreased the interval to a similar extent. Simultaneous injection of 5-hydoxytryptophan with the inhibitor of the serotonin synthesis enzyme reduced the 5-hydoxytryptophan effect suggesting that this effect results from synthesis of serotonin from 5-hydoxytryptophan. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect on the interval. These results suggest that the reproductive timer is regulated by serotonergic neurons in the terminal abdominal ganglion without protein synthesis during the interval of the time-fixed sexually refractory stage. 3ainsect behavior 3adose response 3aserotonin 3aganglia 3acopulation 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ainjection 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3acycloheximide 2a5-Hydroxytryptophanxadministration & dosagexphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aArousalxphysiology 2aBiogenic Aminesxadministration & dosage 2aCopulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEjaculationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGryllidaexphysiology 2aMale 2aOctopaminexadministration & dosage 2aPeriodicity 2aReference Values 2aRefractory Period, Electrophysiologicalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSerotoninxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSpermatogonia 2aTryptophanxadministration & dosage 2aVocalization, Animalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0areproductive timer 0asexual refractoriness 0abiogenic amines 0arefractory interval 0amating behavior1 aDainobu, M.1 aSakai, M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2002 Nov., v. 188, no. 10 p.767-779x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-002-0364-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03272naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002400157245006200181300001600243500002400259520167900283650001401962650002201976650002801998650001002026650001802036650001402054650001402068650001202082650000902094650002602103650006402129650003002193650000902223650002202232650001002254650001802264650001102282650001402293650005002307650005302357650001502410651001102425651002602436700001802462700001802480700001902498773012602517852000902643856007802652655001202730IND4478143220221120025343.0140305s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447814322DNAL7 a129435612pmid7 a10.1079/PHN20024562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPomerleau, Joceline14aThe burden of disease attributable to nutrition in Europe  ap. 453-461.  aIncludes references  aObjective: This review examines the extent to which differences in nutrition could explain the diversity of health in Europe and how dietary patterns might contribute to the overall burden of disease in the region. Setting: Europe. Design: Between-country variations and time trends in dietary and health patterns in Europe are described, taking into account recent evidence on east-west mortality differentials. Existing information on the contribution of dietary factors to the overall burden of disease in Europe and to the burden of cardiovascular diseases and cancer is then reviewed, including a discussion of the methodological challenges that face those seeking to quantify this burden accurately. Results: While evidence from ecological data have long suggested that variations in health patterns in Europe may be at least partly attributed to differences in dietary intake, recent research into the major risks to disease, disability and death is confirming the importance of poor nutrition to major health problems and overall disease burden in Europe. Findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2000 study suggest that 4.4% of the overall burden of disease in the region could be attributed to low fruit and vegetable intake, and 7.8% to overweight and obesity. Conclusions: The burden of disease attributed to poor nutrition in Europe appears to be substantial and probably underestimated. However, better quantification of the contribution of nutrition to the region's burden of disease awaits further research to assess the dietary intake of Europeans and to explore the relationship between nutritional factors and health outcomes in diverse parts of Europe. 3aEuropeans 3aburden of disease 3acardiovascular diseases 3adeath 3aeating habits 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3arisk 3avegetable consumption 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiologyxmortality. 2aCross-Cultural Comparison 2aDiet 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFruit 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMorbidity 2aNeoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiologyxmortality. 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aVegetables 3aEurope 0aEuropexepidemiology.1 aMcKee, Martin1 aLobstein, Tim1 aKnai, Cécile.0 tPublic health nutrition.g2003 Aug., v. 6, no. 5 p.453-461dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/PHN20024563Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03171naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001800195245011500213300001600328500002400344520119700368650003001565650002001595650001801615650001001633650001601643650002901659650002401688650002401712650001301736650003201749650001701781650001801798650004201816650004001858650004201898650005401940650003301994650002502027650004102052650003302093650003702126653001902163653001402182653001302196700001502209700001302224700001702237700001702254773009502271852000902366856008902375930003302464945002502497946001102522655001202533IND4434560620221117165314.0100326e20100401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456062DNAL7 a201389272pmid7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aM001 0aF6001 aWu, Shuangxiu10aImproved hydrogen production with expression of hemH and lba genes in chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 120-125.  aIncludes references  aThe coding region of both the ferrochelatase gene, hemH, from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and the leghemoglobin gene, lba, from Glycine max, were transferred into chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. As a result, transgenic C. reinhardtii cultures more rapidly consumed O₂ and increased H₂ output compared with controls in both sulfur-free and sulfur-containing medium. H₂ production of the transgenic algal cultures in sulfur-free medium was 4-fold greater than that of control cultures, ∼3.3mlbottle⁻¹. Maximum expression of the hemH-lba fusion protein on day 5 coincided with the lowest levels of O₂ content and the highest H₂ evolution rate detected over 7 days of anaerobic induction in sulfur-free medium. When the concentration of sulfate in the growth medium was restored to 12.5 or 50μM, O₂ consumption and H₂ yield decreased more slowly in the transgenic algal cultures than in the control cultures. These results demonstrate that expression of the hemH-lba fusion protein in chloroplast of C. reinhardtii improved their H₂ yield by decreasing O₂ content in the medium, thereby representing the potential for H₂ production in green algae to be improved. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3agene expression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3aGlycine max 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3agenetic engineering 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogen 3agas production (biological) 3achloroplasts 3aleghemoglobin 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixphysiology 2aChloroplastsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFerrochelatasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxphysiology 2aGenetic Enhancementxmethods 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aLeghemoglobinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Engineeringxmethods 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 0aferrochelatase 0ahemH gene 0alba gene1 aHuang, Rui1 aXu, Lili1 aYan, Guangyu1 aWang, Quanxi0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2010 Apr. 1, v. 146, no. 3 p.120-125dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.01.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/04/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03547naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001800165245014000183300001600323500002400339520145400363650002301817650002801840650002301868650001201891650001001903650001201913650001401925650001301939650002601952650001301978650002401991650005702015650002302072650002502095650004202120650004002162650002802202650001302230650002902243650003302272650003202305650005102337650002402388650006002412700002202472700002002494700002302514700002102537700002102558700002802579700002602607700001802633700002302651700001702674773012302691852000902814856008602823655001202909IND4477904420221117165239.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790442DNAL7 a128484292pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.6342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuber, Sophie10aGacS Sensor Domains Pertinent to the Regulation of Exoproduct Formation and to the Biocontrol Potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0  ap. 634-644.  aIncludes references  aIn the root-colonizing biocontrol strain CHA0 of Pseudomonas fluorescens, cell density-dependent synthesis of extra-cellular, plant-beneficial secondary metabolites and enzymes is positively regulated by the GacS/GacA two-component system. Mutational analysis of the GacS sensor kinase using improved single-copy vectors showed that inactivation of each of the three conserved phosphate acceptor sites caused an exoproduct null phenotype (GacS¯), whereas deletion of the periplasmic loop domain had no significant effect on the expression of exoproduct genes. Strain CHA0 is known to synthesize a solvent-extractable extracellular signal that advances and enhances the expression of exoproduct genes during the transition from exponential to stationary growth phase when maximal exoproduct formation occurs. Mutational inactivation of either GacS or its cognate response regulator GacA abolished the strain's response to added signal. Deletion of the linker domain of the GacS sensor kinase caused signal-independent, strongly elevated expression of exoproduct genes at low cell densities. In contrast to the wild-type strain CHA0, the gacS linker mutant and a gacS null mutant were unable to protect tomato plants from crown and root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici in a soil-less microcosm, indicating that, at least in this plant-pathogen system, there is no advantage in using a signal-independent biocontrol strain. 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiological control 3aenzymes 3agenes 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aroot rot 3asecondary metabolites 3atomatoes 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aConserved Sequence 2aFusariumxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aCarruthers, Fiona1 aKeel, Christoph1 aMattart, Alexandre1 aBlumer, Caroline1 aPessi, Gabriella1 aGigot-Bonnefoy, Cécile1 aSchnider-Keel, Ursula1 aHeeb, Stephan1 aReimmann, Cornelia1 aHaas, Dieter0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 July, v. 16, no. 7 p.634-644dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.6343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02735naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245009600184300001600280500002400296520121700320650002901537650000801566650001901574650001301593650001501606650001001621650002601631650002501657650002201682650003201704650001901736650002401755650003301779650002901812650002801841650002001869650003801889650002301927650003401950700001901984700001802003700002002021773010502041852000902146856008602155655001202241IND4477905420221122215202.0140303s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447790542DNAL7 a129061172pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.8.7272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosander, Anna10aIdentification of Extracytoplasmic Proteins in Bradyrhizobium japonicum Using Phage Display  ap. 727-737.  aIncludes references  aA novel gene bank of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110spc4 was constructed using pG3DSS, a phagemid vector designed for detecting genes encoding secreted proteins. In this phagemid, the phage protein III lacks its indigenous signal peptide required for protein secretion, thus recombinant fusion proteins are displayed on the phage surface only if a functional signal peptide is provided by an inserted DNA fragment. In addition, the N-terminal half of protein III has been replaced by a short linker region (the E-tag) that is recognized by a monoclonal antibody, which enables isolation of phages displaying a fusion protein. The expression library described here, therefore, provides a powerful means to affinity select for B. japonicum genes encoding extracytoplasmic proteins. In total, 182 DNA sequences were analyzed, among which 132 different putative extracytoplasmic proteins could be identified. The function of most proteins could be predicted and support an extracytoplasmic localization. In addition, genes encoding novel extracytoplasmic proteins were found. In particular, a novel family of small proteins has been identified that is characterized by a conserved pattern of four cysteine residues. 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aDNA 3abacteriophages 3acysteine 3agene banks 3agenes 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anucleotide sequences 3aprotein secretion 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3asignal peptide 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBradyrhizobiumxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Library 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aFrykberg, Lars1 aAusmees, Nora1 aMüller, Peter.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2003 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.727-737dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.8.7273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02759naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001600162245016200178300001600340500002400356500001500380520099300395650001101388650001801399650001201417650003001429650002701459650002301486650002801509650002501537650003001562650001801592650002101610650002501631650002201656650001401678650002101692650002301713653002101736653001401757700001501771700001801786700001601804700001701820700001801837700001701855700001601872773012201888852000902010856009302019930003302112945002502145946001102170655001202181IND4434557720221122183652.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2051 aTolaini, V.10aLentinula edodes enhances the biocontrol activity of Cryptococcus laurentii against Penicillium expansum contamination and patulin production in apple fruits  ap. 243-249.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPenicillium expansum is a post-harvest pathogen of apples which can produce the hazardous mycotoxin patulin. The yeast Cryptococcus laurentii (LS28) is a biocontrol agent able to colonize highly oxidative environments such as wounds in apples. In this study culture filtrates of the basidiomycete Lentinula edodes (LF23) were used to enhance the biocontrol activity of LS28. In vitro L. edodes culture filtrates improved the growth of C. laurentii and the activity of its catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, which play a key role in oxidant scavenging. In addition, LF23 also delayed P. expansum conidia germination. The biocontrol effect of LS28 used together with LF23 in wounded apples improved the inhibition of P. expansum growth and patulin production in comparison with LS28 alone, under both experimental and semi-commercial conditions. The biocontrol effect was confirmed by a semi-quantitative PCR analysis set up for monitoring the growth of P. expansum. 3aapples 3afood analysis 3apatulin 3abiological control agents 3aCryptococcus laurentii 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3apostharvest diseases 3afungal diseases of plants 3afruit quality 3aLentinula edodes 3aPenicillium expansum 3afruit composition 3amushrooms 3aoxidative stress 3abiological control 0aEmbellisia allii 0aisolation1 aZjalic, S.1 aReverberi, M.1 aFanelli, C.1 aFabbri, A.A.1 aDel Fiore, A.1 aDe Rossi, P.1 aRicelli, A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 138, no. 3 p.243-249dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.0443Available from publisher's Web site  a20110802b20110902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle00907naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245009000132500005700222500001600279520015100295650003400446650002300480653002200503773005500525852000900580939003300589945000800622946001100630655001200641991609067010742620221122183738.0840503s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aPAR840025602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGudkov, I.I.10aStudies of the biology of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Russian.  aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora, development and fertility during infection of Tenebrio molitor under laboratory conditions, preservation in culture 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3abiological control 0aCulture, Nematoda0 tGel'minty nasekomykh.dMoskva : Nauka, 1980.7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840503c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01193naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245016400133500005700297500001600354500001500370520024700385650002800632650001800660650002300678653002400701653001300725653002500738773005500763852000900818939003300827945000800860946001100868655001200879991609066620742620221122154111.0840503s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aPAR840025632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanilov, L.G.10aFeatures of invasion and subsequent development of the nematode Neoaplectana carpocapsae strain "agriotos" in insects during free contact of parasite with host  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Russian.  a2019-12-06  aNeoaplectana carpocapsae "agriotos" strain, invasion and subsequent development of males and females in Galleria mellonella under laboratory conditions, interrelationship of nematode dose size (number), intensity of invasion, and insect death 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3apathogenicity 3aanimal development 0aInvasion mechanisms 0aNematoda 0aLife cycle, Nematoda0 tGel'minty nasekomykh.dMoskva : Nauka, 1980.7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840503c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03715naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172100002500181245010400206300001600310500002400326520180800350650002202158650001202180650002002192650001402212650001902226650002202245650002002267650001802287650002202305650002802327650006902355650003302424650002202457650004202479650004602521650002102567650002002588650002402608650001102632650001402643650003002657650005502687653003302742700001902775700001902794700001702813773012402830852000902954856009302963930003303056945002503089946001103114655001203125IND4434558720221122154046.0100326e20100430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455872DNAL7 a201530672pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2001 avan der Voort, Menno10aGerminant receptor diversity and germination responses of four strains of the Bacillus cereus group  ap. 108-115.  aIncludes references  aFour strains of the Bacillus cereus group were compared for their germinant receptor composition and spore germination capacity. Phylogenetic analysis of the germinant receptor encoding operons of the enterotoxic strains B. cereus ATCC 14579 and ATCC 10987, the emetic strain AH187, and the psychrotolerant strain Bacillus weihenstephanensis KBAB4, indicated a core group of five germinant receptor operons to be present in the four strains, with each strain containing one to three additional receptors. Using quantitative PCR, induction of expression during sporulation was confirmed for all identified germinant receptor operons in these strains. Despite the large overlap in receptors, diversity in amino acid-induced germination capacity was observed, with six out of 20 amino acids, serving as germinants for spores of all four strains. Each strain showed unique features: efficient germination of strain KBAB4 spores required non-inducing amounts of inosine as the co-germinant, strain ATCC 10987 spores germinated only efficiently after heat activation. Furthermore, strain ATCC 14579 and AH187 spores germinated without heat activation or inosine, with strain ATCC 14579 spores being triggered by all amino acids except phenylalanine and strain AH187 spores being specifically triggered efficiently only by phenylalanine. Analysis of all germination data did not reveal strict linkages between specific germinants and germinant receptors. Finally, the diversity in nutrient-induced germination capacity was also reflected in the diverse germination responses of heat-activated spores of the four B. cereus strains in food matrices, such as milk, rice water and meat bouillon, indicating that amino acid composition and/or availability of inosine are important germination determinants in foods. 3aspore germination 3astrains 3aBacillus cereus 3aphylogeny 3afood pathogens 3apathogen survival 3agene expression 3afood spoilage 3afoodborne illness 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBacillus cereusxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aFood Microbiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHot Temperature 2aInosinexmetabolism 2aOperon 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpores, Bacterialxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0agerminant receptor diversity1 aGarcia, Diego.1 aMoezelaar, Roy1 aAbee, Tjakko0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2010 Apr. 30, v. 139, no. 1-2 p.108-115dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.0283Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03823naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100003000199245017500229300001600404500002400420520160000444650002402044650002602068650002302094650002002117650001702137650002002154650002802174650003002202650001802232650002302250650001802273650002102291650002302312650002902335650003802364650002702402650006102429650004002490650003702530650001602567650001802583650002202601650003002623650001902653650003902672650001002711650001902721653004002740700002602780700002702806700002302833773012202856852000902978856009302987930003303080945002503113946001103138655001203149IND4434558120221122154112.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455812DNAL7 a201535412pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ114 0aQ204 0aQ5041 aPassone, María Alejandra10aDetection and quantification of Aspergillus section Flavi spp. in stored peanuts by real-time PCR of nor-1 gene, and effects of storage conditions on aflatoxin production  ap. 276-281.  aIncludes references  aAspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are the main species from section Flavi responsible for aflatoxin accumulation in stored peanuts. A real-time PCR (RT-PCR) system directed against the nor-1 gene of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway as target sequence was applied to monitor and quantify Aspergillus section Flavi population in peanuts. Kernels were conditioned at four water activity (a W) levels and stored during a 4-month period. The quantification of fungal genomic DNA in naturally contaminated peanut samples was performed using TaqMan fluorescent probe technology. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that DNA amounts accounting for a single conidium of A. parasiticus RCP08300 can be detected. A standard curve relating nor-1 copy numbers to colony forming units (cfu) was constructed. Counts of species of Aspergillus section Flavi from unknown samples obtained by molecular and conventional count (CC) methodologies were compared. A correlation between cfu data obtained by RT-PCR and CC methods was observed (r =0.613; p <0.0001); and the former always showed values higher by 0.5-1 log units. A decrease of fungal density was observed throughout the storage period, regardless of the quantification methodology applied. Total aflatoxin levels ranging from 1.1 to 200.4ng/g were registered in peanuts conditioned at the higher a W values (0.94-0.84 a W). The RT-PCR assay developed appears to be a promising tool in the prediction of potential aflatoxigenic risk in stored peanuts, even in case of low-level infections, and suitable for rapid, automated and high throughput analysis. 3amicrobial detection 3aquantitative analysis 3aAspergillus flavus 3astored products 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3amicrobial contamination 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3afood contamination 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3astorage conditions 2aAflatoxinsxbiosynthesis 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aArachisxmicrobiology. 2aAspergillusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBacteriological Techniquesxmethods 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethods 2aDNA, Fungal 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenome, Fungal 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSeeds 2aSpores, Fungal 0areal time polymerase chain reaction1 aRosso, Laura Cristina1 aCiancio, A.q(Aurelio)1 aEtcheverry, Miriam0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 138, no. 3 p.276-281dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03420naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002000156245015800176300001600334500001500350520158300365650002701948650001801975650001201993650002602005650002202031650002002053650001202073650004802085650003402133650002702167650002502194650002202219650002602241650002302267650000902290650003002299650003302329650004302362650002902405650002802434650002502462650002802487653001502515653001202530653002002542653002102562700001602583773008702599852000902686856007802695930003302773945001302806946001102819655001202830IND2036096020221122091219.0931206s1991    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203609602DNAL7 a20335622pmid7 a10.1007/BF002171082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldstein, R.S.10aDifferent effects of the biogenic amines dopamine, serotonin and octopamine on the thoracic and abdominal portions of the escape circuit in the cockroach  ap. 103-112.  a2019-12-04  a1. The escape behavior of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, is known to be modulated under various behavioral conditions (Camhi and Volman 1978; Camhi and Nolen 1981; Camhi 1988). Some of these modulatory effects occur in the last abdominal ganglion (Daley and Delcomyn 1981a, b; Libersat et al. 1989) and others in the thoracic ganglia (Camhi 1988). Neuromodulator substances are known to underlie behavioral modulation in various animals. Therefore, we have sought to determine whether topical application of putative neuromodulators of the escape circuit enhance or depress this circuit, and whether these effects differ in the last abdominal vs. the thoracic ganglia. 2. Topical application of the biogenic amines serotonin and dopamine to the metathoracic ganglion modulates the escape circuitry within this ganglion; serotonin decreases and dopamine enhances the response of leg motoneurons to activation of interneurons in the abdominal nerve cord by electrical or wind stimulation (Figs. 2-7). 3. The neuropil of the thoracic ganglia contains many catecholamine-histofluorescent processes bearing varicosities, providing a possible anatomical substrate for dopamine release sites (Fig. 8). 4. Topical application of octopamine to the terminal abdominal ganglion enhances the response of abdominal interneurons to wind stimulation of the cerci (Figs. 10, 11). In contrast, serotonin and dopamine have no effect at this site (Figs. 9, 11). 5. It is proposed that release of these biogenic amines may contribute to the known modulation of the cockroach escape response. 3acentral nervous system 3amotor neurons 3aganglia 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aelectrophysiology 3abiogenic amines 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBiogenic Aminesxpharmacology 2aDopaminexpharmacology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aElectrophysiology 2aGangliaxdrug effects 2aHistocytochemistry 2aMale 2aMotor Neuronsxphysiology 2aNervous Systemxdrug effects 2aNervous System Physiological Phenomena 2aOctopaminexpharmacology 2aPeriplanetaxphysiology 2aPhysical Stimulation 2aSerotoninxpharmacology 0amodulation 0aneurons 0aneuromodulation 0aescape responses1 aCamhi, J.M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g1991, v. 168, no. 1 p.103-112x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002171083Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02725naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010000143300001400243500001500257520136500272650001601637650000801653650001201661650001501673650002401688650001001712650002301722650002001745650003901765650002301804650000901827650001601836650001101852650000901863650002301872650003101895650003001926650004801956653000902004700001502013700001502028700001602043773009402059852000902153930003302162945001302195946001102208655001202219IND2164229320221122060912.0980923e199801  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216422932DNAL7 a94815292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhybro, A.10aPhosphate supplementation in young men: lack of effect on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover  ap. 29-33.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To examine the effect of phosphate supplements on calcium homeostasis and bone turnover in young men. Design: Study 1 was a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial of 1000 mg elemental phosphate given for one week, with a standard diet of 800 mg/d each of calcium and phosphorus. Study 2 was an escalating dose study of 0, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/d elemental phosphate, each given for one week, with a standard diet of 1000 mg/d each of calcium and phosphate. Setting: Northern General Hospital, Sheffield. Subjects: Study 1, 10 healthy men ages 19-32 y. Study 2, 12 healthy men ages 19-38 y. Interventions: Sodium acid phosphate tablets each containing 500 mg elemental phosphorus (16.1 mmol/d), given with meals. Results: Study 1, administration of 32.2 mmol/d phosphorus resulted in a mean increase of 13.2 mmol/d urinary phosphorus, a mean decrease of 1.1 mmol/d urinary calcium, and a mean increase of 7 ng/mL in serum intact PTH. There were no changes in serum phosphate, osteocalcin or urinary N-telopeptide excretion. Study 2, administration of 64.4 mmol/d phosphorus resulted in a mean increase of 27.2 mmol/d urinary phosphorus, a mean decrease of 2.4 mmol/d urinary calcium, with no change in serum phosphate, PTH or urinary deoxypyridinoline. Conclusions: Phosphate supplementation of the diet does not affect bone turnover in young men. 3aosteocalcin 3amen 3acalcium 3aphosphates 3adietary supplements 2aAdult 2aAmino Acidsxurine 2aBone Remodeling 2aCalciumxbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDiet 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOsteocalcinxblood 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood 2aPhosphatesxbloodxurine. 2aPhosphorusxadministration & dosagexurine. 0adiet1 aJagger, H.1 aBarker, M.1 aEastell, R.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1998 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.29-33x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03636naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245009800146300001600244520173200260650001401992650001002006650001402016650001502030650001602045650001102061650003202072650002302104650002002127650001402147650000802161650002002169650001702189650001102206650001502217650001002232650001802242650001602260650002002276650002802296650002302324650001102347650003302358650003902391650001102430650001802441650001602459650001402475650005402489650001502543650001702558650001702575651001302592651002802605653001802633700001702651700001902668700001402687700001702701700001902718700001602737773009502753852000902848930003302857945001302890946001102903655001202914IND2330920420221122060921.0030220e200205  uk |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233092042DNAL7 a120010122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillamor, E.10aHIV status and sociodemographic correlates of maternal body size and wasting during pregnancy  ap. 415-424.  aObjective: To examine HIV status and sociodemographic variables as correlates of body size (height, body mass index (BMI), and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC)) and wasting (MUAC < 22 cm) in pregnant women. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Four antenatal clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Subjects: Women presenting for first prenatal visit before the 23rd week of gestation, between April 1995 and July 1997 (n = 13 760). Results: Mean MUAC, BMI and height were 25.5 cm, 23.5 kg/m2 and 155.1 cm, respectively. The prevalence of HIV infection was 13.1% and the overall prevalence of wasting was 4.7%. Wasting was 34% (95% Cl = 3%, 73%) more prevalent among HIV-infected than in uninfected mothers, after adjusting for week of gestation, height and sociodemographic indicators. The risk of wasting associated with HIV infection was highest among women with low level of education or unable to contribute to the household income. From a multiple linear regression model, BMI was positively associated with mother's age, level of education and money spent on food, but not with HIV infection, after adjusting for week of gestation. In multivariate analysis, height increased monotonically by categories of maternal age and level of education, and was also positively correlated with the ability to contribute to household income, the amount of money spent on food per person per day, and having a professional partner. Conclusion: HIV infection is a significant risk factor for wasting among pregnant women, particularly in groups of low socioeconomic status (SES). SES indicators are strongly correlated with maternal height and with BMI during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy independently of HIV status. 3ainfection 3awomen 3apregnancy 3ademography 3abody weight 3aheight 3aanthropometric measurements 3adisease prevalence 3arisk assessment 3aeducation 3aage 3afood purchasing 3arisk factors 3aincome 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Height 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEducational Status 2aFemale 2aHIV Infectionsxepidemiology 2aHIV Wasting Syndromexepidemiology 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMiddle Aged 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Infectiousxepidemiology 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aSocial Class 3aTanzania 0aTanzaniaxepidemiology. 0aweight losses1 aMsamanga, G.1 aSpiegelman, D.1 aColey, J.1 aHunter, D.J.1 aPeterson, K.E.1 aFawzi, W.W.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2002 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.415-424x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03809naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184100001800193245012500211300001600336500002400352500001500376520173900391650001502130650001802145650001702163650002902180650001902209650001302228650001902241650002302260650001402283650001902297650001602316650001302332650001502345650001502360650002402375650001702399650001202416650001602428650002102444650001402465650005102479650003102530650000902561650002602570650001202596650002102608650002102629650001602650650001902666650004502685653001002730653001702740653000902757700001702766700001802783773011002801852000902911856009602920930003303016945002503049946001303074655001203087IND4434551420221121223032.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443455142DNAL7 a200477552pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aM0011 aButts, I.A.E.10aSeasonal variations in seminal plasma and sperm characteristics of wild-caught and cultivated Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua  ap. 873-885.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective was to investigate changes, throughout the spawning season, in body size attributes and quantitative semen characteristics of wild-caught and cultivated Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L. Sperm velocity increased significantly throughout the spawning season of cod from both origins. Curvilinear velocity (VCL; 30sec post-activation) increased from 78.9±6.5 to 128.2±6.5μm/sec (mean±SEM) between the beginning and end of the spawning season, respectively, for wild-caught cod, whereas for cultivated fish, it increased from 26.6±2.4 to 48.9±3.1μm/sec between January and March. Spermatocrit did not undergo a significant seasonal change in wild-caught cod but did thicken for cultivated cod (24.6±4.2% in January to 40.5±4.4% in April; P<0.01). Sperm head area, perimeter, length, and width declined significantly at the end of the spawning season of cod from both origins (all P values<0.01). Seminal plasma osmolality and Na⁺ ion concentration followed a dome-shaped function through the spawning season for both wild-caught and cultivated cod (P<0.05). For cultivated cod, seminal plasma pH was significantly lower at the start of the spawning season (P<0.001), whereas Ca²⁺ increased then decreased (P<0.05). Body size attributes, spermatocrit, and seminal plasma constituents had significant relationships with sperm activity variables. These relationships varied as a function of time post-activation, month, and fish origin. Our findings may be used to (i) assess spermiation stage without killing males; (ii) optimize semen collection for hatchery production; (iii) characterize the potential impact of farming on sperm quality; and (iv) improve success of sperm cryopreservation and short-term storage. 3afish farms 3anormal values 3aGadus morhua 3amale reproductive system 3asperm motility 3aspawning 3aseminal plasma 3aseasonal variation 3abody size 3amale fertility 3aspermatozoa 3avelocity 3aosmolarity 3acod (fish) 3areference standards 3awild animals 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBody Composition 2aBody Size 2aGadus morhuaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aSeasons 2aSemenxchemistry 2aSodiumxanalysis 2aSperm Count 2aSperm Motility 2aSpermatozoaxphysiologyxultrastructure. 0asemen 0aspermatocrit 0afish1 aLitvak, M.K.1 aTrippel, E.A.0 tTheriogenology.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 73, no. 7 p.873-885dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.11.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/05/07  aOther US 7aarticle03581naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002000178245008800198300001800286500002400304506007600328520195200404506003702356650001402393650005302407650001102460650002002471650001302491650002202504650001402526650004602540650001102586650002702597650003702624650001102661650000902672650001602681650004602697651001802743700001802761700002102779700002102800700002502821700002602846773010502872852000902977856007702986655001203063IND4443160420221207124053.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444316042DNAL7 a206394522pmid7 aPMC29451582pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-04332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Darin E.10aScreening for Diabetes and Pre-Diabetes With Proposed A1C-Based Diagnostic Criteria  ap. 2184-2189.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: An International Expert Committee (IEC) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) proposed diagnostic criteria for diabetes and pre-diabetes based on A1C levels. We hypothesized that screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with A1C measurements would differ from using oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared pre-diabetes, dysglycemia (diabetes or pre-diabetes), and diabetes identified by the proposed criteria (A1C ≥6.5% for diabetes and 6.0-6.4% [IEC] or 5.7-6.4% [ADA] for high risk/pre-diabetes) with standard OGTT diagnoses in three datasets. Non-Hispanic white or black adults without known diabetes who had A1C and 75-g OGTT measurements were included from the prospective Screening for Impaired Glucose Tolerance study (n = 1,581), and from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (n = 2014), and NHANES 2005-2006 (n = 1,111). RESULTS: OGTTs revealed pre-diabetes in 35.8% and diabetes in 5.2% of combined study subjects. A1C provided receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas for diabetes of 0.79-0.83, but ROC curve areas were [less-than or equal to]0.70 for dysglycemia or pre-diabetes. The proposed criteria missed 70% of individuals with diabetes, 71-84% with dysglycemia, and 82-94% with pre-diabetes. Compared with the IEC criteria, the ADA criteria for pre-diabetes resulted in fewer false-negative and more false-positive result. There were also racial differences, with false-positive results being more common in black subjects and false-negative results being more common in white subjects. With use of NHANES 2005-2006 data, ~5.9 million non-Hispanic U.S. adults with unrecognized diabetes and 43-52 million with pre-diabetes would be missed by screening with A1C. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed A1C diagnostic criteria are insensitive and racially discrepant for screening, missing most Americans with undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmericans 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3adata collection 3adiabetes 3aglucose tolerance 3ascreening 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdiagnosisxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrediabetic Statexdiagnosisxmetabolism. 3aUnited States1 aRhee, Mary K.1 aHerrick, Kirsten1 aZiemer, David C.1 aTwombly, Jennifer G.1 aPhillips, Lawrence S.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.2184-2189dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-04333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03999naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002500178245012100203300001800324500002400342506007600366520185700442506003702299650001802336650001902354650002002373650001002393650003602403650001402439650001002453650001202463650001202475650002102487650001802508650001502526650004302541650001302584650002202597650000902619650000902628650002202637650003002659650002602689650006902715650001102784650003102795650001102826650004102837650000902878650003102887650004002918700002302958700002702981700002303008700002303031700002103054700002403075700002303099773010503122852000903227856007703236655001203313IND4443160120221207120926.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444316012DNAL7 a205737532pmid7 aPMC29451542pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-03892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzo, Maria Rosaria10aRelationships Between Daily Acute Glucose Fluctuations and Cognitive Performance Among Aged Type 2 Diabetic Patients  ap. 2169-2174.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) is a significant determinant of overall metabolic control as well as increased risk for diabetes complications. Older individuals with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have moderate cognitive deficits and structural changes in brain tissue. Considering that poor metabolic control is considered a deranging factor for cognitive performance in diabetic patients, we evaluated whether the contributions of MAGE to cognitive status in older patients with type 2 diabetes were independent from the main markers of glycemic control, such as sustained chronic hyperglycemia (A1C), postprandial glycemia (PPG), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 121 older patients with type 2 diabetes, 48-h continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring (CSGM) were assessed. MAGE and PPG were evaluated during CSGM. The relationship of MAGE to performance on cognitive tests was assessed, with adjustment for age, glycemic control markers, and other determinants of cognitive status. The cognitive tests were a composite score of executive and attention functioning and the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: MAGE was significantly correlated with MMSE (r = 0.83; P < 0.001) and with cognition composite score (r = 0.68; P < 0.001). Moreover, MAGE was associated with the MMSE (P < 0.001) and cognition composite score (P < 0.001) independently of age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip (WHR) ratio, drug intake, physical activity, mean arterial blood pressure, FPG, PPG, and A1C. CONCLUSIONS: MAGE during a daily period was associated with an impairment of cognitive functioning independent of A1C, FPG, and PPG. The present data suggest that interventional trials in older patients with type 2 diabetes should target not only A1C, PPG, and FPG but also daily acute glucose swings.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3abrain 3acentral nervous system diseases 3acognition 3adrugs 3afasting 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3ahyperglycemia 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3arisk 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aGlyburidextherapeutic use 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMetforminxtherapeutic use 2aThiazolidinedionesxtherapeutic use1 aMarfella, Raffaele1 aBarbieri, Michelangela1 aBoccardi, Virginia1 aVestini, Francesco1 aLettieri, Biagio1 aCanonico, Silvestro1 aPaolisso, Giuseppe0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.2169-2174dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-03893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01545naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245017900157300001800336520048900354650002100843650001300864653001200877653001900889700002200908700002300930700001900953773010200972852000901074856007701083930003301160945001301193946001301206655001201219IND2123389620221120221907.0980615e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212338962DNAL7 a10.1021/jf96045042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNefkens, G.H.L.10aSynthesis of a phthaloylglycine-derived strigol analogue and its germination stimulatory activity toward seeds of the parasitic weeds Striga hermonthica and Orobanche crenata  ap. 2273-2277.  aThe newly designed strigol analogue Nijmegen 1 (rac 7) was prepared in high overall yield starting from N-phthaloylglycine.

Since Pol I transcribes rDNA repeats with high processivity and polymerase density, transcription termination is a critical process. Early in vitro studies proposed polymerase pausing by Reb1 and transcript release at the T-rich element T1 determined transcription termination. However recent in vivo studies revealed a 'torpedo' mechanism for Pol I termination: co-transcriptional RNA cleavage by Rnt1 provides an entry site for the 5'-3' exonuclease Rat1 that degrades Pol I-associated transcripts destabilizing the transcription complex. Significantly Rnt1 inactivation in vivo reveals a second co-transcriptional RNA cleavage event at T1 which provides Pol I with an alternative termination pathway. An intact Reb1-binding site is also required for Rnt1-independent termination. Consequently our results reconcile the original Reb1-mediated termination pathway as part of a failsafe mechanism for this essential transcription process.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aKawauchi, Junya1 aProudfoot, Nick J.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 4 p.1439-1448x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq8943Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02246naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245015100157300001800308520118500326650001201511650002301523650002201546650002101568700001801589700001901607700001601626700001901642773010201661852000901763856007701772930003301849945001301882946001301895655001201908IND2123386420221120211403.0980615e199706  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212338642DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960569c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalundo, T.M.M.10aMethod for the rapid headspace analysis of mango (Mangifera indica L.) homogenate volatile constituents and factors affecting quantitative results  ap. 2187-2194.  aA rapid GC method was developed to analyze the headspace composition of cultivar Kent, Keitt, and Tommy Atkins mango homogenates. Factors affecting quantitative results were also studied. Of the 13 volatile compounds identified, 9 were terpene hydrocarbons: alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, 3-carene, myrcene, limonene, p-cymene, terpinolene, alpha-copaene, and caryophyllene. Volatile concentrations were quantified using peak height calibration curves (peak height vs concentration). Linear relationships were derived for all compounds except caryophyllene. Rate of peak height increase was slower at caryophyllene levels <2 ppm than at those greater than or equal to 2 ppm. Volatile levels increased as homogenate was diluted with up to 50% water. Addition of CaCl2 during blending, to inhibit degradative enzymes, induced gelation, which resulted in decreased volatile concentrations in the headspace. Sonicating gelled homogenate resulted in partial liquefaction and an increase in headspace volatiles. These results indicate that significant interactions between mango pulp and volatile compounds occur and, depending on sample preparation method, can affect quantitative results. 3amangoes 3avolatile compounds 3achemical analysis 3aflavor compounds1 aBaldwin, E.A.1 aMoshonas, M.G.1 aBaker, R.A.1 aShewfelt, R.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.2187-2194x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960569c3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245016700204300001600371520137400387592002801761650002001789650002601809650001801835650001101853650001601864650001501880650001601895650001501911650001801926650001801944650001901962651001001981653002401991653004502015653006102060653002402121700001902145700001702164700001702181773008702198856008402285852000902369655001202378IND60635708720221121150725.0190403e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063570872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Lixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7557-535710aPhotography measured-value magnification improves local correlation maximization-complementary superiority method of hyperspectral analysis of soil total nitrogen  ap. 106-114.  aAccurate remote retrieval of soil total nitrogen (TN) content is a challenging task due to many factors including soil color. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the photography measured-value magnification (PMM) method improves estimation accuracy by reducing the influence of soil color, when combined with the local correlation maximization-complementary superiority (LCMCS) method. Soil samples were collected from three areas of subsided land in Renqiu, Changzhou, and Fengfeng District, all located in Hebei Province, China. Soil spectral reflectance was measured using an ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer in a laboratory environment and the TN content was determined by the Kjeldahl method. After PMM analysis, the LCMCS method was used to build models for TN estimation. The results indicate that the LCMCS model of the PMM group produced lower prediction errors (Coefficient of determination [R2] = 0.893, root mean square error of validation [RMSEV] = 0.090, mean relative error of validation [MREV] = 5.721%) when compared with the local correlation maximization-partial least squares regression (LCM-PLSR) model of the PMM group and the models of the conventional group. Overall, the PMM method combined with LCMCS has great potential to improve the estimation accuracy of TN content and enriches the choice of observation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKjeldahl method 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aphotography 3aprediction 3areflectance 3asoil color 3asoil sampling 3aspectrometers 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina 0areflectance spectra 0aphotography measured-value magnification 0alocal correlation maximization-complementary superiority 0asoil total nitrogen1 aXue, Fengchang1 aWang, Yunjia1 aLiu, Keqiang0 tCatena.g2018 June, v. 165 p.106-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02021naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006100166300001800227520100200245592002801247650001301275650001201288650002101300650001701321650001801338650001601356650002201372700002001394700002101414700002201435700002101457773010301478856008101581852000901662655001201671IND60569606720221121130632.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960672DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293161100652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakarov, O.

Lands contaminated with radionuclides and used in agriculture and forestry are often removed from the system of land taxation. In this case, their cadastral value becomes an excessive element of the state cadaster of real estate. An approach toward cadastral valuation of such lands suggested by the authors assumes the creation of a system of compensation payments as the main source of financing of land rehabilitation and soil conservation measures. An original system of calculation of such payments has been tested for radioactively contaminated lands in Plavsk district of Tula oblast. It is argued that compensation payments for radioactively contaminated agrocenoses should be higher than those for natural cenoses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforestry 3afunding 3aland restoration 3aproperty tax 3aradionuclides 3aremediation 3asoil conservation1 aTsvetnov, E.

As such, they have not been able to capture the response to actual changes in the environment. This paper takes a novel approach to identifying voluntary conservation by studying the impact of changing storage levels on urban water usage in the context of a prolonged drought and a highly ’water aware’ community. Our results suggest that voluntary conservation increases substantially when water is scarce and the public value of the savings is greatest. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of environmental information campaigns in general, and urban water demand management in particular.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3awater conservation 3awater utilization1 aSteinhauser, Ralf0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2014 Oct., v. 59, no. 2 p.167-185dSpringer-Verlagx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-013-9722-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245014500205300001800350506007600368520100100444592002801445506003701473650002701510650002901537650001701566650001201583650001801595650002501613650001201638650001301650650001201663700002001675700002801695773012701723856008101850852000901931655001201940IND60479159320221207113627.0160119e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047915932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6998-y2doi7 aPMC47171672pmcid7 a264816192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiseni, Aida10aIdentification of catalytically important residues of the carotenoid 1,2-hydratases from Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Thiocapsa roseopersicina  ap. 1275-1284.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCarotenoid 1,2-hydratases (CrtC) catalyze the selective addition of water to an isolated carbon–carbon double bond. Although their involvement in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is well understood, little is known about the mechanism by which these hydratases transform carotenoids such as lycopene into the corresponding hydroxyl compounds. Key residues were identified at positions His239, Trp241, Tyr266, and Asp268 in CrtC from Rubrivivax gelatinosus (and corresponding positions in Thiocapsa roseopersicina). Alanine mutants at these positions were found to be completely inactive, suggesting their direct involvement in the catalytic reaction. Our resulting mechanistic hypothesis is in analogy with the recently studied class of terpenoid cyclase enzymes containing a highly acidic aspartic residue in their active site. We propose that a similar aspartic acid residue, which is conserved through all putative CrtCs, is involved in initial protonation of the double bond in lycopene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRubrivivax gelatinosus 3aThiocapsa roseopersicina 3aactive sites 3aalanine 3aaspartic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzymes 3alycopene 3amutants1 aOtten, Linda G.1 aArends, Isabel W.

Studies that investigate trade-offs between ecosystem services are urgently needed for informing policy-makers. We examine the trade-offs between a provisioning (revenues from timber selling) and regulating (carbon storage and sequestration) ecosystem services among seven alternative forest management regimes in a large boreal forest production landscape. First, we estimate the potential of the landscape to produce harvest revenues and store/sequester carbon across a 50-year time period. Then, we identify conflicts between harvest revenues and carbon storage and sequestration. Finally, we apply multiobjective optimization to find optimal combinations of forest management regimes that maximize harvest revenues and carbon storage/sequestration. Our results show that no management regime alone is able to either maximize harvest revenues or carbon services and that a combination of different regimes is needed. We also show that with a relatively little economic investment (5% decrease in harvest revenues), a substantial increase in carbon services could be attained (9% for carbon storage; 15–23% for carbon sequestration). We conclude that it is possible to achieve win–win situations applying diversified forest management planning at a landscape level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic investment 3aecosystem services 3ahumans 3aincome 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3atimber production 0aCarbon storage and sequestration 0aClimate change 0aEcosystem service trade-offs 0aFinland 0aForest management 0aMultiobjective optimization1 aJuutinen, Artti1 aMazziotta, Adriano1 aMiettinen, Kaisa1 aPodkopaev, Dmitry1 aReunanen, Pasi1 aMönkkönen, Mikko0 tEcosystem services.g2015 Aug., v. 14 p.179-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245016600182300001600348520152300364592002801887650001401915650001101929650001601940650001601956650001301972650000901985650001201994650002302006650002402029650001302053650001302066650001402079650001102093650001102104650001102115651001502126773010202141856009002243852000902333655001202342IND60439618320221120133948.0151024e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961832DNAL7 a10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029971.11713.412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKevrekidis, Theodoros10aPopulation dynamics, growth and reproduction of Corophium insidiosum (Crustacea: Amphipoda) at low salinities in Monolimni lagoon (Evros Delta, North Aegean Sea)  ap. 117-132.  aDistribution, population dynamics, growth and aspects of reproductive biology of Corophium insidiosum were investigated in Monolimni lagoon. Samples were collected in July 1997 (at 30 psu S) and during February 1998–May 1999 (at 0.1–5.7 psu S). Corophium insidiosumwas almost exclusively found in the outer part of the lagoon, which showed a higher water renewal rate. Population density gradually decreased during winter and spring, when salinity was lower than 1 psu and the amphipod finally vanished from the lagoon. Salinity increase during summer (1.2–5.7 psu) was followed by the re-occurrence of C. insidiosum with a time lag of 2–3 months. Population density increased in autumn and peaked in early winter at salinities 1.6–4.2 psu. Three cohorts appeared in the population during September 1998–March 1999. Breeding activity peaked in early autumn (14–21 °C, 4 psu S) and ceased after December (2–6.5 °C, ¡1.5 psu S). The preponderance of females in the large size classes resulted in a female- biased sex ratio in the whole population. The population showed a growth rate of 7.5–11.2 μm d⁻¹ being faster in autumn (9–21 °C, 3–4 psu S) than in winter (2–12 °C, 0.2–3 psu). An exponential relation existed between body length and cephalic length or dry body weight, while brood size was directly related to body length. Mean brood size was small (4.96 early embryos) and egg loss during development high (53%), possibly as a consequence of low salinities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aautumn 3abody length 3abody weight 3abreeding 3aeggs 3afemales 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3asalinity 3asampling 3asex ratio 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aAegean Sea0 tHydrobiologia.g2004 July, v. 522, no. 1-3 p.117-132dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029971.11713.413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245010700176300001600283520101900299592002801318650001501346650002301361650000901384650002201393651001601415700002101431700002001452700002201472700002201494700001901516700001801535700002101553700001901574700002001593700002201613773010201635856009001737852000901827655001201836IND60439616420221120133900.0151024e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961642DNAL7 a10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029979.68265.3e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKravtsova, L.S.10aMacrozoobenthic communities of underwater landscapes in the shallow-water zone of southern Lake Baikal  ap. 193-205.  aSpecies composition and distribution of macrozoobenthos have been studied in the shallow water zone (0–20 m) of Southern Lake Baikal (Bolshiye Koty Bay). The amount of taxa recorded reached up to 244 species distributed among 16 distinctive communities of complex structure and high species diversity. The Shannon index of specific diversity was found to vary between 2.9 and 4.8 bits. Mosaic spatial distribution of communities is controlled by both biotic and abiotic factors. Trophic zones with respect to the bottom-dwellers are determined by two lithodynamic phenomena: washout and accumulation of thin deposits (fine to medium silt and mud). The bottom with coarse clastic material (pebbles and boulders), where fine sediments are eroded and resuspended, is dominated by immobile and mobile sestonophagous species as well as by the communities dominated by detrito- and phytophagous species. Areas with soft fine sediments are dominated by macro-invertebrates, which ingest the substrate indiscriminately.  aPublisher supplied data 3alandscapes 3amacroinvertebrates 3asilt 3aspecies diversity 3aLake Baikal1 aKamaltynov, R.M.1 aKarabanov, E.B.1 aMekhanikova, I.V.1 aSitnikova, T.

Here, we show the results of the monitoring of needle ice development at four plots located at 2670 m a.s.l. close to the Stelvio Pass in the Italian Central Alps during 2016. Needle Ice formation and evolution with time was monitored through the photogrammetric technique of the Structure from Motion (SfM). Our monitoring data included also quantitative measurements of some selected physical and climatic parameters like air temperature, ground temperature and ground water content at depths of 2 and 5 cm. Our data demonstrate that needle ice can develop with a relatively low ground water content (13.2%), at a relatively high minimum ground temperature (−0.3 °C) and with a low cooling rate (<1.8 °C h−1). Moreover, for the first time, we observed that needle ice can form below a thin snow cover (<25 mm) that can enhance the sensible heat flow from the ground to the atmosphere and, therefore, promote the cooling of the near surface ground. Statistically, the minimum air temperature results in the leading factor for the needle ice growth.The total frost heave seems to be related to the abundance of fine material (although we couldn't demonstrate it statistically). The absence of statistically significant relationships between frost heave and frost creep could be probably due to the importance of the observed needle ice toppling and the possible sliding of the clasts during the melting phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3aclimate 3acooling 3aecosystems 3afrost 3afrost heave 3agroundwater 3aheat flow 3aice 3amelting 3amonitoring 3aphotogrammetry 3aquantitative analysis 3asnowpack 3asoil formation 3awater content 3aAlps region 0aNeedle ice 0aFrost heave 0aFrost creep 0aAlps 0aPeriglacial 0aPhotogrammetric techniques1 aCannone, Nicoletta1 aGuglielmin, Mauro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5966-95720 tCatena.g2018 May, v. 164 p.62-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245016800175520162700343592002801970650002401998650002502022650002202047650002602069650001502095650001502110650000902125650002102134650001902155650001802174650001402192650002602206650002302232650003002255650002302285650001602308650001102324650001102335650001702346650001302363650001802376650001502394653001402409653005102423653002502474653001902499700002202518700001902540700001902559700001902578700002502597700001702622773009902639856009002738852000902828655001202837IND60743632420221118002208.0210813e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074363242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulgar, Rodrigo10aMicro-encapsulated grape pomace extract (MGPE) as a feed additive improves growth performance, antioxidant capacity, and shifts the gut microbiome of rainbow trout  aThe salmon industry has reduced fishmeal in aquafeeds with different sources of alternative proteins, including low-cost plant meals. However, high replacement levels cause negative impacts on carnivore salmonids' growth, partly explained by alterations in the inflammatory and antioxidant response. To cope with this situation, we evaluated the effect of a dietary polyphenol supplementation of micro-encapsulated grape pomace extract (MGPE) from wine industry residual by-product in a diet high in soybean meal on growth performance, plasma antioxidant capacity, and gut microbial communities of Oncorhynchus mykiss for 30, 60 and 90 days. For this purpose, we first compared two commercial diets with low and high soybean meal (SBM) content without MGPE, and as expected, the high soybean content diet showed a significant decrease in the antioxidant capacity and the growth performance of the fish. Interestingly, this phenomenon was reverted in fish fed with the high SBM diet supplemented with the MGPE. Complementary, a fish gut microbiome analysis showed a time-dependent drop in microbial richness and diet-dependent changes in the bacterial communities from 60 days of treatment. The data also revealed that a more cooperative gut bacterial community interaction network could be part of the adjustment that explains the recovery of growth and antioxidant capacity in fish fed with the high SBM content diet supplemented with MGPE. These results present the basis for using residual pomace polyphenol extracts from the winemaking process in fish diets to improve the salmon farming industry's sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture feeds 3abacterial communities 3abyproducts 3acarnivores 3adiet 3adigestive system 3afeed additives 3afish industry 3afish meal 3agrape pomace extracts 3agrowth performance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicroencapsulation 3apolyphenols 3apomace 3asalmon 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3awine industry 3awinemaking 0aSalmonids 0aMicro-encapsulated grape pomace extract (MGPE) 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aGut microbiome1 aMandakovic, Dinka1 aSalgado, Pablo1 aVenegas, Lucas1 aOrtiz, Daniela1 aPeña-Neira, Álvaro1 aWacyk, Jurij0 tAquaculture.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 544 p.737129-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015800176300001600334520102600350592002801376650002101404650002701425650002301452650002501475650001701500650001401517650001901531650001101550650001701561650002101578650002601599650002001625650004101645650001101686650001301697650000901710650001301719651001101732651001201743653002101755653001801776653001801794653001601812653002201828700002301850700002201873700002001895700003001915700002501945700002101970773010301991856008502094852000902179655001202188IND60479157420221121011936.0160119e20160318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047915742DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10409932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarrelli, Mariangela10aComposition, antibacterial, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of essential oils from three Origanum species growing wild in Lebanon and Greece  ap. 735-739.  aThe essential oils from Origanum dictamnus , Origanum libanoticum and Origanum microphyllum were analysed by GC-MS, finding carvacrol, p-cymene, linalool, γ-terpinene and terpinen-4-ol as major components.

Environmental history may, however, influence the response of corals to stress and affect bleaching outcomes. A suite of physiological and immunological traits was evaluated to test the effect of environmental history (low vs. high variable pCO₂) on the response of the reef coral Montipora capitata to elevated temperature (24.5 °C vs. thermal ramping to 30.5 °C). Heating reduced maximum photochemical efficiency (Fᵥ/Fₘ) and chlorophyll a but increased tissue melanin in corals relative to the ambient treatment, indicating a role of the melanin synthesis pathway in the early stages of thermal stress. However, interactions of environmental history and temperature treatment were not observed. Rather, parallel reaction norms were the primary response pattern documented across the two temperature treatments with respect to reef environmental history. Corals with a history of greater pCO₂ variability had higher constitutive antioxidative and immune activity (i.e., catalase, superoxide dismutase, prophenoloxidase) and Fᵥ/Fₘ, but lower melanin and chlorophyll a, relative to corals with a history of lower pCO₂ variability. This suggests that reef environments with high magnitude pCO₂ variability promote greater antioxidant and immune activity in resident corals. These results demonstrate coral physiology and immunity reflect environmental attributes that vary over short distances, and that these differences may buffer the magnitude of thermal stress effects on coral phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSymbiodinium 3aantioxidants 3ableaching 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acoral bleaching 3acorals 3aimmunity 3amelanin 3aphenotype 3aphotochemistry 3aprophenoloxidase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asymbiosis 3athermal stress 3awater temperature1 aRicci, ContessaA.1 aFoulds, GraceE.1 aMydlarz, LauraD.1 aGates, RuthD.1 aPutnam, HollieM.0 tMarine biology.g2018 Mar., v. 165, no. 3 p.56-56dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3317-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001300190245017700203300001600380520159800396592002801994653000802022653000802030653000802038653000902046653000902055653000702064653001002071653000802081653000802089653000902097653002702106653003002133653002102163653001402184653002702198653001602225653001602241653002202257653001102279700002102290700002502311700002202336700002202358773007802380856008302458852000902541655001202550IND60555022020221119015941.0161026e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055502202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.12.0012doi7 aPMC43098502pmcid7 a255602412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ling10aCombined inhibition of glycolysis, the pentose cycle, and thioredoxin metabolism selectively increases cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in human breast and prostate cancer  ap. 127-135.  aInhibition of glycolysis using 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG, 20mM, 24–48h) combined with inhibition of the pentose cycle using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, 300µM, 24–48h) increased clonogenic cell killing in both human prostate (PC-3 and DU145) and human breast (MDA-MB231) cancer cells via a mechanism involving thiol-mediated oxidative stress. Surprisingly, when 2DG+DHEA treatment was combined with an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis (l-buthionine sulfoximine; BSO, 1mM) that depleted GSH>90% of control, no further increase in cell killing was observed during 48h exposures. In contrast, when an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity (Auranofin; Au, 1µM), was combined with 2DG+DHEA or DHEA-alone for 24h, clonogenic cell killing was significantly increased in all three human cancer cell lines. Furthermore, enhanced clonogenic cell killing seen with the combination of DHEA+Au was nearly completely inhibited using the thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 20mM). Redox Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells also supported the conclusion that thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) oxidation was enhanced by treatment DHEA+Au and inhibited by NAC. Importantly, normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were not as sensitive to 2DG, DHEA, and Au combinations as their cancer cell counterparts (MDA-MB-231). Overall, these results support the hypothesis that inhibition of glycolysis and pentose cycle activity, combined with inhibition of Trx metabolism, may provide a promising strategy for selectively sensitizing human cancer cells to oxidative stress-induced cell killing.  aPublisher supplied data 0a2DG 0aNAC 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aDHEA 0aAu 0aG6PDH 0aROS 0aTrx 0aTrxR 0aDehydroepiandrosterone 0aPentose phosphate pathway 0aOxidative stress 0aAuranofin 0aButhionine sulfoximine 0aGlutathione 0aThioredoxin 0a2-Deoxy-d-glucose 0aCancer1 aFath, Melissa A.1 aScarbrough, Peter M.1 aWatson, Walter H.1 aSpitz, Douglas R.0 tRedox Biology.g2015 Apr., v. 4 p.127-135dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005400137245008600191300001800277500002000295520177300315592002802088596034102116650002302457650002402480650001202504650002102516650001602537650002502553650000702578650001202585650001702597650001402614650000902628650000902637650002802646650001602674650001802690650001702708650001002725700001702735700001502752700001902767700005502786700001602841700005602857773012602913856007203039852000903111655001203120IND60783142920221120150609.0220715e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078314292DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.70082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7750-402912aA non‐chemical weed control strategy, introducing duckweed into the paddy field  ap. 3654-3663.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Herbicide resistance in weeds and environmental pollution resulting from excessive application of chemical herbicides keeps increasing. Development of environment‐friendly and effective weed management strategies are required for sustainable agricultural production. In this study we investigated the effects of duckweeds (Landoltia punctata (G. Meyer) Les & D. J. Crawford and Spirodela polyrhiza (Linnaeus) Schle iden) introduction on the weed community and rice growth in paddy fields. RESULTS: The study was conducted in the two rice‐growing seasons (2018 and 2019) with three treatments: rice grown without duckweed introduction (CK), with L. punctata introduction (LP), and with S. polyrhiza introduction (SP). On average, LP and SP significantly reduced total weed density by more than 90% and 97%, respectively. Early in the rice‐growing season, both duckweed species completely prevented weed growth. Further, both species significantly promoted rice plant growth in the advanced stages. SP significantly improved grain yield of rice by 23%. Light transmittance, temperature of the floodwater and soil, floodwater pH, and dissolved oxygen content significantly decreased following introduction of the duckweeds, indicating that the duckweeds introduction might inhibit weeds growth by altering environmental factors. CONCLUSION: This study provides a possible environment‐friendly way to inhibit weed biomass in the paddy field by introducing duckweeds and interpreted the possible reasons of the impacts of duckweed on environmental variables. Weed control is beneficial for rice growth. Duckweed coverage might be limited in open fields and the associated practice requires additional investigation. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cShanghai Agriculture Applied Technology Development Program, China (Grant No. T20180407), National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFD0801106) and Foundation of Key Laboratory of Technology and Model for Cyclic Utilization from Agricultural Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural, P.

Leachate volume prediction is essential for sustainable waste management and leachate treatment processes. The accurate estimation of leachate generation rates is often considered a challenge, especially in developing countries, due to the lack of reliable data and high measurement costs. Leachate generation is related to several variable factors, including meteorological data, waste generation rates, and landfill design conditions. Large variations in these factors lead to complicated leachate modeling processes. The aims of this study are to determine the key elements contributing to leachate production and then develop an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model to predict leachate generation rates. Accuracy of the final model performance was tested and evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (R). The study results defined dumped waste quantity, rainfall level, and emanated gases as the most significant contributing factors in leachate generation. The best model structure consisted of two triangular fuzzy membership functions and a hybrid training algorithm with eight fuzzy rules. The proposed ANFIS model showed a good performance with an overall correlation coefficient of 0.952.  aPublisher supplied data  aFL001-13SUS; RP017C-15SUScUniversity of Malaya Research Grant  aFP016-2014AcMinistry of Higher Education Fundamental Research Grant 3aalgorithms 3adeveloping countries 3afuzzy logic 3agases 3ahumid zones 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3arain 3asurface water 3awaste management 3awastes 3aMalaysia1 aOthman, Faridah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4952-36761 aYounes, Mohammad K.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Oct., v. 190, no. 10 p.597-597dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6966-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245011000205300001600315506007600331520087100407592002801278506003701306650002201343650003501365650002201400650001101422650001401433650001801447650002301465651001901488653002401507653002901531653001801560700002101578700002601599700002401625773017001649856007901819852000901898655001201907IND60173662720221207100633.0150603e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017366272DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12079651102doi7 aPMC35382162pmcid7 a232482862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStadler, Tanja10aBirth–death skyline plot reveals temporal changes of epidemic spread in HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)  ap. 228-233.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhylogenetic trees can be used to infer the processes that generated them.

Our method allows these parameters to vary through time in a piecewise fashion and is implemented within the B EAST 2 software framework. The method is a powerful alternative to the existing coalescent skyline plot, providing insight into the differing roles of incidence and prevalence in an epidemic. We apply this method to data from the United Kingdom HIV-1 epidemic and Egyptian hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic. The analysis reveals temporal changes of the effective reproductive number that highlight the effect of past public health interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis C virus 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3acomputer software 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3atemporal variation 3aUnited Kingdom 0abirth–death prior 0aepidemiological dynamics 0aphylodynamics1 aKühnert, Denise1 aBonhoeffer, Sebastian1 aDrummond, Alexei J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Jan. 2, v. 110, no. 1 p.228-233dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12079651103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009000169300001600259520094700275592002801222650001501250650002001265650002801285650002001313650002001333650001101353651000901364700002201373700001901395773012701414856004801541852000901589655001201598IND50064988120221118004207.0130414e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006498812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-012-0617-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Huai-Hsien10aGeometric harnessing of precipitation records: reexamining four storms from Iowa City  ap. 955-968.  aComplex geometries often present in hydrologic data sets such as precipitation records have been difficult to model in their totality using classical stochastic methods. In recent years, we have developed extensions of a deterministic procedure, the fractal-multifractal (FM) method, whose patterns share fine details and textures of individual data sets in addition to the usual key statistical properties. This work discusses our latest efforts at encoding four geometrically distinct storms gathered in Iowa City with parameters found running a modified particle swarm optimization procedure. The results reaffirm the capabilities of the FM method as all storms are closely fitted within measurement errors. All sets may be encoded with a compression ratio exceeding 350:1, have a maximum error in cumulative distribution less than 2.5 %, and closely preserve the autocorrelation, power spectrum, and multifractal spectrum of the records.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautocorrelation 3acumulative distribution 3adata collection 3ahydrologic data 3astorms 3aIowa1 aPuente, Carlos E.1 aCortis, Andrea0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2013 May, v. 27, no. 4 p.955-968dSpringer-Verlagx1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-012-0617-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010800209300001600317520179000333592002802123650002602151650002302177650001302200650002802213650001502241650001402256650001502270650001702285650001302302650001302315650002502328650001802353650001702371650001302388653001502401653002402416653002702440700001902467700002002486700002102506700002402527700001902551700002202570700002202592710005702614773034802671856008503019852000903104655001203113IND60671738820221118001543.0200210e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067173882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2019.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerdoia, Monica1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6506-839710aHomocysteine levels and platelet reactivity in coronary artery disease patients treated with ticagrelor  ap. 292-299.  aRecurrent atherothrombotic events have been reported in certain higher risk subsets of patients even with ticagrelor, a potent first-line antiplatelet agent for the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Hyperhomocysteinemia is a known determinant of platelet function abnormalities. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of homocysteine (Hcy) levels on platelet reactivity in patients receiving Ticagrelor.Patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization and on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA + Ticagrelor (90mg/twice a day) were scheduled for platelet function assessment 30–90 days post-discharge. Aggregation tests were performed by Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA). Suboptimal platelet inhibition HRPR-high residual platelet reactivity was defined if above the lower limit of normality (417 AU*min).We included 432 patients, divided according to Hcy tertiles. Higher Hcy levels were associated with age, renal failure, creatinine levels and use diuretics (p < 0.001).Patients with higher Hcy levels displayed a higher platelet reactivity at COL test (p = 0.002), and ADP test (p = 0.04), with a linear relationship between Hcy and platelet aggregation after stimulation with collagen (r = 0.202, p < 0.001), thrombin receptor peptide (r = 0.104, p = 0.05) and ADP (r = 0.145, p = 0.006).However, Hcy levels did not significantly affect the rate of HRPR with Ticagrelor (9.9% vs 13.7% vs 10.7%, p = 0.89; adjusted OR [95% CI] = [0.616–1.51], p = 0.99).Among patients with ACS, despite the elevated platelet reactivity associated to hyperhomocysteinemia, DAPT with ticagrelor could overcome such phenomenon, achieving an adequate platelet inhibition in the majority of the patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aat-risk population 3acollagen 3acoronary artery disease 3acreatinine 3adiuretics 3aelectrodes 3ahomocysteine 3apatients 3apeptides 3aplatelet aggregation 3arenal failure 3atherapeutics 3athrombin 0aTicagrelor 0aPlatelet reactivity 0aImpedance aggregometry1 aRolla, Roberta1 aNegro, Federica1 aTonon, Francesco1 aPergolini, Patrizia1 aNardin, Matteo1 aMarcolongo, Marco1 aDe Luca, Giuseppe2 athe Novara Atherosclerosis Study Group (NAS)eauthor0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 30, no. 2 p.292-299dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2019.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245018600153300002000339520076300359592002801122650001401150650001101164650001401175650001401189650002301203650001801226650001301244700001901257700002001276700001801296700002201314700002201336700001601358700001501374773012401389856007401513852000901587655001201596IND60642213720221122202754.0190506e20171031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064221372DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10541j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ning10aGraphene-enhanced platinum-catalysed hydrosilylation of amides and chalcones: a sustainable strategy allocated with in situ heterogenization and multitask application of H₂PtCl₆  ap. 50729-50738.  aWe describe a new sustainable strategy for the comprehensive utilization of a platinum catalyst in different organic transformations, in which an organosilicon/graphene-supported platinum catalyst prepared from a simple hydrosilylation-type reduction could be further used in the 1,4-hydrosilylation of chalcones.

A GIS-based approach was used to estimate and map ecological and social factors illustrating recreation supply and demand in the Basque Country (northern Spain). The proposed methodology for recreation supply was based on recreation potential and accessibility, and the social demand was determined using a convenience sample of 629 persons that reported preferences for recreation activities using photo-questionnaires. Results showed that 23% of the viewsheds showed a high demand and higher recreation potential than accessibility, whereas only 3% showed a high demand and higher accessibility than potential. Approximately 74% of the territory showed a medium-low demand. We concluded that people׳s assessments on the basis of their aesthetic preferences may serve as a reasonable proxy for mapping recreation demand. The proposed visual method is fast, efficient and may be easily replicable in other regions. The proposed framework can be used as an input to support landscape management, to identify areas most demanded by society and to quantify spatially recreation supply and demand for supporting political strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aecosystem services 3ageographic information systems 3alandscape management 3apeople 3apolitics 3arecreation 3asocial factors 3asociety 3asupply balance 3aSpain 0aCultural ecosystem services 0aGIS 0aLandscape management 0aAesthetic preferences 0aSpatially explicit indicator.1 aCasado-Arzuaga, Izaskun1 aOnaindia, Miren1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1040-01310 tEcosystem services.g2015 June, v. 13 p.108-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011300163520126400276592002801540650001501568650001501583650001401598650002501612650001801637650001101655650000901666650001401675653001401689653001801703653001101721653001501732653001201747700001701759700001801776700001401794700001301808700005301821700002001874700001301894773012201907856008102029852000902110655001202119IND60729976220221120171316.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072997622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qinglan10aComparison of Cd(II) adsorption properties onto cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin extracted from rice bran  aRice bran, an underutilized by-product obtained from outer rice layers, has received wide interest due to its abundance, eco-friendliness, and low cost. In this research, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as the main components of rice bran were fractionated, and their Cd(II) adsorption capacity, behavior and mechanism were further studied. The adsorption capacity of cellulose for Cd(II) was 5.79 mg/g within the equilibrium time of 10 min, which was 1.8 and 3.6 times those of hemicellulose and lignin, respectively. The Cd(II) adsorption onto cellulose exhibited monolayer surface behavior, whilst the heterogeneous adsorption behavior was observed for hemicellulose and lignin. These differences were related to the discrepancy of morphology and chemical composition in three polymers. The multi-hole sticks morphology of cellulose and porous blocky structure of hemicellulose were observed, while lignin showed compact and agglomerated blocky structure. Cellulose had numerous available adsorption sites including the oxygen-containing functional groups, which bonded with Cd(II) driven by chemical interaction. In conclusion, it highlights that cellulose from rice bran has the great potential of being applied as adsorbent for the Cd(II) removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3arice 3arice bran 0aCellulose 0aHemicellulose 0aLignin 0aAdsorption 0aCadmium1 aRen, Mingfei1 aZhang, Xinxia1 aLi, Cheng1 aLi, Ting1 aYang, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8062-57371 aChen, Zhengxing1 aWang, Li0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012200171300001600293520107000309592002801379650002501407650001501432650001201447650001301459650001301472650001101485650001901496700002101515700002601536773012001562856008201682852000901764655001201773IND60616934720221118144938.0181021e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061693472DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517503073011072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelu, Yogeshwar K.10aMeltblown Structures Formed by a Robotic and Meltblowing Integrated System: Impact of Process Parameters on Pore Size  ap. 971-979.  aOur earlier studies have evaluated the effect of meltblowing process parameters on fiber diameter and orientation distribution. This paper deals with parametric studies evaluating the effect of polymer throughput, attenuating air pressure, take-up speed of the web, fiber stream approach angle, and die-to-collector distance (DCD) on pore sizes and their distribution in meltblown nonwoven webs. Pore sizes and their cumulative frequency are determined by an automated perm porometer. Under the conditions explored, the average pore size of meltblown fabrics decreases significantly when the attenuating air pressure increases. Pore size decreases significantly when the take-up speed of the web increases. As expected, an increase in the polymer throughput increases the average pore size. Increasing the DCD initially decreases, then increases pore size. confirming the existence of different "zones" in the space between the die and collector. An increase in the fiber stream approach angle initially decreases, then significantly increases pore size in the web.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3aautomation 3afabrics 3apolymers 3aporosity 3arobots 3atextile fibers1 aGhosh, Tushar K.1 aSeyam, Abdelfattah M.0 tTextile research journal.g2003 Nov., v. 73, no. 11 p.971-979dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517503073011073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011100165300001800276520115100294592002801445650003301473650002601506650001801532650001301550650002001563650001401583700001801597700001701615700002201632773010601654856008101760852000901841655001201850IND60121206220221122031946.0150217e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012120622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-014-8460-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQadeer, M.

Sm₂Co₁₇particles were surface-treated with three different silanes: 3-glycidoxy(propyl)trimethoxysilane, 3-amino(propyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS), and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS). It was shown, for the composites with untreated particles, that the viscosity and storage modulus increased with increasing filler content (0–60 vol%) and decreasing filler particle size. In addition, the glass transition temperature increased significantly and the damping decreased with increasing filler content. Of the silanes, the MTMS, which yielded only a thin surface layer, had in general the least effect on the rheological properties of the composite. The composite containing the APTMS-coated filler showed the highest storage modulus. The results give new insights on how to prepare polymer-bonded magnets with optimal process conditions (rheology) and dynamic mechanical properties, by varying the amount of particles, their size, and surface treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3aparticle size 3arheology 3astorage modulus 3aviscosity1 aSavage, S.

How this modulation is associated with metabolic pathways related to the gut is largely unclear. This study aims to investigate differences in metabolites produced by the gut microbiota and their interactions with host metabolism in response to supplementation with two bran fibers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C57BL/6N mice are fed a western diet (WD) for 17 weeks. Two groups of mice received a diet enriched with 10% w/w of either oat or rye bran, with each bran containing 50% DF. Microbial metabolites are assessed by measuring cecal short‐chain fatty acids (SCFAs), ileal and fecal bile acids (BAs), and the expression of genes related to tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. Both brans lowered body weight gain and ameliorated WD‐induced impaired glucose responses, hepatic inflammation, liver enzymes, and gut integrity markers associated with SCFA production, altered BA metabolism, and TRP diversion from the serotonin synthesis pathway to microbial indole production. CONCLUSIONS: Both brans develop a favorable environment in the gut by altering the composition of microbes and modulating produced metabolites. Changes induced in the gut environment by a fiber‐enriched diet may explain the amelioration of metabolic disturbances related to WD.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe University of Hong Kong 3aWestern diets 3abile 3abody weight changes 3adietary fiber 3afood research 3aglucose 3aileum 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aoats 3arye 3arye bran 3aserotonin 3atryptophan1 aLee, Jetty Chung‐Yung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8175-70691 aPihlajamäki, Jussi1 aChan, Chi Bun1 aLeung, Kin Sum1 aSo, Stephanie Sik Yu1 aNordlund, Emilia1 aKolehmainen, Marjukka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3770-25381 aEl‐Nezami, Hani0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2021 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.e1900580-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019005803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009400172300001800266520133400284592002801618650001501646650001701661650003601678650002601714650002001740650002001760650001901780650001301799700002701812700002001839773009401859856008501953990002302038852000902061655001202070IND60098250920221118233224.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009825092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulma, Magdalena10aRaft coalescence and FcγRIIA activation upon sphingomyelin clustering induced by lysenin  ap. 1641-1647.  aActivation of immunoreceptor FcγRIIA by cross-linking with antibodies is accompanied by coalescence of sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich membrane rafts leading to the formation of signaling platforms of the receptor. In this report we examined whether clustering of the raft lipid sphingomyelin can reciprocally induce partition of FcγRIIA to rafts. To induce sphingomyelin clustering, cells were exposed to non-lytic concentrations of GST-lysenin which specifically recognizes sphingomyelin. The lysenin/sphingomyelin complexes formed microscale assemblies composed of GST-lysenin oligomers engaging sphingomyelin of rafts. Upon sphingomyelin clustering, non-cross-linked FcγRIIA associated with raft-derived detergent-resistant membrane fractions as revealed by density gradient centrifugation. Pretreatment of cells with GST-lysenin also increased the size of detergent-insoluble molecular complexes of activated FcγRIIA. Sphingomyelin clustering triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and its accompanying proteins, Cbl and NTAL, in the absence of receptor ligands and enhanced phosphorylation of these proteins in the ligand presence. These data indicate that clustering of plasma membrane sphingomyelin induces coalescence of rafts and triggers signaling events analogous to those caused by FcγRIIA activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acrosslinking 3adensity gradient centrifugation 3aimmunologic receptors 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3asphingomyelins 3atyrosine1 aKwiatkowska, Katarzyna1 aSobota, Andrzej0 tCellular signalling.g2012 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.1641-1647dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245009500182300001600277520185800293592002802151650001202179650002502191650001102216650001502227650001002242650002102252650001002273650001102283650001302294650001302307650001302320650001402333650002002347650000702367650001502374650001202389650001002401650001202411650001802423650001002441650002502451650001502476650001402491650001502505650002102520650001902541650000902560651001402569700001702583700002502600700002202625773010202647856009002749852000902839655001202848IND60439616820221120133904.0151024e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961682DNAL7 a10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029983.53568.d22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Ernesto J.10aPhysical and chemical features of a tropical hypertrophic reservoir permanently stratified  ap. 301-310.  aPhysical and chemical parameters of Pao-Cachinche reservoir (Venezuela) were measured in four stations (S1-S4) during an eighteen months period from September 1997 to February 1999. The tributaries of this reservoir introduce high amounts of nutrients from domestic wastewaters and from poultry and pig farms located in the basin. Thermal stratification was well established throughout the study period. Mountainous topography protects the water surface from mechanical action of wind, preventing water mixing. Hypoxic/anoxic conditions prevailed from 6–7 m depth down to the bottom in the limnetic stations. A strong smell of H₂S was detected below the 10 m level. The low water transparency (max. 1.5 m) may be mainly attributed to a high biogenic turbidity. Water salinity was low, as the maximum conductivity measured (260 μS cm⁻¹) suggests. The water was alkaline in the upper layers during the day time (pH >8.0), due to the high phytoplanktonic productivity, whereas in deeper layers, where decomposition processes predominate, pH was acidic (close to 6.0). Orthophosphate concentrations were high, reaching maximal concentrations in the deeper part of the reservoir (greater than 800 μg l⁻¹). Total phosphorus exceeded 1000 μg l⁻¹ in the hypolimnion during the dry season. Ammonia was the dominant inorganic nitrogen species, and its values were greater than 4000 μg l⁻¹ in the hypolimnetic layer during the dry season. Nitrates and nitrites were present in relatively low concentrations, except for the Paito stream entrance, where nitrate concentrations remained above 260 μg l⁻¹. Pao–Cachinche reservoir can be considered hypertrophic, according to Salas & Martinó’s criteria for tropical warm lakes, and could be classified as meromictic and warm monomictic, according to Lewis tropical lake types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanaerobic conditions 3abasins 3adry season 3afarms 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alakes 3amixing 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apoultry 3asmell 3astreams 3asurface water 3aswine 3atemperature profiles 3atopography 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awater reservoirs 3awater salinity 3awind 3aVenezuela1 aOrtaz, Mario1 aPeñaherrera, Carlos1 ade Infante, Aída0 tHydrobiologia.g2004 July, v. 522, no. 1-3 p.301-310dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029983.53568.d23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009200168300001600260520077500276592002801051650001601079650002601095650002101121650001201142650001301154650002201167651001201189653001901201653001301220653001101233653001001244653001501254653001001269653002501279653001701304700002301321700002501344700002301369700002201392700001801414773012401432856008401556852000901640655001201649IND60790408120221116160537.0220824e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079040812DNAL7 a10.1640/0002-8444-112.3.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanker, Tom A.10aEthnobotany and Vernacular Names of the Lycophytes and Ferns of Tafea Province, Vanuatu  ap. 143-177.  aWe conducted extensive fieldwork in the Tafea Province of Vanuatu from 2014 to 2021 as part of a long-term floristic study of plants and fungi as well as analyses of changes in forest structure and plant diversity in response to the category 5 cyclone Pam.

Technologies such as microfluidics have sought to expand the throughput of these methods, although assimilation with advanced imaging strategies has been limited. Here, we describe the pairing of high resolution time-lapse imaging with microfluidic multiplexing for the analysis of cellular dynamics, utilizing a design selected for facile fabrication and operation, and integration with microscopy instrumentation. This modular, medium-throughput platform enables the long-term imaging of living cells at high numerical aperture (via oil immersion) by using a conserved 96-well, ∼6 × 5 mm² imaging area with a variable input/output channel design chosen for the number of cell types and microenvironments under investigation. In the validation of this system, we examined fundamental features of cell cycle progression, including mitotic kinetics and spindle orientation dynamics, through the high-resolution parallel analysis of model cell lines subjected to anti-mitotic agents. We additionally explored the self-renewal kinetics of mouse embryonic stem cells, and demonstrate the ability to dynamically assess and manipulate stem cell proliferation, detect rare cell events, and measure extended time-scale correlations. We achieved an experimental throughput of >900 cells/experiment, each observed at >40× magnification for up to 120 h. Overall, these studies illustrate the capacity to probe cellular functions and yield dynamic information in time and space through the integration of a simple, modular, microfluidics-based imaging platform.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantimitotic agents 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3aembryonic stem cells 3aimage analysis 3ainstrumentation 3amice 3amicrofluidic technology 3amicroscopy 3amitosis 3amodels 3aoils 3aphenotype1 aUnderhill, Gregory H.1 aResnikoff, Joshua1 aMendelson, Avital1 aBhatia, Sangeeta N.1 aShah, Jagesh V.0 tIntegrative biology.g2010 June 8, v. 2, no. 5-6 p.278-287dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b923699f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04565naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245018300167520262500350592002802975650001803003650002003021650001503041650001903056650001503075650001303090650002503103650001603128650001503144650001503159650002003174650002003194650000903214650002303223650001903246650002003265650001903285650001803304650001803322650003003340650001503370650002003385650003003405650001403435650002003449650002503469650001603494653002503510653002103535653002303556653003203579653002603611700001103637700002003648700001503668700001403683700002003697773009903717856009003816852000903906655001203915IND60743632820221117235639.0210911e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074363282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Ze10aCarbonate alkalinity and dietary protein levels affected growth performance, intestinal immune responses and intestinal microflora in Songpu mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio Songpu)  aAn eight week 3 × 2 two-factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the interaction between carbonate alkalinity levels at 0 and 15 mmol/L, and dietary protein levels at 310, 340 and 370 g/kg on the growth rate, digestive ability and the intestinal immunity, physical barrier function and microflora of Songpu mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio songpu). Fish at an initial average weight of 17.86 ± 0.19 g were randomly allotted to 18 aquariums each with 30 fish. Results revealed that weight gain rate (WGR) significantly decreased as carbonate alkalinity levels increased (p < 0.05), whereas the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of fish significantly increased (p < 0.05). Amylase activity in the intestine significantly decreased with increasing carbonate alkalinity levels (p < 0.05). A carbonate alkalinity of 15 mmol/L significantly reduced the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) activities, elevated the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in the intestine and hepatopancreas and decreased the contents of Complement 3 (C3), Complement (C4) and Ig M (p < 0.05). The relative expressions of occludin, claudin3, claudin7, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the intestine were significantly down-regulated with increasing carbonate alkalinity levels (p < 0.05), whereas the relative expressions of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in the intestine were significantly up-regulated (p < 0.05). The Proteobacteria abundance significantly increased with increasing carbonate alkalinity level (p < 0.05). The WGR significantly decreased as dietary protein levels increased (p < 0.05). The MDA contents in intestine and hepatopancreas also showed a significant rise with increasing dietary protein levels (p < 0.05). Increments in dietary protein levels significantly reduced the C3 and C4 contents of fish intestine (p < 0.05). Fish in the 370 g/kg diet protein level group showed a significantly lower relative expression of occludin and TNF-α (p < 0.05). There was an effect on the C3 content, the relative expression of occludin, the abundance of Firmicutes and Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio between carbonate alkalinity and dietary proteins over time (p < 0.05).In summary, under the long-term carbonate alkalinity stress of 15 mmol/L, dietary protein level for Songpu mirror carp should be controlled below 310 g/kg, which could effectively weaken the oxidative damage produced by carbonate alkalinity stress and further strengthen the growth and intestinal immune response of fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aCyprinus carpio 3aFirmicutes 3aProteobacteria 3aalkalinity 3aamylases 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture 3acarbonates 3acomplement 3adietary protein 3afeed conversion 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ahepatopancreas 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amalondialdehyde 3amyosin light chain kinase 3aoccludins 3aprotein content 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain 0aCarbonate alkalinity 0aDietary proteins 0aSongpu mirror carp 0aIntestinal immune responses 0aIntestinal microflora1 aWu, Di1 aZhang, Yuanyuan1 aLi, Jinnan1 aXu, Qiyou1 aWang, Liansheng0 tAquaculture.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 545 p.737135-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245022800171300001800399520152100417592002801938650001701966650001501983650002301998650002802021650001202049650001002061650003502071650004302106650001102149650001602160650000902176650003702185650001902222650001402241650002002255650002402275650002602299700002102325700002202346700001702368700001602385773009402401856008502495990002302580852000902603655001202612IND60098251020221118233300.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009825102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Young-June10aMacrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 stimulates proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by up-regulating cyclins D1 and E through the PI3K/Akt-, ERK-, and JNK-dependent AP-1 and E2F activation signaling pathways  ap. 1485-1495.  aMacrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) is highly associated with malignant human cancers and has been suggested to be involved in tumor angiogenesis. In the present study, we examined the effect of MIC-1 on endothelial cell proliferation to confirm the angiogenesis-promoting role of MIC-1. MIC-1 treatment accelerated progression of the G₁ stage in the cell cycle of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), leading to an increased cell proliferation rate. MIC-1 augmented the levels of cyclins D1 and E without altering the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, thereby increasing protein kinase activity of CDKs and subsequent phosphorylation of the Rb protein followed by nuclear translocation of E2F. MIC-1-induced expression of cyclins D1 and E was mediated by AP-1 and E2F-1 transcription factors, and among the AP-1 members, c-Jun and JunD appeared to participate in MIC-1-dependent transcription of the cyclin D1 gene. Additionally, the PI3K/Akt, JNK, and ERK pathways were found to mediate MIC-1-induced cyclin D1 expression in HUVECs. Importantly, lung endothelial cells isolated from MIC-1 transgenic mouse displayed a higher proliferation rate and cyclin D1 and E levels relative to their wild-type counterparts. These results suggest that MIC-1 secreted from cancer cells stimulates endothelial cell proliferation by enhancing AP-1- and E2F-dependent expression of G₁ cyclins via PI3K/Akt, JNK, and ERK signaling pathways, potentially leading to enhanced tumor angiogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors1 aLee, Jeong-Hyung1 aKim, Young-Myeong1 aOh, Goo Taeg1 aLee, Hansoo0 tCellular signalling.g2012 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.1485-1495dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002100171245015700192300001600349520176600365592002802131650001902159650001002178650001802188650001002206650002402216650002202240650001702262650001802279650003602297650001402333650001502347650002402362650001602386650001502402650001702417650001502434650001702449650000902466650001502475650003102490650001202521650005702533650003002590650003402620650005802654650002902712650002702741650000902768650002502777650002702802650002902829650000902858650002102867650002102888700001702909700001802926773008502944856008603029990002303115852000903138655001203147IND60091796520221118052735.0141103e20111012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009179652DNAL7 a219073292pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakemori, Kumiko10aPossible role of nitric oxide generated by leukocytes in the pathogenesis of hypertensive cerebral edema in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats  ap. 137-145.  aWe investigated the mechanisms responsible for cerebral edema in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP), including leukocyte activation and nitric oxide (NO) generation, both in vivo and in vitro. We also investigated the effects of angiotensin II (AngII) on leukocyte function in relation to NO production. Leukocyte–endothelial cell adhesion in brain microvessels was investigated by electron tomography using ultra-high voltage electron microscopy. Electron tomography clearly showed that leukocytes had well-developed intracellular organelles and abundant microvilli that were tangled with the endothelial cells in brain microvessels. Under confocal microscopic examination, diaminofluorescein-2 (a NO indicator)-positive cells were closely localized to anti-granulocyte-positive cells. The fluorescence intensity was much stronger in SHRSP than in age-matched Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rats, as a normotensive control. Mac-1 (leukocyte integrin, CD11b/CD18), angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression was higher (or tended to be higher) in SHRSP leukocytes than in WKY leukocytes. The plasma NO metabolite content was also higher in SHRSP than in WKY rats. All of these factors were upregulated by AngII stimulation. Furthermore, NO release from leukocytes was enhanced by AngII or lipopolysaccharide through NF-κB activation, but was suppressed by an AT1 receptor blocker or s-methyl-isothiourea. The present study revealed that one of the causative factors for cerebral edema in SHRSP rats is the generation of NO radicals by iNOS activated via NF-κB in AngII-stimulated leukocytes. Thus, the pathogenesis of cerebral edema in SHRSP is likely to involve inflammatory processes mediated by AngII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiotensin II 3abrain 3acell adhesion 3aedema 3aelectron microscopy 3aendothelial cells 3afluorescence 3afree radicals 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aintegrins 3aleukocytes 3alipopolysaccharides 3ametabolites 3amicrovilli 3anitric oxide 3aorganelles 3apathogenesis 3arats 3atomography 2aAngiotensin IIxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBrain Edemaxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aCell Adhesionxphysiology 2aEndothelial Cellsxmetabolism 2aHypertensionxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aInflammationxmetabolism 2aLeukocytesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred SHR 2aRats, Inbred WKY1 aInoue, Takao1 aIto, Hiroyuki0 tBrain research.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 1417 p.137-145dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245008400201300002000285506007600305520077100381592002801152506003701180650001501217650001101232650001401243650001201257650001101269650001501280650001301295650001501308650001201323700001501335700001401350700001501364773014901379856008101528852000901609655001201618IND60569605620221207132249.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7703-02doi7 aPMC50993522pmcid7 a276584002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirc, U.10aEmissions of microplastic fibers from microfiber fleece during domestic washing  ap. 22206-22211.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroplastics are found in marine and freshwater environments; however, their specific sources are not yet well understood. Understanding sources will be of key importance in efforts to reduce emissions into the environment. We examined the emissions of microfibers from domestic washing of a new microfiber polyester fleece textile. Analyzing released fibers collected with a 200 μm filter during 10 mild, successive washing cycles showed that emission initially decreased and then stabilized at approx. 0.0012 wt%. This value is our estimation for the long-term release of fibers during each washing. Use of detergent and softener did not significantly influence emission. Release of fibers during tumble drying was approx. 3.5 times higher than during washing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adetergents 3adrying 3aemissions 3afabrics 3afleece 3afreshwater 3aplastics 3apolyesters 3awashing1 aVidmar, M.1 aMozer, A.1 aKržan, A.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.22206-22211dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7703-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002500190245012300215300001600338520137900354592002801733653001101761653001201772653000801784653000901792653000701801653000801808653000801816653000801824653001001832653000901842653000801851653002101859653001601880653002401896653001801920653001001938653003501948700002601983700001702009700002302026700002002049700002102069700002602090700002002116773007802136856008302214852000902297655001202306IND60555022420221119015655.0161026e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055502242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.12.0052doi7 aPMC43098452pmcid7 a255748482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCinq-Frais, Christel10aAnnexin II-dependent actin remodelling evoked by hydrogen peroxide requires the metalloproteinase/sphingolipid pathway  ap. 169-179.  aActin remodeling is a dynamic process associated with cell shape modification occurring during cell cycle and proliferation. Oxidative stress plays a role in actin reorganization via various systems including p38MAPK. Beside, the mitogenic response evoked by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMC) involves the metalloproteinase (MMPs)/sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) signaling pathway. The aim of this work was to investigate whether this system plays a role in actin remodeling induced by H2O2.Low H2O2 dose (5µM) rapidly triggered a signaling cascade leading to nSMase2 activation, src and annexin 2 (AnxA2) phosphorylation, and actin remodeling, in fibroblasts and SMC. These events were blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of MMPs (Ro28-2653) and p38MAPK (SB203580), and were lacking in MMP2−/− and in nSMase2-mutant (fro) fibroblasts. Likewise, H2O2 was unable to induce actin remodeling in fro and MMP2−/− fibroblasts or in cells pretreated with p38MAPK, or MMP inhibitors. Finally we show that nSMase2 activation by H2O2, depends on MMP2 and p38MAPK, and is required for the src-dependent phosphorylation of AnxA2, and actin remodeling.Taken together, these findings indicate for the first time that AnxA2 phosphorylation and actin remodeling evoked by oxidative stress depend on the sphingolipid pathway, via MMP2 and p38MAPK.  aPublisher supplied data 0anSMase 0anSMase2 0aSMC 0amFbl 0awt 0afro 0amef 0aMMP 0aAnxA2 0aH2O2 0aROS 0aOxidative stress 0aFibroblasts 0aSmooth muscle cells 0aSphingolipids 0aActin 0aVasculo-proliferative diseases1 aCoatrieux, Christelle1 aSavary, Aude1 aD’Angelo, Romina1 aBernis, Corinne1 aSalvayre, Robert1 aNègre-Salvayre, Anne1 aAugé, Nathalie0 tRedox Biology.g2015 Apr., v. 4 p.169-179dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008300202300001800285500001500303506007600318520175200394592002802146506003702174650001802211650002102229650001402250650001502264650002002279650001302299650002302312650003402335650001402369650001202383650001502395650001602410653001202426700001902438700001702457700002302474773017202497856008302669852000902752655001202761IND4486979720221207114535.0120502e20120207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448697972DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11152601092doi7 aPMC32775462pmcid7 a223083822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInaki, Mikiko10aEffective guidance of collective migration based on differences in cell states  ap. 2027-2032.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDirected cell migration is important for normal animal development and physiology. The process can also be subverted by tumor cells to invade other tissues and to metastasize. Some cells, such as leukocytes, migrate individually; other cells migrate together in groups or sheets, called collective cell migration. Guidance of individually migrating cells depends critically on subcellularly localized perception and transduction of signals. For collective cell migration, guidance could result from cells within a group achieving different signaling levels, with directionality then encoded in the collective rather than in individual cells. Here we subject this collective guidance hypothesis to direct tests, using migration of border cells during Drosophila oogenesis as our model system. These cells normally use two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), PDGF/VEGF-related receptor (PVR) and EGFR, to read guidance cues secreted by the oocyte. Elevated but delocalized RTK signaling in one cell of the cluster was achieved by overexpression of PVR in the absence of ligand or by overexpression of fusion receptors unable to detect Drosophila ligands; alternatively, Rac was photoactivated centrally within a single cell. In each case, one cell within the group was in a high signal state, whereas others were in low signal states. The high signal cell directed cluster movement effectively. We conclude that differences in cell signaling states are sufficient to direct collective migration and are likely a substantial contributor to normal guidance. Cell signaling states could manifest as differences in gene expression or metabolite levels and thus differ substantially from factors normally considered when analyzing eukaryotic cell guidance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell movement 3aeukaryotic cells 3aoogenesis 3aleukocytes 3agene expression 3atyrosine 3aanimal development 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3areceptors 3aoocytes 3aDrosophila 3ametabolites 0akinases1 aVishnu, Smitha1 aCliffe, Adam1 aRÃ¸rth, Pernille0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Feb. 7, v. 109, no. 6 p.2027-2032dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11152601093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245012900209300001100338520182300349592002802172650002602200650002502226650001502251650000902266650002402275650002102299650001902320650001302339650000902352650001502361650001402376650002402390650001502414650001302429650001102442651001902453700002402472773011602496856008202612852000902694655001202703IND60590030020221121130308.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059003002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-018-3301-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrothers, CeciliaJ.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6942-092510aSea urchins exposed to near-future elevated seawater temperature alter resource allocation under low-quality food conditions  ap. 43.  aThe sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus inhabits seagrass meadows in the northern Gulf of Mexico where seasonal high temperatures are already capable of inducing physiological stress. Climate change will increasingly expose individuals to longer periods of elevated temperature. Sea urchins (n = 12 per treatment) were chronically exposed for a period of 90 days to ambient early summer temperature (26 °C) and a near-future predicted summer temperature (30 °C). Feeding and absorption efficiencies were measured in sea urchins fed a diet of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum embedded in agar. Test diameter and height, and total wet weight were recorded for each individual every 30 days. Mean spine length and diameter were also recorded for each individual at days 0 and 90. During the first 60 days, there were no significant differences in feeding rate, absorption efficiency, or growth of individuals held in the ambient (26°) or elevated (30 °C) temperature treatment. However, after 90 days, sea urchins exposed to 30 °C exhibited reduced rates of feeding, lower levels of total organic content in the Aristotle’s lantern, and thinner spines than those held at ambient temperature. Accordingly, despite the ability of L. variegatus to feed efficiently and sustain growth at predicted near-future seawater temperature for 60 days, after 90 days, individuals had significantly reduced their allocation of resources to skeletal components (spines and lantern). These findings suggest that in the near-future, chronic exposure to elevated temperature may compromise feeding through inadequate maintenance of the lantern and increase vulnerability to crushing predators through a reduction in spine diameter. Both factors could alter the role of L. variegatus as a key player in seagrass ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLytechinus variegatus 3aThalassia testudinum 3aabsorption 3aagar 3aambient temperature 3achronic exposure 3aclimate change 3acrushing 3adiet 3aecosystems 3apredators 3aresource allocation 3aseagrasses 3aseawater 3asummer 3aGulf of Mexico1 aMcClintock, JamesB.0 tMarine biology.g2018 Mar., v. 165, no. 3 p.43-43dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3301-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011900160300001800279520194100297592002802238650002302266650001302289650001002302650001902312650002802331650000902359650001302368650001102381650002502392650001102417650001302428650001502441650002502456650002802481650001502509653001602524653001902540653004502559653004402604653001802648700001802666700001902684700001802703700002102721700001502742700001702757773012302774856008002897852000902977655001202986IND60563479320221119085331.0170223e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056347932DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b161302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Wansun10aHighly Reproducible Au-Decorated ZnO Nanorod Array on a Graphite Sensor for Classification of Human Aqueous Humors  ap. 5891-5899.  aGold-decorated, vertically grown ZnO nanorods (NRs) on a flexible graphite sheet (Au/ZnONRs/G) were developed for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based biosensing to identify trace amounts of human aqueous humors. This Au/ZnONRs/G SERS-functionalized sensor was fabricated via two steps: hydrothermal synthesis-induced growth of ZnO NRs on graphite sheets for nanostructure fabrication, followed by e-beam evaporator-induced gold metallization on ZnONRs/G for SERS functionalization. The thickness of the Au layer and the height of the ZnO NRs for enhancing SERS performance were adjusted to maximize Raman intensity, and the optimized Au/ZnONRs/G nanostructures were verified by the electric finite element computational models to maximize the electric fields. The proposed Au/ZnONRs/G SERS sensor showed an enhancement factor of 2.3 × 10⁶ via rhodamine 6G Raman probe and excellent reproducibility (relative standard deviation of <10%) via Raman mapping of a SERS active area with a square of 100 × 100 μm². To evaluate the actual bioapplicability of point-of-care-testing (POCT) analysis in clinics, SERS data acquisition was performed with an integration time of 1 s from a 1 μL analytic droplet of the sample. The performance of this Au/ZnONRs/G sensor was evaluated using human aqueous humors with cataract and two oxidative stress-induced eye diseases, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic macular edema. These three eye diseases could be identified without any labeling or modification using the Au/ZnONRs/G SERS sensor and the computational algorithm incorporating a support vector machine and multivariate statistical prediction. Therefore, these findings indicate that our label-free, highly reproducible and flexible Au/ZnONRs/G SERS-functionalized sensor supported by a multivariate statistics-derived bioclassification method has great potential in POCT applications for identifying eye diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acataract 3aedema 3aelectric field 3afinite element analysis 3agold 3agraphene 3ahumans 3amacular degeneration 3amodels 3ananorods 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3asupport vector machines 3azinc oxide 0aZnO nanorod 0agraphite sheet 0asurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 0afinite element method (FEM) computation 0aaqueous humor1 aLee, Soo Hyun1 aKim, Sang-hun,1 aLee, Jae-Chul1 aMoon, Sang Woong1 aYu, Jae Su1 aChoi, Samjin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Feb. 22, v. 9, no. 7 p.5891-5899dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b161303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245019200160300001800352520141100370592002801781650001701809650001601826650001301842650002801855650001501883650002201898650001501920650001401935653002201949653001401971653001501985653003202000653002202032653002002054700001902074700001602093700001802109700001802127700001602145773012402161856008002285852000902365655001202374IND60528886020221121144137.0160717e20160413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b113002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhipeng10aConstruction of Hierarchical α-MnO2 Nanowires@Ultrathin δ-MnO2 Nanosheets Core–Shell Nanostructure with Excellent Cycling Stability for High-Power Asymmetric Supercapacitor Electrodes  ap. 9050-9058.  aPoor electrical conductivity and mechanical instability are two major obstacles to realizing high performance of MnO₂ as pseudocapacitor material. The construction of unique hierarchical core–shell nanostructures, therefore, plays an important role in the efficient enhancement of the rate capacity and the stability of this material. We herein report the fabrication of a hierarchical α-MnO₂ nanowires@ultrathin δ-MnO₂ nanosheets core–shell nanostructure by adopting a facile and practical solution-phase technique. The novel hierarchical nanostructures are composed of ultrathin δ-MnO₂ nanosheets with a few atomic layers growing well on the surface of the ultralong α-MnO₂ nanowires. The first specific capacitance of hierarchical core–shell nanostructure reached 153.8 F g–¹ at the discharge current density of as high as 20 A g–¹, and the cycling stability is retained at 98.1% after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles, higher than those in the literature. The excellent rate capacity and stability of the hierarchical core–shell nanostructures can be attributed to the structural features of the two MnO₂ crystals, in which a 1D α-MnO₂ nanowire core provides a stable structural backbone and the ultrathin 2D δ-MnO₂ nanosheet shell creates more reactive active sites. The synergistic effects of different dimensions also contribute to the superior rate capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acapacitance 3acrystals 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3amanganese dioxide 3ananosheets 3ananowires 0amanganese dioxide 0ananowires 0ananosheets 0acore−shell nanostructures 0acycling stability 0asupercapacitors1 aShao, Guangjie1 aFan, Yuqian1 aWang, Guiling1 aSong, Jianjun1 aShen, Dejiu0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Apr. 13, v. 8, no. 14 p.9050-9058dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b113003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245009100170300001600261520144300277592002801720650001301748650001301761650001001774650001201784650000901796650001001805650001801815650001401833650001401847650001301861650002101874650002001895650000701915650001501922650001801937650001401955650001401969650001101983650001401994650001102008650002002019650001502039650001702054650001802071650001402089650000902103700002102112773010202133856009002235852000902325655001202334IND60439617020221120133835.0151024e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961702DNAL7 a10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029987.64557.362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, P.F.10aMacrophyte induced microchemical changes in the water column of a northern Boreal Lake  ap. 207-220.  aWater quality was compared between open water and vegetated regions of the littoral zone of a Boreal lake. Within region variation occurred in vegetated areas and was species dependent. In the water lily versus the open water stations, conductivity and concentrations of B, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, S and Sr were elevated in the water column while N concentrations were lower. Wild rice areas were characterized by lower S and higher conductivity and Ca and Fe concentrations than open water areas. Variations in water quality in the vegetated regions occurred as a result of chemical exchange with the sediment in the proximity of the vegetation. Elemental concentrations in the sediment appeared to vary as a result of root aeration and nutrient uptake by the plants. Open water stations had elevated sediment levels of N, P and Al while elevated levels of Na were present in both the open water and wild rice plots. Water lily stations exhibited higher pH levels and higher concentrations of Fe, Mn and Ca than the open water plots. Plant tissue analysis indicated that between species elemental variation existed as well. Water lily tissue had higher concentrations of N, P, Mn, Zn, Ca, K and Mg than that of wild rice. It was postulated that aquatic macrophytes can influence the redox level of sediments and thereby dramatically alter the overlying water column forming microchemical environments in stagnant regions of the littoral zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aaluminum 3aboron 3acalcium 3airon 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3apotassium 3asediments 3asodium 3astrontium 3asulfur 3atissue analysis 3avegetation 3awater lilies 3awater quality 3awild rice 3azinc1 aMcNaughton, K.A.0 tHydrobiologia.g2004 July, v. 522, no. 1-3 p.207-220dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000029987.64557.363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245014000188300001600328520138200344592002801726650000801754650001201762650001001774650001301784650001201797650001301809650001701822650001301839650003501852650001501887650001701902650002801919650004801947650002501995650001002020650001102030650003802041650001302079650001102092650000902103650003602112650002802148650001602176700001602192700001502208700001302223700001402236700001502250700001702265773008502282856008602367990002302453852000902476655001202485IND60091796620221118052737.0141103e20111012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009179662DNAL7 a219172412pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Zhenghui10aLack of effect of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism on early onset schizophrenia in Chinese Han population  ap. 146-150.  aSchizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder with high heritability. Schizophrenic patients with early-age onset tend to have a greater genetic component and may be an attractive subpopulation for genetic studies. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is considered a candidate gene for schizophrenia. A single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) was reported to be associated with schizophrenia, although discrepancy remains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and schizophrenia using an early onset sample in the Chinese Han population. Our sample consisted of 353 schizophrenic patients with onset before age 18 and 394 healthy controls. All subjects were of an ethnically homogenous Han Chinese origin. No significant differences of genotype or allele distribution were identified between the patients and controls. However, the Met allele was significantly associated with an earlier age of onset in male schizophrenic patients (Kaplan–Meier log-rank test P=0.005), but not in females (P=0.289). The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has an important effect on the age of onset of schizophrenia in a gender-specific manner. This may represent a significant genetic clue for the etiology of schizophrenia and thus, further studies are required to uncover the exact role of BDNF in the development of schizophrenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aalleles 3abrain 3aetiology 3afemales 3agenotype 3aheritability 3apatients 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAdolescent 2aAge of Onset 2aAsian Peoplexgenetics. 2aBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factorxgenetics 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChild 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSchizophreniaxgenetics 2aSex Factors1 aZhang, Chen1 aWu, Zhiguo1 aHong, Wu1 aLi, Zezhi1 aFang, Yiru1 aYu, Shunying0 tBrain research.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 1417 p.146-150dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008900202300001800291500001900309520129700328592002801625650002001653650001801673650001101691650001101702650001101713650001601724650001701740700001701757700002501774700005701799773013701856856008001993852000902073655001202082IND60712066920221117224421.0201009e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071206692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c055072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOno, Junichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2189-354110aHydroxide Ion Carrier for Proton Pumps in Bacteriorhodopsin: Primary Proton Transfer  ap. 8524-8539.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a model protein for light-driven proton pumps, where the vectorial active proton transport results in light-energy conversion. To clarify the microscopic mechanism of primary proton transfer from retinal Schiff base (SB) to Asp85 in BR, herein, we performed quantum-mechanical metadynamics simulations with the isolated BR model (∼3750 atoms). The simulations showed a novel proton transfer mechanism, viz. the hydroxide ion mechanism, in which the deprotonation of specific internal water (Wat452) yields the protonation of Asp85 via Thr89, after which the resulting hydroxide ion accepts the remaining proton from retinal SB. Systematic investigations adopting four sequential snapshots obtained by the time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography revealed that proton transfer took 2–5.25 μs on the photocycle. The presence of Wat401, which is the main difference between snapshots at 2 and 5.25 μs, is found to be essential in assisting the primary proton transfer. Furthermore, the hydroxide ion mechanism was confirmed by the minimum energy path for the primary proton transfer in BR obtained by the nudged elastic band calculations with the embedded BR model (10,119 atoms), in which BR was embedded within lipid membranes in between water solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallography 3adeprotonation 3aenergy 3alipids 3amodels 3aprotonation 3aschiff bases1 aImai, Minori1 aNishimura, Yoshifumi1 aNakai, Hiromi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5646-29310 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Sept. 02, v. 124, no. 39 p.8524-8539dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c055073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245004300209300001600252520059900268592002800867653000800895653000900903653000700912653000800919653000900927653000900936653000900945653000800954653001000962653001000972653000800982653000800990653001500998653001401013653001001027653001301037653002101050700001301071700001201084700001601096773007801112856008301190852000901273655001201282IND60555022520221119015714.0161026e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055502252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.12.0062doi7 aPMC43098592pmcid7 a255457942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaofeng10aRedox regulated peroxisome homeostasis  ap. 104-108.  aPeroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles present in nearly all eukaryotic cells.

Maps that predict the potential spread of an invader based on known habitat preferences can be extremely valuable for assessing invasion risk and prioritizing management actions for invasion control or prevention. Most maps are developed by using environmental data on the species’ known distribution to map the potential niche of the species in a new location. However, this approach is complicated when a species spreads to an area where environmental conditions are much different than in other places it is known to exist. Didemnum vexillum was discovered in Southeast Alaska in 2010, marking the northernmost known range of this species. A self-organizing map (SOM) was used to assess potential habitat for D. vexillum in other parts of Southeast Alaska using summer and winter temperature and salinity as controlling factors. This research highlights the uncertainty of using the species’ current distribution to evaluate potential spread to an environment at the edge of a species’ environmental tolerances.

The spray deposition of four types of nozzles (SX110015, XR80015, IDK90015 and TR80015), two spray volume rates (45 and 90 L ha⁻¹) and with or without a commercial surfactant adjuvant were evaluated based on the spot spray mode. RESULTS: The air‐ assisted IDK90015 nozzle showed significantly higher deposition and penetration, and its large droplet size also reduced the risk of drift. Increasing the spray volume rate can increase the amount of droplets deposition. The adjuvant showed excellent potential to improve spray technology in Nanguo pear trees, with a mean deposition of 0.175–0.574 μL cm⁻² and penetration of 3.09–66.73%. The droplet size also increased significantly, with volume median diameter (DV₀.₅) of 469 μm. CONCLUSION: The nozzle type, spray volume rate and adjuvant should be well considered when using the spot spray in orchard. Compared with increasing spray volume rate, the use of air‐induction nozzles and surfactant‐based adjuvants can improve the spray deposition better. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019JH2/10200002cLiaoning Provincial Key R&D Program Project  aD18019cthe 111 Project  cTop Talents Program for One Case One Discussion of Shandong Province 3aadjuvants 3adroplet size 3aorchards 3apears 3apesticide application 3arisk 3aspot spraying 3aspray deposition 3aspray volume 3asurfactants1 aYao, Weixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7784-22041 aXu, Tongyu1 aMa, Hui1 aSun, Mujun1 aChen, Chunling1 aLan, Yubin0 tPest management science.g2022 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.3564-3575dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.69993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012700165300001800292520140900310592002801719650001601747650001201763650001801775650001201793650001701805650001201822650001801834650001801852650002601870650001301896650002601909650002101935650002101956650001801977650001101995650001202006650001002018651001102028700001802039700001902057700002102076773010302097856008102200852000902281655001202290IND60569605820221121130651.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960582DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293161100772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrlis, Mėri,14aThe influence of spruce on acidity and nutrient content in soils of Northern Taiga dwarf shrub–green moss spruce forests  ap. 1276-1287.  aPresently, among the works considering the influence of forest trees on soil properties, the idea that spruce (Picea abies) promotes the acidification of soils predominates. The aim of this work is to assess the effects of spruce trees of different ages and Kraft classes on the acidity and content of available nutrient compounds in the soils under boreal dwarf shrub–green moss spruce forests by the example of forest soils in the Kola Peninsula. The soils are typical iron-illuvial podzols (Albic Rustic Podzols (Arenic)). Three probable ways of developing soils under spruce forests with the moss–dwarf shrub ground cover are considered. The soils under windfall–soil complexes of flat mesodepressions present the initial status. The acidity of organic soil horizons from the initial stage of mesodepression overgrowth to the formation of adult trees changed nonlinearly: the soil acidity reached its maximum under the 30–40-year-old trees and decreased under the trees older than 100 years. The contents of nitrogen and available nutrients increased. The acidity of the mineral soil horizons under the trees at the ages of 110–135 and 190–220 years was comparable, but higher than that under the 30–40-year-old trees. The differences in the strength and trends of the trees’ effect on the soils are explained by the age of spruce trees and their belonging to different Kraft classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aPodzols 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aforest trees 3aforests 3amature plants 3amineral soils 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3aorganic horizons 3aorganic soils 3ashrubs 3asoil pH 3ataiga 3aRussia1 aLukina, N.

An experimental study using microwave oxidation process to treat leachate was designed and optimized using Taguchi L₁₆ orthogonal array (OA) design, coupled with the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio method and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, and compared the relationships between them. Three experimental factors, microwave (MW) power settings, persulfate (PS) doses, and MW irradiation time (T), as well as three target parameters, total organic carbon (TOC), color, and UV₂₅₄, were studied. The optimal conditions were found to be: 550 W, 1 M, and 120 min for TOC removals of 80% and color removals of 96%; 775 W, 1 M, and 120 min for UV₂₅₄ removals of 55%. The ranking of significance of experimental factors was: MW > PS > T for TOC removals, PS > MW > T for color removals, and MW > PS > T for UV₂₅₄ removals. The quality loss function values were used to compare the quality loss situation among different experimental conditions in the Taguchi OA design. The predicted removals of target parameters under the optimal conditions by Taguchi method and ANOVA were similar to the actual results from the confirmation experimental runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaguchi method 3aanalysis of variance 3acolor 3airradiation 3alandfill leachates 3aorganic carbon 3aoxidation 3aTaiwan1 aLo, S.-L.1 aKuo, J.1 aChou, Y.-C.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2018 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.2075-2086dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-017-1567-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04069naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245015200207300001800359520222900377592002802606650001702634650001602651650002302667650002402690650002302714650002002737650001702757650001602774650001902790650003102809650002302840653002102863653002202884653002902906653002302935653001502958653002702973653000803000653000903008653001403017653000803031700002203039700002103061700005903082700001803141700001603159700005903175700002003234710004503254773011203299856008303411852000903494655001203503IND60739186620221120173552.0210729e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073918662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidley, Emma J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7922-571710aMeasured energy expenditure in mildly hypothermic critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury: A sub-study of a randomized controlled trial  ap. 3875-3882.  aProphylactic hypothermia, often used in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury, reduces energy expenditure and may affect energy delivered by nutrition therapy. The primary objective of this study was to measure energy expenditure in hypothermic patients over the first 3 days after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Secondary objectives included comparison of measured energy expenditure and nutrition delivery to day 7.A prospective sub-study of a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe TBI, investigating prophylactic hypothermia (33–35 °C) as a neuroprotective therapy. In two centers, indirect calorimetry was initiated within 24 h of randomization and repeated up to twice daily to day 7. Data are presented as n (%), mean (standard deviation (SD)), median [interquartile range (IQR)], and mean difference (95% confidence interval (CI)).Forty patients were included (20 in each group), with 17 patients in the hypothermic and 16 in the normothermic group having an indirect calorimetry measurement in the first 3 days. Over the first 3 days, the mean temperature in the hypothermic and normothermic groups was 33.5 (0.6) ºC (n = 17) and 37 (0.5) ºC (n = 16), p < 0.0001, and the mean measured energy expenditure, was 21 (5) and 27 (4) kcal/kg, p = 0.002, representing a mean difference of 5 (95% CI: 2–8) kcal/kg. Energy expenditure was 20% (95% CI: 9.5–29%) less in hypothermia patients compared to normothermia patients. Hypothermia patients also had higher gastric residual volumes across the 7 day study period (438 (237) mls vs 184 (103) mls, p < 0.0001) and higher use of metoclopramide and erythromycin as prokinetics. Despite enteral nutrition intolerance, hypothermia patients received 93% of measured energy expenditure over 7 days.In TBI patients, energy expenditure was 20% less when receiving prophylactic hypothermia compared to normothermia. Greater gastric residual volumes, use of prokinetics and energy delivery that approximated measured energy expenditure was also observed in hypothermia patients.POLAR-RCT: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00987688; Anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12609000764235.

This study assessed whether ocean acidification alters the predatory whelk Tenguella marginalba, their prey, the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and their interactions. Oysters and whelks were exposed separately to ambient or elevated pCO₂ for 6 weeks, after which, a reciprocal cross design was used to expose oysters and whelks together to ambient and elevated pCO₂. Both T. marginalba and C. gigas were measured for growth, shell morphology, shell compression strength and metabolic rate. The rate at which whelks consumed oysters was also measured. We found C. gigas had weaker shells and greater SMR at elevated pCO₂, but lowered its SMR when held at ambient pCO₂ with T. marginalba. T. marginalba had a greater SMR and consumed more C. gigas when both the predator and prey were held at elevated pCO₂. We also tested whether C. gigas responses to predator chemical cues were altered by ocean acidification. C. gigas lowered its metabolic rate in response to predator cues at ambient, but not elevated pCO₂. We conclude that elevated pCO₂ may increase the energy requirements of predators, as they attempt to maintain homoeostasis. Furthermore, elevated pCO₂ may also alter the morphology and increase the visibility of prey. Whether the consequence of this will be a sustained increase in consumption by the predator is less certain as molluscs acclimate and the dynamics of other organisms in marine ecosystems are also altered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abehavior change 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acompression strength 3aenergy requirements 3amarine ecosystems 3ametabolism 3aocean acidification 3aoceans 3aoysters 3apredators 3areciprocal crosses1 aParker, LauraM.1 aO’Connor, WayneA.1 aScanes, Elliot1 aRoss, PaulineM.0 tMarine biology.g2018 Mar., v. 165, no. 3 p.46-46dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-018-3302-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245013300177300001600310520150500326592002801831650003001859650001701889650001101906650001301917653002101930653002201951653001801973653001901991653003602010653003502046700001802081700002102099700002002120700003102140700002302171700002702194773007702221856008902298852000902387655001202396IND60545379220221119173331.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054537922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstoppey, Nicolas10aLow density polyethylene (LDPE) passive samplers for the investigation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) point sources in rivers  ap. 268-276.  aThis study aims to provide a passive sampling approach which can be routinely used to investigate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) sources in rivers. The approach consists of deploying low density polyethylene (LDPE) strips downstream and upstream of potential PCB sources as well as in their water discharges. Concentrations of indicator PCBs (iPCBs) absorbed in samplers (Cs) from upstream and downstream sites are compared with each other to reveal increases of PCB levels. Cs measured in water discharges are used to determine if released amounts of PCBs are compatible with increases revealed in the river. As water velocity can greatly vary along a river stretch and influences the uptake at each site in a different way, differences in velocity have to be taken into account to correctly interpret Cs. LDPE strips were exposed to velocities between 1.6 and 37cms−1 using a channel system built in the field. Relationships between velocity and Cs were established for each iPCB to determine the expected change in Cs due to velocity variations. For PCBs 28 and 52, this change does not exceed a factor 2 for velocity variations in the range from 1.6 to 100cms−1 (extrapolated data above 37cms−1). For PCBs 101, 138, 153 and 180, this change only exceeds a factor 2 in the case of large velocity variations. The approach was applied in the Swiss river Venoge to first conduct a primary investigation of potential PCB sources and then conduct thorough investigations of two suspected sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolyethylene 3arivers 3asamplers 0aPassive sampling 0aPollution sources 0aInvestigation 0aWater velocity 0aLow density polyethylene (LDPE) 0aPolychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)1 aOmlin, Julien1 aSchopfer, Adrien1 aEsseiva, Pierre1 aVermeirssen, Etiënne L.M.1 aDelémont, Olivier1 aDe Alencastro, Luiz F.0 tChemosphere.g2015 Jan., v. 118 p.268-276dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013200167520130500299592002801604650001701632650002301649650000901672650001301681650000901694650001801703650001301721650001901734650003901753650002101792650002201813650003301835650001601868650001701884650001601901653002901917653002801946653002101974700001701995700001502012700001702027700002002044700001902064773010202083856008602185852000902271655001202280IND60686137220221119044614.0200517e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068613722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xingfei10aEffect of preheating-induced denaturation during protein production on the structure and gelling properties of soybean proteins  aTo explore the effect of preheating-induced denaturation during protein production on the structure and gelling properties of soybean protein isolates (SPI), protein neutralization solutions were preheated at various temperature for various periods and then spray-dried. The pre-denaturation degree (PDD) of SPI was quantitatively characterized by the change in the AB subunit using non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The onset denaturation time was 180 s, 40 s, and 10 s at preheating temperatures of 80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C. As PDD increased, the contents of free sulfhydryl group and the ordered secondary structure gradually decreased, accompanied by the unfolding of the tertiary structure. Gel hardness, G′ and G″ increased at high PDDs, where the heating time required for gel formation decreased. The highly pre-denatured proteins (e.g., SPI₈₆.₁₁%, and SPI₁₀₀%) formed gel network structures without heating. SEM images showed that the partially pre-denatured gels (SPI₂₂.₂₈% and SPI₈₆.₁₁%) were denser and had more uniform gel networks than the native protein (SPI₀) and the completely pre-denatured protein (SPI₁₀₀%). This work will provide guidelines for the control of heating conditions during SPI production process to improve gelling properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturation 3agelling properties 3agels 3ahardness 3aheat 3ahydrocolloids 3amoieties 3aneutralization 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein synthesis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoy protein 3aspray drying 3atemperature 0aSoybean protein isolates 0aPre-denaturation degree 0aProtein subunits1 aChen, Liyang1 aHua, Yufei1 aChen, Yeming1 aKong, Xiangzhen1 aZhang, Caimeng0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Aug., v. 105 p.105846-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1058463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245019600197300001800393506007600411520169800487592002802185506003702213650001702250650004002267650001502307650001302322650001102335650000902346650001002355650005702365650001102422650003702433650004902470650001102519650000902530650001602539650001602555651001302571651002802584700001502612700001902627700002202646700002602668700002102694700002202715700001602737700001902753700001902772700002302791700000702814773010502821856007702926852000903003655001203012IND4485267820221207113204.0120501e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448526782DNAL7 a217886232pmid7 aPMC31612682pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-20992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovan, Lindsay10aAchieved Levels of HbA1c and Likelihood of Hospital Admission in People With Type 1 Diabetes in the Scottish Population: A study from the Scottish Diabetes Research Network Epidemiology Group  ap. 1992-1997.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: People with type 1 diabetes have increased risk of hospital admission compared with those without diabetes. We hypothesized that HbA1c would be an important indicator of risk of hospital admission. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Scottish Care Information–Diabetes Collaboration, a dynamic national register of diagnosed cases of diabetes in Scotland, was linked to national data on admissions. We identified 24,750 people with type 1 diabetes during January 2005 to December 2007. We assessed the relationship between deciles of mean HbA1c and hospital admissions in people with type 1 diabetes adjusting for patient characteristics. RESULTS: There were 3,229 hospital admissions. Of the admissions, 8.1% of people had mean HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and 16.3% had HbA1c <7.5% (58 mmol/mol). The lowest odds of admission were associated with HbA1c 7.7–8.7% (61–72 mmol/mol). When compared with this decile, a J-shaped relationship existed between HbA1c and admission. The highest HbA1c decile (10.8–18.4%/95–178 mmol/mol) showed significantly higher odds ratio (95% CI) for any admission (2.80, 2.51–3.12); the lowest HbA1c decile (4.4–7.1%/25–54 mmol/mol) showed an increase in odds of admission of 1.29 (1.10–1.51). The highest HbA1c decile experienced significantly higher odds of diabetes-related (3.31, 2.94–3.72) and diabetes ketoacidosis admissions (10.18, 7.96–13.01). CONCLUSIONS: People with type 1 diabetes with highest and lowest mean HbA1c values were associated with increased odds of admission. People with high HbA1c (>10.8%/95 mmol/mol) were at particularly high risk. There is the need to develop effective interventions to reduce this risk.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepidemiology 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apeople 3arisk 2aAdult 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHospitalizationxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aYoung Adult 3aScotland 0aScotlandxepidemiology.1 aWu, Olivia1 aBriggs, Andrew1 aColhoun, Helen M.1 aFischbacher, Colin M.1 aLeese, Graham P.1 aMcKnight, John A.1 aPhilip, Sam1 aSattar, Naveed1 aWild, Sarah H.1 aLindsay, Robert S.1 a, 0 tDiabetes care.g2011 Sept., v. 34, no. 9 p.1992-1997dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-20993Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006000159300002000219520119200239592002801431650000801459650001701467650002201484650001801506650001501524700002201539700001801561700002001579773013401599856007501733852000901808655001201817IND60538629420221116222318.0160815e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053862942DNAL7 a10.1021/ja304904p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jungkweon10aFolding Dynamics of Cytochrome c Using Pulse Radiolysis  ap. 13430-13435.  aPulse radiolysis is a powerful method to realize real-time observation of various redox processes, which induces various structural and functional changes occurring in biological systems. However, its application has been mainly limited to studies of the redox reactions of rather smaller biological systems such as DNA because of an undesired reaction due to various free radicals generated by pulse radiolysis. For application of pulse radiolysis to generate plenty of redox reactions of biological systems, selective redox reactions induced by electron pulses have to be developed. In this study, we report that in the presence of the high concentration of the denaturant, guanidine HCl (GdHCl), the selective reduction of the oxidized cytochrome c (Cyt c) takes place in time scales of a few microseconds by the electron transfer from the guanidine radical that is formed by the fast reaction of eₐq– with GdHCl, consequently leading to folding kinetics of Cyt c. By providing insight into the folding dynamics of Cyt c, we show that the pulse radiolysis technique can be used to track the folding dynamics of various biomolecules in the presence of a denaturant including GdHCl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acytochrome c 3aelectron transfer 3afree radicals 3aguanidines1 aFujitsuka, Mamoru1 aTojo, Sachiko1 aMajima, Tetsuro0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 134, no. 32 p.13430-13435dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja304904p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100002000193245012500213506007600338506003100414520123000445592002801675596004701703506003701750650002601787650002701813650002901840650001001869650002401879650002001903650001801923650001901941650001801960650001801978650001901996650001202015650001602027650001202043650001102055653001802066653001802084653002102102653001902123653002002142653001702162653001702179700002502196700001502221700001702236700006102253773011102314856008602425852000902511655001202520IND60648452920221207125013.0190712e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064845292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1085232doi7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1085232chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongchao10aAntimicrobial action of octanoic acid against Escherichia coli O157:H7 during washing of baby spinach and grape tomatoes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWe investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of octanoic acid (OA) against Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated on the surface of baby spinach and grape tomatoes during simulated washing processes. 3 mM OA at 45 °C achieved >6 log CFU/g reduction from the surface of tomatoes within 2 min. However, washing baby spinach with 6 mM OA at 5 °C resulted in <1 log CFU/g reduction, highlighting the role of surface properties in inactivation efficacy. OA significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the risk of cross-contamination during washing of spinach as well as tomatoes. Also, total mold and yeast population on surface of spinach was significantly reduced immediately after OA wash and inhibited during following 14 days. Baby spinach and grape tomatoes washed with OA did not cause significant (p > 0.05) difference in color compared to the control and no residual OA was detected in most cases following rinsing of produce in water. OA at the concentrations above 2 mM and temperature higher than 25 °C induced severe membrane damage along with release of ATP and other intracellular constituents resulting in bacterial death. OA can be an attractive natural decontamination agent for washing fresh produce.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantimicrobial properties 3acolor 3across contamination 3adecontamination 3afresh produce 3agrape tomatoes 3amolds (fungi) 3aoctanoic acid 3arisk reduction 3aspinach 3atemperature 3awashing 3ayeasts 0aOctanoic acid 0aAntimicrobial 0aEscherichia coli 0aProduce safety 0aMembrane damage 0aGrape tomato 0aBaby spinach1 aDolan, Heather Leigh1 aDing, Qiao1 aWang, Siyuan1 aTikekar, Rohan V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7915-38480 tFood research international.g2019 Nov., v. 125 p.108523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1085233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013600161300001600297520247900313592002802792650002702820650001102847650001702858650002202875650001302897650004402910650001402954650001602968650001302984650000902997650001703006650002003023650001003043650001903053651001403072773011503086856007803201852000903279655001203288IND60613520720221121064050.0180913e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061352072DNAL7 a10.1065/jss2006.08.1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Zhihong,10aEffect of Overlying Windrowed Harvest Residues on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen in Hoop Pine Plantations of Subtropical Australia (6 pp)  ap. 243-248.  aBACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Harvest residues were formed into windrows to prevent nitrogen (N) losses through volatilisation and erosion that occurred following pile and burn operations in hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn.) plantations of subtropical Australia. We selected second rotation (2R) hoop pine sites where the windrows (10-15 m apart) had been formed 1, 2 and 3 years prior to sampling in order to examine soil carbon (C) and N in the areas beneath and between the windrows. Materials and Methods: We used conventional chemical methods, anaerobic incubation assay, 13C and 15N natural abundance analyses and, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results: Percent mineralisable N (PCMN) was the only parameter in the underneath windrow position at the Year 1 site that did not show a significant difference to the rest of the positions along the transect. However, positions adjacent to windrows did have significantly greater PCMN at the Year 1 site than other positions along the transect. PCMN, total N and total C were significantly greater underneath the windrows at the Year 3 site, whilst d13C was significantly more negative in the underneath windrow positions. Discussion: PCMN was the most sensitive biological indicator of the changes occurring in the soil due to decomposition of the windrows, with the beneath-windrow position having a significantly higher PCMN than the inter-windrow position (p<0.001) at the Year 3 site. Isotopic natural abundance for both 13C and 15N was able to detect the influx of labile materials from new residues. Solid-state 13C NMR was able to detect inputs of labile C from the windrows at the Year 1 site, whilst the increase in aromatic C at the Year 3 site was indicative of the more advanced stages of windrow decomposition. Conclusions: Decomposition of windrowed residues had a beneficial effect on soil N and C pools. However, the effect remained localised after 3 years, indicating that trees needed to be planted close to the windrows to gain any benefit from residue decomposition Recommendations and Perspectives: The use of windrows allows a clear planting area and provides a good barrier against soil erosion. However, trees can only gain access to the nutrients from the decomposing residues if they are planted close to the windrows. Limiting the width of the cleared areas to allow for only 2 planting rows will give the maximum benefit to the developing trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraucaria cunninghamii 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aindicator species 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrients 3aplantations 3aplanting 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3astable isotopes 3atrees 3avolatilization 3aAustralia0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2006 Oct., v. 6, no. 4 p.243-248dEcomedwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1065/jss2006.08.1803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245016500191300001800356520137700374592002801751650002801779650001401807650001201821650002501833650002301858650001401881650001201895650001901907650001501926650001201941650001301953650001601966650002901982650001102011650001102022650004602033650002402079650001702103650002402120650002402144650002002168650007502188650002502263700002902288700002102317700001602338700002202354700002102376700001902397773014302416856008202559852000902641655001202650IND4457316920221118070115.0200312e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445731692DNAL7 a214761402pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3218-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrussamee, Nadchanok10aGrowth and ethanol fermentation ability on hexose and pentose sugars and glucose effect under various conditions in thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus  ap. 1573-1586.  aEthanol fermentation ability of the thermotolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, which is able to utilize various sugars including glucose, mannose, galactose, xylose, and arabinose, was examined under shaking and static conditions at high temperatures. The yeast was found to produce ethanol from all of these sugars except for arabinose under a shaking condition but only from hexose sugars under a static condition. Growth and sugar utilization rate under a static condition were slower than those under a shaking condition, but maximum ethanol yield was slightly higher. Even at 40°C, a level of ethanol production similar to that at 30°C was observed except for galactose under a static condition. Glucose repression on utilization of other sugars was observed, and it was more evident at elevated temperatures. Consistent results were obtained by the addition of 2-deoxyglucose. The glucose effect was further examined at a transcription level, and it was found that KmGAL1 for galactokinase and KmXYL1 for xylose reductase for galactose and xylose/arabinose utilization, respectively, were repressed by glucose at low and high temperatures, but KmHXK2 for hexokinase was not repressed. We discuss the possible mechanism of glucose repression and the potential for utilization of K. marxianus in high-temperature fermentation with mixed sugars containing glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aarabinose 3aethanol 3aethanol fermentation 3aethanol production 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aheat tolerance 3ahexokinase 3amannose 3apentoses 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3axylose 3ayeasts 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHexosesxmetabolism 2aHot Temperature 2aKluyveromycesxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPentosesxmetabolism1 aLertwattanasakul, Noppon1 aHirata, Katsushi1 aSuprayogi, 1 aLimtong, Savitree1 aKosaka, Tomoyuki1 aYamada, Mamoru0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 May, v. 90, no. 4 p.1573-1586dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3218-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008900166300001600255520111700271592002801388650002201416650002101438650002201459650001101481650001501492653002401507653002901531653002901560653002301589653001601612700001801628700001501646700001601661700001801677700001401695700001601709773009901725856008701824852000901911655001201920IND60642989420221119030703.0191024e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064298942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Chao10aIn situ monitoring of lithium-ion battery degradation using an electrochemical model  ap. 685-696.  aLithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly popular for electric vehicle and grid storage applications, but degradation mechanisms remain poorly understood and are difficult to characterize accurately. Here a new method for in situ monitoring of internal degradation in LIBs using an electrochemical model (EM) is introduced. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) An EM is developed based on a single particle model, the parameters of which are reorganized from the original physical property parameters for convenience of identification, with each new parameter assigned a specific physical meaning. (2) Identification methods for all parameters are determined through activation-and-response analysis, and a combined load profile for parameter identification is developed. (3) Cyclic aging experiments are carried out and the aforementioned model and parameter identification methods are applied at appropriate intervals. The predicted trends of 7 (internal resistance included) of the 10 model parameters show strong correlations with the experimentally observed degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3amonitoring 0aLithium-ion battery 0aElectrochemical modeling 0aParameter identification 0aIn situ diagnostic 0aDegradation1 aSong, Yankong1 aZheng, Jun1 aLuo, Weilin1 aHinds, Gareth1 aLi, Junfu1 aWang, Lixin0 tApplied energy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 250 p.685-696dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245011400205300002000319520148600339592002801825650002301853650001401876650001701890650001801907650001101925650001401936650001101950650002301961650002201984650003702006700002002043700002402063700006002087700007002147773013702217856008002354852000902434655001202443IND60646807620221119041218.0190613e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b004642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaGrow, Alec P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3306-645810aIn Situ Visualization of Site-Dependent Reaction Kinetics in Shape-Controlled Nanoparticles: Corners vs Edges  ap. 14746-14753.  aCorner and edge sites have long been predicted to play a dominant role in the chemistry of nanomaterials due to their low metal–metal coordination numbers. However, due to the difficulty in directly observing chemical reactions, a detailed understanding of how a material’s crystallographic sites and morphology affect those sites’ reaction kinetics is limited. Using environmental scanning transmission electron microscopy (ESTEM), we report direct observations under continuous reaction conditions of site-dependent chemical reactivity critical to corrosion and heterogeneous catalysis. A range of fcc nickel nanocrystal morphologies bound by the low index {111} facets (triangular plates, hexagonal plates, and decahedral and icosahedral nanoparticles) were studied during oxidation to visualize in situ changes using atomic number (Z) contrast ESTEM. Oxidation is shown to occur preferentially at the corner sites and then the edges. The enhanced oxidation rate of the corners persists until corrosion has progressed to a depth of ∼2–4 nm, depending on the nanoparticle geometry. The nanoparticle systems showed that the triangular plates were the most reactive followed by the hexagonal plates, decahedra, and icosahedra. Time-resolved measurements of oxidation rates show a size-dependent induction period for the edges, hypothesized to be due to oxygen diffusion along the surface of the smaller particles to react preferentially at the more reactive corner sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acorrosion 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphysical chemistry 3areaction kinetics 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLloyd, David C.1 aSchebarchov, Dmitri1 aGai, Pratibha L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3837-71481 aBoyes, E.

The present experiment was designed to investigate preference for acoustic, olfactory, and acoustic + olfactory signals in laboratory mice. Eighteen female CBA/CaJ mice, socially housed or isolated, were tested to evaluate preference for signals produced by males. Social experience influenced female preference for male USV playback and soiled bedding. Female mice who had experience with males showed a stronger preference for olfactory signals, whereas female mice with experience only with other females preferred USV playback. Isolated mice showed a greater preference for signals of different modalities presented together than socially experienced mice. This preference may have occurred because of increased motivation to make social contact. The findings of this experiment illustrate that social experience could play a role in mate choice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacoustics 3afemales 3amales 3amating behavior 3amice 3amotivation 0aF 0aM/F 0aOVX 0aSPL 0aTM 0aUSVs 0aAnimal communication 0aAcoustic communication 0aSexual selection1 aDent, Micheal L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7462-501X0 tBehavioural processes.g2018 Dec., v. 157 p.171-179dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11891x0376-63577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.beproc.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013700162300001600299520132000315592002801635650000801663650002601671650001601697650003001713650002101743650001101764650002701775650003001802650001701832650001301849650001901862651001201881651001401893653002001907653001701927700002101944700001801965700002101983773011302004856008202117852000902199655001202208IND60549467720221119214847.0160908e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946772DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-11-00312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, N.

The fungus did not grow or become established on leaf surfaces until uredinia erupted, but when soybean rust signs and symptoms were evident, S. lanosoniveum colonized leaves within 3 days and sporulated within 4 days. Development of new uredinia was suppressed by about fourfold when S. lanosoniveum colonized uredinia. In the presence of S. lanosoniveum, uredinia became increasingly red-brown, and urediniospores turned brown and germinated at very low rates. Assays using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the fungus colonized leaf surfaces when plants were infected with P. pachyrhizi, either in a latent stage of infection or when symptoms were present. However, when plants were inoculated before infection, there was no increase of DNA of S. lanosoniveum, suggesting that the pathogen must be present in order for the antagonist to become established on soybean leaf surfaces. We documented significantly lower amounts of DNA of P. pachyrhizi and lower disease severity when soybean leaves were colonized with S. lanosoniveum. These studies documented the mycophilic and disease-suppressive nature of S. lanosoniveum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3aantagonists 3abiological control agents 3adisease severity 3aleaves 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoybean rust 3asoybeans 3aurediniospores 3aFlorida 3aLouisiana 0aCordycipitaceae 0aGlycine max.1 aRobertson, C.

Folate is a membrane-bound receptor that plays a vital role in the uptake of anti-folate molecules aimed for efficient drug delivery of anti-folate drugs.The present study is aimed at the modulation of the expression of folate receptor by curcumin that enhances the intake, cytotoxicity and anticancer effects of paclitaxel in HeLa cells.HeLa cells were pretreated with curcumin and treated with paclitaxel. We measured the cell viability, uptake of radiolabelled folic acid and paclitaxel, Folate receptor –alpha (FR-α) protein expression by immunocytochemistry and western blot and FR-α mRNA expression by qualitative and quantitative analysis.This study shows that curcumin (10 - 50 µM) causes significantly increased cytotoxicity in a dose and time dependent manner. It also enhances the intake of radiolabeled folic acid and paclitaxel 3–4 folds in HeLa cells. The pretreatment of HeLa cells with curcumin shows statistically significant of cell death by paclitaxel. The quantitative RT-PCR demonstrates the expression of FR- α mRNA upon curcumin treatment. Furthermore, immunochemistry and western blotting analysis proved that curcumin enhances expression the FR- α in HeLa cells.Our study proved that the molecular mechanism of curcumin enhances the upregulation of FR – α mRNA and protein expression in HeLa cells. Therefore, a combination of curcumin and paclitaxel at less concentration may be a targeting strategy for FR-targeted drug delivery providing a better therapeutic intervention of cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell death 3acell viability 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afolate receptors 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahuman cell lines 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3aprotein synthesis 3aradiolabeling 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 0aFolate-receptor 0aCurcumin 0aPaclitaxel 0aTargeted drug delivery 0aOver-expression 0aATRA 0aEGFR 0aFR 0aLDLP 0aFR-α 0aIgG- FITC 0aPMSF0 tPhytomedicine.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 56 p.279-285dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2018.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001600293500001900309520103900328592002801367650001301395650002001408650000901428650001201437650001401449650004001463650001001503650001201513650001601525653002101541653001301562653001601575700001901591700002101610700002201631700001901653773014701672856008101819852000901900655001201909IND60689330720221120213622.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068933072DNAL7 a10.1080/096374809031366672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Ch-Huing12aA novel green tea meal replacement formula for weight loss among obese individuals: a randomized controlled clinical trial  ap. 151-159.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aObjective To assess the efficacy and safety of a green tea meal replacement formula product for the treatment of obesity.

Among completers only, the treatment group again lost more weight (6.8 kg; n=54 versus 0.8 kg; n =56; P =0.001) and had a greater reduced total body fat mass (7.6%; n=37 versus 0.5%; P=0.005) Conclusions This green tea meal replacement formula contributes to the lower body weight and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3aclinical trials 3adiet 3afemales 3agreen tea 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amales 3aobesity 3aweight loss 0ameal replacement 0afat mass 0ablood lipid1 aChiu, Wan-Chen1 aYang, Nae-Cherng1 aOuyang, Chung-Mei1 aYen, Yue-Horng0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 60, no. sup6 p.151-159dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374809031366673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013800166300001800304520215800322592002802480650001302508650001602521650002602537650001502563650001802578650005002596650001702646650001902663650001302682650001502695650001602710650001202726650002102738651001002759651001602769700001302785700001702798700001602815700001602831773009802847856008602945852000903031655001203040IND60089037520221116164645.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008903752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmili, E.10aMapping particulate matter in alpine regions with satellite and ground-based measurements: An exploratory study for data assimilation  ap. 4344-4353.  aThe objective of this study is the integration of satellite and in-situ measurements of particulate matter (PM₁₀) to provide PM₁₀ maps in Switzerland and South Tyrol (Italy) on an operational daily basis. Satellite retrieval of PM has been widely investigated in the past years, showing moderate potential (uncertainty of ∼30%) but also a number of severe limitations (e.g., due to cloud and snow cover or unknown aerosol extinction profiles). Its actual effectiveness can only be tested by a comparison with the mapping capability of ground-based measurements from existing air-quality networks. Moreover, the integration of both observational systems (assimilation) can improve PM mapping. Herein, we apply a linear model including aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) and meteorological boundary layer height (BLH) to estimate spatially homogeneous maps of PM₁₀ over the study region in 2008–2009. AOD from MODIS is used to compare the results with those of similar studies. The validation of the satellite maps reveals higher accuracy in flat areas (r ∼ 0.6, RMSE ∼ 10 μg m⁻³) than in alpine valleys and elevated sites. In contrast, the inverse distance interpolation of in-situ measurements is able to produce more accurate (r > 0.8, RMSE < 6 μg m⁻³) PM₁₀ maps. An assimilation schema was developed considering the interpolation of ground measurements as a background field, updating it with satellite observations wherever they are available. The accuracy of the assimilated maps is assessed and compared to the background fields. It is found that satellite data is of limited benefit in the considered region due to the good spatial coverage of the ground networks and the difficulties inherent to the satellite PM retrieval over rugged topography. The results of the assimilation are positive (∼1 μg m⁻³ improvement in RMSE) when a number of ground sites (80%) are excluded. It is concluded that satellite data are of higher interest for regions with a sparser distribution of measurement sites (e.g., distance > 100 km between sites).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aextinction 3alinear models 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aparticulates 3aremote sensing 3asnowpack 3atopography 3auncertainty 3avalleys 3avegetation cover 3aItaly 3aSwitzerland1 aPopp, C.1 aWunderle, S.1 aZebisch, M.1 aPetitta, M.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Aug., v. 45, no. 26 p.4344-4353dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.05.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245016000167300002000327520156500347592002801912650002101940650002401961650001101985650001501996650002202011650001502033650001602048650002802064650001102092650001202103650002302115650001402138650002402152650001302176650002102189700001402210700001702224700001302241700005302254700002302307700005702330700005602387773012202443856008702565852000902652655001202661IND60676851320221122034157.0191122e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067685132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b024052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rong10aSolid-State KOH Pretreatment of Corn Straw for Anaerobic Digestion: Methane Yield Enhancement, Potassium Flow Analysis, and Preliminary Economic Assessment  ap. 11034-11040.  aPretreatment has been widely used to improve the anaerobic digestion (AD) efficiency of cellulosic substrates. However, intrinsic shortcomings of traditional pretreatment techniques limit their industrial applications. In this study, a solid-state alkaline pretreatment with KOH to improve the AD efficiency of corn straw was developed, which could largely decrease the chemical needed during pretreatment. In addition, it could be done during the feedstock storage without the need for liquid/solid separation before AD. Furthermore, the potassium added during pretreatment could be preserved in the AD digestate, which could benefit its utilization as a fertilizer. Results showed that the solid-state KOH pretreatment significantly improved the methane yield and AD efficiency that depended on KOH loading. Under 8% KOH load, the maximum methane yield was obtained, which was 31.9% higher than that of the original corn straw. Structural analysis showed that the intact structures (especially lignin) of corn straw were partly destroyed during pretreatment, which improved the AD performance of pretreated corn straw. The added K⁺ was well preserved in the digestate, more than 76% of which was distributed in the biogas slurry as water-soluble K⁺. The economy of solid-state KOH pretreatment was strongly associated with the KOH loads during pretreatment as well as with the utilization pattern of the biogas digestate. Only pretreatment with 1% KOH loading showed a positive net value of 0.16 USD/day without considering the value of the AD digestate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali treatment 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acorn straw 3aeconomic analysis 3afeedstocks 3afertilizers 3aindustrial applications 3alignin 3aliquids 3amethane production 3apotassium 3apotassium hydroxide 3aslurries 3awater solubility1 aZhang, Xu1 aSun, Wen-Xin1 aZou, Hua1 aZheng, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3419-94631 aZhang, Guang-Sheng1 aWang, Zhen-Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5114-435X1 aFu, Shan-Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5822-55070 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 33, no. 11 p.11034-11040dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b024053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006200206300001200268506007600280520039600356592002800752506003700780650001800817650002100835650001600856773011700872856007700989852000901066655001201075IND60690433120221207094553.0200426e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069043312DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.3.152862doi7 aPMC31424062pmcid7 a216735052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLev-Yadun, Simcha10aTerminology for plant polaritybProgress and difficulties  ap. 315.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent attempts to establish a "natural" terminology for plant polarity¹⁻³ are significant as they have identified various problems in the classic terminology of polarity⁴, and arrived at a logical and simple terminology (shootward and rootward). 3 The related issue of polarity changes was also addressed while assuming that cell polarity is conserved throughout the development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell polarity 3aplant physiology 3aterminology0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 6, no. 3 p.315-315dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.3.152863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245012100201300001800322520185600340592002802196650001902224650002902243650003102272650001902303650002302322650002502345650001502370650002202385700001602407700005702423700001702480700001802497700001702515700001302532773013702545856008102682852000902763655001202772IND60616357620221119071544.0181020e20180919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061635762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b067262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Hujun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6117-059710aMolecular Dynamics Simulations of Ether- and Ester-Linked Phospholipid Bilayers: A Comparative Study of Water Models  ap. 9399-9408.  aMembrane dipole potential influences a variety of important biological processes involving cell membranes. Because it is quite challenging to directly measure the membrane dipole potential in experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has emerged as a powerful tool for a reasonable prediction of the dipole potential. Although MD predictions agree well with experiments about the sign of the dipole potential, the magnitude of the dipole potential varies significantly with the force field parameters. It has been shown that the positive dipole potential of phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayer membranes would be overestimated by a nonpolarizable model owing to the treatment of many-body polarization effects in a mean-field fashion. In this work, we carried out atomistic MD simulations of the diphytanyl PC (ether-DPhPC) and diphytanoyl PC (ester-DPhPC) bilayers and made a comparative study of three different nonpolarizable water models (TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP5P). Interestingly, we discover that the calculated dipole potential by the TIP5P model shows good agreement with the result obtained using the cryoelectron microscopy experiment, suggesting that a better description of electrostatic interactions in a nonpolarizable water model can effectively ameliorate the overestimation in the calculation of the dipole potential. In addition, our MD results show that the substitution of the ether linkage for the ester linkage of phospholipid bilayers would bring about a change in the orientation of the linkage group with respect to the bilayer normal, leading to the difference in the membrane dipole potential. Surprisingly, although water molecules provide a major contribution to the positive dipole potential, they have a limited impact on the difference of the dipole potential between the ether-DPhPC and ester-DPhPC bilayer membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3acryo-electron microscopy 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alinkage groups 3amolecular dynamics 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aprediction 3asimulation models1 aWu, Zhenhua1 aDeng, Mingsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3331-38501 aWen, Shuiguo1 aGao, Chenggui1 aLi, Shixiong1 aWu, Xupu0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 19, v. 122, no. 40 p.9399-9408dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b067263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245008200206300002000288506007600308520149000384592002801874506003701902650001601939650001501955650001601970650001001986650002401996650001702020650001902037650001402056650002802070650001902098650002402117650001602141653003002157653002602187653003402213653000902247653002002256700002002276700002302296700002202319773017602341856007902517852000902596655001202605IND60172238020221207093741.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017223802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12071701092doi7 aPMC34271012pmcid7 a228649132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Victoria M.10aSmall molecule inhibitors of Smoothened ciliary localization and ciliogenesis  ap. 13644-13649.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signals involved in development and some forms of cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, are transduced by the primary cilium, a microtubular projection found on many cells. A critical step in vertebrate Hh signal transduction is the regulated movement of Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein, to the primary cilium. To identify small molecules that interfere with either the ciliary localization of Smo or ciliogenesis, we undertook a high-throughput, microscopy-based screen for compounds that alter the ciliary localization of YFP-tagged Smo. This screen identified 10 compounds that inhibit Hh pathway activity. Nine of these Smo antagonists (SA1–9) bind Smo, and one (SA10) does not. We also identified two compounds that inhibit ciliary biogenesis, which block microtubule polymerization or alter centrosome composition. Differential labeling of cell surface and intracellular Smo pools indicates that SA1–7 and 10 specifically inhibit trafficking of intracellular Smo to cilia. In contrast, SA8 and 9 recruit endogenous Smo to the cilium in some cell types. Despite these different mechanisms of action, all of the SAs inhibit activation of the Hh pathway by an oncogenic form of Smo, and abrogate the proliferation of basal cell carcinoma-like cancer cells. The SA compounds may provide alternative means of inhibiting pathogenic Hh signaling, and our study reveals that different pools of Smo move into cilia through distinct mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantagonists 3abiogenesis 3acentrosomes 3acilia 3amechanism of action 3amicrotubules 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphysiological transport 3apolymerization 3asignal transduction 3avertebrates 0ahigh-throughput screening 0ahigh-content analysis 0afluorescence cell-based assay 0aSufu 0amedulloblastoma1 aChen, Steven C.1 aArkin, Michelle R.1 aReiter, Jeremy F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13644-13649dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12071701093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009600174300001400270520148000284536051201764592002802276596006902304653002402373653002202397653003202419653002302451700002102474700001702495700001702512700001902529773014102548856008602689852000902775655001202784IND60686975220221118162221.0200402e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068697522DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2019.16094802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeaton, Matthew J.10aModeling Bronchiolitis Incidence Proportions in the Presence of Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty  ap. 66-78.  aBronchiolitis (inflammation of the lower respiratory tract) in infants is primarily due to viral infection and is the single most common cause of infant hospitalization in the United States. To increase epidemiological understanding of bronchiolitis (and, subsequently, develop better prevention strategies), this research analyzes data on infant bronchiolitis cases from the U.S. Military Health System between the years 2003–2013 in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. For privacy reasons, child home addresses, birth dates, and diagnosis dates were randomized (jittered) creating spatio-temporal uncertainty in the geographic location and timing of bronchiolitis incidents. Using spatio-temporal point patterns, we created a modeling strategy that accounts for the jittering to estimate and quantify the uncertainty for the incidence proportion (IP) of bronchiolitis. Additionally, we regress the IP onto key covariates including pollution where we adequately account for uncertainty in the pollution levels (i.e., covariate uncertainty) using a land use regression model. Our analysis results indicate that the IP is positively associated with sulfur dioxide and population density. Further, we demonstrate how scientific conclusions may change if various sources of uncertainty (either spatio-temporal or covariate uncertainty) are not accounted for.

Single oocyte monoculture using the hanging drop (HD) system has some advantages such as improving analysis efficiency brought by the smaller number of samples than the number of oocytes cultured in one drop. Direct effects of ligands on single oocytes could also be detected without considering the effects of paracrine factors from other oocytes. After 22 h of pre‐culture, denuded oocytes were cultured for 22 h with 0.01 and 0.1 μg/ml of L‐carnitine (LC), lactoferrin (LF) or sulforaphane (SF) in the presence/non‐presence of oxidant stress induced by H₂O₂supplementation to evaluate the reducing effects against oxidative stress on nuclear maturation. As a result, compared with LC and SF, LF showed effective reduction in oxidative stress at a lower concentration (0.01 μg/ml), suggesting that LF is a more effective antioxidant in porcine oocyte IVM. Additionally, LF also increased maturation rate even in culture without H₂O₂. Our results clearly suggest that the HD monoculture system is useful for screening the substances that affect porcine oocyte culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactoferrin 3ascreening 3aoocytes 3aoxidative stress 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCell Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aHydrogen Peroxide 2aIn Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aOocytesxdrug effects 2aSwinexphysiology 0aantioxidants1 aMachida, R1 aHiraga, K1 aHiradate, Y1 aSuda, Y1 aTanemura, K0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.e26-e30dP.

In a solution‐culture study, ten wheat genotypes were tested under control, 200 mM–NaCl salt stress and 4‐week water‐logging (nonaerated solution stagnated with 0.1% agar), alone or in combination. Shoot and root growth of the wheat genotypes was reduced by salinity and salinity × water‐logging, which was associated with increased leaf Na⁺ and Cl– concentrations as well as decreased leaf K⁺ concentration and K⁺ : Na⁺ ratio. The genotypes differed significantly for their growth and leaf ionic composition. The genotypes Aqaab and MH‐97 were selected as salinity×water‐logging‐resistant and sensitive wheat genotypes, respectively, on the basis of their shoot fresh weights in the salinity × water‐logging treatment relative to control. In a soil experiment, the effect of water‐logging was tested for these two genotypes under nonsaline (EC = 2.6 dS m–¹) and saline (EC = 15 dS m–¹) soil conditions. The water‐logging was imposed for a period of 21 d at various growth stages, i.e., tillering, stem elongation, booting, and grain filling alone or in combinations. The maximum reduction in grain yield was observed after water‐logging at stem‐elongation + grain‐filling stages followed by water‐logging at grain‐filling stage, booting stage, and stem‐elongation stage, respectively. Salinity intensified the effect of water‐logging at all the growth stages. It is concluded that the existing genetic variation in wheat for salinity × water‐logging resistance can be successfully explored using relative shoot fresh weight as a selection criterion in nonaerated 0.1% agar–containing nutrient solution and that irrigation in the field should be scheduled to avoid temporary water‐logging at the sensitive stages of wheat growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3adevelopmental stages 3afilling period 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3aroot growth 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aselection criteria 3ashoots 3asoil quality 3astem elongation 3atillering 3awheat1 aAkhtar, Javaid1 aQureshi, Riaz Hussain1 aNasīm, Muḥammad,0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2013 Apr., v. 176, no. 2 p.131-137dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201200011  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245011600201300002000317506007600337520090900413592002801322506003701350650001101387650002001398650004601418650001101464650002101475650001101496650001201507650004401519650002501563653002101588653002301609653003301632700001901665700002301684700002201707700002101729700001801750700002301768700001701791773017601808856007901984852000902063655001202072IND60172238120221207080839.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017223812DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12074931092doi7 aPMC34270972pmcid7 a228697352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanci, L.,10aHuman superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD1) maturation through interaction with human copper chaperone for SOD1 (hCCS)  ap. 13555-13560.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCopper chaperone for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), CCS, is the physiological partner for the complex mechanism of SOD1 maturation. We report an in vitro model for human CCS-dependent SOD1 maturation based on the study of the interactions of human SOD1 (hSOD1) with full-length WT human CCS (hCCS), as well as with hCCS mutants and various truncated constructs comprising one or two of the protein’s three domains. The synergy between electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and NMR is fully exploited. This is an in vitro study of this process at the molecular level. Domain 1 of hCCS is necessary to load hSOD1 with Cu(I), requiring the heterodimeric complex formation with hSOD1 fostered by the interaction with domain 2. Domain 3 is responsible for the catalytic formation of the hSOD1 Cys-57–Cys-146 disulfide bond, which involves both hCCS Cys-244 and Cys-246 via disulfide transfer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acopper 3adisulfide bonds 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3amutants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asuperoxide dismutase 0acopper transport 0aprotein maturation 0aprotein-protein interactions1 aBertini, Ivano1 aCantini, Francesca1 aKozyreva, Tatiana1 aMassagni, Chiara1 aPalumaa, Peep1 aRubino, Jeffrey T.1 aZovo, Kairit0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13555-13560dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12074931093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008800209300001300297500001900310500001100329520111100340592002801451650002201479650001001501650001201511650001501523650001101538650001101549650001001560650001201570650001501582773012701597856008201724852000901806655001201815IND60724018120221120100601.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072401812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04489-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspejo, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0134-636410aRole of commercial enzymes in wine production: a critical review of recent research  ap. 9-21.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aPurified enzymes of microbial origin are applied in the beverage industry since decades because of their ability to enhance products and processes with minimal side effects and low costs. Commercial enzymes are widely used during different wine making steps providing a broad range of effects, such as to maximise juice yield, improve aroma compounds, flavour enhancement, colour extraction in red wines, and contribute in the removal of dissolved unwanted colloidal particles and pectin substances during wine stabilization and filtration. This review presents a study of recent advances in the application of commercial enzymes in the wine making of red, white and sweet wines that have been made in essentially the last 13 years (2005–2018). Literature has been critically analysed to discover general rules about previous research. Special attention is paid to the safety of enzyme application due to allergic issues. Future research efforts should be concentrated on application of immobilizated enzymes and the use of microorganisms with potential enzymatic side activities during wine production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverage industry 3acolor 3aenzymes 3afiltration 3aflavor 3ajuices 3aodors 3apectins 3awinemaking0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.9-21dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04489-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245012200200300001600322506007600338520171600414592002802130506003702158650000802195650002502203650002102228650001602249650001502265650001102280650001302291650001702304650001402321650001702335650001002352650001102362650001502373650001302388650002602401650001602427650003102443650001402474650001902488650001402507650001802521650001402539650002202553700001802575773011702593856007702710852000902787655001202796IND60690433420221207093532.0200426e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069043342DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.4.143352doi7 aPMC31423782pmcid7 a216735112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchauer, S.12aA novel growth-promoting microbe, Methylobacterium funariae sp. nov., isolated from the leaf surface of a common moss  ap. 510-515.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLand plants (embryophytes) evolved in the presence of prokaryotic microbes. As a result, numerous mutually beneficial associations (symbioses) developed that can be analyzed using a variety of methods. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a new pink-pigmented facultatively methylotrophic symbiotic bacterium of the genus Methylobacterium (laboratory strain F3.2) that was isolated from the gametophytic phylloids of the common cord moss Funaria hygrometrica Hedw. Plantlets were collected in the field and analyzed in the laboratory. Colonies of methylobacteria were obtained by the agar-impression-method. Based on its unique phenotype (the bacterial cells are characterized by fimbriae-like appendages), a comparative 16S rRNA gene (DNA) sequence analysis, and an average DNA-DNA hybridization value of 8,4 %, compared with its most closely related sister taxon, this isolate is described as a new species, Methylobacterium funariae sp. nov. (type strain F3.2). This new epiphytic bacterium inhabits the leaf surface of “primitive” land plants such as mosses and interacts with its host organism via the secretion of phytohormones (cytokinines, auxins). These external signals are perceived by the plant cells that divide and grow more rapidly than in the absence of their prokaryotic phytosymbionts. We suggest that M. funariae sp. nov. uses methanol emitted from the stomatal pores as principal carbon source for cell metabolism. However, our novel data indicate that, in this unique symbiotic plant-microbe interaction, the uptake of amino acids leached from the surface of the epidermal cells of the green host organism may be of importance as microbial carbon- and nitrogen-source.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aFunaria hygrometrica 3aMethylobacterium 3aamino acids 3aappendages 3aauxins 3abacteria 3aembryophytes 3aepiphytes 3agametophytes 3agenes 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amethanol 3amosses and liverworts 3anew species 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aphenotype 3aplant hormones 3aplantlets 3aribosomal RNA 3asecretion 3asequence analysis1 aKutschera, U.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.510-515dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.4.143353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006300157300002000220520073800240592002800978650001001006650001601016650001601032650002501048650001901073650002701092650002401119650001601143650001601159700001501175700002001190773010101210856007501311852000901386655001201395IND60576619120221121093800.0170806e20120807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057661912DNAL7 a10.1021/la302433a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Zhiqiang10aSuperhydrophilic Zwitterionic Polymers Stabilize Liposomes  ap. 11625-11632.  aNonionic polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a stealth polymer destabilizes liposomes due to its amphiphilic property. As a result, PEGylated liposomes have to be further stabilized, such as by using a large amount cholesterol. This is a long existing dilemma faced by PEG. In this work, we show that zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB) stabilizes liposomes because of its superhydrophilic nature, thus solving this dilemma. Specifically, PCB-modified liposomes without cholesterol exhibited good retention of hydrophilic drug and long blood circulating characteristics in vivo. To further validate this new PCB chemistry, PCB liposomal doxorubicin without cholesterol was compared with DOXIL for their antitumor therapeutic efficacies.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adoxorubicin 3ahydrophilic polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3aliposomes (artificial) 3apolyethylene glycol 3astabilizers 3azwitterions1 aZhang, Lei1 aJiang, Guangbi,0 tLangmuir.g2012 Aug. 07, v. 28, no. 31 p.11625-11632dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla302433a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012000166520199400286592002802280650001602308650001902324650002002343650000902363650002002372650001802392650002202410651001202432653002502444653004702469653003002516653002802546700001902574700002202593700002902615700002002644773010002664856008402764852000902848655001202857IND60750001420221119013428.0211218e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075000142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1008412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe Mon Aung,10aTechnical efficiency of small-scale aquaculture in Myanmar: Does women’s participation in decision-making matter?  aEfficient use of inputs is crucial for sustainable aquaculture productivity growth, increased profitability, and improved livelihoods in developing countries. Studies have shown that women’s participation in decision-making (WPDM) can influence technical efficiency among agricultural crops farmers. However, rigorous empirical evidence in small-scale aquaculture is inadequate. Using data from 440 small-scale aquaculture households in the Ayeyarwady Delta region of Myanmar, this study: (a) measures technical efficiency using radial, non-radial and two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA); and (b) examines the effect of WPDM on technical efficiency. Results reveal that most households perform 45–60% below the production frontier indicating they are not technically efficient. WPDM correlates with a significant increase in technical efficiency suggesting that women’s empowerment contributes to optimal use of inputs and improved on-farm aquaculture performance. Practicing polyculture and implementing climate change adaptation strategies correlate with enhanced efficiency. Practicing polyculture with compatible fish species allows advantageous interactions and coexistence which improve inputs utilization and reduce wastes. Judicious use of inputs as a strategy for addressing climatic shocks possibly explains the positive correlation between adaptation and technical efficiency. Together, the findings highlight the important need to promote interventions targeted at improving technical efficiency of small-scale aquaculture producers. Improving technical efficiency can reduce production costs, increase net farm income, and provide a sustainable supply of nutritious foods, a source of essential micronutrients such as vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids, and affordable animal-source protein. Programs and policies aimed at increasing aquaculture productivity would benefit by including interventions to reduce gender inequality and promoting equity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3afish 3anet farm income 3aprofitability 3asocial inequality 3aMyanmar 0aInput use efficiency 0aWomen’s participation in decision-making 0aData envelopment analysis 0aSmall-scale aquaculture1 aKhor, Ling Yee1 aTrần, Nhương,1 aShikuku, Kelvin Mashisia1 aZeller, Manfred0 tAquaculture reports.g2021 Nov., v. 21 p.100841-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1008413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002300159245008500182300001600267500000900283520164400292592002801936650002201964650001301986650002001999650002002019650002102039650002102060650002302081650001602104650001902120650003002139650001302169650001302182650002202195650001302217650001302230650001602243650001602259650002302275650002502298650001302323650002002336650005702356650003402413650002002447650004102467650001202508700001902520700002202539773019202561852000902753856007702762655001202839IND4433477920221121221911.0191028e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443347792DNAL7 a201768222pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2009.02652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Melissa L.10aEffects of Polymer-coated Urea on Nitrate Leaching and Nitrogen Uptake by Potato  ap. 492-499.  aepub  aIncreasing groundwater nitrate concentrations in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production regions have prompted the need to identify alternative nitrogen management practices. A new type of polymer-coated urea (PCU) called Environmentally Smart Nitrogen (Agrium, Inc., Calgary, AB) is significantly lower in cost than comparable PCUs, but its potential to reduce nitrate leaching and improve fertilizer recovery has not been extensively studied in potato. In 2006 and 2007, four rates of PCU applied at emergence were compared with equivalent rates of soluble N split-applied at emergence and post-hilling. Additional treatments included a 0 N control, two PCU timing treatments (applied at preplant or planting), and a soluble N fertigation simulation. Nitrate leaching, fertilizer N recovery, N use efficiency (NUE), and residual soil inorganic N were measured. Both 2006 and 2007 were low leaching years. Nitrate leaching with PCU (21.3 kg NO₃–N ha⁻¹ averaged over N rates) was significantly lower than with split-applied soluble N (26.9 kg NO₃–N ha⁻¹). The soluble N fertigation treatment resulted in similar leaching as PCU at equivalent N rates. Apparent fertilizer N recovery with PCU (65% averaged over four rates) tended to be higher than split-applied soluble N (55%) at equivalent rates (p = 0.059). Residual soil N and NUE were not significantly affected by N source. Under the conditions of this study, PCU significantly reduced leaching and tended to improved N recovery over soluble N applied in two applications and resulted in similar N recovery and nitrate leaching as soluble N applied in six applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3acrop production 3acrop management 3aurea fertilizers 3aapplication rate 3aapplication timing 3afertigation 3asoil pollution 3agroundwater contamination 3anitrates 3aleaching 3apollution control 3apolymers 3acoatings 2aAgriculture 2aFertilizers 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPolymers 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSolanum tuberosumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aUreaxadministration & dosage 2aWaterxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWeather1 aRosen, Carl J.1 aMoncrief, John F.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Mar., v. 39, no. 2 p.492-499dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.02653Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02637naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009900172300001600271520166200287592002801949653002901977653002102006653002502027653000802052700002202060700002702082773014302109856008602252852000902338655001202347IND60686975520221118161917.0200402e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068697552DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2019.16099702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Gareth M.10aPenalized and Constrained Optimization: An Application to High-Dimensional Website Advertising  ap. 107-122.  aFirms are increasingly transitioning advertising budgets to Internet display campaigns, but this transition poses new challenges. These campaigns use numerous potential metrics for success (e.g., reach or click rate), and because each website represents a separate advertising opportunity, this is also an inherently high-dimensional problem. Further, advertisers often have constraints they wish to place on their campaign, such as targeting specific sub-populations or websites. These challenges require a method flexible enough to accommodate thousands of websites, as well as numerous metrics and campaign constraints. Motivated by this application, we consider the general constrained high-dimensional problem, where the parameters satisfy linear constraints. We develop the Penalized and Constrained optimization method (PaC) to compute the solution path for high-dimensional, linearly constrained criteria. PaC is extremely general; in addition to internet advertising, we show it encompasses many other potential applications, such as portfolio estimation, monotone curve estimation, and the generalized lasso. Computing the PaC coefficient path poses technical challenges, but we develop an efficient algorithm over a grid of tuning parameters. Through extensive simulations, we show PaC performs well. Finally, we apply PaC to a proprietary dataset in an exemplar Internet advertising case study and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in this practical setting.

All 111 samples analyzed were positive for aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB) and 46 (41.4%) did not comply with Mexico's Official Guidelines. Sixty-nine (62.1%) and 23 (20.7%) water samples were positive for total coliforms (TC) and fecal coliforms (FC), respectively. A total of 81 (72.9%) of the water samples exceeded the maximum allowed limit stipulated in the guideline. Thirty-three (29.7%) of the purified water samples were positive for NTM, being recovered a total of 40 isolates. These NTM isolates were identified using three molecular markers (hsp65, rrs and rpoB genes) which corresponded to the fast-growing mycobacteria M. chelonae (n = 12), M. porcinum (n = 8), M. senegalense (n = 5), M. abscessus (n = 4), M. septicum (n = 4), M. wolinskyi (n = 3), M. mucogenicum (n = 2), M. fortuitum (n = 1) and M. sp. (n = 1). In seven purified water samples, two different NTM species were isolated simultaneously. Overall, these results showed that most of the purified bottled water samples analyzed in this study had unsatisfactory microbiological quality and some harbored NTM associated with illness. Our data could hasten health authorities to intensify efforts in the routine monitoring of activities in the purified bottled water industry in order to supply safe and healthy water to the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottled water 3acoliform bacteria 3afecal bacteria 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aguidelines 3amicrobiological quality 3amonitoring 3awater purification 3awater utilities 3aMexico 0aPurified water 0aMicrobiological quality 0aMycobacteria1 aCortes-Cueto, Ana Laura1 aVillegas-Martínez, Daniel1 aLeon-Montes, Nancy1 aSalas-Rangel, Laura P.1 aRivera-Gutierrez, Sandra1 aLopez-Hernandez, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8701-04281 aHelguera-Repetto, Addy Cecilia1 aFernandez-Rendon, Elizabeth1 aGonzalez-y-Merchand, Jorge Alberto0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 306 p.108260-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.1082603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245005300201300001600254506007600270520081300346592002801159506003701187650001801224650001101242650002101253650001501274650001301289650001701302650002701319650001301346650001801359650001101377650001301388650002201401650001701423650001301440650001901453700002101472773011701493856007701610852000901687655001201696IND60690433620221207093623.0200426e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069043362DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.4.145582doi7 aPMC31423762pmcid7 a214069742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuhua,10aDeveloping a model of plant hormone interactions  ap. 494-500.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlant growth and development is influenced by mutual interactions among plant hormones. The five classical plant hormones are auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, abscisic acid and ethylene. They are small diffusible molecules that easily penetrate between cells. In addition, newer classes of plant hormones have been identified such as brassinosteroids, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and various small proteins or peptides. These hormones also play important roles in the regulation of plant growth and development. This review begins with a brief summary of the current findings on plant hormones. Based on this knowledge, a conceptual model about interactions among plant hormones is built so as to link and develop an understanding of the diverse functions of different plant hormones as a whole in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscisic acid 3aauxins 3abrassinosteroids 3acytokinins 3aethylene 3agibberellins 3agrowth and development 3ahormones 3ajasmonic acid 3amodels 3apeptides 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aproteins 3asalicylic acid1 aIrving, Helen R.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 6, no. 4 p.494-500dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.4.145583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03890naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016200165520180800327592002802135650001602163650001402179650002102193650002102214650001002235650001102245650002102256650002102277650001702298650002402315650001002339650000902349650003702358650001602395650002002411650003102431651000902462653004302471653004202514653002002556653002902576653004202605653000902647653000902656653000702665653000802672653000702680653001002687653000802697653000802705653000902713653000802722653000702730653000802737653001002745653001002755653000902765653001102774700005902785700001702844700001902861700001802880700002002898700002102918700001702939773009402956856008503050852000903135655001203144IND60625597220221122220439.0190620e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062559722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2018.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Je-Won10aModificated Mahuang-Tang, a traditional herbal medicine suppresses inflammatory responses induced by cigarette smoke in human airway epithelial cell and mice  aCigarette smoke (CS) is a major contributor to the high incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) featured as chronic inflammation and airway obstruction. Mahuang-Tang is a traditional polyherbal mixture composed of four different herbs. It is widely used in Asia as a remedy for allergic reaction and inflammation.We investigated the effects of a modificated Mahuang-Tang water extract (MTWE) against airway inflammation caused by CS and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice and cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)-stimulated NCI-H292 cells.CS exposed to animals for 1 h per day from day 1 to day 7 and treated with LPS intranasally on day 4. One hour before CS exposure, animals were received MTWE (50 or 100 mg/kg) by oral gavage. Inflammatory cell count and cytokines levels were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Expression levels of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) were analyzed by western blotting.MTWE markedly decreased the neutrophil and other inflammatory cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and reduced proinflammatory mediators as evidenced by the decreases in inflammatory cell recruitment in lung tissue. Furthermore, MTWE meaningfully declined MMP-9 expression and reduced the Erk phosphorylation, caused by the CS and LPS exposure. In in vitro experiments, MTWE suppressed the elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by CSC treatment. MTWE reduced Erk phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression in CSC-stimulated H292 cells.Overall, MTWE effectively inhibited the pulmonary inflammation and MMP-9 expression caused by the CS and LPS exposure, which was closely involved in suppression of Erk phosphorylation. These results suggest that MTWE possesses a potential for the treatment of COPD.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensates 3acytokines 3aepithelial cells 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneutrophils 3aphosphorylation 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aAsia 0aModificated Mahuang-Tang water extract 0aChronic obstructive pulmonary disease 0aCigarette smoke 0aMatrix metalloprotease-9 0aExtracellular signal-regulated kinase 0aBALF 0aCOPD 0aCS 0aCSC 0aDW 0aELISA 0aErk 0aH&E 0aHPLC 0aIHC 0aIL 0aLPS 0aMAPKs 0aMMP-9 0aMTWE 0aTNF-α1 aSeo, Chang-Seob1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8156-446X1 aShin, Na-Rae1 aKim, Joong-Sun1 aLee, Soong-In1 aKim, Jong-Choon1 aKim, Sŭng-hwan,1 aShin, In-Sik0 tPhytomedicine.g2019 June, v. 59 p.152777-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2018.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014300161500001400304520168700318592002802005650002402033650001502057650001202072650000902084650002802093650001002121650002402131650002302155650000902178650000902187650001002196651001002206700002202216700002002238700002002258700002002278700002002298700002402318700002502342700002002367700002202387700002602409773011802435856007302553852000902626655001202635IND60704509020221120104325.0200723e20200526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070450902DNAL7 a10.3390/w120615142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamela, Caterina 10aSafer_RAIN: A DEM-Based Hierarchical Filling-&-Spilling Algorithm for Pluvial Flood Hazard Assessment and Mapping across Large Urban Areas  aNAL-light  aThe increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events caused by the changing climate (e.g., cloudbursts, rainstorms, heavy rainfall, hail, heavy snow), combined with the high population density and concentration of assets, makes urban areas particularly vulnerable to pluvial flooding. Hence, assessing their vulnerability under current and future climate scenarios is of paramount importance. Detailed hydrologic-hydraulic numerical modeling is resource intensive and therefore scarcely suitable for performing consistent hazard assessments across large urban settlements. Given the steadily increasing availability of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) high-resolution DEMs (Digital Elevation Models), several studies highlighted the potential of fast-processing DEM-based methods, such as the Hierarchical Filling-&-Spilling or Puddle-to-Puddle Dynamic Filling-&-Spilling Algorithms (abbreviated herein as HFSAs). We develop a fast-processing HFSA, named Safer_RAIN, that enables mapping of pluvial flooding in large urban areas by accounting for spatially distributed rainfall input and infiltration processes through a pixel-based Green-Ampt model. We present the first applications of the algorithm to two case studies in Northern Italy. Safer_RAIN output is compared against ground evidence and detailed output from a two-dimensional (2D) hydrologic and hydraulic numerical model (overall index of agreement between Safer_RAIN and 2D benchmark model: sensitivity and specificity up to 71% and 99%, respectively), highlighting potential and limitations of the proposed algorithm for identifying pluvial flood-hazard hotspots across large urban environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGreen-Ampt equation 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3ahail 3ahazard characterization 3alidar 3amathematical models 3apopulation density 3arain 3asnow 3awater 3aItaly1 aPersiano, Simone 1 aBagli, Stefano 1 aLuzzi, Valerio 1 aMazzoli, Paolo 1 aHumer, Günter 1 aReithofer, Andreas 1 aEssenfelder, Arthur 1 aAmadio, Mattia 1 aMysiak, Jaroslav 1 aCastellarin, Attilio 0 tWater.g2020 May 26, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120615143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245007600204300001600280520124200296592002801538650002201566650002001588650001401608650002501622650001501647650001301662650001801675650001301693650002001706650001701726650001101743651002101754700001801775773011301793856008101906852000901987655001201996IND60613521520221121060828.0180913e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061352152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-018-9367-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasnak, Cemal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8312-782910aChange in Some Glycoalkaloids of Potato under Different Storage Regimes  ap. 183-193.  aThe potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is an important food crop worldwide. Potato tubers can be stored to provide continuity of supply between production seasons, but it is important that they be stored under appropriate conditions as incorrect storage will result in deterioration in end user quality and may increase glycoalkaloid levels. We have investigated the effects of types of household storage on potato glycoalkaloid content (total glycoalkaloids [TGA]; α-solanine; α-chaconine) in Turkey. Tubers of potato cultivars (cvs.) Agria and Bettina were stored under four types of storage conditions (indirect sunlight for 10 h per day and dark storage for the remaining 14 h per day; storage under continuous fluorescent light; storage in constant darkness; storage in the dark in a refrigerator) for 56 days. Samples of tubers were taken at the beginning of the storage period and after 14, 28 and 56 days of storage for tuber glycoalkaloid measurement. Tubers stored in the three light environments showed an increase in glycoalkaloid levels; however, none of the cv. Agria tubers reached the critical level of 200 mg/kg tuber. On day 56 the TGA level of cv. Bettina tubers stored under fluorescent light reached 234.31 mg/kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalpha-chaconine 3acultivars 3afluorescent lighting 3afood crops 3apotatoes 3arefrigerators 3asolanine 3asolar radiation 3astorage time 3atubers 3aTurkey (country)1 aArtik, Nevzat0 tPotato research.g2018 June, v. 61, no. 2 p.183-193dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl47412x0014-30657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-018-9367-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014800163300001600311520178900327592002802116650002502144650001802169650002502187650001702212650001202229650002202241650002002263650001802283650002402301650001302325650002402338650001902362650001902381650002402400650002102424650002902445650002602474650001802500650001302518650001702531650001502548650002202563651001002585653001602595653000802611653000902619653003602628653002802664653002402692653001802716700001902734700001502753773008802768856008302856852000902939655001202948IND60576092320221119083832.0180830e20170830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057609232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.05.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping13aDe novo assembly and analysis of the Pugionium cornutum (L.) Gaertn. transcriptome and identification of genes involved in the drought response  ap. 290-297.  aPugionium cornutum (L.) Gaertn. is a xerophytic plant species widely distributed in sandy and desert habitats in northwest China. However, the molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in P. cornutum has received little attention. At present, there is limited available transcriptome information for P. cormutum in public databases. Illumina sequencing was used to identify drought-responsive genes and to further characterize the molecular basis of drought tolerance in P. cornutum. In total, 51,385 unigenes with an average length of 825.32bp were obtained by de novo transcriptome assembly. Among these unigenes, 35,276 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms, and metabolic pathways. In addition, the results showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly involved in photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways, notably ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, which could be an alternative pathway to enhance antioxidant capacity in P. cornutum in response to drought stress. These results provide an important clue about the effects of accumulation of ROS on ascorbic acid biosynthesis in P. cornutum. In addition, we found that transcription of most genes involved in ascorbic acid metabolism was altered under drought stress. Additionally, 93 drought-inducible transcription factor genes were identified in the DEGs under drought conditions; these included DREB, AP2/EREBP, B-2a, ERF2, MYB and Zinc finger family. The results of this study provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in P. cornutum, and also identify some attractive candidate genes and valuable information for improving drought stress tolerance in other species through genetic engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression 3agene ontology 3agenetic engineering 3ahabitats 3anitrogen metabolism 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant hormones 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 3awater stress 3axerophytes 3azinc finger motif 3aChina 0aP. cornutum 0aROS 0aDEGs 0aPugionium cornutum (L.)

Layer-by-layer self-assembly of polyelectrolytes on 78 nm Ag NCs is used to control CPE–metal distance and its effect on CPE fluorescence. The highest fluorescence enhancement factor (FEF) is obtained for Ag NCs with two bilayers, corresponding to a CPE–metal spacer thickness of ∼6 nm. At the optimal excitation wavelength, the FEF is 13.8 with respect to the control silica nanoparticles (NPs). The fluorescent NPs are further used for cellular imaging studies. The CPE-loaded Ag NCs with two bilayers exhibit excellent image contrast, superior to the control of CPE–silica NP at a similar uptake efficiency. The viability test indicates low cytotoxicity of the CPE-loaded Ag NCs, rendering them as promising cell imaging agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asilver 3aviability assays 3awavelengths1 aLi, Kai1 aGurzadyan, Gagik G.1 aLu, Xianmao1 aLiu, Bin0 tLangmuir.g2012 Aug. 07, v. 28, no. 31 p.11302-11309dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla302511e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012700163520179000290592002802080650001502108650003002123650001702153650001402170650002002184650001502204650002202219650001602241650001902257650001302276651001002289653003002299653003002329653002602359653002402385653002402409700001502433700001802448773011302466856008602579852000902665655001202674IND60675617520221120073407.0200210e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067561752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Cui10aReservoir operation optimization for balancing hydropower generation and biodiversity conservation in a downstream wetland  aHydropower has a damaging effect on aquatic biodiversity globally. Extensive research has demonstrated the significance of plant diversity in sustaining wetland services and functions. However, wetland plant diversity conservation has rarely been considered in hydropower operation optimization, and the relationship between hydropower generation and plant diversity indicators has rarely been quantified. In this study, a new optimization approach is proposed for reservoir operation to balance hydropower generation and plant diversity conservation in downstream wetlands. We identify key hydrological indicators affecting wetland plant diversity, accounting for the richness and abundance of plants as well as the evenness of multiple plant species. An artificial neural network (ANN) is subsequently adopted to quantify the complex relationship between hydrological and plant diversity indicators. Using the ANN model for plant diversity prediction, we develop a multi-objective optimization model for reservoir operation to maximize hydropower generation and wetland plant diversity indicators. This approach is applied to a large plant-dominated wetland (Baiyangdian) in China as a case study. Using a genetic algorithm to solve the optimization model, we suggest a reservoir operation scheme which can increase multi-year averaged plant diversity indicator in this wetland by 20% while decreasing reservoir hydropower generation by 10%. We also generate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions from the optimization model, which quantifies the tradeoff relationship between hydropower generation and plant diversity conservation. This relationship provides a reference for managers in determining reservoir operation rules depending on the demands on these two conflicting objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiodiversity conservation 3acase studies 3ahydrology 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3awater power 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3aChina 0aHydropower sustainability 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aOptimization approach 0aReservoir operation 0aWetland restoration1 aXu, Zhihao1 aYang, Zhifeng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 245 p.118885-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001800247520153800265592002801803650001601831650001701847650001801864650002201882650002401904650002201928650001601950650001201966650002001978650001601998650001402014650000902028650002402037650002202061650001502083653001702098653003202115653001702147653001702164700001802181700001702199700001702216700002202233700001802255700001902273700002002292700001902312700001702331700002302348773011402371856008302485852000902568655001202577IND60581910320221116170300.0190415e20170912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058191032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2017.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Seungsu10aModulation of ABA Signaling by Altering VxGΦL Motif of PP2Cs in Oryza sativa  ap. 1190-1205.  aThe abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway is regulated by clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2CAs) in plants. In the presence of ABA, PP2Cs release stress/ABA-activated protein kinases by binding to ABA-bound receptors (PYL/RCARs) for activation. Although the wedging tryptophan in PP2Cs is critical in the interaction with PYL/RCARs in Arabidopsis and rice, it remains elusive as to how other interface regions are involved in the interaction. Here, we report the identification of a conserved region on PP2Cs, termed the VxGΦL motif, which modulates the interaction with PYL/RCARs through its second and fourth residues. The effects of the second and fourth residues on the interaction of OsPP2C50 with several OsPYL/RCAR proteins were investigated by systematic mutagenesis. One OsPP2C50 mutant, VFGML (“FM”) mutant, lowered the affinity to OsPYL/RCAR3 by ∼15-fold in comparison with the wild-type. Comparison of the crystal structures of wild-type OsPP2C50:ABA:OsPYL/RCAR3 with those composed of FM mutant revealed local conformational changes near the VxGΦL motif, further supported by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. In rice protoplasts, ABA signaling was altered by mutations in the VxGΦL motif. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsPP2C50 and OsPP2C50FM showed altered ABA sensitivity. Taken together, the VxGΦL motif of PP2Cs appears to modulate the affinity of PP2Cs with PYL/RCARs and thus likely to alter the ABA signaling, leading to the differential sensitivity to ABA in planta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aOryza sativa 3aabscisic acid 3acrystal structure 3agene overexpression 3amass spectrometry 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aprotein kinases 3aprotoplasts 3areceptors 3arice 3asignal transduction 3atransgenic plants 3atryptophan 0aABA receptor 0atype 2C protein phosphatase 0aVxGΦL motif 0aOryza sativa1 aMin, Myung Ki1 aLee, Su-Youn1 aIm, Ch'ae-u,1 aBhatnagar, Nikita1 aLee, Yeongmok1 aShin, Donghyuk1 aChung, Ka Young1 aLee, Sung Chul1 aKim, Beom-Gi1 aLee, S.q(Sangho),0 tMolecular plant.g2017 Sept. 12, v. 10, no. 9 p.1190-1205dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2017.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245006400212300001400276520107000290592002801360653001001388653001401398653001701412653001701429700002501446700003001471700002201501700002701523700002101550700002001571700002101591700002801612773007601640856008301716852000901799655001201808IND60555021220221123021710.0161026e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055502122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.0052doi7 aPMC43098602pmcid7 a254989662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Alwena H.12aA novel role for 12/15-lipoxygenase in regulating autophagy  ap. 40-47.  a12/15-Lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymatically generates oxidized phospholipids in monocytes and macrophages. Herein, we show that cells deficient in 12/15-LOX contain defective mitochondria and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles containing electron dense material, indicating defects in autophagy or membrane processing, However, both LC3 expression and lipidation were normal both basally and on chloroquine treatment. A LOX-derived oxidized phospholipid, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine (12-HETE-PE) was found to be a preferred substrate for yeast Atg8 lipidation, versus native PE, while both native and oxidized PE were effective substrates for LC3 lipidation. Last, phospholipidomics demonstrated altered levels of several phospholipid classes. Thus, we show that oxidized phospholipids generated by 12/15-LOX can act as substrates for key proteins required for effective autophagy and that cells deficient in this enzyme show evidence of autophagic dysfunction. The data functionally link phospholipid oxidation with autophagy for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLipid 0aAutophagy 0aLipoxygenase 0aMitochondria1 aHammond, Victoria J.1 aSakoh-Nakatogawa, Machiko1 aOhsumi, Yoshinori1 aThomas, Christopher P.1 aBlanchet, Fabien1 aPiguet, Vincent1 aKiselyov, Kirill1 aO’Donnell, Valerie B.0 tRedox Biology.g2015 Apr., v. 4 p.40-47dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012600172300002000298520137200318592002801690650001701718650001201735650002001747650001201767650001201779650002001791650000901811650001401820650001401834650001401848650003301862650001501895650002401910650000901934650001301943650001101956650001101967650000901978650001801987651001102005700002302016700002402039700002202063700002302085700001902108773014902127856008102276852000902357655001202366IND60569604020221121164836.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7450-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanović, Violeta10aStudy of silver, selenium and arsenic concentration in wild edible mushroom Macrolepiota procera, health benefit and risk  ap. 22084-22098.  aThe content and bioaccumulation of trace (Ag, Se, As) and major elements (Ca, Mg, Na and K) in wild edible mushroom Macrolepiota procera and its corresponding soil substrates, collected from five sites in the Rasina region in central Serbia, were investigated. The content of Ag, As and Se was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) while the amount of Ca, Mg, Na and K was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). The concentrations of major elements in the mushrooms were at typical levels. As far as trace elements are concerned, M. procera bioaccumulates silver although all samples were collected from unpolluted sites. It was found that the content of Ag depended on the geographical origin and the density of fruiting body on the certain site. Principal component analysis distinguished the mushroom samples from different geographical areas and revealed the influence of soil composition on metal content in fruiting bodies. Also, a linear regression correlation test was performed to investigate correlations between Ag, Cd, Se, Pb and As in caps and stipes at different geographic sites separately. In addition, our results indicated that M. procera could serve as a good dietary source of Mg, K and Se. The content of Ag and As was low, so it could not pose a health risk for consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrolepiota 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acalcium 3afruiting bodies 3alead 3amagnesium 3amushrooms 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aselenium 3asilver 3asodium 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3aSerbia1 aTrifković, Jelena1 aDjurdjić, Sladjana1 aVukojević, Vesna1 aTešić, Živoslav1 aMutić, Jelena0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.22084-22098dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7450-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01582naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009800167300001600265520062300281592002800904650001500932650002600947650002100973650001900994700001801013700001901031700001901050773012001069856008201189852000901271655001201280IND60616933820221118145010.0181021e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061693382DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517503073010122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jia-Horng10aEffect of Fiber Arrangement on the Mechanical Properties of Thermally Bonded Nonwoven Fabrics  ap. 917-920.  aAnisotropy is important to the structure and application of nonwoven fabrics.

Colonic fermentation may influence satiety and food intake. OBJECTIVE: To test the satiating properties of four isolated fibers added to chocolate crisp bars. DESIGN: Within-subject preload design with repeated measures. Each participant completed five conditions, presented in random order. SUBJECTS: Participants were 22 adult women who do not practice restrained eating (body mass index 18 to 29). INTERVENTION: The experimental conditions were four fiber treatments: 10 g oligofructose, inulin, soluble corn fiber, or resistant wheat starch in chocolate crisp bars. A no-added-fiber bar was evaluated as the control. The night before each treatment, participants consumed a dinner bar containing 10 g of the same fiber given the next morning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Repeated ratings of feelings related to hunger and fullness at the lunch meal were the main measures. Secondary outcomes included breath hydrogen and methane, gastrointestinal symptoms, energy consumed at an ad libitum lunch, and energy from 24-hour dietary recall. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Mixed-effect linear models with random intercept for participants to model within-subject correlation. RESULTS: All treatments were well tolerated. No differences were found in subjective satiety during the morning or food intake at lunch or over 24 hours. The oligofructose bar produced the greatest increase in breath hydrogen, and the most bloating and flatulence symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Functional fibers incorporated into chocolate bars at high fiber doses produce greater gastrointestinal symptoms than control, but do not alter satiety, hunger, or food intake compared with control in the short term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody mass index 3achocolate 3acorn 3adiet recall 3adinner 3aeating habits 3aenergy 3afermentation 3aflatulence 3afood intake 3afructooligosaccharides 3agastrointestinal system 3ahunger 3ahydrogen 3ainulin 3alinear models 3alunch 3amethane 3asatiety 3astatistical analysis 3awheat starch 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBreath Tests 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aEnergy Intakexdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFlatulencexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aHumans 2aHydrogenxanalysis 2aInulinxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aLinear Models 2aObesityxprevention & control 2aOligosaccharidesxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aSatiationxdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aTriticumxadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aYoung Adult 2aZea maysxadverse effectsxmetabolism.1 aClark, Michelle1 aGreaves, Kathryn A.1 aThomas, William1 aVickers, Zata1 aKuyama, Megumi1 aSlavin, Joanne0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2012 Sept., v. 112, no. 9 p.1356-1362dElsevier Inc.x2212-26727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2012.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245006600212520086600278592002801144650001801172650001801190650001601208650002801224650002401252650001201276650001501288650001501303650001301318650001301331650001301344650002101357653001201378653001601390653001001406653001701416653001201433653002001445653001301465653002001478653001001498653002201508700002001530700001701550773009001567856008701657852000901744655001201753IND60739185120221120071112.0210723e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073918512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2021.1705772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagaoka, Satoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5348-318710aPlant-derived peptides improving lipid and glucose metabolism  aPlant protein-derived peptides, focusing especially on soybean protein-derived peptides have considerable effects on metabolic regulation and modulation such as cholesterol lowering, triglyceride lowering, anti-obesity, inhibition of fatty acid synthase, and antidiabetic effects.

Some investigations describe disparate effects including immunomodulatory properties for tropisetron which may be mediated through immunophilin–calcineurin pathway. Calcineurin, a phosphatase involved in immune system signaling, modulates expression of several genes, such as Cannabinoid type one (CB₁) receptors. On the quest for its underlying mechanisms of action, this study aimed to investigate the effect of tropisetron on calcineurin activity and CB₁ receptor expression and function in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). The rat pup CGNs were used as highly calcineurin-rich and devoid of 5-HT₃ receptor neuronal cells. Calcineurin activity was assessed in CGNs treated with tropisetron or the congener granisetron at 1nM–10μM concentrations. Moreover, cannabinoid CB₁ receptor expression at mRNA and protein levels were investigated by real time PCR and western blotting, respectively and its functionality studied by measuring the secondary messenger cAMP in CGNs receiving tropisetron or granisetron. Results indicate that tropisetron, but not granisetron, significantly inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, over-expresses the CB₁ receptors at both transcriptional and protein levels, and reduces cAMP content. Our investigation shows that tropisetron targets calcineurin in a receptor-independent fashion. Tropisetron-induced CB₁ receptor up-regulation might underlie many pharmacological aspects of tropisetron unrelated to anti-emesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantagonists 3abrain 3acannabinoids 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulators 3amechanism of action 3aneurons 3apups 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areceptors 3asecond messengers 3atranscription (genetics)1 aDehpour, Ahmad Reza1 aFakhfouri, Gohar1 aKhorramizadeh, Mohammad Reza1 aGhia, Jean-Eric1 aSeyedabadi, Mohammad1 aCaldarelli, Antonio1 aMousavizadeh, Kazem1 aForouzandeh, Mehdi1 aMehr, Shahram Ejtemaei0 tBrain research.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 1417 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012100178300001600299520130700315592002801622650001301650650002301663650002901686650002301715650001501738650001201753650001201765650001301777650002501790650001901815650001601834650001101850650001401861650000801875651001501883653002901898653002401927653002001951653002801971653001501999700002502014700002302039773009902062856008502161852000902246655001202255IND60537768820221120220802.0190416e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053776882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSohel, Md Shawkat Islam10aLandscape׳s capacities to supply ecosystem services in Bangladesh: A mapping assessment for Lawachara National Park  ap. 128-135.  aLand uses/land covers (LULC) are closely related to the integrity of ecosystems and associated provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services (ES). Anthropogenic activities continuously influence ecological integrity and ES through changes in LULC. An integrative approach is essential to understand and measure the relations between ecosystem functioning, associated ES and the relative contributions of the different system components. Here, using a locally justified ES scoring matrix, we linked different LULC types to ecological integrity and ES supply in the Lawachara National Park of Bangladesh. The results were used to compile spatially explicit ES maps. Our analysis revealed relatively high capacities of mixed tropical evergreen forests to supply a broad range of ES and to support ecological integrity, followed by tea (Camellia chinesis) gardens and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. Other LULC types located on the edge or on the periphery of the park showed comparably lower ES supply capacities. Our study is the first of its type carried out in Bangladesh and can be seen as a first screening study of available ES and their supply capacities. The results can be used to form the base for ES based landscape management and future conservation priorities in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agardens 3aland use 3alandscape management 3anational parks 3aplantations 3arubber 3ascreening 3atea 3aBangladesh 0aEcosystem service matrix 0aEcosystem integrity 0aSpatial mapping 0aLawachara National Park 0aBangladesh1 aMukul, Sharif Ahmed,1 aBurkhard, Benjamin0 tEcosystem services.g2015 Apr., v. 12 p.128-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245009400180300001600274520088700290592002801177650002201205650001601227650001101243650001901254650001001273650002501283650001301308650001801321650001701339650001801356650001701374650001201391650004401403650002901447650004401476650001301520650006001533650002801593650004201621650004901663651001001712700001801722700001801740700001701758700001901775700001501794773011301809856008201922852000902004655001202013IND4471300720221119162629.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447130072DNAL7 a213532682pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bao10aPolymorphism in GHRH gene and its association with growth traits in Chinese native cattle  ap. 243-246.  aGrowth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus and stimulates growth hormone (GH) released from the pituitary. Mutations detected in GHRH gene showed associations with animal production traits. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of the GHRH gene with growth traits in Chinese native cattle. PCR-SSCP and sequencing were used to detect mutations of the GHRH gene in this study. One novel mutation 4251nt (C>T) was found and the frequencies of C allele were 0.8778 and 0.8476 for Qinchuan and Nanyang cattle, respectively. Body weight with the CT genotype was significantly higher (P<0.05 or P<0.01) than those with CC genotype for different growth periods (6, 12, 18, and 24months old) in Nanyang cattle. Our findings suggested that polymorphism in bovine GHRH might be one of the important genetic factors to influence body weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3abody weight 3acattle 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3agrowth traits 3ahypothalamus 3asomatoliberin 3asomatotropin 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Frequencyxgenetics 2aGenetic Association Studiesxveterinary 2aGenotype 2aGrowth Hormone-Releasing Hormonexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aChina1 aZhao, Gaofeng1 aLan, Xianyong1 aLei, Chuzhao1 aZhang, Chunlei1 aChen, Hong0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2012 Apr., v. 92, no. 2 p.243-246dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006700147245018200214300001800396520184000414592002802254596004002282596004102322650001902363650001602382650001902398650002002417650001502437650001202452650001302464650001102477650001702488650001702505650000902522650001702531650001002548650001202558650001802570650001202588650000902600650001002609650001102619650001202630650000902642700002402651700001902675700002302694700002102717700002302738773010602761856008102867852000902948655001202957IND60614175420221119230402.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061417542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-018-1960-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStankevičiūtė, Milda1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8906-381410aResponses of biomarkers in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) following exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of complex metal mixture (Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd). Part II  ap. 1069-1086.  aThe aim of this research was to assess interactions between metals at low exposure concentrations (Maximum-Permissible-Concentrations accepted for the inland waters in EU) and to assess possible influence of background exposure (10-times reduced concentration of a single metal) on toxicological significance of selected biomarkers in Salmo salar after treatment with metal mixture (Zn – 0.1, Cu – 0.01, Ni – 0.01, Cr – 0.01, Pb – 0.005 and Cd – 0.005 mg/L). The tissue-specific bioaccumulation, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity responses (erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities assay) in peripheral blood, kidneys, gills and liver erythrocytes of fish to metal mixtures were assessed after 14 days treatment. Treatment with primary mixture (MIX) or two variants of this mixture (Cr↓ (10 times reduced Cr⁶⁺ concentration) and Cu↓ (10 times reduced Cu²⁺ concentration)) induced the strongest responses in genotoxicity and cytotoxicity endpoints. Exposure to these mixtures highly affected Zn, Cu and Cd bioaccumulation in liver tissue. The highest amount of Ni accumulated was measured after Cd↓ treatment in all tissues. Treatments with reduced concentration of non-essential metal resulted in an increased accumulation of Pb, Ni, or Cd; treatments with reduced concentration of essential metal resulted in a reduced accumulation of certain metals (especially Cd and Pb) in tissues compared between treatments. Glucose content in blood and behavioural endpoints were evaluated after short-term exposure to metal mixtures (MIX, Cr↓, Cu↓). Significant increase in blood glucose concentration was measured after all treatments. These metal mixtures elicit significant behavioural alterations in fish. Consequently, this research revealed a significant influence of background exposure considering mixture toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data  aS-MIP-17-10cLietuvos Mokslo Taryba  aMIP-108/2015cLietuvos Mokslo Taryba 3aEuropean Union 3aSalmo salar 3aacute exposure 3abioaccumulation 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3afish 3agenotoxicity 3agills 3aglucose 3ainland waters 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3anickel 3atissues 3azinc1 aSauliutė, Gintarė1 aMakaras, Tomas1 aMarkuckas, Arvydas1 aVirbickas, Tomas1 aBaršienė, Janina0 tEcotoxicology.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 8 p.1069-1086dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1960-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245005500205300002000260520078000280592002801060653001801088653001801106653001001124653001801134653002401152700002701176700002201203700001701225700002701242700002101269773019401290856007901484852000901563655001201572IND60518027220161210000000.0160406e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051802722DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15210021122doi7 aPMC46974322pmcid7 a266445612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaible, Ralf10aConstant mortality and fertility over age in Hydra  ap. 15701-15706.  aSignificance How an organism changes with age and why the pattern of change differs across species are questions that have intrigued biologists since Aristotle. Patterns of change can be described by trajectories of birth and death rates over age. For humans and many other mammals, mortality increases and fertility declines with age among adults. For other species, however, a remarkable variety of patterns has been observed. Although roughly constant mortality and fertility trajectories have been reported for some species, the data are problematic because sample sizes are small, especially at older ages. Here, we present compelling evidence for constant mortality and reproduction of Hydra using data from careful, large-scale studies over 8 y with 2,256 individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 0anonsenescence 0abiodemography 0aaging 0ainvertebrates 0aclonal reproduction1 aScheuerlein, Alexander1 aDańko, Maciej J.1 aGampe, Jutta1 aMartńínez, Daniel E.1 aVaupel, James W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 112, no. 51 p.15701-15706dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15210021123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024004000135040001800175100002100193245013900214300001400353520165300367592002802020650001302048650001002061650001202071650000902083650001202092650001202104650003702116650004702153650004202200650000902242650002902251650000902280650002502289650002402314700001902338773008302357856008602440990002302526852000902549655001202558IND60091795420221118052806.0141103e20111012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009179542DNAL7 a218901202pmid7 aPMC31834062pmcid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabriele, Amanda10aLesions and reversible inactivation of the dorsolateral caudate-putamen impair cocaine-primed reinstatement to cocaine-seeking in rats  ap. 27-35.  aRecent evidence suggests that cocaine addiction may involve progressive drug-induced neuroplasticity of the dorsal striatum. Here, we examined the effects of a) dorsolateral caudate putamen (dlCPu) lesions on cocaine self-administration, extinction of responding, and subsequent reinstatement to cocaine-seeking, and b) reversible inactivation of the dlCPu with GABA receptor agonists (baclofen and muscimol) immediately prior to reinstatement testing. Male, Sprague–Dawley rats self-administered cocaine (0.2mg/50μl infusion, i.v.) along an FR1 schedule in daily 2h sessions for 10days, whereby lever presses resulted in cocaine infusions and presentation of a paired light-tone stimulus complex. After 14days of abstinence, animals were returned to the self-administration chamber and lever responding was recorded, but had no programmed consequences (relapse test). Animals then underwent daily extinction, followed by reinstatement tests in the presence of the conditioned cues, after a cocaine priming injection (10mg/kg), or cues+cocaine prime. Lesions of the dlCPu failed to affect responding during self-administration, extinction, relapse, or cued-induced reinstatement. However, lesioned animals showed reduced cocaine-seeking during cocaine-primed reinstatement as compared to sham controls. Furthermore, reversible inactivation of the dlCPu significantly impaired both cocaine-primed and cocaine-primed+cue-induced reinstatement. These results demonstrate the critical involvement of the dlCPu in cocaine-primed reinstatement, perhaps via chronic drug-induced changes in the interoceptive effects of cocaine that impact drug-seeking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abrain 3acocaine 3arats 3arelapse 2aAnimals 2aCaudate Nucleusxphysiopathology 2aCocaine-Related Disordersxphysiopathology 2aExtinction, Psychologicalxphysiology 2aMale 2aPutamenxphysiopathology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSelf Administration1 aSee, Ronald E.0 tBrain research.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 1417 p.27-35dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245010000216300001200316520073200328592002801060653001701088653001601105653001601121653003101137653003101168700001801199700002901217700002201246773007401268856008301342852000901425655001201434IND60555021420221119015529.0161026e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055502142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.11.0072doi7 aPMC43098492pmcid7 a254795492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Montfort, Claudia10aRedox-active cerium oxide nanoparticles protect human dermal fibroblasts from PQ-induced damage  ap. 1-5.  aRecently, it has been published that cerium (Ce) oxide nanoparticles (CNP; nanoceria) are able to downregulate tumor invasion in cancer cell lines.

Their expression, though ubiquitous in most mammalian cell types, is especially important for the proper functioning of cardiac and neuronal systems. Many existing methods for studying gap junction communication suffer from either unquantifiable data or difficulty of use. Here, we measure the extent of dye spread and effective diffusivities through gap junction connected cells using a quantitative microfluidic cell biology platform. After loading dye by hydrodynamic focusing of calcein/AM, dye transfer dynamics into neighboring, unexposed cells can be monitored via timelapse fluorescent microscopy. By using a selective microfluidic dye loading over a confluent layer of cells, we found that high expression of gap junctions in C6 cells transmits calcein across the monolayer with an effective diffusivity of 3.4 × 10⁻¹³ m²/s, which are highly coupled by Cx43. We also found that the gap junction blocker 18α-GA works poorly in the presence of serum even at high concentrations (50 µM); however, it is highly effective down to 2.5 µM in the absence of serum. Furthermore, when the drug is washed out, dye spread resumes rapidly within 1 min for all doses, indicating the drug does not affect transcriptional regulation of connexins in these Cx43+ cells, in contrast to previous studies. This integrated microfluidic platform enables the in situ monitoring of gap junction communication, yielding dynamic information about intercellular molecular transfer and pharmacological inhibition and recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aconnexins 3adiffusivity 3adrugs 3adyes 3afluorescence microscopy 3agap junctions 3ahydrodynamics 3aions 3amammals 3amonitoring 3aneurons 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLee, Luke P.0 tIntegrative biology.g2010 Mar. 5, v. 2, no. 2-3 p.130-138dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b919392h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245010400159300002000263520159700283592002801880650001501908650002301923650003301946650002901979650001502008650001602023650001002039650001302049650001402062650001502076650001402091650002302105650001902128700001802147700001802165700001502183700001502198773014902213856008102362852000902443655001202452IND60569604320221121200816.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7327-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bin10aPhotoproduction of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nutrients from resuspended lake sediments  ap. 22126-22135.  aSediments exposed to simulated solar radiation can serve as an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to surrounding waters. However, it is still unclear if dissolved nutrients can be photoproduced from lake sedimentary organic matter. In this study, a series of laboratory-based experiments was conducted to address the photoproduction of dissolved inorganic nutrients and DOC from resuspended Taihu Lake sediments. Dissolved inorganic nutrients and DOC were photoproduced after 8-h irradiation. The released NH₄ ⁺, NOₓ ⁻, and DOC levels ranged from 3.57 to 12.14, 1.43 to 6.43, and 24.17 to 69.17 μmol L⁻¹, respectively. The variation in the amount released indicated that sediment source had an effect on DOC and nutrient photorelease. More DOC and nutrients were released from higher concentration suspensions. However, due to the light absorption by suspended sediment, less DOC and nutrients were released from per gram of suspended sediment in high concentration suspensions. The decrease in DOC and increase in dissolved inorganic nitrogen during the last 2-h irradiation indicated that the photoproduction of inorganic nutrients proceeded via direct photodissolution of suspended sediments and subsequent photodegradation of the produced dissolved organic matter. Our results demonstrated that the photoproduction flux of NH₄ ⁺ and NOₓ ⁻ accounts for 12.3 and 6.5 % of wet deposition, respectively, which suggest that the photodissolution of suspended sediment could be a potential source of DOC and dissolved nutrients in shallow water ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonium compounds 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecosystems 3airradiation 3alakes 3alighting 3anutrients 3aphotolysis 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3awet deposition1 aWang, Peifang1 aZhang, Nannan1 aWang, Chao1 aAo, Yanhui0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.22126-22135dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7327-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03933naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245014900183300001600332520178000348592002802128650001402156650001402170650001402184650002102198650001202219650001302231650001202244650001602256650001002272650001702282650001002299650002602309650001202335650002302347650002402370650001302394650005202407650002802459650002802487650003502515650002402550650003502574650003702609650002402646650004702670650001102717650001102728650005202739650004002791650002702831700002102858700002102879700001502900700001602915700001602931700001802947700001302965700001702978700001602995773009903011856008103110990002303191852000903214655001203223IND60089919620221118003957.0141102e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008991962DNAL7 a233482502pmid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2013.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Jun-Min10aSaxifragifolin D induces the interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells through ROS-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress  ap. 913-926.  aBreast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among females, and novel chemotherapeutic drugs for treating breast cancer are needed urgently. Saxifragifolin D (SD) was isolated by our group from Androsace umbellata which is commonly used to treat solid tumor. In this study, we evaluated its growth inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that SD inhibited the growth of both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells significantly. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that SD induced apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Evidence of SD-induced autophagy included the occurrence of autophagic vacuoles, up-regulation of LC3-II, Beclin1 and Vps34. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 or Beclin1 siRNA pretreatment decreased the ratio of apoptosis, indicating that autophagy induction contributes to apoptosis and is required for the latter. SD was also found to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, accompanied by ROS production, increase of intracellular calcium and up-regulation of Bip, IRE1α and XBP-1s. Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress by N-acetyl-l-cysteine, tauroursodeoxycholic acid or IRE1α siRNA pretreatment could suppress both apoptosis and autophagy. Besides, increases in CHOP, calnexin, calpain, p-JNK and p-Bcl-2 were followed by subsequent dissociation of Beclin1 from Bcl-2, further suggesting endoplasmic reticulum stress to be the common signaling pathway shared by SD-induced apoptosis and autophagy. In conclusion, SD inhibits breast cancer cell growth and induces interplay between apoptosis and autophagy through ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress. It will provide molecular bases for developing SD into a drug candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrosace 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abreast neoplasms 3acalcium 3acalnexin 3acalpain 3acell growth 3adeath 3adissociation 3adrugs 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afemales 3agrowth retardation 3asignal transduction 3avacuoles 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAutophagyxdrug effects 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapy 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumorxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aEndoplasmic Reticulum Stressxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMembrane Potential, Mitochondrialxdrug effects 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSaponinsxpharmacology1 aBai, Liang-Liang1 aZhang, Dong Mei,1 aYiu, Anita1 aYin, Zhi-Qi1 aHan, Wei-Li1 aLiu, Jun-Shan1 aLi, Yong1 aFu, Deng-Yue1 aYe, Wen-Cai0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 85, no. 7 p.913-926dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.01.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012800160300002000288520105100308592002801359650004401387650002801431650001501459650002301474650001101497650002201508650001101530650001101541650001701552650004401569650002201613650003301635650002201668650002001690650003701710650000901747700002201756700002501778700002401803700001901827700001901846700001901865773012401884856007502008852000902083655001202092IND60642212820221120144527.0210813e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064221282DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10517g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHepokur, Ceylan10aNovel type ketone-substituted metallophthalocyanines: synthesis, spectral, structural, computational and anticancer studies  ap. 56296-56305.  aThis work reports on the synthesis and characterization of phthalocyanines (M = Cu(ii) (2), Zn(ii) (3) In(iii) (4) and Co(ii) (5)) peripherally tetra-substituted with 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-1-one. Confirmation of the synthesized phthalocyanine structures are performed with a combination of elemental analysis, FTIR, ¹H-NMR, ¹³C-NMR, UV-vis and MALDI-MS SEM and spectral data. Their aggregation properties were examined in THF by UV-vis. Spectral and photophysical (fluorescence quantum yield) properties of complexes (2–4) were reported in THF (tetrahydrofuran). These results suggest that the metal in the core of the phthalocyanine plays an important role in the fluorescence quantum yields ΦF of the synthesized complexes (2–4). Also, the anticancer activities of complexes were studied on MCF-7, MG63, and L929 cell lines. Finally, all synthesized phthalocyanines were investigated by quantum chemical studies. Chemical reactivity parameters such as EHOMO, ELUMO, ΔE (HOMO–LUMO energy gap) were calculated by Gaussian software.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantineoplastic activity 3acell lines 3achemical reactions 3acobalt 3acomputer software 3acopper 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantum mechanics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis 3atetrahydrofuran 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc1 aGünsel, Armağan1 aYarasir, M.

Here, in a set of experiments using an isolated eyestalk–brain preparation, we investigated whether there is a circadian input from the brain to retina that regulates this rhythm. We sought to determine whether the protocerebral bridge (PB) stimulation affects the ERG amplitude in accordance with the zeitgeber time (ZT) and whether 5-HT modulates the associate input. Our results showed that photic stimulation of retina produced changes in both the amplitude and the frequency of spontaneous electrical activity in the protocerebral neuropils. In addition, electrical stimulation of the medial protocerebrum, particularly the PB, produced statistically significant changes in the ERG that depended on both the time of day and the level of serotonin. This suggests that pathways between retina and PB seem to be serotonergic.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acrayfish 3aelectrical treatment 3aelectroretinography 3aretina 3aserotonin 2aAnimals 2aAstacoideaxphysiology 2aBrainxphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aElectroretinography 2aNeural Pathwaysxphysiology 2aNeuropilxphysiology 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aRetinaxphysiology 2aSerotoninxmetabolism1 aPrieto-Sagredo, Julio1 aFanjul de Moles, María Luisa,0 tBrain research.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 1417 p.36-44dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245012000195300001800315500002000333520137900353592002801732596028501760650001902045650003002064650000902094650001402103650002202117650002202139650002702161650002702188650002702215650001902242650001102261651001502272651001102287700002402298700002402322700003202346700002002378773012402398856007402522852000902596655001202605IND60787046720221122045312.0220807e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078704672DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.141522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalm, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9890-826510aReduced genetic diversity and low effective size in peripheral northern European catfish Silurus glanis populations  ap. 1407-1421.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUsing 10 polymorphic microsatellites and 1251 individual samples (some dating back to the early 1980s), genetic structure and effective population size in all native and introduced Swedish populations of the European wels catfish or Silurus glanis were studied. Levels of genetic variability and phylogeographic relationships were compared with data from a previous study of populations in other parts of Europe. The genetically distinct Swedish populations displayed comparably low levels of genetic variability and according to one‐sample estimates based on linkage disequilibrium and sib ship‐reconstruction, current local effective population sizes were lower than minimum levels recommended for short‐term genetic conservation. In line with a previous suggestion of postglacial colonisation from a single refugium, all Swedish populations were assembled on a common branch in a star‐shaped dendrogram together with other European populations. Two distinct subpopulations were detected in upper and lower habitats of River Emån, indicating that even minor dispersal barriers may restrict gene flow for wels in running waters. Genetic assignment of specimens encountered in the brackish Baltic Sea and in lakes where the species does not occur naturally indicated presence of long‐distance sea dispersal and confirmed unauthorised translocations, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data  cS.P. was financed by the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS; Grant No. 215‐2010‐1235).

However, the classical shrinking unreacted core model (CSUC model) is only applicable to spherical particles. Currently, the CSUC model has been used in many studies regardless of its applicable conditions. For example, Wang et al. (2016) investigated the decomposition kinetics of a rod-like residue and deduced the rate-controlling step using the CSUC model. The purpose of this comment is to propose a modified shrinking unreacted core model (shrinking cylinder model) suitable for materials with a high aspect ratio. The authors hope that this work will be helpful for kinetic analysis of rod-shaped and fiber-shaped materials in the uncatalyzed liquid/gas-solid reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3afly ash 3akinetics 3aliquids 3amodels 3aparticle size 3areaction kinetics 0aUncatalyzed liquid/gas-solid reaction 0aShrinking unreacted core model 0aShrinking cylinder model 0aAspect ratio1 aWu, Yinghong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 401 p.123818-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1238183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012600174520106700300592002801367650002901395650001501424650001701439650001001456650001401466650001301480650001001493650000901503650001601512650000901528650001501537650002101552650001801573650002201591650001801613650002101631653002301652653001301675653001401688653001901702653002901721653001301750700005701763700002001820700002001840700002201860700001601882773010801898856008602006852000902092655001202101IND60687334320221118231225.0200419e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068733432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1162052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakei, Moemi Naito10aDetection and isolation of low molecular weight alginate- and laminaran-susceptible gut indigenous bacteria from ICR mice  aAlginate and laminaran are the main water-soluble polysaccharides in edible brown algae such as arame Eisenia bicyclis. To determine the alginate- and/or laminaran-susceptible indigenous bacteria (SIB) in the gut, the caecal microbiomes of ICR mice fed a diet containing 2% low molecular weight (LMW ≒50 kDa) alginate or laminaran were analysed by 16S rRNA gene (V4) amplicon sequencing. At the phylum level abundances, compared to those in mice fed a no-fibre diet, Firmicutes was lower and Bacteroidetes was higher in both LMW alginate- or laminaran-fed mouse groups. At the operational taxonomic unit level, Bacteroides acidifaciens- and Bacteroides intestinalis-like bacteria were considered alginate- and laminaran-SIB, respectively.

Among the many types of GFs and cytokines, epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor could be specifically used for stimulating molecules in wound healing as well as for recovery of damaged skin tissues. It is speculated that delivered GFs could stimulate various cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, deposition of extracellular matrix molecules, and remodeling of collagen synthesis. Although the physiological wound healing process is complex, engineering strategies for proper delivery of multiple therapeutic GFs could enhance the quality and quantity of regenerated skin tissues. As compared to single delivery of a GF, recent studies have proven that any combination of multiple GFs and/or therapeutic chemical factors synergistically facilitates the regeneration of damaged skin tissues. In order to maximize the stability, bioactivity, intrinsic therapeutic functionality, and efficiency of internal delivery of cargo GFs, it is essential to utilize tissueengineered biomaterials and related composites as implantable platforms. Successful fabrication and development of skin tissue engineering applications as well as subsequent surgical implantation of these platforms might provide clinical treatment for superior skin regeneration. Therefore, the present review summarizes the biological functions, related signaling mechanisms, and recent developments of tissue engineering applications for multiple GF delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatible materials 3acollagen 3acytokines 3aepidermal growth factor 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblast growth factors 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3atissues 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aKim, Kyobum0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2017 Nov., v. 22, no. 6 p.659-670dThe Korean Society for Biotechnology and BioengineeringwJournal:J000001239x1226-83727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-017-0436-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01252naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245007600150300001800226520021300244592002800457650002300485650002700508650002300535650001800558650001400576700001400590700001700604700001300621700001700634700001700651700001800668773013400686856007300820852000900893655001200902IND60658570220221118110553.0190826e20100316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065857022DNAL7 a10.1039/b922256a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Min10aNoncrystalline NiPB nanotubes for hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene  ap. 2268-2270.  aHigh quality noncrystalline NiPB nanotubes were synthesized and exhibited high efficiency for the catalytic hydrogenation of p-chloronitrobenzene due to the characteristic confinement effect of the nanotubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical compounds 3ahydrogenation 3ananotubes1 aHan, Ling1 aLv, Jiangang1 aZhu, Yan1 aPeng, Luming1 aGuo, Xuefeng1 aDing, Weiping0 tChemical communications.g2010 Mar. 16, v. 46, no. 13 p.2268-2270dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b922256a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014600174300001600320520130800336592002801644650002601672650002201698650001701720650001501737650001701752650003201769650001901801650001501820650002401835650000701859650001401866650001101880700003601891700001701927700003201944773010701976856008702083852000902170655001202179IND60087666220221119181408.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008766622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez, Karel10aHydrolysis of triacetin catalyzed by immobilized lipases: Effect of the immobilization protocol and experimental conditions on diacetin yield  ap. 510-517.  aThe effect of the immobilization protocol and some experimental conditions (pH value and presence of acetonitrile) on the regioselective hydrolysis of triacetin to diacetin catalyzed by lipases has been studied. Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) and lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (RML) were immobilized on Sepabeads (commercial available macroporous acrylic supports) activated with glutaraldehyde (covalent immobilization) or octadecyl groups (adsorption via interfacial activation). All the biocatalysts accumulated diacetin. Covalently immobilized RML was more active towards rac-methyl mandelate than the adsorbed RML. However, this covalent RML preparation presented the lowest activity towards triacetin. For this reason, this preparation was discarded as biocatalyst for this reaction. At pH 7, acyl migration occurred giving a mixture of 1,2 and 1,3 diacetin, but at pH 5.5, only 1,2 diacetin was produced. Yields were improved at acidic pH values and in the presence of 20% acetonitrile (to over 95%). RML immobilized on octadecyl Sepabeads was proposed as optimal preparation, mainly due to its higher specific activity. Each enzyme preparation presented very different properties. Moreover, changes in the reaction conditions affected the various immobilized enzymes in a different way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aRhizomucor miehei 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorption 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrolysis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3atriacetin 3ayields1 aGarcía-Verdugo, E.q(Eduardo),1 aPorcar, Raul1 aFernandez-Lafuente, Roberto0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 May 6, v. 48, no. 6-7 p.510-517dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01389naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009200158300001800250520037700268592002800645650001500673650002800688650002700716650002300743650001400766650001500780650000900795700002000804700002500824773013200849856007300981852000901054655001201063IND60658570320221118110645.0190826e20100203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065857032DNAL7 a10.1039/b922257j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolden, Mark A.10aIn situ crystal growth of nanoporous zincophosphate observed by atomic force microscopy  ap. 1047-1049.  aWe present the first in situ observations of the growth of a zeotype using atomic force microscopy.

However, the role of Tai in crustacean innate immunity is less known. In this study, four Tai isoforms (MnTai-A, MnTai-B, MnTai-C, and MnTai-D) produced by alternative splicing were identified from Macrobrachium nipponense. The obtained genome sequences indicated that MnTai DNA has more than 20 exons and 19 introns. The second to last (-exon2) and the third to last (-exon3) exons can be alternatively spliced. The loss of -exon2 or -exon3 produces MnTai-B or MnTai-C, respectively. Both exons are absent in MnTai-D. The full-length cDNA of MnTai-A (including all exons) was 6894 bp with an open reading frame of 4998 bp that encoded a protein of 1665 amino acids. MnTaiA contains the conservative structure of the Tai family and clustered with nuclear receptor coactivator from shrimp. All these four isoforms were widely distributed in a variety of tissues with the highest expression level in the hepatopancreas except MnTaiC. The transcriptional levels of total Tai genes (designated as MnTaiT) in the hepatopancreas and gills were regulated by bacterial or viral challenge. Knockdown of MnTaiT increased the expression of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) during Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. Further study indicated that the negative regulation of AMP gene expression by prawn Tai was mediated through its positive regulation of cactus. Our research provides valuable information that prawn Tai isoforms are involved in innate immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobrachium nipponense 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acacti and succulents 3aecdysterone 3aexons 3afish 3agene expression 3ahepatopancreas 3ainnate immunity 3ainsulin 3aintrons 3ajuvenile hormones 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTaiman 0aAlternative splicing 0aCactus1 aMa, Futong1 aZhang, Ruidong1 aDai, Xiaoling1 aRen, Qian0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 Oct., v. 105 p.152-163dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001600260520155700276592002801833650002701861650001901888650001601907650002501923650001501948650001501963650002501978700001702003700001702020700001402037700001702051700001802068700001902086773017502105856008202280852000902362655001202371IND60590385920221118142803.0180619e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059038592DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-017-0378-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Taeyoung10aAssessment of organic removal in series- and parallel-connected microbial fuel cell stacks  ap. 739-747.  aMicrobial fuel cells (MFCs) degrade organic contaminants in wastewater while simultaneously producing electricity, but must be stacked to yield adequate voltage and current. This study examined the evolution of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate and efficiency in two identical individual MFCs (i-MFCs) in series- and parallel-connected stacks (sc- and pc-MFCs, respectively) under batch and continuous operation. The stack voltage and current increased in the respective series and parallel connections of the two i-MFCs (MFC unit 1 and MFC unit 2). Voltage reversal was observed in the sc- MFC below an external load of 100 Ω. Regardless of occurrence of the voltage reversal, organic reduction between i-MFCs and sc-MFCs showed no significant difference (gap of < 9% and < 6% in COD removal rate and efficiency, respectively); additionally, organic removals between the two individual MFCs in series indicated differences less than 9% of COD removal rate and 5% of COD removal efficiency in batch mode. Continuous operation also yielded similar organic removals as the MFCs in individual and series connection (voltage reversal occurred) mode, even over 8 days operation. Parallel connection yielded identical organic removals and currents in the two individual MFCs of the pc-MFC, even though the two separate i-MFCs showed different organic removal rates and current productions. This study provides the guide for the application of stacked MFCs for power source and efficient organic pollutant removal in wastewater treatment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apollutants 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aKang, Sukwon1 aKim, HyunWoo1 aPaek, Yee1 aSung, JeHoon1 aKim, YoungHwa1 aJang, JaeKyung0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2017 Nov., v. 22, no. 6 p.739-747dThe Korean Society for Biotechnology and BioengineeringwJournal:J000001239x1226-83727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-017-0378-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245019000181300001600371520129200387592002801679650002301707650002901730650001201759650001701771650001201788650001901800650001401819650001801833650002101851650002501872650001601897650001201913650001101925650001301936700001801949700002001967700002001987700002202007700002802029700002002057773010702077856008702184852000902271655001202280IND60087666320221119181307.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008766632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca Martel, César,14aThe glucose/xylose facilitator Gxf1 from Candida intermedia expressed in a xylose-fermenting industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae increases xylose uptake in SSCF of wheat straw  ap. 518-525.  aEthanolic fermentation of lignocellulose raw materials requires industrial xylose-fermenting strains capable of complete and efficient d-xylose consumption. A central question in xylose fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered for xylose fermentation is to improve the xylose uptake. In the current study, the glucose/xylose facilitator Gxf1 from Candida intermedia, was expressed in three different xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strains of industrial origin. The in vivo effect on aerobic xylose growth and the initial xylose uptake rate were assessed. The expression of Gxf1 resulted in enhanced aerobic xylose growth only for the TMB3400 based strain. It displayed more than a 2-fold higher affinity for d-xylose than the parental strain and approximately 2-fold higher initial specific growth rate at 4g/L d-xylose. Enhanced xylose consumption was furthermore observed when the GXF1-strain was assessed in simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of pretreated wheat straw. However, the ethanol yield remained unchanged due to increased by-product formation. Metabolic flux analysis suggested that the expression of the Gxf1 transporter had shifted the control of xylose catabolism from transport to the NAD⁺ dependent oxidation of xylitol to xylulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida intermedia 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aethanol 3afermentation 3aglucose 3alignocellulose 3aoxidation 3araw materials 3asaccharification 3aspecific growth rate 3awheat straw 3axylitol 3axylose 3axylulose1 aOlofsson, Kim1 aFerreira, Carla1 aRunquist, David1 aFonseca, Luís L.1 aHahn-Hägerdal, Bärbel1 aLidén, Gunnar,0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 May 6, v. 48, no. 6-7 p.518-525dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300001600249520066100265592002800926650003700954650001100991650001301002650002401015650001901039650002801058650002101086700002001107700001401127700002001141773013001161856007401291852000901365655001201374IND60626911620221123021736.0190128e20190103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062691162DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc07665k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xuemei10aBlack and white anatase, rutile and mixed forms: band-edges and photocatalytic activity  ap. 533-536.  aHere we investigate the band-level energetics of “black” hydrogenated titania in different polymorphs using in situ photoelectrochemical measurements and XPS valence band measurements.

The Boland–Ridley–Lauret (BRL) model consists of a single set of parameters for all global locations. There is scope to improve the BRL model to better match local climatic conditions. In this research, the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system is considered to develop a set of adjusted BRL models for Australian conditions. Ground-based and satellite-based irradiation data derived from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology are used to tune and test new BRL models developed at a national level and for each climate zone. Irradiation data are processed through a rigorous quality control procedure before parameter tuning. For ground-based data, a new national model results in an improvement in 96% of statistical indicators over the original BRL model while Köppen-Geiger zone adjusted models show improvement over the new national model in 72% of the statistics. For satellite-based global irradiation estimates, a new national BRL model also results in observed improvements, however, no discernible improvement is observed for Köppen-Geiger zone models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate classification 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatic zones 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3amathematical models 3ameteorology 3aquality control 3arenewable energy sources 3asatellites 3astatistics 0aKöppen-Geiger climate classification 0aBRL model 0aDiffuse irradiation 0aData quality control 0aStatistical indicators 0aPerformance assessment1 aLi, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8485-22161 aDorrell, David G.0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Mar., v. 147 p.2453-2469dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008300171300001600254520085200270592002801122650001201150650002101162650001501183650001501198650001501213650001601228650002401244650002101268650000701289700002301296700002101319700002101340773010701361856008701468852000901555655001201564IND60087666420221119181501.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008766642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Min-Tian10apH-uncontrolled lactic acid fermentation with activated carbon as an adsorbent  ap. 526-530.  aIn this paper, we presented a novel process involving activated carbon (AC) as an adsorbent for lactic acid fermentation, separation and oligomerization. It was found that pH has a significant effect on the adsorption of lactic acid on AC. The use of AC for in situ removal of lactic acid successfully decreased the inhibitory effect of lactic acid, resulting in significant increases in both productivity and yield. Acetone was used to desorb lactic acid and it was confirmed that the acetone treatment did not decrease the optical purity of the lactic acid, i.e., the optical purity was as high as 99.5% after desorption. Due to the presence of little materials influencing lactic acid oligomerization, oligomers with an optical purity of above 96% and a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 2400 were obtained in the oligomerization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3alactic acid 3alactic fermentation 3amolecular weight 3apH1 aShimamura, Takashi1 aIshida, Nobuhiro1 aTakahashi, Haruo0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 May 6, v. 48, no. 6-7 p.526-530dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01910naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009400169300001600263520088200279592002801161650002201189650001001211650002501221650001401246650001801260650000901278650002101287650001601308700002201324700002001346773011601366856008101482852000901563655001201572IND60083198620221119233223.0141101e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008319862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2013.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChepkova, Aisa N.10aAlterations of corticostriatal plasticity by ammonium and rescue by green tea polyphenols  ap. 176-182.  aHyperammonemia is a major pathophysiological factor in encephalopathies associated with acute and chronic liver failure.

Ammonium chloride exposure enhanced the expression of HFS-induced LTP at the expense of LTD and promoted the generation of NMDA-induced LTD. This treatment did not affect two NMDAR-independent forms of plasticity: taurine-induced LTP and histamine-induced LTD.

Meanwhile, NaMgH₃ possesses an outstanding theoretical thermal storage density of 2881 kJ/kg, which makes it one of the most promising thermal energy storage materials. However, the sluggish dehydrogenation kinetics of NaMgH₃ embarrasses further practical application. Doping a nanosize Ti-based catalyst is treated to be one of the most effective methods to settle the poor dehydriding kinetics. In this work, different kinds of TiO₂ catalysts, the 5 wt % TiO₂ microparticle (MP) (100 nm), TiO₂ nanoparticle (NP) (5–10 nm), and TiO₂ nanotube (NT) (5–10 nm), were doped into NaMgH₃ in the process of ball milling and heat treatment, which in situ formed Na₀.₄₆TiO₂ significantly promoting the full hydrogen desorption kinetics of NaMgH₃. Among all samples, the TiO₂ NT-doped sample shows the best performance of which the onset decomposition temperature is reduced to 300 °C, and the first- and second-step decomposition peak temperatures are decreased to 346.3 and 355.8 °C, respectively. The TiO₂ NT-doped sample desorbs approximately 3.4 wt % H₂ at 350 °C within 10 min, while the pure NaMgH₃ sample releases only 0.2 wt % H₂ in 10 min. The significant improvement in both two decomposition reactions kinetics of NaMgH₃ can be attributed to the tubular morphology of the TiO₂ NT and the in situ formation of multivalence Ti species (Na₀.₄₆TiO₂). These two reasons can change the kinetic models of NaMgH₃ from A2 to R2 and further dramatically decrease the activation energies of first- and second-step decomposition reactions of NaMgH₃ to 91.7 and 142.1 kJ/mol, respectively. In particular, the in situ formed Na₀.₄₆TiO₂ can benefit the e– transfers among Na⁺, Mg²⁺, and H–, tremendously enhancing dehydrogenation properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3adesorption 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3akinetics 3amagnesium 3amicroparticles 3amilling 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3asodium 3atemperature 3athermal energy 3atitanium dioxide1 aQin, Haiying1 aXiao, Xuezhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4035-50441 aChen, Man1 aLiu, Meijia1 aJiang, Ruicheng1 aChen, Lixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9624-918X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 28, v. 123, no. 37 p.22832-22841dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b066883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012000172300001600292520131700308592002801625650001101653650002301664650001501687650002201702650002201724650001301746650001801759650001701777650001601794650001601810651001101826653002901837653002401866653003101890653001801921653003101939700002201970700002201992700001802014773009902032856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60539009320221119211915.0190416e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053900932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaczorowska, Anna10aEcosystem services in urban land use planning: Integration challenges in complex urban settings—Case of Stockholm  ap. 204-212.  aThe concept of urban ecosystem services (ES) is currently promoted in Sweden in the planning for more compact and sustainable cities. This study looks into how the implementation of the urban ES concept in Stockholm is understood by different urban professionals, based on semi-structured interviews and a stakeholder workshop. Although recognizing the usefulness of the ES concept, the professionals identified many remaining challenges linked to integrating the concept into land use planning. These are analyzed in relation to the gap between ES science and ES policy and structured according to the different types of planning uncertainties they represent. One issue that was persistently highlighted by stakeholders was that the promotion of urban ES – regardless of how beneficial it may be – will add further complexity to already strained workloads among planners, policy-makers and urban managers. Also, the political demand for increasing density in the urban areas of Stockholm seems to create a growing need for urban ES. Urban densification can thus potentially promote the interest in planning with ES as a vital parameter for urban qualities. They expressed a need for long term perspectives in planning with new tools and methods for valuing ES, supported through “high profile” projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aecosystem services 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland use planning 3apolitics 3aprofessionals 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3aurban areas 3aSweden 0aUrban ecosystem services 0aIntegrated planning 0aUrban ecosystem management 0aUncertainties 0aUrban green infrastructure1 aKain, Jaan-Henrik1 aKronenberg, Jakub1 aHaase, Dagmar0 tEcosystem services.g2016 Dec., v. 22 p.204-212dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245016000210300001600370506007600386520136300462592002801825506003701853650001801890650001001908650002401918650002001942650000901962650000901971650001501980650003101995650001202026650001702038650001202055700002202067700002402089700002502113700002702138700002502165700002102190773011202211856008102323852000902404655001202413IND60575640520221207095815.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057564052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-016-9995-82doi7 aPMC53502382pmcid7 a278388982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoman, Andrei Yu.10aGeneration of mouse lines with conditionally or constitutively inactivated Snca gene and Rosa26-stop-lacZ reporter located in cis on the mouse chromosome 6  ap. 301-307.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aα-Synuclein is involved in many important molecular processes in neuronal cells and their synapses, and its malfunction has been linked to the development of Parkinson’s and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. Animal models allowing tightly monitored conditional inactivation of the encoding gene, Snca, are indispensible for studies aimed at understanding normal function of α-synuclein in various neuronal populations and its role in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. We have recently reported the production of several novel mouse lines for manipulating expression of the endogenous Snca gene, including a line for Cre-recombinase-driven conditional inactivation of the gene (mice with floxed Snca) and a new line with a constitutive knockout of α-synuclein. Rosa26-stop-lacZ reporter cassette is commonly used for monitoring efficiency of Cre-recombination but in mouse genome Snca and Rosa26 loci are located on the same chromosome. Here we describe production of lines with a modified Snca locus, either floxed or constitutively inactivated and the Rosa26-stop-lacZ reporter cassette located in cis on the mouse chromosome 6. These new mouse lines are invaluable for fast identification of cells with inactivation of Snca by Cre-recombination and represent useful tools for in vivo studies of α-synuclein function and dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ain vivo studies 3aloci 3amice 3amonitoring 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3asynapse1 aLimorenko, Galina1 aUstyugov, Alexey A.1 aTarasova, Tatiana V.1 aLysikova, Ekaterina A.1 aBuchman, Vladimir L.1 aNinkina, Natalia0 tTransgenic research.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.301-307dSpringer International Publishingx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-016-9995-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01473naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245007600156300001800232520030500250592002800555650002700583650002300610650001400633650000900647650002100656650000900677650001200686650001500698650001900713650001300732650001300745700001900758700001800777700001600795700001900811700001800830773013400848856007200982852000901054655001201063IND60658570720221118110555.0190817e20100323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065857072DNAL7 a10.1039/b922305c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu Lim, Chang10aDetection of mercury in fish organs with a two-photon fluorescent probe  ap. 2388-2390.  aWe report a two-photon fluorescent probe (AHg1) that can be excited by 780 nm femto-second pulses, shows high photostability and negligible toxicity, and can visualize the site of Hg²⁺ accumulation, but can also estimate trace amounts of mercury ions in fresh fish organs by two-photon microscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3adetection 3afish 3afluorescent dyes 3aions 3amercury 3amicroscopy 3aphotostability 3araw fish 3atoxicity1 aWon Kang, Dong1 aShun Tian, Yu1 aHee Han, Ji1 aLim Hwang, Hye1 aRae Cho, Bong0 tChemical communications.g2010 Mar. 23, v. 46, no. 14 p.2388-2390dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b922305c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006500171520215900236592002802395650002002423650001902443650002002462650002002482650001502502650002402517650002302541650001202564650001602576650001302592650001502605651001102620653002402631653002502655653003702680653002802717653002402745700002602769700002702795700001802822700001802840700002902858700002202887700003102909773009502940856008703035852000903122655001203131IND60682937520221118061916.0200318e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068293752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1142372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Songchao10aModel averaging for mapping topsoil organic carbon in France  aThe soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is the largest terrestrial carbon (C) pool and is two to three times larger than the C stored in vegetation and the atmosphere. SOC is a crucial component within the C cycle, and an accurate baseline of SOC is required, especially for biogeochemical and earth system modelling. This baseline will allow better monitoring of SOC dynamics due to land use change and climate change. However, current estimates of SOC stock and its spatial distribution have large uncertainties. In this study, we test whether we can improve the accuracy of the three existing SOC maps of France obtained at national (IGCS), continental (LUCAS), and global (SoilGrids) scales using statistical model averaging approaches. Soil data from the French Soil Monitoring Network (RMQS) were used to calibrate and evaluate five model averaging approaches, i.e., Granger-Ramanathan, Bias-corrected Variance Weighted (BC-VW), Bayesian Modelling Averaging, Cubist and Residual-based Cubist. Cross-validation showed that with a calibration size larger than 100 observations, the five model averaging approaches performed better than individual SOC maps. The BC-VW approach performed best and is recommended for model averaging. Our results show that 200 calibration observations were an acceptable calibration strategy for model averaging in France, showing that a fairly small number of spatially stratified observations (sampling density of 1 sample per 2500 km²) provides sufficient calibration data. We also tested the use of model averaging in data-poor situations by reproducing national SOC maps using various sized subsets of the IGCS dataset for model calibration. The results show that model averaging always performs better than the national SOC map. However, the Modelling Efficiency dropped substantially when the national SOC map was excluded in model averaging. This indicates the necessity of including a national SOC map for model averaging, even if produced with a small dataset (i.e., 200 samples). This study provides a reference for data-poor countries to improve national SOC maps using existing continental and global SOC maps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aland use change 3amonitoring 3asoil organic carbon 3astatistical models 3atopsoil 3auncertainty 3avariance 3avegetation 3aFrance 0aSoil organic carbon 0aDigital soil mapping 0aBias-corrected Variance Weighted 0aSample size requirement 0aData-poor countries1 aMulder, Vera Leatitia1 aHeuvelink, Gerard B.M.1 aPoggio, Laura1 aCaubet, Manon1 aRomán Dobarco, Mercedes1 aWalter, Christian1 aArrouays, D.q(Dominique),0 tGeoderma.g2020 May 01, v. 366 p.114237-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.1142373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245010000179300001400279520162200293592002801915596005301943650002401996650002302020650001302043650001102056650001402067650001802081650002002099650002202119650001902141650002302160650001502183650001302198650002402211650002002235650002502255650000902280651001702289653002002306653001902326653001502345653002402360700001602384700002302400700002002423700002202443773010702465856008602572852000902658655001202667IND60539009520221119211854.0200430e20160718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053900952DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2016.11864992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabuschagne, Christiaan10aGenetic monitoring of ex situ African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) populations in South Africa  ap. 83-90.  aThe African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) has suffered population declines and is listed in the IUCN Red List as Endangered. The species is endemic to the coast of southern Africa, and breeding colonies are distributed on the south-western coast of Africa. Currently, African Penguins are being kept in zoo and aquarium facilities throughout South Africa. In this study, molecular genetic data based on 12 microsatellite markers from 1 119 African Penguin samples from four facilities were generated in order to determine the level of genetic variation, population structure and differentiation, and effective population size to assist in the development of an effective captive management plan. Expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.57 to 0.62, and allelic richness from 4.2 to 5.1. However, based on differences between first- and second-generation captive birds, we conclude that the ex situ population is at risk of losing genetic variability in the future and management programmes should include exchange of birds between captive facilities in order to induce gene flow and increase effective population size. Adding individuals from in situ populations should also be considered in the future in cases where these birds cannot be rehabilitated. Molecular genetic analyses of wild penguin populations should be carried out for comparison, and to ascertain to what degree ‘in situ genetic diversity’ is represented among ex situ populations. With regular resampling and analyses, the extent of the effect of processes such as genetic drift on diversity in the ex situ penguin populations will become evident.  aPublisher supplied data  a79732cNational Research Foundation South Africa 3aSpheniscus demersus 3aat-risk population 3abreeding 3acoasts 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aindigenous species 3amonitoring 3apenguins 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3azoos 3aSouth Africa 0aAfrican Penguin 0amicrosatellite 0amonitoring 0aSpheniscus demersus1 aNupen, Lisa1 aKotzé, Antoinette1 aGrobler, J Paul1 aDalton, Desiré L0 tAfrican zoology.g2016 July 18, v. 51, no. 2 p.83-90dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2016.11864993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013800175300001600313520152300329592002801852650002601880650001101906650002101917650001301938650002701951650001701978650001501995650001402010650001902024650002502043650001502068650001302083700002102096700001902117700001702136700002402153700002402177700002502201700002202226700002302248773010702271856008702378852000902465655001202474IND60087666820221119181303.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008766682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, Scott R.10aFabrication of macroporous chitosan scaffolds doped with carbon nanotubes and their characterization in microbial fuel cell operation  ap. 458-465.  aChitosan (CHIT) scaffolds doped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were fabricated and evaluated for their utility as a microbial fuel cell (MFC) anodic material. High resolution microscopy verified the ability of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to directly colonize CHIT–CNT scaffolds. Cross-linking agents 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC), glutaraldehyde and glyoxal were independently studied for their ability to strengthen the CHIT–CNT matrix without disrupting the final pore structure. 2.5vol% glyoxal was found to be the optimal cross-linker in terms of porosity (BET surface area=30.2m²g⁻¹) and structural stability. Glyoxyl and EDC cross-linked CHIT–CNT scaffolds were then studied for their ability to transfer electrons to underlying glassy carbon. Results showed an open circuit cell voltage of 600mV and a maximum power density of 4.75W/m³ at a current density of 16A/m³ was achieved in non stirred batch mode, which compares well with published data using carbon felt electrodes where a power density of 3.5W/m³ at a current density of 7A/m³ have been reported. Additionally, CHIT–CNT scaffolds were impregnated into carbon felt electrodes and these results suggest that CHIT–CNT scaffolds can be successfully integrated with multiple support materials to create hybrid electrode materials. Further, preliminary tests indicate that the integrated scaffolds offer a robust macroporous electrode material that can be used in flow-through configurations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShewanella oneidensis 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitosan 3across-linking reagents 3acrosslinking 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3aglutaraldehyde 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amicroscopy 3aporosity1 aFoerster, Daniel1 aCheung, Andrea1 aLau, Carolin1 aBretschger, Orianna1 aMinteer, Shelley D.1 aNealson, Kenneth H.,1 aAtanassov, Plamen1 aCooney, Michael J.0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 May 6, v. 48, no. 6-7 p.458-465dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01572naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009800160300001600258520048300274592002800757650002300785650002600808650001800834650001400852650002000866700002200886700002800908700003700936700002000973700002700993773013101020856007401151852000901225655001201234IND60626912020221120132946.0190128e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062691202DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc07709f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButova, Vera V.10aWater as a structure-driving agent between the UiO-66 and MIL-140A metal–organic frameworks  ap. 901-904.  aWe report a careful investigation of a selective phase formation in the zirconium–terephthalic acid system during solvothermal synthesis, which could result in the UiO-66 (Zr₆O₆(OH)₄(BDC)₆) or MIL-140A (ZrO(BDC)) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).

In this paper, a fuzzy two-stage chance-constrained stochastic programming (FTSCCP) model is proposed for the optimization of regional incremental ecological service value through adjustments to the original water diversions and ecological water supplement schemes for ecosystem restoration under different management requirements and scenarios. The proposed method can effectively address uncertainties such as fuzzy parameters, probability distributions, and random variables in optimizing processes simultaneously. The results reveal that, under the requirement of meeting the original plan, a decrease in restoration scale would mainly appear under low-flow scenarios, and for the other scenarios, the original plan would be fully realized with an increase in flood utilization and a decrease in normal water supplementation. For the requirement of maximizing the incremental ecological service value, the adjustments would mainly be increases in water supplementation for reed wetlands and marsh wetlands and decreases in water surface area, including fish ponds and crab ponds. The ecological service values would be 11,256.79 million CNY (Chinese Yuan), 16,465.11 million CNY and 17,639.59 million CNY under low-, normal- and high-flow scenarios, respectively, with increases of 3.2%, 6.9% and 14.5% compared to the values based on the requirement of meeting the original plan. The results would be helpful for guiding regional ecosystem restoration and water resource management in the western Jilin Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrabs 3aecological restoration 3aecosystem services 3afish ponds 3amarshes 3amodels 3aprobability distribution 3arivers 3asurface area 3auncertainty 3awater management 3aChina1 aMeng, Chong 1 aWang, Xian’en 1 aLi, Yu 0 tWater.g2019 Jan. 02, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110100683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010300159300002000262520158700282592002801869650004401897650002201941650002401963650001301987650002002000650002102020650001502041650001902056650002102075650001302096650001402109700001602123700001702139700002102156700001502177773012502192856007502317852000902392655001202401IND60781732620221121031055.0220701e20220621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078173262DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02693g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhiyong10aThiourea modified low molecular polyamide as a novel room temperature curing agent for epoxy resin  ap. 18215-18223.  aA thiourea modified low molecular weight polyamide (TLMPA) as a room temperature curing agent was synthesized by a two-step method. Firstly, a low molecular weight polyamide curing agent (LMPA) with low viscosity and high amine value was synthesized by amidation of sebacic acid with tetraethylenepentamine, then the synthesized curing agent was modified with thiourea to increase its reactivity at room temperature. The optimal reaction conditions were studied by L₉(3³) orthogonal experiments. The structure of the prepared curing agent was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The kinetics of TLMPA curing of E-51 epoxy resin was analyzed using the Kissinger method with non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The activation energy of TLMPA/E-51 calculated by the Kissinger method and FWO method was 38.79 kJ mol⁻¹ and 42.73 kJ mol⁻¹. The nano-SiO₂ filler was compounded with E-51 epoxy resin, TLMPA, allyl glycidyl ether diluent, and KH-560 coupling agent to prepare the room temperature curing epoxy resin (EP) system. L₉(3⁴) orthogonal experiments were carried out to study the effect of various factors on the mechanical properties of the cured resin systems. The best formulation of the system is that the content of nano-SiO₂, curing agent, diluent, and coupling agent is 3, 35, 15, 1 wt%, respectively. With the optimal formulation, the tensile and shear strength, tensile strength, impact strength, and bending strength of the cured EP system was 13.19 MPa, 53.8 MPa, 52.16 kJ m⁻², and 94.95 MPa, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aambient temperature 3aepoxides 3aimpact strength 3amolecular weight 3apolyamides 3ashear strength 3atensile strength 3athiourea 3aviscosity1 aZhu, Huixin1 aJin, Guofeng1 aHuang, Yuanzheng1 aGao, Minna0 tRSC advances.g2022 June 21, v. 12, no. 28 p.18215-18223dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02693g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011800170300001600288520183600304592002802140650002102168650002302189650001302212650001102225650002002236650001102256650001402267650002502281650001302306650001102319700002102330700001802351773010702369856008702476852000902563655001202572IND60087667120221119181341.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008766712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Chris10aWhole-cell bio-oxidation of n-dodecane using the alkane hydroxylase system of P. putida GPo1 expressed in E. coli  ap. 480-486.  aThe alkane-1-monoxygenase (alkB) complex of Pseudomonas putida GPo1 has been extensively studied in the past and shown to be capable of oxidising aliphatic C₅–C₁₂ alkanes to primary alcohols both in the wild-type organism by growth on C₅–C₁₂ alkanes as sole carbon source and in vitro. Despite this, successful n-dodecane oxidation for the production of 1-dodecanol or dodecanoic acid has proven elusive in the past when using alkB-expressing recombinants. This article demonstrates, for the first time in vivo, by using the Escherichia coli GEC137 pGEc47ΔJ strain, that n-dodecane oxidation using this enzyme for the production of primary alcohols and carboxylic acids is feasible and in fact potentially more promising than n-octane oxidation due to lower product and substrate toxicity. Yields are reported of 1-dodecanol of up to 2g/Lₒᵣgₐₙᵢc and dodecanoic acid up to 19.7g/Lₒᵣgₐₙᵢc in a 2L stirred tank reactor with 1L aqueous phase and 200mL of n-dodecane as a second phase. The maximum volumetric rate of combined alcohol and acid production achieved was 1.9g/Lₒᵣgₐₙᵢc/h (0.35g/Lₜₒₜₐₗ/h). The maximum specific activity of combined alcohol and acid production was 7-fold lower on n-dodecane (3.5μmol/min/gdcw) than on n-octane (21μmol/min/gdcw); similar to the 5-fold difference observed between wild-type growth rates using the two respective alkanes as sole carbon source. Despite this, both total volumetric rate and final yield exceeded n-octane oxidation by 3.5-fold under the same conditions, due to the lower toxicity of n-dodecane and its oxidation products to E. coli compared to the 8-carbon equivalents. Substrate access limitations and the overoxidation of 1-dodecanol to dodecanoic acid were identified as the most important limitations to be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3aalcohols 3acarbon 3adodecanoic acid 3aoctane 3aoxidation 3aprimary productivity 3atoxicity 3ayields1 aWoodley, John M.1 aBaganz, Frank0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 May 6, v. 48, no. 6-7 p.480-486dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2011.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002100186245008200207300001300289506007600302520057600378592002800954506003700982650001301019650001901032650002201051650001701073650002401090650002201114650002801136650002601164650003601190650001301226700001801239700002101257700001201278700002301290700001701313700002101330700002201351700001501373773010601388856007901494852000901573655001201582IND50066867520221207080920.0141214e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006686752DNAL7 a233209582pmid7 aPMC40538042pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2013-14-1-r22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreangen, Todd J10aMetAMOS: a modular and open source metagenomic assembly and analysis pipeline  ap. 3043.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe MetAMOS, an open source and modular metagenomic assembly and analysis pipeline.

Perhaps the most well-studied flavonoids are the anthocyanins that have human health benefits and help plants attract pollinators, regulate hormone production, and confer resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. The canonical biochemical pathway responsible for the production of these pigments is well-characterized for flowering plants yet its conservation across deep divergences in land plants remains debated and poorly understood. Many early land plants such as mosses, liverworts, and ferns produce flavonoid pigments, but their biosynthetic origins and homologies to the anthocyanin pathway remain uncertain. We conducted phylogenetic analyses using full genome sequences representing nearly all major green plant lineages to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway then test the hypothesis that genes in this pathway are present in early land plants. We found that the entire pathway was not intact until the most recent common ancestor of seed plants and that orthologs of many downstream enzymes are absent from seedless plants including mosses, liverworts, and ferns. Our results also highlight the utility of phylogenetic inference, as compared to pairwise sequence similarity, in orthology assessment within large gene families that have complex duplication-loss histories. We suggest that the production of red-violet flavonoid pigments widespread in seedless plants, including the 3-deoxyanthocyanins, requires the activity of novel, as-yet discovered enzymes, and represents convergent evolution of red-violet coloration across land plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngiospermae 3aabiotic stress 3aancestry 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic stress 3aconvergent evolution 3aembryophytes 3aferns and fern allies 3agenes 3amosses and liverworts 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence homology 3astress response 0aPhylogenomics 0aPlant pigments 0aAnthocyanin biosynthetic pathway 0aFlavonoids1 aImwattana, Karn1 aTripp, Erin A.1 aWeston, David J.1 aHealey, Adam1 aSchmutz, Jeremy1 aShaw, A.

Although comparatively low in selenium content, the brain exhibits high priority for selenium supply and retention under conditions of dietary selenium deficiency. Liver-derived Sepp1 is the major transport protein in plasma to supply the brain with selenium, serving as a “survival factor” for neurons in culture. Sepp1 expression has also been detected within the brain. Presumably, astrocytes secrete Sepp1, which is subsequently taken up by neurons via the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Knock-out of Sepp1 or ApoER2 as well as neuron-specific ablation of selenoprotein biosynthesis results in neurological dysfunction in mice. Astrocytes, generally less vulnerable to oxidative stress than neurons, are capable of up-regulating the expression of antioxidant selenoproteins upon brain injury. Occurrence of neurological disorders has been reported occasionally in patients with inadequate nutritional selenium supply or a mutation in the gene encoding selenocysteine synthase, one of the enzymes involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis. In three large trials carried out among elderly persons, a low selenium status was associated with faster decline in cognitive functions and poor performance in tests assessing coordination and motor speed. Future research is required to better understand the role of selenium and selenoproteins in brain diseases including hepatic encephalopathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapolipoprotein E 3aastrocytes 3abiosynthesis 3ablood proteins 3abrain 3acognition 3aelderly 3aencephalopathy 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3amutation 3aneurons 3anutrient deficiencies 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apeople 3aperoxidases 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3aselenoproteins 3atesting 3atransport proteins1 aSies, Helmut0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2013 Aug. 15, v. 536, no. 2 p.152-157dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2013.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016000166300001600326520160700342592002801949650000801977650002401985650001502009650001002024650001702034650002402051650003002075650001202105650001102117650001302128650003002141650001502171650001002186650001202196650001502208650002302223650001102246700001802257700002102275700002202296700002402318700002202342700002102364700002602385700001802411773011202429856008102541852000902622655001202631IND60575641020221123001505.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057564102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-016-0004-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurome, Mayuko10aDirect introduction of gene constructs into the pronucleus-like structure of cloned embryos: a new strategy for the generation of genetically modified pigs  ap. 309-318.  aDue to a rising demand of porcine models with complex genetic modifications for biomedical research, the approaches for their generation need to be adapted. In this study we describe the direct introduction of a gene construct into the pronucleus (PN)-like structure of cloned embryos as a novel strategy for the generation of genetically modified pigs, termed “nuclear injection”. To evaluate the reliability of this new strategy, the developmental ability of embryos in vitro and in vivo as well as the integration and expression efficiency of a transgene carrying green fluorescence protein (GFP) were examined. Eighty percent of the cloned pig embryos (633/787) exhibited a PN-like structure, which met the prerequisite to technically perform the new method. GFP fluorescence was observed in about half of the total blastocysts (21/40, 52.5%), which was comparable to classical zygote PN injection (28/41, 68.3%). In total, 478 cloned embryos injected with the GFP construct were transferred into 4 recipients and from one recipient 4 fetuses (day 68) were collected. In one of the fetuses which showed normal development, the integration of the transgene was confirmed by PCR in different tissues and organs from all three primary germ layers and placenta. The integration pattern of the transgene was mosaic (48 out of 84 single-cell colonies established from a kidney were positive for GFP DNA by PCR). Direct GFP fluorescence was observed macro- and microscopically in the fetus. Our novel strategy could be useful particularly for the generation of pigs with complex genetic modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomedical research 3ablastocyst 3afetus 3afluorescence 3agenetic engineering 3agreen fluorescent protein 3akidneys 3amodels 3aplacenta 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apronucleus 3aswine 3atissues 3atransgenes 3atransgenic animals 3azygote1 aLeuchs, Simon1 aKessler, Barbara1 aKemter, Elisabeth1 aJemiller, Eva-Maria1 aFoerster, Beatrix1 aKlymiuk, Nikolai1 aZakhartchenko, Valeri1 aWolf, Eckhard0 tTransgenic research.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.309-318dSpringer International Publishingx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-016-0004-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010300165520108600268592002801354650003401382650001501416650002401431650001201455650001201467650001101479650002501490650003001515650001501545650001701560650001301577650002101590650001701611650001901628650001201647650002001659653001201679653001601691653001101707653002401718653002401742653003001766700001301796700001201809700001501821700005401836773010601890856008701996852000902083655001202092IND60670375320221116152721.0200913e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067037532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1221632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhen10aSynergistic removal of tylosin/sulfamethoxazole and copper by nano-hydroxyapatite modified biochar  aAntibiotics and heavy metals are frequently detected simultaneously in aquatic environment.

Six nHAP@biochars were prepared with different feedstock and nHAP and biomass ratios. The influences of feedstock and nHAP and biomass ratios, interaction of TYL/SMX and Cu(II) and thermodynamic study were investigated. The adsorption quantities on nHAP@biochars prepared by wood-processing residues were higher than by Chinese medicine residues. The adsorption amounts of TYL decreased with the addition of Cu(II), while the adsorption quantities of SMX increased. The adsorptions of Cu(II) were promoted by TYL and changed slightly with the increasing of SMX. Specific surface area and pore size were two of the main factors influencing the adsorption capacities of nHAP@biochars. According to density functional theory, nHAP@biochar-TYL-Cu and nHAP@biochar-Cu-SMX were more existed in the systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aadsorption 3aaquatic environment 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3adensity functional theory 3afeedstocks 3aheavy metals 3aporosity 3asulfamethoxazole 3asurface area 3athermodynamics 3atylosin 3awood processing 0aBiochar 0aAntibiotics 0aCopper 0aSynergistic removal 0aNano-hydroxyapatite 0aDensity functional theory1 aLi, Miao1 aChe, Qi1 aLi, Yandan1 aLiu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0617-55440 tBioresource technology.g2019 Dec., v. 294 p.122163-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1221633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009900169300001000268520148700278592002801765596004501793596009401838596003301932650001401965650001301979650003401992650002702026650001002053650003502063650002802098650001602126650001502142650001802157650002302175650001202198650002102210650002002231650001702251700002602268700002402294700001802318700002002336700001902356700002002375700001802395700002002413700002302433700002302456700005902479773014302538856008302681852000902764655001202773IND60760931620221118043146.0220225e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076093162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-021-04070-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabbrizio, Paola10aContingent intramuscular boosting of P2XR7 axis improves motor function in transgenic ALS mice  ap. 7.  aAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive degeneration of motor neurons and severe muscle atrophy without effective treatment. Most research on the disease has been focused on studying motor neurons and supporting cells of the central nervous system. Strikingly, the recent observations have suggested that morpho-functional alterations in skeletal muscle precede motor neuron degeneration, bolstering the interest in studying muscle tissue as a potential target for the delivery of therapies. We previously showed that the systemic administration of the P2XR7 agonist, 2′(3′)-O‐(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5-triphosphate (BzATP), enhanced the metabolism and promoted the myogenesis of new fibres in the skeletal muscles of SOD1G93A mice. Here we further corroborated this evidence showing that intramuscular administration of BzATP improved the motor performance of ALS mice by enhancing satellite cells and the muscle pro-regenerative activity of infiltrating macrophages. The preservation of the skeletal muscle retrogradely propagated along with the motor unit, suggesting that backward signalling from the muscle could impinge on motor neuron death. In addition to providing the basis for a suitable adjunct multisystem therapeutic approach in ALS, these data point out that the muscle should be at the centre of ALS research as a target tissue to address novel therapies in combination with those oriented to the CNS.  aPublisher supplied data  aSG-2018-12366226cMinistero della Salute  aPG_8/2020 MacrophalscFondazione Italiana di Ricerca per la Sclerosi Laterale Amiotrofica  a2015-0023cRegione Lombardia 3aadenosine 3aagonists 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3acentral nervous system 3adeath 3agenetically modified organisms 3aintramuscular injection 3amacrophages 3ametabolism 3amotor neurons 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics1 aD’Agostino, Jessica1 aMargotta, Cassandra1 aMella, Giulia1 aPanini, Nicolò1 aPasetto, Laura1 aSammali, Eliana1 aRaggi, Flavia1 aSorarù, Gianni1 aBonetto, Valentina1 aBendotti, Caterina1 aNardo, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1803-14840 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2022 Jan., v. 79, no. 1 p.7-7dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-021-04070-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03927naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010100173520227200274592002802546650001702574650001602591650001102607650001302618650003002631650001702661650001402678650001902692650001402711650002102725653001202746653001802758653002002776653001702796653003702813653001702850653001102867653001202878700002102890700002502911700002402936700001802960700001302978700002102991700001903012700002203031700002203053700002703075700002103102700002103123773012403144856008403268852000903352655001203361IND60701390520221121024546.0200809e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070139052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2020.1069052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWepfer, Patricia H.10aEvolutionary biogeography of the reef-building coral genus Galaxea across the Indo-Pacific ocean  aStony corals (Scleractinia) form the basis for some of the most diverse ecosytems on Earth, but we have much to learn about their evolutionary history and systematic relationships. In order to improve our understanding of species in corals we here investigated phylogenetic relationships between morphologically defined species and genetic lineages in the genus Galaxea (Euphyllidae) using a combined phylogenomic and phylogeographic approach. Previous studies revealed the nominal species G. fascicularis included three genetically well-differentiated lineages (L, S & L+) in the western Pacific, but their distribution and relationship to other species in the genus was unknown. Based on genomic (RAD-seq) and mitochondrial sequence data (non-coding region between cytb and ND2) we investigated whether the morphological taxa represent genetically coherent entities and what is the phylogenetic relationship and spatial distribution of the three lineages of G. fascicularis throughout the observed species range. Using the RAD-seq data, we find that the genus Galaxea is monophyletic and contains three distinct clades: an Indo-Pacific, a Pacific, and a small clade restricted to the Chagos Archipelago. The three lineages of G. fascicularis were associated with different RAD-seq clades, with the ‘L’ lineage showing some morphological distinction from the other two lineages (larger more asymmetrical polyps). In addition to these, three more genetic lineages in G. fascicularis may be distinguished – a Chagossian, an Ogasawaran, and one from the Indian-Red Sea. Among nominal taxa for which we have multiple samples, G. horrescens was the only monophyletic species. The mitochondrial non-coding region is highly conserved apart of the length polymorphism used to define L, S & L+ lineages and lacks the power to distinguish morphological and genetic groups resolved with genomic RAD-sequencing. The polyphyletic nature of most species warrants a careful examination of the accepted taxonomy of this group with voucher collections and their comparison to type specimens to resolve species boundaries. Further insight to the speciation process in corals will require international cooperation for the sharing of specimens to facilitate scientific discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScleractinia 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3agenomics 3ainternational cooperation 3amitochondria 3amonophyly 3aphylogeography 3apolyphyly 3atype collections 0aRAD-seq 0aPhylogenetics 0aCryptic species 0aBiogeography 0aMitochondrial haplotype analysis 0aIndo-Pacific 0aChagos 0aGalaxea1 aNakajima, Yuichi1 aSutthacheep, Makamas1 aRadice, Veronica Z.1 aRichards, Zoe1 aAng, Put1 aTerraneo, Tullia1 aSudek, Mareike1 aFujimura, Atsushi1 aToonen, Robert J.1 aMikheyev, Alexander S.1 aEconomo, Evan P.1 aMitarai, Satoshi0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2020 Oct., v. 151 p.106905-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.1069053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010800165300001600273520136200289592002801651650002801679650002001707650001301727650001301740650001701753650001001770650004301780650001901823650002101842650001101863650001201874650001001886650001801896650000901914650001301923650003801936650003701974650001302011653001302024653002502037653002302062653003302085700001702118700001502135700001702150700001702167700001502184700001602199700001602215700001902231700001702250700001802267700001902285700001402304773013502318856008702453852000902540655001202549IND60683515820221121035519.0210121e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068351582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.2222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bo10aChitosan mediated solid lipid nanoparticles for enhanced liver delivery of zedoary turmeric oil in vivo  ap. 108-115.  aZedoary turmeric oil (ZTO) has a strong antitumor activity. However, its volatility, insolubility, low bioavailability, and difficulty of medication owing to oily liquid limit its clinical applications. Solid lipid nanoparticles can provide hydrophobic environment to dissolve hydrophobic drug and solidify the oily active composition to decrease the volatility and facilitate the medication. Chitosan has been widely used in pharmaceutics in recent years and coating with chitosan further enhances the internalization of particles by cells due to charge attract. Here, Chitosan (CS)-coated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) loaded with ZTO was prepared and characterized using dynamic laser scanner (DLS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The uptake and distribution of drug were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The average sizes of ZTO-SLN and CS-ZTO-SLN were 134.3 ± 3.42 nm and 210.7 ± 4.59 nm, respectively. CS coating inverted the surface charge of particles from −8.93 ± 1.92 mV to +9.12 ± 2.03 mV. The liver accumulation of CS-ZTO-SLN was higher than ZTO-SLN (chitosan-uncoated particles) by analysis of tissue homogenate using HPLC, and the bioavailability of ZTO was also obviously improved. The results suggested that SLN coated with CS improved the features of ZTO formulation and efficiently deliver drug to the liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3acoatings 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3alipids 3aliquids 3aliver 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3ascanners 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aturmeric 0aChitosan 0aZedoary turmeric oil 0aLipid nanoparticle 0aLiver targeting accumulation1 aJiang, Jiaqi1 aJiang, Lei1 aZheng, Peiyu1 aWang, Fuling1 aZhou, Yang1 aChen, Zhong1 aLi, Minghui1 aLian, Mingming1 aTang, Shukun1 aLiu, Xiaoying1 aPeng, Haisheng1 aWang, Qun0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.108-115dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.01.2223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012400172300001800296520121600314592002801530650001901558650001201577650001401589650002301603650001301626650001501639650001101654650002201665650001501687650001701702650001001719650001301729653001901742653002401761653002601785653003001811653003101841653002001872700001701892700001801909700002701927700001601954773007901970856008902049852000902138655001202147IND60531490120221120083949.0170719e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053149012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.10.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yong-He10aArsenic uptake, arsenite efflux and plant growth in hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata: Role of arsenic-resistant bacteria  ap. 1937-1942.  aBacteria-mediated arsenic (As) transformation and their impacts on As and P uptake and plant growth in As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata (PV) were investigated under sterile condition. All As-resistant bacteria (9 endophytic and 6 rhizospheric) were As-reducers except one As-oxidizer. After growing two months in media with 37.5 mg kg−1 AsV, As concentrations in the fronds and roots were 3655–5389 (89–91% AsIII) and 971–1467 mg kg−1 (41–73% AsIII), corresponding to 22–52% decrease in the As in the media. Bacterial inoculation enhanced As and P uptake by up to 47 and 69%, and PV growth by 20–74%, which may be related to elevated As and P in plants (r = 0.88–0.97, p < 0.05). Though AsV was supplied, 95% of the As in the bacteria-free media was AsIII, suggesting efficient efflux of AsIII by PV roots (120 µg g−1 root fw). This was supported by the fact that no AsV was detected in media inoculated with As-reducers while 95% of AsV was detected with As-oxidizer. Our data showed that, under As-stress, PV reduced As toxicity by efficient AsIII efflux into media and AsIII translocation to the fronds, and bacteria benefited PV growth probably via enhanced As and P uptake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteris vittata 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3aaseptic conditions 3abacteria 3aendophytes 3afronds 3ahyperaccumulators 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aroots 3atoxicity 0aPteris vittata 0aEndophytic bacteria 0aRhizospheric bacteria 0aArsenic reducing bacteria 0aArsenic oxidizing bacteria 0aArsenite efflux1 aFu, Jing-Wei1 aChen, Yanshan1 aRathinasabapathi, Bala1 aMa, Lena Q.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Feb., v. 144 p.1937-1942dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.10.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015200170300001600322520163600338592002801974650002002002650002002022650002102042650001302063650002602076650001802102650001802120650001002138650002402148650003502172650001302207650003302220650002102253650001802274650001502292650000902307650001802316650001302334650002202347650002002369650001302389650001002402700001902412773011202431856008102543852000902624655001202633IND60575641220221123013325.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057564122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11248-016-9992-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Monica A.10aProteome rebalancing in transgenic Camelina occurs within the enlarged proteome induced by β-carotene accumulation and storage protein suppression  ap. 171-186.  aOilseed crops are global commodities for their oil and protein seed content. We have engineered the oilseed Camelina sativa to exhibit increased protein content with a slight decrease in oil content. The introduction of a phytoene synthase gene with an RNAi cassette directed to suppress the storage protein 2S albumin resulted in seeds with an 11–24 % elevation in overall protein. The phytoene synthase cassette alone produced enhanced β-carotene content of an average 275 ± 6.10 μg/g dry seed and an overall altered seed composition of 11 % less protein and comparable nontransgenic amounts of both oil and carbohydrates. Stacking an RNAi to suppress the major 2S storage protein resulted in seeds that contain elevated protein and slight decrease in oil and carbohydrate amounts showing that Camelina rebalances its proteome within an enlarged protein content genotype. In both β-carotene enhanced seeds with/without RNAi2S suppression, the seed size was noticeably enlarged compared to nontransgenic counterpart seeds. Metabolic analysis of maturing seeds indicate that the enhanced β-carotene trait had the larger effect than the RNAi2S suppression on the seed metabolome. The use of a GRAS (generally regarded as safe) β-carotene as a visual marker in a floral dip transformation system, such as Camelina, might eliminate the need for costly regulatory and controversial antibiotic resistance markers. β-carotene enhanced RNAi2S suppressed Camelina seeds could be further developed as a rapid heterologous protein production platform in a nonfood crop leveraging its enlarged protein content and visual marker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelina sativa 3aGRAS substances 3aRNA interference 3aalbumins 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-carotene 3acarbohydrates 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenotype 3aheterologous gene expression 3aindustrial crops 3alipid content 3ametabolome 3aoils 3aoilseed crops 3aoilseeds 3aphytoene synthase 3aprotein content 3aproteome 3aseeds1 aPendarvis, Ken0 tTransgenic research.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.171-186dSpringer International Publishingx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-016-9992-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012700210300001000337506007600347520185600423592002802279506003702307650001102344650001102355650001202366650001302378650002002391650002802411650002002439650001802459650003402477650001702511650001402528650001802542650001802560650001202578650001902590650000902609650002402618650001702642700001902659700002102678773010702699856008202806852000902888655001202897IND60590387220221207140546.0181228e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059038722DNAL7 a10.1186/s12263-018-0593-72doi7 aPMC58192602pmcid7 a294840312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerritt, David C.10aFTO genotype, dietary protein intake, and body weight in a multiethnic population of young adults: a cross-sectional study  ap. 4.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Variation in the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) has been associated with susceptibility to obesity, but the association appears to be modified by diet. We investigated whether dietary protein intake modifies the association between FTO variant rs1558902 and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in young adults (n = 1491) from the cross-sectional Toronto Nutrigenomics and Health Study. RESULTS: Lifestyle, genetic, anthropometric, and biochemical data were collected and diet was assessed using a Toronto-modified Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire. General linear models stratified by ethnicity and adjusted for age, sex, and total energy intake were used to examine the association between FTO genotypes and measures of body weight, and whether protein intake modified any of the associations. East Asians who were homozygous for the rs1558902 risk allele (A) had a greater BMI (p = 0.004) and waist circumference (p = 0.03) than T allele carriers. This association was not observed in individuals of Caucasian or South Asian ancestry. Among East Asians, a significant FTO-protein interaction was observed for BMI (p = 0.01) and waist circumference (p = 0.007). Those with low protein intake (≤ 18% total energy intake) who were homozygous for the rs1558902 risk allele (A) had significantly higher BMI (p < 0.0001) and waist circumference (p = 0.0006) compared to carriers of the T allele. These associations were absent in the high protein intake group (> 18% total energy intake). Compared to Caucasians and South Asians, East Asians consumed a significantly higher ratio of animal-to-plant protein (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that high dietary protein intake may protect against the effects of risk variants in the FTO gene on BMI and waist circumference.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsians 3aWhites 3aalleles 3aancestry 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahomozygosity 3alifestyle 3alinear models 3anutrigenomics 3aobesity 3aprotein intake 3arisk 3awaist circumference 3ayoung adults1 aJamnik, Joseph1 aEl-Sohemy, Ahmed0 tGenes & nutrition.g2018 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.4-4dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001235x1555-89327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12263-018-0593-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013500167300001600302520159800318592002801916650002101944650001901965650001801984650001902002650001702021650002002038650001302058650000902071650001402080700002002094700002102114700002702135700002202162700002002184773011602204856008102320852000902401655001202410IND60083199620221119233452.0141101e20130815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008319962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2013.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlansola, Marta10aImpaired release of corticosterone from adrenals contributes to impairment of circadian rhythms of activity in hyperammonemic rats  ap. 164-170.  aPatients with liver cirrhosis may present impaired sleep-wake and circadian rhythms, relative adrenal insufficiency and altered hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal gland (HPA) axis. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Circadian rhythms are modulated by corticosteroids which secretion is regulated by HPA axis. Hyperammonemia alters circadian rhythms of activity and corticosterone in rats. The aims were: (1) assessing whether corticosterone alterations are responsible for altered circadian rhythm in hyperammonemia: (2) to shed light on the mechanism by which corticosterone circadian rhythm is altered in hyperammonemia. The effects of daily corticosterone injection at ZT10 on circadian rhythms of activity, plasma corticosterone, adreno-corticotropic hormone (ACTH) and hypothalamic corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH) were assessed in control and hyperammonemic rats. ACTH-induced corticosterone release was analyzed in cultured adrenal cells. Corticosterone injection restores the corticosterone peak in hyperammonemic rats and their activity and circadian rhythm. Plasma ACTH and CRH in hypothalamus are increased in hyperammonemic rats. Corticosterone injection normalizes ACTH. Chronic hyperammonemia impairs adrenal function, reduces corticosterone content and ACTH-induced corticosterone release in adrenals, leading to reduced feedback modulation of HPA axis by corticosterone which contributes to impair circadian rhythms of activity.

In the Last Glacial Maximum (Late Pleistocene), the beaver disappeared from most of the Western Palaearctic, only surviving in a few relic areas including the south-eastern Alpine Chain as shown by new data. After the subsequent extended repopulation in the warmer phases of the Lateglacial and in the early Holocene, the species once again disappeared locally from several countries, including Italy, between the 17th and the 20th centuries. Direct or indirect persecution by humans seems to be the main cause of beaver extinction in Europe. In Low Medieval Italy, it is more likely that the disappearance of the beaver between the 16th and 17th centuries was due to habitat alteration and human population pressure. Numerous reclamations have been carried out since the late Middle Ages, mostly in the easternmost area of the Po Valley, the last beaver refuge in Italy. Eurasian beaver was common in the northern and widespread in the central part of Italy, but always absent in southern Italy, probably due to unfavourable hydrological conditions of watercourses in the latter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastor fiber 3aHolocene epoch 3aMiocene epoch 3aPalearctic region 3aPleistocene epoch 3aanthropogenic activities 3aextinction 3ahabitat destruction 3ahuman population 3ahydrology 3apopulation pressure 3aItaly 0aHolocene 0aLate Pleistocene 0apalaeobiogeography1 aMasseti, Marco1 aSilvestri, Letizia0 tMammalia.g2020 Mar. 26, v. 84, no. 3 p.259-277dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mammalia-2018-01593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007600162300001600238500001900254520164700273592002801920650002401948650002001972650001201992650001002004650003102014650001402045650002002059650001302079650001602092650000902108653001702117653002602134653002302160700002902183700002502212700002402237773011202261856007802373852000902451655001202460IND60727923220210525000000.0210304e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072792322DNAL7 a10.2478/frp-2020-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamszel, Marta10aFungi associated with Armillaria spp. rhizomorphs on Populus tremula L.  ap. 115-122.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe economic significance of aspen Populus tremula l. is only marginal, which is the main reason for its low share in the structure of stands. however, aspen can play a decisive ecological role as a pioneer tree in the succession of forest communities and may decrease the occurrence of pathogenic fungi. Aspen is also dying out and in order to determine possible biotic causes, we examined taxa of fungi using classical and molecular methods in the area of the Czerwony Dwór Forest District, Subdistrict Rogale, compartments 74b and 75j. The health of aspen trees and the quantitative and qualitative structure of microorganisms associated with Armillaria spp. was evaluated. Based on our health assessment of the aspen, we conclude that the main reason for its dying out is the intensification of root rot, which is a result of Armillaria spp weakening the trees. In the general pool of Armillaria-associated microorganisms, saprotrophs were dominating, and the fungus Fomitopsis pinicola commonly inhabited the poplar stems, whereas pathogen antagonists comprised the lowest proportion. In the quantitative and qualitative structure of fungi found in rhizomorphs, the composition of ecological groups inhabiting stumps was found to be favourable nevertheless. The increasing frequency of pathogens on the logs is a major premise for removing trees affected by Armillaria, because aspen stumps are a good food base for A. cepistipes and A. ostoyae which ultimately spread within the stand. Treatment of stumps with preparations stimulating the decomposition of wood is not recommended for logs that form the food base for pathogenic fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFomitopsis pinicola 3aPopulus tremula 3aforests 3afungi 3ahealth effects assessments 3apathogens 3apioneer species 3aroot rot 3asaprotrophs 3awood 0aCommon aspen 0aArmillaria cepistipes 0aArmillaria ostoyae1 aPrzemieniecki, Sebastian1 aDyczewska, Katarzyna1 aMastalerz, Jędrzej0 tLeśne prace badawcze.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 81, no. 3 p.115-122dSciendowJournal:J000000075x2082-89267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/frp-2020-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245017300213300001600386520192000402592002802322650001602350650001402366650002402380650001102404650001302415650001302428650000902441650002502450650001402475650002402489650002102513650001102534650001702545650001302562651001202575700002502587700002002612700002202632700002102654773013002675856008102805852000902886655001202895IND60630338220221119132800.0190207e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-018-0838-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCianciotto, Anthony C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7039-830710aModifying mosquito impoundment management to enhance nursery habitat value for juvenile common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis) and Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus)  ap. 403-416.  aCoastal wetlands function as nurseries for juveniles of many fishes, including common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) and Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus). Thousands of hectares of mangrove habitat in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida (USA) have been impounded for mosquito control, limiting connectivity and potentially decreasing nursery habitat value. Many impoundments are managed to provide connectivity through culverts to the IRL from October through April (non-breeding season for mosquitos), with the impoundments isolated and filled with water to control mosquito breeding from May through September. To determine whether seasonality of impoundment-estuary connectivity affected nursery habitat value, we conducted a quantitative assessment of the emigration of juvenile snook and tarpon from Bee Gum Point, a mosquito impoundment in the IRL. A total of 305 snook and 103 tarpon were captured within the impoundment and marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Pairs of tag-detecting antennas were established at culverts in two basins within the impoundment and monitored for 2 years. Only four tagged snook, and no tagged tarpon, were physically recaptured, while nearly 71% of the tagged snook and 77% of the tagged tarpon were detected at least once by antennas on the inside of the impoundment. Antennas on the outside of the culverts detected only 18 snook and eight tarpon emigrating through the culverts during 418 days of two open seasons. When culverts were experimentally opened for a total of 21 days in three periods during two summers, both snook (n = 49) and tarpon (n = 22) emigrated at far higher rates that they did during the normal open season. This significant increase in emigration indicates the importance of managing habitat connectivity to correspond to natural seasonal emigration patterns to increase the productivity of these fish nurseries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropomus 3aCulicidae 3aMegalops atlanticus 3abasins 3abreeding 3aculverts 3afish 3ahabitat connectivity 3ajuveniles 3amangrove ecosystems 3amosquito control 3asummer 3atransponders 3awetlands 3aFlorida1 aShenker, Jonathan M.1 aAdams, Aaron J.1 aRennert, Jacob J.1 aHeuberger, David0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2019 Feb., v. 102, no. 2 p.403-416dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0838-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245005300175500001900228520123600247592002801483650001601511650001501527650002501542650003001567650001701597650001901614650001601633650000901649650001601658650001701674653001301691653000801704700001901712700002001731700002401751700001801775773011801793856008601911852000901997655001202006IND60710770020221119100145.0201230e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071077002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1113292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAseperi, Adeniyi K.10aBehaviour of neonicotinoids in contrasting soils  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNeonicotinoids are widely used to control insect pests in agriculture. Their presence in the environment can affect the health of non-target insects and aquatic animals. The behaviour of four neonicotinoids, namely imidacloprid, acetamiprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam, has been investigated in soils with contrasting characteristics to understand their migration in soil and ecological risk. Among the study neonicotinoids, thiamethoxam and thiacloprid were found to be the least and most sorbed neonicotinoids by all the soils, respectively (up to 186 time greater adsorption of thiacloprid), and their uptake was affected by the content of organic matter in the soil. Leaching studies in columns confirmed that thiamethoxam leached out of the soils readily, pointing out to a relatively high risk of ground water contamination with possible ecological impact when thiamethoxam is used in soils with low organic matter. In soil column studies, the soil with the lowest organic matter presents the greatest residue of neonicotinoids in the sub-surface (≤5 cm). In contrast the soil richer in organic matter presented most of the contamination deeper down in the column; a factor to be considered in the remediation from soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetamiprid 3aadsorption 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater contamination 3aimidacloprid 3aorganic matter 3aremediation 3arisk 3athiacloprid 3athiamethoxam 0aLC-MS/MS 0aBee1 aBusquets, Rosa1 aHooda, Peter S.1 aCheung, Philip C.W.1 aBarker, James0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 276 p.111329-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1113293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245015400210300001400364520112500378592002801503650001601531650002501547650002501572650001601597650001201613650002301625650002001648650001601668653002101684653001801705653002201723653001401745653002301759653002501782700002501807700001701832700001901849700002701868773011001895856008602005852000902091655001202100IND60639455620221123031803.0190712e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanovic, Marija1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1452-016512aA cross-cultural perspective on impact of health and nutrition claims, country-of-origin and eco-label on consumer choice of new aquaculture products  ap. 36-47.  aOver the last decade, an increasing number of new value-added aquaculture products made their way onto the European market, as a response to growing demand for healthier diet, and more sustainable and locally produced protein sources. The importance of these drivers of consumer choice for aquaculture products' acceptance paves the way for a relevant reorientation of the European aquaculture industry towards a more consumer-centred approach. This research uses discrete choice experiments to examine the effect of health and nutrition claims, country-of-origin (COO), and eco-labels on consumer choice of new aquaculture products in a cross-cultural context. Three products with different preserving methods have been chosen for the study: fresh (chilled), canned, and smoked product. Results indicate that COO label “produced in own country” together with ASC eco-label function better than the health and nutrition claims as driver of choice. Results further point to the existence of different segments of “nutrition conscious”, “ethnocentric”, “price conscious”, and “eco-conscious” consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3aconsumer preferences 3aecolabeling 3amarkets 3anutrition labeling 3aprotein sources 3avalue added 0aNutrition claims 0aHealth claims 0aCountry-of-origin 0aEco-label 0aChoice experiments 0aAquaculture products1 aReinders, Machiel J.1 aClaret, Anna1 aGuerrero, Luis1 aKrystallis, Athanasios0 tFood research international.g2019 Sept., v. 123 p.36-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013100197300001600328500002000344520155300364592002801917596006101945596006102006596006902067596007302136596006702209596007302276596007302349596005202422650002502474650001802499650001202517650001702529650001102546650001602557650001102573650001302584650001102597650001502608650001302623650001602636650001902652650001102671650002302682700005702705700005402762700006802816700005802884773012002942856007303062852000903135655001203144IND60749894920221119064853.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074989492DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.175692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusoms, Silvia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9917-711810aAdaptation to coastal soils through pleiotropic boosting of ion and stress hormone concentrations in wild Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 208-220.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLocal adaptation in coastal areas is driven chiefly by tolerance to salinity stress. To survive high salinity, plants have evolved mechanisms to specifically tolerate sodium. However, the pathways that mediate adaptive changes in these conditions reach well beyond Na⁺. Here we perform a high‐resolution genetic, ionomic, and functional study of the natural variation in Molybdenum transporter 1 (MOT1) associated with coastal Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We quantify the fitness benefits of a specific deletion‐harbouring allele (MOT1ᴰᴱᴸ) present in coastal habitats that is associated with lower transcript expression and molybdenum accumulation. Analysis of the leaf ionome revealed that MOT1ᴰᴱᴸ plants accumulate more copper (Cu) and less sodium (Na⁺) than plants with the noncoastal MOT1 allele, revealing a complex interdependence in homeostasis of these three elements. Our results indicate that under salinity stress, reduced MOT1 function limits leaf Na⁺ accumulation through abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. Enhanced ABA biosynthesis requires Cu. This demand is met in Cu deficient coastal soils through MOT1ᴰᴱᴸ increasing the expression of SPL7 and the copper transport protein COPT6. MOT1ᴰᴱᴸ is able to deliver a pleiotropic suite of phenotypes that enhance salinity tolerance in coastal soils deficient in Cu. This is achieved by inducing ABA biosynthesis and promoting reduced uptake or better compartmentalization of Na⁺, leading to coastal adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data  aERC‐StG679056 HOTSPOTcH2020 European Research Council  aBFU2016‐75176‐RcMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  aPID2019‐104000‐RB‐100cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  a2P4ES007373‐19A1cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health  a2R01GM078536cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health  aBB/L000113/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aBB/P013511/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aPCIG9‐GA‐2011‐291798cEuropean Commission 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3aalleles 3abiosynthesis 3acopper 3ahomeostasis 3aionome 3aionomics 3aleaves 3amolybdenum 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3atransport proteins1 aTerés, Joana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4136-99311 aYant, Levi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3442-02171 aPoschenrieder, Charlotte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3818-08741 aSalt, David E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0283-09910 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Oct., v. 232, no. 1 p.208-220dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.175693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245016600195300001800361500002000379520192600399592002802325596006902353596014302422596013502565596017102700650001702871650001402888650002502902650001102927650002202938650002002960650001202980650001502992650002103007650002303028650001103051650001103062650001503073650002103088650002203109700001803131700001503149700001703164700005203181773012403233856007403357852000903431655001203440IND60787043820221122060438.0220807e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078704382DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.141362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fengjiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4449-631110aDigestive enzyme activity of the Japanese grenadier anchovy Coilia nasus during spawning migration: influence of the migration distance and the water temperature  ap. 1311-1319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, we investigated the activity levels of two major digestive enzymes (pepsin and lipase) in the commercially important Japanese grenadier anchovy Coilia nasus during its upstream migration to analyse the digestive physiological responses to starvation and to analyse the influence of the water temperature on enzyme activity. Water temperature had a significant effect on pepsin activity, while long‐term starvation resulted in a significant decrease in pepsin activity. As starvation continued, however, a slight increase in pepsin activity between the Wuhu (440 river km) and Anqing (620 river km) regions may indicate that C. nasus had refeeding behaviour due to its large expenditure of energy reserves. In contrast, lipase activity was not significantly affected by the water temperature but the effect of fasting increased as much as 13% of lipase activity from the Chongming region (20 river km) to Anqing region, suggesting that the stored lipids of grenadier anchovy were mobilised to meet energy requirements of upstream migration activity and gonad development. Lipid mobilisation activated lipoprotein lipase (LPL; proteins with lipase activity) to hydrolyse triacylglycerides (TAG), which is the first step of lipid assimilation and obtained energy from fatty acids under fasting conditions. Therefore, the increased lipase activity is attributed mainly to the lipase that is involved in endogenous lipid hydrolysis. Grenadier anchovy appears to adapt to long‐term starvation during migration and the increased lipase activity may indicate a crucial effect on lipid metabolism. This study demonstrated that distinct alterations occur in pepsin and lipase activities during the spawning migration of grenadier anchovy due to exogenous nutrition and endogenous metabolism. Furthermore, it provides a basis for further research on the digestive physiology and energy metabolism in this species.  aPublisher supplied data  aZYHB16cmajor project of hydrobios resources in Jiangsu province  aCJDC‐2017‐22cAgricultural Finance Special Project ‘Investigation of fishery resources and environment in the lower Yangtze River’  cMinistry of Agriculture's species resources conservation project (Investigation and analysis of special fishing species resources)  aJJ(2017)‐010caquatic life and fishery environmental monitoring key station (downstream station) monitoring project of the Three Gorges Project of the Yangtze River 3aCoilia nasus 3aanchovies 3adigestive physiology 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3afasting 3ahydrolysis 3alipid metabolism 3alipoprotein lipase 3apepsin 3arivers 3astarvation 3atriacylglycerols 3awater temperature1 aYang, Yanping1 aJiang, Min1 aYin, Denghua1 aLiu, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5730-30400 tJournal of fish biology.g2019 Nov., v. 95, no. 5 p.1311-1319dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.141363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04224naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013000166300001800296520292100314592002803235650000803263650001603271650001403287650002003301650002503321650001703346650001403363650001703377650001603394650001103410650002103421650001503442650000903457650002503466650001903491700002203510700002503532773015403557856008203711852000903793655001203802IND60744832920221116202759.0210717e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074483292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-021-01918-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kaixin10aUsing the US National Air Toxics Assessment to benchmark the USEtox inhalation-mediated carcinogenic impacts of air emissions  ap. 1417-1430.  aPURPOSE: Regional air quality models generate a high-resolution prediction of pollutant concentrations using sophisticated treatments of atmospheric fate and transport processes, speciation, and chemistry. By comparison, the multi-media box modeling underpinning the USEtox model is far simpler but allows for broad coverage of hazardous air pollutants. The purpose of the present article is to benchmark USEtox results via inhalation against a state-of-the-science regulatory model and investigate methodological areas that drive differences in results. METHODS: The 2014 US National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) used a linked dispersion-regional air quality model to evaluate human health risk from emissions of air toxics, a prescribed list of hazardous air pollutants that can cause cancer and severe human health effects. We compare the NATA results for human health risk from carcinogenic emissions to characterization factors generated by running the USEtox model on the same starting emissions inventory, namely, the US National Emissions Inventory (NEI), using the North American model parameterization. We have also decomposed characterization factors into intake fractions and effect factors. The separate comparison analysis allows us to trace the driving force for cancer risk differences. Statistical analysis is applied to determine the significance of pollutant characteristics in driving differences in results, including molecular weight, vapor pressure, octanol–water partitioning, compartment half-lives in air, and chemical composition. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Comparative analysis shows a good concordance for carcinogenic impacts between the two models, with a factor of ~10 difference. The difference in effect factors is ~1.4, which is within an expected range. However, intake fraction is the major cause of cancer risk divergence. Intake fractions in NATA tend to have large variations due to the high-resolution air dispersion model and including secondary pollutants. NATA and USEtox results have consistent levels of statistical significance across the pollutant characteristics evaluated, with the greatest level of significance (p < 0.05) for molecular weight and vapor pressure, which strongly influence atmospheric fate. Formaldehyde is the dominant contributor to the total burden of diseases with 5000 to 20,000 cases of cancer per year. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical to benchmark LCIA results against current state-of-the-science models in order to ensure that LCA results can be reliably used for decision support. The USEtox model was not designed to mimic the complexity of full-scale air quality modeling, but still manages to produce a relative scaling of carcinogenic impacts that is consistent with NATA. Further regionalization, calibration, or inclusion of additional chemical transformations within the USEtox model may yield further performance improvements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical composition 3aformaldehyde 3ahalf life 3ahuman health 3ainventories 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aprediction 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3avapor pressure1 aSanchez, Sarah A.1 aEckelman, Matthew J.0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2021 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.1417-1430dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-021-01918-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011700198300001800315500002000333520182300353592002802176596003002204596004502234596004702279596004202326650002002368650001802388650001702406650001202423650001202435650001302447650001302460650003002473650001802503650002202521650001602543650001102559650001302570650001302583650002002596650002402616650001502640650001202655650002502667650001102692650001302703700006302716773012102779856007302900852000902973655001202982IND60669595520221118102628.0190920e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066959552DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.152002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, Erik S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1457-401910aStochastic exits from dormancy give rise to heavy‐tailed distributions of descendants in bacterial populations  ap. 3915-3928.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVariance in reproductive success is a major determinant of the degree of genetic drift in a population. While many plants and animals exhibit high variance in their number of progeny, far less is known about these distributions for microorganisms. Here, we used a strain barcoding approach to quantify variability in offspring number among replicate bacterial populations and developed a Bayesian method to infer the distribution of descendants from this variability. We applied our approach to measure the offspring distributions for five strains of bacteria from the genus Streptomyces after germination and growth in a homogenous laboratory environment. The distributions of descendants were heavy‐tailed, with a few cells effectively ‘winning the jackpot’ to become a disproportionately large fraction of the population. This extreme variability in reproductive success largely traced back to initial populations of spores stochastically exiting dormancy, which provided early‐germinating spores with an exponential advantage. In simulations with multiple dormancy cycles, heavy‐tailed distributions of descendants decreased the effective population size by many orders of magnitude and led to allele dynamics differing substantially from classical population genetics models with matching effective population size. Collectively, these results demonstrate that extreme variability in reproductive success can occur even in growth conditions that are far more homogeneous than the natural environment. Thus, extreme variability in reproductive success might be an important factor shaping microbial population dynamics with implications for predicting the fate of beneficial mutations, interpreting sequence variability within populations and explaining variability in infection outcomes across patients.  aPublisher supplied data  a342039cSimons Foundation  aDEB 1457518cNational Science Foundation  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a1006261cUS Department of Agriculture 3aBayesian theory 3aDNA barcoding 3aStreptomyces 3aalleles 3aanimals 3abacteria 3adormancy 3aeffective population size 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3agermination 3amodels 3amutation 3apatients 3aplants (botany) 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3aspores 3avariance1 aVetsigian, Kalin H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8864-502X0 tMolecular ecology.g2019 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.3915-3928dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.152003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245007300208300001600281520120200297592002801499650001801527650002101545650001701566650001201583650001401595650002501609650001901634650002601653650001701679650001801696653001601714653001001730653001401740653002101754653001801775700002001793773011201813856008601925852000902011655001202020IND60639455720221123031954.0190712e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoon, Jan Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0488-143410aDeveloping anti-counterfeiting measures: The role of smart packaging  ap. 135-143.  aCounterfeiting of food and beverage products is rife and premium brands are often targeted by fraudsters. Such is the case with Scotch whisky, a global, reputable brand revered for its heritage and tradition. Using Scotch whisky as a case study, the aim of this paper is to review existing literature and industry information to determine the market and personal consequences of counterfeiting activities and consider the packaging related anti-counterfeiting measures that can be employed within a wider anti-counterfeiting strategy. A typology of counterfeiting activities is developed including: tear-down counterfeiting, product overruns, malicious activities and document counterfeiting. Anti-counterfeiting measures are used to deter, detect and control counterfeiting activities and different packaging related approaches include the use of smart covert and overt technology. Most smart packaging-related anti-counterfeit technologies are stand-alone systems and this presents a vulnerability. An integrated anti-counterfeiting measures strategy, employed by business, the supply chain and the government is required to reduce the risk of the sale of counterfeit food and beverage products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScotch whisky 3abrewing industry 3acase studies 3amarkets 3apackaging 3aproduct authenticity 3arisk reduction 3astandards of identity 3asupply chain 3atreaty rights 0aCounterfeit 0aFraud 0aPackaging 0aSmart technology 0aScotch whisky1 aManning, Louise0 tFood research international.g2019 Sept., v. 123 p.135-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.04.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245014500206300001600351520174300367592002802110650001802138650001402156650001102170650002902181650002802210650001802238650001202256650002502268650002402293650001302317650002202330650001102352650001602363650001602379650001202395650001302407650001402420650001802434651001202452700002502464700002002489700002102509700001602530700002302546773013002569856008102699852000902780655001202789IND60630338420221119131447.0190207e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-018-0802-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Aaron J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3181-221510aIdentifying pre-spawning aggregation sites for bonefish (Albula vulpes) in the Bahamas to inform habitat protection and species conservation  ap. 159-173.  aMany species of tropical marine fish aggregate to spawn, and the dynamics of these aggregations make them especially susceptible to overfishing and habitat loss. Spawning aggregations tend to attract reproductive adults from a large geographic area, sites are traditionally used across generations, and larval dispersal can help supply regional fish stocks. Thus, anthropogenic impacts to spawning sites can have population-level consequences over local and regional scales. A critical component in the challenge to conservation of aggregation-spawning species is identification and subsequent protection of spawning sites. Here we summarize fieldwork conducted to create a protocol for identification of pre-spawning aggregation sites for bonefish, Albula vulpes, in The Bahamas. The mixed-methods, field-based protocol includes Traditional Ecological Knowledge, assessment of spawning readiness, tracking using acoustic telemetry, behavioral observations, and mark-recapture, that combined meet the requirements for identifying pre-spawning aggregation sites. Pre-spawning site identification, in conjunction with information on other life stages and habitats, is essential for successful spatial management strategies. Since bonefish and many other tropical fishes that form spawning aggregation are ‘data poor’ and occur in regions where enforcement of fishery regulations is lacking, spatial management is often the best conservation strategy. This protocol builds upon similar previous efforts to identify spawning sites for groupers and snappers, and will contribute to information needs for conservation is an essential component in the conservation of aggregation-forming species such as bonefish across broad spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbula vulpes 3aacoustics 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aenvironmental knowledge 3afisheries law 3agrouper 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ainformation needs 3alarvae 3amarine fish 3aoverfishing 3asnapper 3aspawning 3atelemetry 3atropical fish 3aBahamas1 aShenker, Jonathan M.1 aJud, Zachary R.1 aLewis, Justin P.1 aCarey, Eric1 aDanylchuk, Andy J.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2019 Feb., v. 102, no. 2 p.159-173dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0802-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008900169300002000258500001900278520156300297592002801860650002601888650002001914650000901934650001401943650001101957650001401968650000701982650001901989650001902008650001402027650001302041650002102054650002602075700002202101700002102123700002502144773015402169856008302323852000902406655001202415IND60739392420221119043358.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073939242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12098-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansouri, Mohsen10aEnhanced photocatalytic performance of UiO-66-NH2/TiO2 composite for dye degradation  ap. 25552-25565.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the performance of TiO₂, ZnO, UiO-66-NH₂ and UiO-66-NH₂/TiO₂ nanoparticles was investigated. They apply as photocatalysts for the destruction of organic reactive red dye 120 (RR120) under UV light. In order to determine the optimal conditions, effects of different catalysts and initial dye concentration, H₂O₂ content and catalyst loading parameters were examined. Taguchi-designed experimental method was used to obtain optimal test conditions. The physical and chemical properties of synthetic photocatalysts were investigated by SEM, XRD, EDX, BET and DRS. SEM images show that the globular particles of titania are well placed on the surface of the metal-organic framework (MOF). XRD and EDX analyses also confirmed the presence of titania in the synthesised UiO-66-NH₂/TiO₂ photocatalyst. Optimal values of H₂O₂, pH, the amount of catalyst, the dye concentration and the type of available photocatalyst to remove the RR120 dye, were obtained by 80 μl/l, 3 mg/l, 5 mg/l and 20 mg/l, UiO-66-NH₂/TiO₂ catalyst, respectively. The required time for complete removal of RR120 dye under detection limit of 0.136 mg/l in optimal conditions was 10 min. The RR120 photocatalytic degradation followed the first-order kinetic equation according to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model (kₐₚₚ = 0.407 min⁻¹). The result of optimisation showed the 20 wt% of the titania on MOF (UiO-66-NH₂) photocatalyst can be used in advanced oxidation processes, and it can be used as a suitable option for cleaning coloured effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3adyes 3aequations 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollution 3aresearch 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSadeghian, Samira1 aMansouri, Ghobad1 aSetareshenas, Naimeh0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 20 p.25552-25565dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12098-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245007900201300001800280500000900298520182900307592002802136650001802164650002202182650001402204650001202218650001702230650001602247650002002263650002002283650001802303650001702321650002202338650001102360650002202371650001402393650002002407650001302427773012102440856007302561852000902634655001202643IND60669595620221118102629.0190920e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066959562DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.152112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesprés, Laurence1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0660-626010aOne, two or more species? Mitonuclear discordance and species delimitation  ap. 3845-3847.  aNews  aDelimiting species boundaries is central to understand ecological and evolutionary processes, and to monitor biodiversity patterns over time and space. Yet, most of our current knowledge on animal diversity and phylogeny relies on morphological and mitochondrial (mt) DNA variation, a popular molecular marker also used as a barcode to assign samples to species. For morphologically undistinguishable sympatric species (cryptic species), the congruence of several independent markers is necessary to define separate species. Nuclear markers are becoming more accessible, and have confirmed that cryptic species are widespread in all animal phyla (Fišer, Robinson, & Malard, 2018). However, striking differences between the mitochondrial and nuclear variation patterns are also commonly found within single species. Mitonuclear discordance can result from incomplete lineage sorting, sex‐biased dispersal, asymmetrical introgression, natural selection or Wolbachia‐mediated genetic sweeps. But more generally, the distinct mode of transmission of these two types of markers (maternal vs. biparental) is sufficient to explain their distinct sensitivity to purely demographic events such as spatial range and population size fluctuations over time. In a From the Cover manuscript in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hijonosa et al. (2019) show that highly divergent mtDNA lineages coexist in a widespread European butterfly (Figure 1). None of the hundreds of nuclear markers analyzed was associated with mt lineages, nor was Wolbachia variation. These findings rule out the presence of cryptic species but shed light on complex demographic history of lineage divergence/fusion during the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, and pave the way to a better integration of both mt and nuclear information in demographic models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aPleistocene epoch 3aWolbachia 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3abutterflies 3acryptic species 3agenetic markers 3aintrogression 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3anatural selection 3aphylogeny 3apopulation size 3asympatry0 tMolecular ecology.g2019 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.3845-3847dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.152113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008800165500001900253520126000272592002801532650001201560650001901572650001101591650000901602650001501611650002501626650001701651651001001668653003601678653003601714653002301750653002401773653002501797700001501822700002001837700002001857700001901877773011801896856008602014852000902100655001202109IND60710770320221119100255.0201230e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071077032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1113372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aAlternative water supply solutions: China's South-to-North-water-diversion in Jinan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInter-basin water transfers are intended to have a positive impact on the development of a region, but are always accompanied by huge energy consumption. The feasibility and effectiveness of water transfer projects have not yet been clearly evaluated, especially in the light of their energy consumption and effects on social development. This paper develops a method that combines life cycle approach and system dynamic model to reveal the effectiveness of different water supply alternatives (transferred water, reclaimed wastewater and rainwater harvesting) when they are all constrained to consume equal energy. This approach is applied to the case of Jinan city in Shandong province, China, the main water-receiving city on the Eastern Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (ER-SNWTP). The results show that in normal years, Jinan's reclaimed water and rainwater harvesting supply are effective replacements for transferred water under the constraints of equal energy consumption and capital costs; even in dry years these two alternatives still play an important role. The results of this study indicate the relative effectiveness of reclaimed water and rainwater harvesting in supplying urban water while conserving energy and capital.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3arain 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater supply 3aChina 0aSupply-oriented water solutions 0aDemand-oriented water solutions 0aEnergy consumption 0aLife cycle approach 0aSystem dynamic model1 aWang, Mark1 aWebber, Michael1 aZhou, Chengting1 aZhang, Wenjing0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 276 p.111337-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1113373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245016800175506011700343506007600460520156100536592002802097506003702125650002702162650001702189650002402206650001102230650002202241650001702263650001502280650002602295650002302321650001402344650002002358650001202378650001902390653001502409653004102424653002502465653002702490653001002517653001402527700002402541700001802565700002102583700002302604700002002627700001902647700002002666700002602686773012102712856008502833852000902918655001202927IND60727923620221207085904.0220606e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072792362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2021.1483992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPáleníková, Petra10aQuantitative density gradient analysis by mass spectrometry (qDGMS) and complexome profiling analysis (ComPrAn) R package for the study of macromolecular complexes  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany cellular processes involve the participation of large macromolecular assemblies. Understanding their function requires methods allowing to study their dynamic and mechanistic properties. Here we present a method for quantitative analysis of native protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes by mass spectrometry following their separation by density – qDGMS. Mass spectrometric quantitation is enabled through stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We provide a complete guide, from experimental design to preparation of publication-ready figures, using a purposely-developed R package – ComPrAn. As specific examples, we present the use of sucrose density gradients to inspect the assembly and dynamics of the human mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), its interacting proteins, the small subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosome, cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex and the mitochondrial PDH complex. ComPrAn provides tools for analysis of peptide-level data as well as normalization and clustering tools for protein-level data, dedicated visualization functions and graphical user interface. Although, it has been developed for the analysis of qDGMS samples, it can also be used for other proteomics experiments that involve 2-state labelled samples separated into fractions. We show that qDGMS and ComPrAn can be used to study macromolecular complexes in their native state, accounting for the dynamics inherent to biological systems and benefiting from its proteome-wide quantitative and qualitative capability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaminoacyl tRNA ligases 3acell culture 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3aribonucleoproteins 3aribosomes 3astable isotopes 3asucrose 3auser interface 0aProteomics 0aDensity gradient ultracentrifugation 0aComplexome profiling 0aMitochondrial ribosome 0aSILAC 0aR package1 aHarbour, Michael E.1 aDing, Shujing1 aFearnley, Ian M.1 aVan Haute, Lindsey1 aRorbach, Joanna1 aScavetta, Rick1 aMinczuk, Michal1 aRebelo-Guiomar, Pedro0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2021 June 01, v. 1862, no. 6 p.148399-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2021.1483993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011500172300002000287500001900307520103200326592002801358650003001386650000801416650001801424650001601442650002301458650002201481651001601503700001501519700002701534700005901561773015401620856008301774852000901857655001201866IND60739392520221119043411.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073939252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12122-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumbhakar, Subal C.10aEfficiency in reducing air pollutants and healthcare expenditure in the Seoul Metropolitan City of South Korea  ap. 25442-25459.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study analyzes efficiency in the reduction of air pollutants and the associated healthcare costs using a stochastic frontier cost function panel data approach. For the empirical analysis, we use monthly data covering 25 districts in the Seoul metropolitan city of South Korea observed over the period January 2010 to December 2017. Our results show large variations in air pollution and healthcare costs across districts and over time and their efficiency in reducing air pollutants. The study concludes that efforts are needed to apply the World Health Organization’s air quality standards for designing and implementing location-specific customized policies for improving the level of air quality and its equal distribution, provision of health services, and improved efficiency in improving air quality standards. The study identifies a number of determinants of air pollutants and efficiency enhancement which provide useful pointers for policymakers for addressing the current environmental problems in South Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aempirical research 3ahealth care costs 3aSouth Korea1 aAn, Jiyeon1 aRashidghalam, Masoomeh1 aHeshmati, Almas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7902-46830 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 20 p.25442-25459dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12122-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245015800206300001800364500002000382520086400402592002801266596010101294596010101395650000901496650001801505650001601523650001101539650001101550651001901561700006201580700002001642700002001662700002401682700006101706773012401767856007401891852000901965655001201974IND60787044020221122060342.0220807e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078704402DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.141232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaltabellotta, Fabio P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8174-224910aAge and growth of three endemic threatened guitarfishes Pseudobatos horkelii, P. percellens and Zapteryx brevirostris in the western South Atlantic Ocean  ap. 1236-1248.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe age and growth of three endemic threatened guitarfish species were analysed using vertebrae of Pseudobatos horkelii, P. percellens and Zapteryx brevirostris. Edge and marginal‐increment analyses were used to evaluate the periodicity of the formation of the band‐pairs, suggesting deposition of one band‐pair per year, from late winter to late spring. The von Bertalanffy growth model was used to describe the growth of these species with the following parameters, for pooled sexes: P. horkelii L∞ = 126.93, k = 0.19 and t₀ = −1.51; P. percellens L∞ = 109.31, k = 0.16 and t₀ = −1.78; Z. brevirostris L∞ = 60.37, k = 0.24 and t₀ = −1.42. Our results are essential to understanding the resilience and vulnerability of these species to harvest, which can contribute to management and conservation actions of these species.  aPublisher supplied data  a#2010/02397–7cThe São Paulo Research Foundation supported F.

CD40 and CD154 interaction is critically important in regulating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In this study we have investigated whether a DNA vaccine encoding rhoptry protein 1 (ROP1) of Toxoplasma gondii, and encoding ovine CD154 induces an enhanced ROP1-specific immune response in sheep. Two groups of twelve animals received two intramuscular injections, of a DNA plasmid encoding T. gondii ROP1 antigen (group 1) or an ROP1 antigen fused to ovine CD154 (group 2). There were two control groups of sheep. One was injected with an empty vector (group 3) and the other received no injections at all (group 4). The injection of the plasmid containing ROP1 (group 1) at weeks 0 and 4 induced a significant IgG2 response at week 2 which was amplified at week 4 after the booster injection and persisted to week 8 compared to the control animals in groups 3 and 4. For IgG1, significant differences from the control animals were only observed from week 5 onwards. The fusion of CD154 and ROP1 elicited significant IgG1 and IgG2 responses from week 1 which were amplified from weeks 5 to 8 compared to the control animals in groups 3 and 4. The IgG1 response was significantly higher in group 2 animals receiving pROP1-CD154 compared to group 1 receiving pROP1 only. There was no significant difference in IgG2 responses between groups 1 and 2. Significant differences in IFN-γ levels were only observed in treatment group 1 at week 2 and treatment group 2 at weeks 1 and 2 compared to the control animals. The results demonstrated that an intramuscular injection of pROP1-CD154 gene to sheep significantly enhanced their immune response and induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response while the intramuscular injection of pROP1 only induced a Th1-specific immune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantigens 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aintramuscular injection 3aproteins 3arecombinant vaccines 3asheep 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCD40 Ligandxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCHO Cells 2aCattle 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aFemale 2aImmunizationxveterinary 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPlasmids 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aProtozoan Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesximmunologyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aSheep, Domestic 2aToxoplasmaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalximmunologyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aVaccines, DNAxadministration & dosageximmunology. 0aNew Zealand1 aLi, Hong1 aXu, Janet Boyu1 aHolec-Gąsior, Lucyna1 aKur, Józef1 aSedcole, Richard1 aBickerstaffe, Roy1 aStankiewicz, Mirosław0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2011 Dec. 29, v. 183, no. 1-2 p.72-78dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245012700206300001600333520211100349592002802460650001802488650001602506650001502522650002802537650000902565650001402574650003002588650002502618650001302643650002402656650001502680651001902695651001202714651001802726651001202744651001902756700002402775700002102799773013002820856008102950852000903031655001203040IND60630338720221119132720.0190207e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-018-0840-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Aaron J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3181-221512aA multi-methods approach supports the effective management and conservation of coastal marine recreational flats fisheries  ap. 105-115.  aThe recreational, catch and release fishery for fishes that inhabit shallow-water, coastal marine habitats in tropical and sub-tropical regions (called the flats fishery) is economically valuable and increasingly perceived as a sustainable ecotourism pursuit. However, knowledge of many aspects of target species (such as bonefish, tarpon and permit) ecology is incomplete, and fishery- and non-fishery-related threats to the fish and habitats are numerous and often poorly understood. The International Bonefish and Tarpon Symposium is convened every three years to share new knowledge and to chart directions for future research, with a focus on research that informs conservation and management. Most of the articles in this Special Issue focus on the flats fishery in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and western North Atlantic ocean, but the findings presented here provide guidance for similar work in other regions. Conservation and management of flats fisheries present a challenge because the fisheries are typically data poor; they occur in locations that lack resources and there are scant data on the target species and their habitats. Since earlier symposia, much has been accomplished to fill knowledge gaps and contribute actionable knowledge to conservation. Studies are being replicated across a wider geographic range, and connectivity is being studied at local and regional scales. Citizen science and local ecological knowledge have contributed to a better understanding of historical trends and ongoing processes. In some instances, data have been applied to proactive habitat protections, as in the Bahamas, and to habitat restoration, as in Florida. In other instances, though much data have been gathered, additional information is needed before a comprehensive conservation strategy is possible, as in the Florida Keys. As the articles contained in this Special Issue demonstrate, a mixed-methods approach that uses complementary sources of information to construct a broad understanding of the flats fishery is necessary to guide research and inform conservation and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbula vulpes 3aMegalopidae 3aecotourism 3aenvironmental knowledge 3afish 3afisheries 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3ainformation sources 3asubtropics 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBahamas 3aCaribbean Sea 3aFlorida 3aGulf of Mexico1 aRehage, Jennifer S.1 aCooke, Steven J.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2019 Feb., v. 102, no. 2 p.105-115dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0840-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024001700120024002100137024003200158024002200190024001100212040001800223100002100241245009200262300001600354506007600370506017300446520172200619506003702341650002502378650002002403650000902423650002202432650001202454650001002466650001102476650001202487650002302499650001902522650001002541700002302551700001802574700001602592700002402608700002302632773007302655856011202728856004502840956008802885961000902973852000902982655001202991IND50071298220221214225548.0131206e20120917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007129822DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid7 a2820942aris7 a10113/581032hdl7 a10.1542/peds.2012-07012doi7 aPMC40746282pmcid8 ans3618  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuattrin, Teresa10aEfficacy of family-based weight control program for pre-school children in primary care  ap. 660-666.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aOBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of an innovative family-based intervention for overweight pre-school children and overweight parents conducted in the primary care setting. METHODS: Children with BMI $85th percentile and an overweight parent were randomized to intervention or information control (IC). Trained staff delivered dietary and physical/sedentary activities education to parents over 6 months (10 group meetings and 8 calls). Parents in the intervention received also behavioral modification. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed by using mixed analysis of variance models to test changes in child percent over BMI (%OBMI) and z-BMI and to explore potential moderators of group differences in treatment response. RESULTS: Ninety-six of 105 randomized families started the program: 46 children (31 girls/15 boys) in the intervention and 50 (33 girls/17 boys) in the IC, with 33 and 39 mothers and 13 and 11 fathers in intervention and IC, respectively. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Children in the intervention group had greater %OBMI and z-BMI decreases at 3 and 6 months compared with those assigned to IC (P , .0021). A greater BMI reduction over time was also observed in parents in the intervention compared with parents assigned to IC (P , .0001). Child %OBMI and parent BMI changes were correlated (r = .31; P = .003). Children with greater baseline %OBMI were more likely to have a greater %OBMI decrease over time (P = .02)). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrently targeting preschool-aged overweight youth and their overweight parents for behavioral weight control in a primary care setting reduced child %OBMI and parent BMI, with parent and child weight changes correlating.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildhood obesity 3afathers 3agirls 3amodels 3amothers 3apreschool children 3aweight control 3ayouth1 aRoemmich, James N.1 aPaluch, Rocco1 aYu, Jihnhee1 aEpstein, Leonard H.1 aEcker, Michelle A.0 tPediatrics.g2012 Sept. 17, v. 130, no. 4 p.660-666x1098-42757nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-0701  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/HNRC1770.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245010600172300001400278520173900292592002802031650002202059650002302081650001302104650002002117650001602137650001202153650002202165650001102187650002402198650001002222650001802232650001702250650002402267650002002291650002102311650002902332650002602361650001002387651001402397653001302411653001202424653002902436653001802465653001402483653001402497653001102511700002602522700001802548700002902566700002202595700002202617700001902639700002302658700002202681773012302703856008302826852000902909655001202918IND60581040020221119055653.0190318e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058104002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPresotto, Alejandro10aCrop-wild sunflower hybridization can mediate weediness throughout growth-stress tolerance trade-offs  ap. 12-21.  aAgricultural weeds are plants well-adapted to agricultural environments interfering directly and indirectly with crop production and causing important economic losses worldwide. Crop-wild hybridization is one of the main forces that have ruled weed evolution along with adaptation to agricultural (or benign) environments. Considering the competing demands for resources in any plant, adaptation to agricultural environments might result in an increase in growth but with lower tolerance to stress. In Argentina, most of the non-native H. annuus populations grow on roadsides, ditches, fences, hedgerows (ruderals), but there are also a few cases of H. annuus growing in agricultural field as weeds (agrestals). We asume that weediness of these agrestal biotypes came after crop hybridization as result of growth-stress tolerance trade-offs. Ruderal, agrestal (with evidence of crop introgression), and crop biotypes were contrasted under studies of drought and defoliation stresses, as well as for plant growth under non-stressful conditions and sequences of stress-related genes. The agrestal biotype was less tolerant to defoliation and drought than the ruderal biotype. Drought tolerance variation was largely explained by plant height rate (growth) and defoliation tolerance variation was mainly explained by biomass accumulation (resource allocation). Agrestal biotype sequences of two genes encoding transcription factors involved in stress response, DREB2 and NAC, showed evidence of positive selection in the crop direction. Therefore, selection in the agricultural environment combined with crop hybridization driver the evolution of a well-adapted genetic variant of H. annuus with fast growth but reduced stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiomass production 3abiotypes 3acrop production 3adefoliation 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afences 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3aintrogression 3aplant growth 3aresource allocation 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aweeds 3aArgentina 0aAgrestal 0aRuderal 0aAgricultural environment 0aIntrogression 0aTrade-off 0aTolerance 0aGrowth1 aHernández, Fernando,1 aDiaz, Marina,1 aFernández-Moroni, Ivana1 aPandolfo, Claudio1 aBasualdo, Jessica1 aCuppari, Selva1 aCantamutto, Miguel1 aPoverene, Mónica0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 249 p.12-21dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011500158300001800273500002000291520039500311592002800706596004000734650001500774650001700789650001100806650000900817650001500826650001600841650001500857700006400872700002300936700002100959700001800980700001800998700002401016700001801040700001801058700002001076773012401096856007401220852000901294655001201303IND60787044420221122060419.0220807e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078704442DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.141402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGache, Camille10aEffects of Asparagopsis taxiformis metabolites on the feeding behaviour of post‐larval Acanthurus triostegus  ap. 1355-1358.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOur study highlights the effect of the macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis on the feeding behaviour of the tropical surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus.

Human milk contains endogenous enzymes that comprise a dynamic proteolytic system, yet biological properties of these enzymes and their activities in response to variations including pH within infants are unclear. Human milk has a neutral pH around 7, while infant gastric pH varies from 2 to 6 depending on individual conditions. This study is designed to determine the specificity of enzyme–substrate interactions in human milk as a function of pH. METHODS AND RESULTS: Endogenous proteolysis is characterized by incubating freshly expressed human milk at physiologically relevant pH ranging from 2 to 7 without the addition of exogenous enzymes. Results show that the effects of pH on endogenous proteolysis in human milk are protein‐specific. Further, specific interactions between cathepsin D and α‐lactalbumin are confirmed. The endogenous enzyme cathepsin D in human milk cleaves α‐lactalbumin as the milk pH shifts from 7 to 3. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that selective proteolysis activated by pH shift is a mechanism for dynamic interactions between human milk and the infant. Controlled proteolysis can guide the use of human milk products based on individual circumstance.  aPublisher supplied data  aAT007079cNational Institutes of Health  aAT008759cNational Institutes of Health  aJastro‐Shields Research ScholarshipcUniversity of California, Davis  aProvost's Undergraduate FellowshipcUniversity of California, Davis0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast milk 3acathepsin D 3aenzyme substrates 3ainfants 3alactalbumin 3amilk 3apH 3aproteolysis1 aZheng, Jingyuan1 aKrishnakumar, Nithya1 aGoonatilleke, Elisha1 aLebrilla, Carlito B.1 aBarile, Daniela1 aGerman, J.

Trends in dissolved oxygen (DO), salinity, temperature and pH were analyzed from ten sites throughout PHMR for statistically significant relationships. Maintaining satisfactory water quality is critical for sustaining healthy fisheries. PHMR represents a unique link between upland watersheds and coastal wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds. These ecosystems comprise important habitat for many fisheries including the economically valuable sport fish species of Megalops atlanticus (Atlantic tarpon), Albula vulpes (bonefish) and Trachinotus falcatus (permit). Sport fishing in the PHMR area has become increasingly popular in recent decades and is responsible for generating direct and indirect income opportunities for local communities, including Punta Gorda, the largest town in southern Belize. As a result, degradation of water quality of PHMR through land-based human activities could have ecological and economic consequences for southern Belize. The results of the analyses revealed significant seasonal variations and slight increasing trends in DO and salinity at several sampling sites. These relatively stable results are likely related to several factors including limited coastal development and low population density of southern Belize. This study provides baseline information for future research and outlines recommendations for management strategies of PHMR to mitigate impacts from current and future threats to water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbula vulpes 3aMegalops atlanticus 3aTrachinotus 3acoastal water 3acoral reefs 3adissolved oxygen 3aeconomic impact 3aecosystems 3afish 3afisheries 3agame fish 3ahighlands 3aincome 3apH 3apopulation density 3asalinity 3aseagrasses 3aseasonal variation 3asport fishing 3atemperature 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aBelize 3aHonduras1 aFoley, James R.1 aSteinberg, Michael K.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2019 Feb., v. 102, no. 2 p.429-442dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0811-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245010700173500001900280520136800299592002801667650003201695650002201727650002801749650001501777650001701792650001301809650003501822650001101857650004301868650001201911650002201923650001601945650001301961653002001974653004301994653002002037653001102057700001202068773009302080856009102173852000902264655001202273IND60687332220221118230606.0200412e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068733222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sanghee10aLipid photosensitizers for suppression of gastric inhibitory polypeptide in obese with type 2 diabetes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a“K-cell targeted photodynamic therapy (K-cell targeted PDT)” with a minimally invasive procedure was investigated to reduce the secretion of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), an incretin hormone secreted from enteroendocrine K-cells in the duodenum that is suspected to be strongly correlated with obesity. Oleic acid-poly (ethylene glycol)-chlorin e6 (OA-PEG-Ce6, OPC) was designed for PDT because it targets K-cells through the interaction of OA in OPC with a G protein-coupled receptor (GPR 119) that is overexpressed on K-cells and mediates fatty acid sensing. OPC interacted with duodenal cells (HUTU-80) expressing GPR 119 and HEK 293 cells transfected with human GPR 119 to mimic K-cells in vitro. The intracellular intensity and cytotoxicity of OPC on HUTU-80 cells increased 5- and 3-fold compared to PEG-Ce6, respectively. In particular, its intensity on HEK 293 cells overexpressing GPR 119 showed 7.8-fold higher than that of PEG-Ce6. Moreover, in high fat-diet animal models, OPC induced endocrine cell death through PDT, resulting in a decrease in the plasma GIP level and a reduction their weight (80% less than on the day of PDT initiation). Therefore, K-cell targeted PDT presents a new direction of future minimally invasive anti-obesity treatment to replace conventional methods such as bariatric surgery and radiofrequency ablation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abariatric surgery 3abiocompatible materials 3acell death 3acytotoxicity 3aduodenum 3agastric inhibitory polypeptide 3ahumans 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aphotochemotherapy 3aradio waves 3asecretin 0aType 2 diabetes 0aEndo-laparoscopic photodynamic therapy 0aPhotosensitizer 0aK-cell1 aNa, Kun0 tBiomaterials.g2020 July, v. 246 p.119977-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010500206300001100311500001100322520208800333592002802421650001302449650001202462650003102474650001402505650001602519650001602535650001302551650001902564650002902583650000902612650001702621700007002638700005702708700006102765773011002826856008302936852000903019655001203028IND60756331220221117172529.0220318e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075633122DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-021-01107-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlanes, Analia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2187-631110aMolecular control to salt tolerance mechanisms of woody plants: recent achievements and perspectives  ap. 96.  aReview  aKEY MESSAGE : Woody plants have salt-tolerant mechanisms similar to those developed by non-woody plants. Among others, compartmentalization of ions, production of compatible solutes, synthesis of specific proteins and metabolites, and induction of transcriptional factors are the most relevant. Woody plant-associated microbial interactions as well as naturally stress-adapted trees are resources that deserve to be deepened to fully understand the tolerance mechanisms. CONTEXT: The high variability of salinity responses found in woody plants implies a high potentiality for germplasm selection and breeding. Salt tolerance mechanisms of plants are regulated by numerous genes, which control ion homeostasis, production of compatible solutes and specific proteins, and activation or repression of specific transcription factors. Despite the fact that numerous studies have been done on herbaceous model plants, knowledge about salt tolerance mechanisms in woody plants is still scarce. AIMS: The present review critically evaluates molecular control of salt tolerance mechanisms of woody plants, focusing on the regulation and compartmentalization of ions, production of compatible solutes, activation of transcription factors, and differential expression of stress response-related proteins, including omics-based approaches and the role of plant-microbial interactions. The potential identification of genes from naturally stress-adapted woody plants and the integration of the massive omics data are also discussed. CONCLUSION: In woody plants, salt tolerance mechanisms seem not to diverge to those identified in non-woody plants. More comparative studies between woody and non-woody salt tolerance plants will be relevant to identify potential molecular mechanisms specifically developed for wood plants. In this sense, the activation of metabolic pathways and molecular networks by novel genetic engineering techniques is key to establish strategies to improve the salt tolerance in woody plant species and to contribute to more sustainable agricultural and forestry systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforestry 3aforests 3agene expression regulation 3agermplasm 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolites 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3atranscription (genetics) 3awood 3awoody plants1 aPalchetti, María Virginia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0442-86401 aVilo, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0021-93981 aIbañez, Cristian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7767-64880 tAnnals of forest science.g2021 Dec., v. 78, no. 4 p.96-96dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-021-01107-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245006000161520064300221592002800864650002000892650001800912650001200930650001100942650002400953650003100977653002101008653002601029653002601055653002601081653002901107700001701136700001901153773011101172856008301283852000901366655001201375IND60657000120221118004348.0190815e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065700012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2019.1068152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin10aSemiparametric model for covariance regression analysis  aEstimating covariance matrices is an important research topic in statistics and finance.

The asymptotic properties for the time varying coefficient and the associated semiparametric covariance estimators are established. A Bayesian information criterion to select the order of the polynomial function is also investigated.

Since it is common for people in modern cities to spend up to 85% of time indoors, the quality of the indoor environment is critical for human health. In this study, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), emerging brominated flame retardants (EBFRs), and dechlorane-related compounds (DRCs) were measured in household dust samples (n = 34) from Latvia, followed by human exposure assessment. Among all studied compounds, OPFRs showed the highest concentrations (1380–133,000 ng g⁻¹). Despite the phase-out of PBDEs, they were the second most significant flame retardants in the studied dust samples (468–25,500 ng g⁻¹) and the predominant compound was BDE-209. The concentrations of EBFRs were in the range of 120–7295 ng g⁻¹, with the most abundant contaminant being DBDPE, which is widely used as a substitute for the deca-BDE formulation. DRCs were the least common flame retardants in the Latvian indoor environments, with concentrations ranging 22.4–192 ng g⁻¹. Although the concentrations of specific FRs are known to vary between different countries, the levels and patterns observed in dust samples from Latvia were similar to those reported from Central Europe. Human exposure was evaluated as the estimated daily intake (EDI). The calculated exposure to most of the FRs was several orders of magnitude lower than the available reference dose (RfD) values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily intake 3abiphenyl 3abromination 3adecabromodiphenyl ethane 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3adust 3aflammability 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3apeople 3apollution 3aresearch 3aCentral European region 3aLatvia1 aPerkons, Ingus1 aBartkevics, Vadims1 aZacs, Dzintars0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 20 p.25493-25502dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12374-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013500165300001600300506002800316520126600344592002801610506003701638650002101675650001801696650002601714650001501740650001601755650002901771650001801800650001101818650002401829650001801853650002001871650003301891650001301924650003701937650001201974650001901986653002002005653002202025653003102047653002702078653001602105700002402121700001802145700001802163700003002181773010302211856007902314852000902393655001202402IND60698415720221207105223.0210506e20200609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069841572DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2020-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikhlou, Kosar10aWalnut leaf extract-based green synthesis of selenium nanoparticles via microwave irradiation and their characteristics assessment  ap. 227-235.  aResource is Open Access  aSelenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) have predominant characteristics compared to that in their bulk usage due to their high surface-to-volume ratio. The walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaf extract containing different bioactive compounds that act as reductant and stabilizing agents has been used for the green synthesis of the Se NPs. Influences of two synthetic variables, namely, the amount of selenium salt solution ranging from 15 to 25 mL and the amount of walnut leaf extract ranging from 1 to 5 mL, on broad emission peak (λₘₐₓ) and absorbance of colloidal solutions having Se NPs were evaluated via the response surface methodology.

To control these infections, potential causes for this high susceptibility for enteric virus infections in younger piglets were analyzed by comparing the intestinal barrier between 1-week, 2-week and 4-week-old piglets. In this study, histological staining was used to analyze morphological differences in intestinal villi, real-time qPCR was performed to assess mRNA expression levels of genes that were related to viral infection and differentiation of immune cells, and flow cytometry was utilized to measure the frequencies of T cells. According to the results obtained, 1-week-old piglets have intestinal villi with shallower crypts, less well developed epithelial cells and a more immature immune system compared to older pigs. Moreover, high amounts of enteric virus invasion-assisting proteins but low amounts of resistant proteins in 1-week piglets could also be a reason for the high susceptibility of 1-week-old piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3ahistology 3aimmunology 3aintestines 3amortality 3aviruses 0aPiglets 0aEnteric virus 0aSusceptibility 0aAges 0aIntestinal environment1 aYang, Ning1 aHuang, Xin1 aLi, Yang1 aLiu, Guo1 aJansen, Christine A.1 aSavelkoul, Huub F.J.1 aLiu, Guangliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8158-57490 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2022 Nov., v. 136 p.104512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2022.1045123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245015200197500002000349520148500369592002801854596005901882596005901941596007702000596004302077650002602120650002002146650001402166650001602180650001302196650001202209650001102221650001002232650001902242650002302261650001702284650002702301650001702328650002202345650002802367650003702395700005302432700001402485700002602499700001402525700001802539700001702557700001602574700001802590773014102608856007802749852000902827655001202836IND60669596420221118102600.0190920e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066959642DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2018012552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7228-351114aThe Preventative Effects of Procyanidin on Binge Ethanol‐Induced Lipid Accumulation and ROS Overproduction via the Promotion of Hepatic Autophagy  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: Autophagy plays an important role in alleviating alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In this study, it is discovered that a dimer procyanidin (DPC) significantly prevented ALD by promoting hepatic autophagy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both cell and animal disease models stimulated by excessive ethanol are employed to evaluate the protective actions of DPC. Specifically, in vitro, DPC significantly decreased intracellular lipid deposition, diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and elevated the level of mitochondrial membrane potential. These beneficial effects can be remarkably blocked by 3‐methyladenine, a potent autophagy inhibitor, suggesting the autophagy‐dependent protective role of DPC. In vivo, DPC pretreatment can also significantly reduce lipid accumulation, ROS overproduction, and elevated GSH content in the liver. Similarly, these protective effects of DPC can be partially reversed by chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor used to block the late‐stage autophagy flux. Moreover, the determinations of LC3 and p62 protein expressions, autophagic flux assessments, and transmission electron microscopy observation further demonstrate the pro‐autophagic effect of DPC. CONCLUSIONS: DPC may activate hepatic autophagy to eliminate lipid droplets and damaged mitochondria, thereby reducing hepatic lipid disposition and ROS overproduction. This study demonstrates that DPC is a protective reagent on ALD, providing a novel strategy of fighting ALD.  aPublisher supplied data  a81903901cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81274151cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a02.03.2017‐319cScientific Research Department of Wuhan Union Hospital  aGNT1092451cNHMRC CJ Martin Fellowship 3aanimal disease models 3aanimal diseases 3aautophagy 3achloroquine 3adroplets 3aethanol 3alipids 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aprocyanidins 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3630-90021 aHuang, Zi1 aSullivan, Mitchell A.1 aHe, Zihao1 aWang, Jinglin1 aChen, Zehong1 aHu, Huiping1 aWang, Kaiping0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2019 Sept., v. 63, no. 18 p.e1801255-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2018012553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007200148245010000220300001200320520133800332592002801670596007301698596007301771596007301844596007301917650001601990650002302006650001302029650001702042650002902059650001102088650002002099650002202119650001302141650001702154650001402171650001902185650000902204650001302213650002502226700002402251700006102275700006202336700006002398700006802458700006402526773013102590856008302721852000902804655001202813IND60744833920221116202821.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074483392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-021-03291-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa-Silva, Cristiane Jovelina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3239-592710aNitrate nutrition increases foliar levels of nitric oxide and waterlogging tolerance in soybean  ap. 116.  aLeaves are key photosynthetic organs impaired by soil waterlogging. Here, we evaluated the role of nitrate nutrition in alleviating waterlogging-induced stress in leaves of soybean (Glycine max). Plants were cultivated with or without nitrate nutrition over short- (three days) or long-term (40 days) treatments prior to waterlogging exposure. Very small differences in leaf performance were observed between plants supplied with nitrate during the short- and long-term treatments. Both short- and long-term nitrate nutrition resulted in higher activity of nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1) and higher levels of foliar nitric oxide (NO) in plants exposed to waterlogging. Nitrate nutrition did not change the activity of glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2); however, it increased the levels of amino acids in waterlogged plants. In addition, nitrate nutrition decreased foliar levels of H₂O₂, [Formula: see text], and malondialdehyde under waterlogging, while increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6). Nitrate nutrition further prevented waterlogging-induced decreases in photosynthetic pigment levels, leaf gas exchange, and foliar biomass accumulation. Using NO scavenger, we demonstrated that nitrate nutrition enhances soybean tolerance to waterlogging stress through NO signaling.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aGlycine max 3abiomass production 3acatalase 3agas exchange 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3anitrate reductase 3anitrates 3anitric oxide 3anutrition 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil 3asoybeans 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aShimoia, Eduardo P.1 aPosso, Douglas A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1560-20231 aCardoso, Amanda A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7078-62461 aBatz, Timothy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0601-43611 aOliveira, Ana Claudia B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8856-23441 ado Amarante, Luciano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4219-94040 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2021 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.116-116dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-021-03291-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165300001300284520161700297592002801914650001301942650001501955650002201970650001601992650002002008650001202028650003502040650001302075650001702088650001702105650001302122650001202135650002602147650001502173650001302188650002302201651001002224653003002234653001502264653003102279653001402310653002402324700001902348700002102367700002302388700002602411700002302437700002002460773012202480856008302602852000902685655001202694IND60581040420221119055734.0190318e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058104042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabuchi, Ken10aPredicting potential rice damage by insect pests using land use data: A 3-year study for area-wide pest management  ap. 4-11.  aTo mitigate crop damage by insect pests, it is important to determine priority areas for the allocation of available pest management resources, which are usually limited. We tested whether the occurrence of pecky rice damage caused by the sorghum plant bug Stenotus rubrovittatus (Hemiptera: Miridae), a major rice pest in Japan, could be predicted using a spatial model based on land use data. Using a data from a 3-year field study, we examined the relationships among the land use of the area within a 300-m radius around each focal paddy field, the abundance of S. rubrovittatus, and level of pecky rice damage in the Maesawa region of northern Honshu Island, Japan. We also used mapping to visualize potential priority areas using a model and GIS software. From a linear mixed model analysis and model selection by Akaike’s information criterion values, areas of source habitats, soybean fields and rice paddies were selected for the best model, but the abundance of S. rubrovittatus was not. Based on the model’s evaluation, the predicted value of pecky rice damage, when compared with the observed value, was not sensitive enough for a quantitative prediction. However, the model was accurate enough to predict whether the brown rice was first grade, which is of greatest importance to local farmers. Therefore, it is possible that potential pecky rice damage by S. rubrovittatus could be predicted when the spatial arrangement of arable fields in a certain year is determined. Our results will be useful to support decision-making that involves insecticide applications to mitigate pecky rice damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStenotus 3abrown rice 3acomputer software 3acrop damage 3adecision making 3afarmers 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3aland use 3apaddies 3apesticide application 3aprediction 3asoybeans 3astatistical models 3aJapan 0aArea-wide pest management 0aPecky rice 0aPest-suppressing landscape 0aRice bugs 0aLandscape structure1 aMurakami, Taro1 aOkudera, Shigeru1 aFurihata, Shunsuke1 aSakakibara, Mitsutaka1 aTakahashi, Akihiko1 aYasuda, Tetsuya0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 249 p.4-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013800166500001900304520080600323592002801129650002501157650001701182650001101199650001201210650001101222650001601233650002201249651001001271653002601281653002201307653002701329653004001356653003701396700001501433700001801448700001601466700001801482700002201500773009001522856008501612852000901697655001201706IND60731454720221120044045.0210519e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xiaohui12aA new converged Emperor Penguin Optimizer for biding strategy in a day-ahead deregulated market clearing price: A case study in China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this research, a new approach has been suggested for providing an optimization bidding strategy in the day-ahead market for case research in China.

The resemblance amounts between each day and the next day are used for clustering. The clustering is performed based on the well-known subtractive clustering methodology. A simulation model using the probability function in MCP estimates the fitness function of the generated strategies.

Primate sperm diversity reflects therefore the evolutionary divergences of the different primate species and the impact of a combination of variables exerting selection pressures on sperm form, function, and competition. Thereby, mating systems, life cycle or ecological variables are some of the important factors driving sperm diversity and explaining variation in terms of sperm morphology, parameters or male sexual characters. Here, we address primate sperm diversity through a compilation of all data available in the literature concerning primate sperm parameters and relationships between them. We also review the factors that can influence primate sperm diversity (e.g. mating systems, trade-off between investments in precopulatory and postcopulatory sexual traits, male and female sexual behaviors, seasonality, social constraints, testosterone levels), and discuss also their relevance to our understanding of human reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3ahuman reproduction 3amales 3areproductive behavior 3asexual selection 3asperm competition 3aspermatozoa 3atestosterone 0aSexual selection 0aSperm competition 0aSemen evaluation 0aTestes 0aSperm allocation 0aTrade-off1 aGarcia, Cécile0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 518 p.110974-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1109743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245013900200300001800339500001400357520190400371592002802275650001302303650002102316650002002337650001702357650001902374650001802393650002002411650002402431650002202455650002202477650001302499650001502512650000902527650002402536650001602560650001902576653002202595653002802617653003402645700001402679700001502693700001202708700001302720700005502733700005302788700001302841700005802854700005602912773015402968856007903122852000903201655001203210IND60727924420221119210340.0210322e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072792442DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2020-187252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Hanpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6211-383410aGenomic analyses and biological validation of candidate genes for rectal temperature as an indicator of heat stress in Holstein cattle  ap. 4441-4451.  aNAL-light  aHeat stress is a major cause of welfare issues and economic losses to the worldwide dairy cattle industry. Genetic selection for heat tolerance has a great potential to positively affect the dairy industry, as the gains are permanent and cumulative over generations. Rectal temperature (RT) is hypothesized to be a good indicator trait of heat tolerance. Therefore, this study investigated the genetic architecture of RT by estimating genetic parameters, performing genome-wide association studies, and biologically validating potential candidate genes identified to be related to RT in Holstein cattle. A total of 33,013 RT records from 7,598 cows were used in this study. In addition, 1,114 cows were genotyped using the Illumina 150K Bovine BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Rectal temperature measurements taken in the morning (AMRT) and in the afternoon (PMRT) are moderately heritable traits, with estimates of 0.09 ± 0.02 and 0.04 ± 0.01, respectively. These 2 traits are also highly genetically correlated (r = 0.90 ± 0.08). A total of 10 SNPs (located on BTA3, BTA4, BTA8, BTA13, BTA14, and BTA29) were found to be significantly associated with AMRT and PMRT. Subsequently, gene expression analyses were performed to validate the key functional genes identified (SPAG17, FAM107B, TSNARE1, RALYL, and PHRF1). This was done through in vitro exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to different temperatures (37°C, 39°C, and 42°C). The relative mRNA expression of 2 genes, FAM107B and PHRF1, significantly changed between the control and heat stressed PBMC. In summary, RT is heritable, and enough genetic variability exists to enable genetic improvement of heat tolerance in Holstein cattle. Important genomic regions were identified and biologically validated; FAM107B and PHRF1 are the main candidate genes identified to influence heat stress response in dairy cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abody temperature 3acattle industry 3adairy cattle 3adairy industry 3adairy science 3agene expression 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic selection 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3aheat 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 0aanimal resilience 0aChinese Holstein cattle 0agenome-wide association study1 aLi, Xiang1 aHu, Lirong1 aXu, Wei1 aChu, Qin1 aLiu, Aoxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9155-14941 aGuo, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8677-63251 aLiu, Lin1 aBrito, Luiz F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5819-09221 aWang, Yachun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3629-28020 tJournal of dairy science.g2021 Apr., v. 104, no. 4 p.4441-4451dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-187253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245005200135300001200187520082400199592002801023650002201051650001501073650001601088650001301104650001801117650001301135650000901148650001601157650001201173651001601185651001801201773012401219852000901343655001201352IND60312952620221120065417.0150714e20150109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031295262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aService, Robert F.12aA soft approach kick-starts cybernetic implants  ap. 114.  aWhen it comes to making cybernetic implants that aim to fuse electronics with biology, a soft touch works best. Researchers in the United States and Switzerland report this week that they were able to restore the ability of paralyzed rats to walk after implanting ultrasoft, pliable electrode arrays along their damaged spines. The soft implants were better able to match the animals' natural movements without detaching from the neural tissue. The softness also helped the implants avoid triggering rejection by the immune system, which could either kill the animals or cause the surrounding tissues to wall off the implants, leaving them useless. In the future, such implants may help restore mobility in paralyzed patients or be used to treat neurological ailments, such as Parkinson's disease and Tourette syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3ahardness 3aimmune system 3apatients 3arats 3aresearchers 3atissues 3aSwitzerland 3aUnited States0 tScience.g2015 Jan. 9, v. 347, no. 6218 p.114-114dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010000171500001900271520159100290592002801881650002501909650002201934650001101956650003101967650002701998650001602025650000902041650001202050651001002062651001002072653002302082653002102105653001802126653002602144653002902170773009002199856008502289852000902374655001202383IND60731454920221120051910.0210519e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawoud, Samir M.10aTechno-economic and sensitivity analysis of hybrid electric sources on off-shore oil facilities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOwing to the low efficiency of off-shore oil ships and the dangerous atmospheric pollutants of the environment that the cause of ships, solar photovoltaic and the energy storage batteries in a ship system are highly attracting attention. The basic objective of this article is to enterprise an optimal model suitable for large oil tanker ships. Therefore, most of this article discussed a design for hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) on an oil ship using a common optimization HOMER software. However, the incorrect sizing of HRES in the oil ships system will transpire higher greenhouse gasses (GHGs) and investment costs. So, this article presents a strategy of HRES on the ships between Egypt and China. The electric load’s profile data used are accurate and real, dependent on the sailing route of the ships directed from Dalian/China to Hurghada/Egypt. The optimal hybrid system contains solar photovoltaic (SPV), batteries storage, and diesel generator engine with a yearly capacity shortage of zero which is assigned to be the system completely reliable. The optimal system can decay the number of GHGs and the fuel consumption by 15,592,000 kg and 5,765,575L respectively in comparison with some stand-alone diesel generations during a project period. This reduction refers to an incentive factor that will lead to an essential role in raising the capacity of SPV installation on the off-shore oil. So, the HRESs minimized the total fuel prices and fuel consumption amounts. This article also discusses a comparison of HRESs on land and off-shore oil in a brief method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3agenerators (equipment) 3agreenhouses 3aoils 3atankers 3aChina 3aEgypt 0aSolar photovoltaic 0aRenewable energy 0aHybrid energy 0aBattery storage units 0aTechno-economic analysis0 tEnergy.g2021 July 15, v. 227 p.120391-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013500164520174900299592002802048650001402076650001502090650002602105650001202131650001002143650001202153650001302165650004302178650001402221650001502235653003102250653004102281653002602322653001402348653002902362653002702391653000902418653000702427653000702434653000802441653000802449653000902457653000802466653000702474700002602481700001402507700001302521700001702534700001602551700001402567700001302581700001802594700001902612700001702631700003502648700001702683700001802700773012102718856008202839852000902921655001202930IND60710771420221119095943.0220103e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071077142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2020.1110252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Heting10aBiological behaviors of mutant proinsulin contribute to the phenotypic spectrum of diabetes associated with insulin gene mutations  aInsulin gene mutation is the second most common cause of neonatal diabetes (NDM). It is also one of the genes involved in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We aim to investigate molecular behaviors of different INS gene variants that may correlate with the clinical spectrum of diabetes phenotypes. In this study, we concentrated on two previously uncharacterized MODY-causing mutants, proinsulin-p.Gly44Arg [G(B20)R] and p.Pro52Leu [P(B28)L] (a novel mutant identified in one French family), and an NDM causing proinsulin-p.(Cys96Tyr) [C(A7)Y]. We find that these proinsulin mutants exhibit impaired oxidative folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with blocked ER export, ER stress, and apoptosis. Importantly, the proinsulin mutants formed abnormal intermolecular disulfide bonds that not only involved the mutant proinsulin, but also the co-expressed WT-proinsulin, forming misfolded disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes. This impaired the intracellular trafficking of WT-proinsulin and limited the production of bioactive mature insulin. Notably, although all three mutants presented with similar defects in folding, trafficking, and dominant negative behavior, the degrees of these defects appeared to be different. Specifically, compared to MODY mutants G(B20)R and P(B28)L that partially affected folding and trafficking of co-expressed WT-proinsulin, the NDM mutant C(A7)Y resulted in an almost complete blockade of the ER export of WT-proinsulin, decreasing insulin production, inducing more severe ER stress and apoptosis. We thus demonstrate that differences in cell biological behaviors among different proinsulin mutants correlate with the spectrum of diabetes phenotypes caused by the different INS gene mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adisulfides 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aexports 3agenes 3amutants 3amutation 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphenotype 3aproinsulin 0aNeonatal diabetes mellitus 0aMaturity onset diabetes of the young 0aProinsulin misfolding 0aER stress 0aDominant negative effect 0aInsulin gene mutations 0aDLPC 0aER 0aEV 0aHMW 0aINS 0aMODY 0aNDM 0aWT1 aSaint-Martin, Cécile1 aXu, Jialu1 aDing, Li1 aWang, Ruodan1 aFeng, Wenli1 aLiu, Ming1 aShu, Hua1 aFan, Zhenqian1 aHaataja, Leena1 aArvan, Peter1 aBellanné-Chantelot, Christine1 aCui, Jingqiu1 aHuang, Yumeng0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 518 p.111025-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1110253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011900168520108300287592002801370650001701398650001301415650001201428650001501440650002001455650002601475650001301501650001301514650001701527650001501544653003901559653003001598653001301628653001601641653001201657700001501669700001401684700002001698700001501718700001901733700001901752773010701771856008701878852000901965655001201974IND60639453720221120034656.0190606e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Chong10aEnhanced biofilm formation and denitrification in biofilters for advanced nitrogen removal by rhamnolipid addition  aDenitrification biofilters (DNBFs) are widely used in advanced nitrogen removal of wastewater with low C/N and effective biofilm formation is critical to their long-term operation. Hereby the influence of rhamnolipid addition in DNBFs was investigated for the first time. Gradient concentrations (0, 20, 40, 80, 120 mg/L) of rhamnolipid were applied to investigate nitrogen removal, biofilm properties and microbial community of lab-scale DNBFs. A significant increase of nitrogen removal was observed in rhamnolipid-treated DNBFs (p < 0.05). Total solid (TS), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and adhesion force of biofilms in DNBF with 120 mg/L rhamnolipid reached the maximum, which were 2.17, 2.15 and 3.36 times of those in the control, respectively. Moreover, rhamnolipid exhibited an improvement in abundance of Simplicispira and Gemmatimonas which were responsible for enhanced biofilm formation and denitrification. The results suggested that rhamnolipid addition can be a novel strategy to improve the start-up and denitrification performance of DNBFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGemmatimonas 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3adenitrification 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3apolymers 3arhamnolipids 3awastewater 0aDenitrification biofilters (DNBFs) 0aAdvanced nitrogen removal 0aStart-up 0aRhamnolipid 0aBiofilm1 aGao, Yilin1 aFan, Xuan1 aPeng, Pengcheng1 aHuang, Hui1 aZhang, Xuxiang1 aRen, Hongqiang0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Sept., v. 287 p.121387-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009400174520137100268592002801639650002301667650002201690650002201712650001501734650002201749651001701771653002201788653002001810653001301830653001601843653001601859700002001875700005901895700005801954773011202012856008702124852000902211655001202220IND60790005420221116151303.0220914e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079000542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.1048322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangani, Tshepiso10aGrass species diversity response to brush packing in semi-arid rangelands of South Africa  aMost semi-arid savannahs in South Africa are being degraded by bush encroachment, resulting in a decline in biodiversity. Four restoration treatments consisting of bush clearing, brush packing, reseeding and a combination of clearing, reseeding and brush packing were tested. Grass diversity was measured in a communal and conservation area using the difference between the baseline year (2017) and two years after restoration (2019). The effect of brush packing versus non-brush packing was further assessed analysing indicator species and the composition of grass species communities. The brush packing and reseeding had a less pronounced effect on grass richness and diversity at the conservation area, however a large effect on grass richness (p < 0.05) at the communal area. The results suggest that brush packing promotes grass diversity under high grazing pressure in communal areas compared to conservation areas. Species evenness was positively affected by brush packing at the communal area, while abundance was not significantly affected by the treatments. Furthermore, the results showed that the grass composition was dissimilar between brush packed and un-brush packed treatments, in the communal area. A higher number of decreasers and perennial grass species were identified in the brush packing treatments compared especially to the communal area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aindicator species 3aperennial grasses 3arangelands 3aspecies diversity 3aSouth Africa 0aBush encroachment 0aGrass diversity 0aLand-use 0aOvergrazing 0aRestoration1 aMarquart, Arnim1 aChirima, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5784-033X1 aKellner, Klaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7502-89350 tJournal of arid environments.g2022 Dec., v. 207 p.104832-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2022.1048323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04317naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245012300197300001600320500002000336520162700356592002801983596005802011596005202069596005902121596006002180596013702240596006402377596005102441650001402492650001802506650002402524650001502548650002902563650002602592650002102618650001102639650001102650650001902661650002002680650002902700650002502729650001802754651001002772700001802782700006002800700001902860700001702879700001502896700005702911700001502968700005302983700001303036700005303049700005403102700005403156700005303210700006003263700005503323700005103378773012003429856007303549852000903622655001203631IND60749893220221116234041.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074989322DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.175792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Zhengbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5028-816710aSpectroscopy outperforms leaf trait relationships for predicting photosynthetic capacity across different forest types  ap. 134-147.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLeaf trait relationships are widely used to predict ecosystem function in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), in which leaf maximum carboxylation capacity (Vc,ₘₐₓ), an important trait for modelling photosynthesis, can be inferred from other easier‐to‐measure traits. However, whether trait–Vc,ₘₐₓ relationships are robust across different forest types remains unclear. Here we used measurements of leaf traits, including one morphological trait (leaf mass per area), three biochemical traits (leaf water content, area‐based leaf nitrogen content, and leaf chlorophyll content), one physiological trait (Vc,ₘₐₓ), as well as leaf reflectance spectra, and explored their relationships within and across three contrasting forest types in China. We found weak and forest type‐specific relationships between Vc,ₘₐₓ and the four morphological and biochemical traits (R² ≤ 0.15), indicated by significantly changing slopes and intercepts across forest types. By contrast, reflectance spectroscopy effectively collapsed the differences in the trait–Vc,ₘₐₓ relationships across three forest biomes into a single robust model for Vc,ₘₐₓ (R² = 0.77), and also accurately estimated the four traits (R² = 0.75–0.94). These findings challenge the traditional use of the empirical trait–Vc,ₘₐₓ relationships in TBMs for estimating terrestrial plant photosynthesis, but also highlight spectroscopy as an efficient alternative for characterising Vc,ₘₐₓ and multitrait variability, with critical insights into ecosystem modelling and functional trait ecology.  aPublisher supplied data  a27306020cResearch Grants Council Early Career Scheme  a#31922090cNSFC‐Excellent Young Scholar Grant  a31901086cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cDivision of Ecology and Biodiversity PDF research award  cThe Innovation and Technology Fund (funding support to State Key Laboratories in Hong Kong of Agrobiotechnology) of the HKSAR, China  aDE‐SC0012704cUnited States Department of Energy contract  a201905159005cHKU Seed Fund for Basic Research 3abiosphere 3acarboxylation 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aleaf nitrogen content 3aleaf reflectance 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aplants (botany) 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aspecific leaf weight 3awater content 3aChina1 aGuo, Zhengfei1 aSerbin, Shawn P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4136-89711 aSong, Guangqin1 aZhao, Yingyi1 aChen, Yang1 aWu, Shengbiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4569-63661 aWang, Jing1 aWang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5274-75661 aLi, Jing1 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0893-05391 aWu, Yuntao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6505-18511 aSu, Yanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7931-339X1 aWang, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2482-18181 aRogers, Alistair1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9262-74301 aLiu, Lingli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5696-31511 aWu, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8991-39700 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Oct., v. 232, no. 1 p.134-147dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.175793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245005700211300001100268520161200279592002801891650001901919650002301938650002401961650000901985650002001994650001502014650001302029650001302042773014102055856008302196852000902279655001202288IND60744831020221116202925.0220530e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074483102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-021-01508-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadden, Joah Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0691-096710aHow many gamebirds are released in the UK each year?  ap. 72.  aLarge numbers of gamebirds (pheasants Phasianus colchicus, red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa and mallard Anus platyrhynchos) are released annually in the UK to support recreational shooting. It is important to know how many of these birds are being released because their release and management has ecological effects on the wildlife and habitats of the UK. There is little regulation governing their release, and consequently, an accurate figure for the numbers being released is unknown. I took 12 different approaches, totalling 4329 estimates of the numbers of birds being released annually, based on a series of datasets that described numbers of birds being held for breeding, rearing or release, being released, managed or shot on game shoots, being shot by individual guns or being recorded during breeding bird surveys. These 12 approaches produced estimates ranging from 14.7 to 106.1 million with a mean of 43.2 million (95% CI 29.0–57.3 million). This suggests that 31.5 million pheasants (range 29.8–33.7 million), 9.1 million red-legged partridges (range 5.6–12.5 million) and 2.6 million mallard (range 0.9–6.0 million) are released annually in the UK. These figures differ substantially from both official records of gamebirds and previous published estimates, and I discuss why such differences may occur. I set these figures in the context of the number and behaviour of shoots operating in the UK. Improved estimates of numbers of gamebird being released are critical if we are to better understand the ecological effects occurring in areas where they are released and managed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlectoris rufa 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aPhasianus colchicus 3aanus 3adata collection 3agame birds 3aresearch 3awildlife0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2021 Aug., v. 67, no. 4 p.72-72dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-021-01508-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013400173300001600307520195600323592002802279650002002307650002502327650002202352650001102374650001902385650001002404650001002414650001602424650001402440650001902454650001402473650002302487650001402510650001202524650001802536650001502554650002202569650004402591653002102635653001702656653002102673653002002694653002002714653002902734700002202763700001802785700002302803700002302826700002202849773010302871856008602974852000903060655001203069IND60581038220221119055735.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058103822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossbach, Lisa M.10aSub-lethal effects of waterborne exposure to copper nanoparticles compared to copper sulphate on the shore crab (Carcinus maenas)  ap. 245-255.  aThe toxicity of soluble copper (Cu) to marine organisms is reasonably well described. However, the hazard of Cu engineered nanomaterial (ENMs) is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to compare the toxicity of Cu ENMs to Cu as CuSO4 in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. The crabs were exposed via the water using a semi-static approach to 0.2 or 1mgL−1 of Cu ENMs or 1mgL−1 of Cu as CuSO4. Gills, hepatopancreas, chela muscle and haemolymph were collected at days 0, 4 and 7 for the body burden of Cu, histology and biochemical analysis [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total glutathione (GSH)]. Nominal exposure concentrations of both the ENMs and the metal salt were maintained at over 80% in each treatment throughout the experiment. By day 7, 54% mortality was recorded in the 1mgL−1 CuSO4 treatment, compared to just 21% in the 1mgL−1 Cu ENM-exposed crabs. The target organs for Cu accumulation were similar for both forms of Cu with highest concentrations in the gills, particularly the posterior gills; followed by the hepatopancreas, and with the lowest concentrations in the chela muscle. No changes were observed in the osmolarity of the haemolymph (ANOVA, P>0.05). TBARS were measured as an indicator of lipid peroxidation and showed the greatest change in the anterior and posterior gills and hepatopancreas of animals exposed to 1mgL−1 Cu ENMs (ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, P<0.05). No statistically significant changes in total GSH were observed (ANOVA, P>0.05; n=6 crabs per treatment). Histological analysis revealed organ injuries in all treatments. The types of pathologies observed in the Cu ENM treatments were broadly similar to those of the Cu as CuSO4 treatment. Overall, the target organs and Cu accumulation from Cu ENMs were comparable to that following exposure to Cu as CuSO4, and although there were some differences in the sub-lethal effects, the metal salt was more acutely toxic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarcinus maenas 3aanalysis of variance 3aaquatic organisms 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3acrabs 3agills 3aglutathione 3ahemolymph 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistology 3alipid peroxidation 3amortality 3amuscles 3ananoparticles 3aosmolarity 3asublethal effects 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aMarine organisms 0aAccumulation 0aOxidative stress 0aOrgan pathology 0aCopper toxicity 0aEngineered nanomaterials1 aShaw, Benjamin J.1 aPiegza, Dawid1 aVevers, William F.1 aAtfield, Andrew J.1 aHandy, Richard D.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2017 Oct., v. 191 p.245-255dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010100165520082800266592002801094650001001122650001401132650002001146650001801166650001201184650001201196650001901208650001401227650001201241650001701253653001401270653003801284653002501322653001801347653001401365700001301379700001201392700001601404700001901420700005401439773010601493856008701599852000901686655001201695IND60639453920221120034635.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yan14aThe mechanism of wet/dry torrefaction pretreatment on the pyrolysis performance of tobacco stalk  aIn this work, the influence of dry/wet torrefaction with additives on the pyrolysis performance was investigated. The results showed that the content of phenols and ketones (62% and 42%) was improved and the content of acids decreased from 35% to 4% due to the increase of lignin content in torrefied char. Moreover, the content of aromatic hydrocarbon reached 22%. The mechanism showed that the conversion of “CO/CO” into states of “aromatic CC/CC”, the removal of hemicellulose and the formation of pseudo-lignin during wet/dry torrefaction were the key factors for the enrichment of aromatic hydrocarbon. The research supplied an effective and original method for obtaining high value aromatic chemicals from the agricultural and forestry waste via the wet/dry torrefaction pretreatment combining with pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aadditives 3acarbon monoxide 3ahemicellulose 3aketones 3aphenols 3aplant residues 3apyrolysis 3atobacco 3atorrefaction 0aPyrolysis 0aWet/dry torrefaction pretreatment 0aAromatic hydrocarbon 0aPseudo-lignin 0aMechanism1 aHe, Zhen1 aTu, Ren1 aWu, Yu-jian1 aJiang, En-chen1 aXu, Xi-wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0607-402X0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Aug., v. 286 p.121390-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011800162300001600280520130600296592002801602596005901630596005801689596006301747650001801810650002901828650002301857650001701880650001801897650001801915650001201933650002401945650001001969650001301979650001801992650001102010700001702021700001902038700001502057700001302072700001802085700001602103700001702119773016102136856008202297852000902379655001202388IND60630336620221119132621.0190426e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-018-2116-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Jing10aModification of isoprene synthesis to enable production of curcurbitadienol synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 147-157.  aCucurbitane-type triterpenoids such as mogrosides and cucurbitacins that are present in the plants of Cucurbitaceae are widely used in Asian traditional medicine. Cucurbitadienol is the skeleton of cucurbitane-type triterpenoids. As an alternative production strategy, we developed baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a microbial host for the eventual transformation of cucurbitadienol. The synthetic pathway of cucurbitadienol was constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by introducing the cucurbitadienol synthase gene from different plants, resulting in 7.80 mg cucurbitadienol from 1 L of fermentation broth. Improving supplies of isoprenoid precursors was then investigated for increasing cucurbitadienol production. Cucurbitadienol production increased to 21.47 mg/L through the overexpression of a global regulatory factor (UPC2) gene of triterpenoid synthase. In addition, knockout of the ERG7 gene increased cucurbitadienol production from 21.47 to 61.80 mg/L. Finally, fed-batch fermentation was performed, and 63.00 mg/L cucurbitadienol was produced. This work is an important step towards the total biosynthesis of valuable cucurbitane-type triterpenoids and demonstrates the potential for developing a sustainable and secure yeast biomanufacturing platform for triterpenoids.  aPublisher supplied data  a81573521cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a5172028cBeijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation  a2017-I2 M-1-013cCAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences 3aCucurbitaceae 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abatch fermentation 3abiosynthesis 3acucurbitacins 3aculture media 3aenzymes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aisoprene 3atriterpenoids 3ayeasts1 aLuo, Zuliang1 aCui, Shengrong1 aZhao, Huan1 aTang, Qi1 aMo, Changming1 aMa, Xiaojun1 aDing, Zimian0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 46, no. 2 p.147-157dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-018-2116-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172520105500271592002801326650001501354650002201369650001101391650001601402650001201418650002201430650001601452650001301468650001601481653002001497653002201517653002201539653002101561653002401582700001601606700001901622700001601641700001901657700001401676773009001690856008501780852000901865655001201874IND60731451720221120132958.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Tiancheng12aA novel state of charge estimation method for lithium-ion batteries based on bias compensation  aAccurate and efficient state-of-charge estimation for lithium-ion batteries are extremely crucial for electrical vehicles. A lot of researches make great progress on joint estimation algorithms. However, the combination of different algorithms brings too many design parameters, which reduces the accuracy of estimation and computational efficiency. In this paper, an adaptive H-infinity filter with bias compensation is proposed. Static condition and dynamic condition are set to verify the proposed algorithm in the experiments. In the dynamic condition, the proposed algorithm is verified and compared with the other three joint estimation algorithms at temperatures of 40 °C, 25 °C, 10 °C and 0 °C. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency under two operating conditions and four temperatures, and the average time consumption of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 0.9%, 2.25% and 34.14%, respectively, compared with the other combinations of different algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3aexhibitions 3afilters 3alithium batteries 3amethodology 3aresearch 3atemperature 0aState-of-charge 0aH-infinity filter 0aBias compensation 0aJoint estimation 0aLithium-ion battery1 aXu, Peihang1 aChen, Jingxian1 aSu, Zixiang1 aHuang, Guicong1 aChen, Nan0 tEnergy.g2021 July 01, v. 226 p.120348-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04719naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245015200169500002200321520281400343592002803157650001603185650003903201650002503240650001703265650001803282650002503300650001803325650001503343650002403358650002203382650001503404650002403419650000903443650002003452650002103472650002403493650001703517650001803534650001303552650001203565650001903577650001003596651001003606653002903616653003203645653003803677653004503715653002203760700001803782700002603800700002503826700002103851700001603872700001703888773009503905856008404000852000904084655001204093IND60656997820221120045336.0190819e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065699782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2019.1043702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModak, Kingshuk10aResponse of oxidative stability of aggregate-associated soil organic carbon and deep soil carbon sequestration to zero-tillage in subtropical India  aPre-press version  aWorldwide, conservation agriculture (CA) practices have been recognized to enhance soil health by optimizing key soil attributes. But, the potential of CA to soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and enhancing its oxidative stability (OXS) in deep layers and aggregates are less highlighted. Thus, our aim was to study the long-term effects of contrasting tillage treatments and residue addition on soil aggregation, C pools and sequestration and OXS in bulk soils and aggregates. For this an experiment was laid out in a split plot design with two tillage practices in main plot (zero-tillage: ZT and conventional tillage: CT) and four residue management practices in sub-plot (No residue: NR, wheat residue: WR, soybean residue: SR and wheat + soybean residue: WR + SR) in 2007. Soil samples at 0-5, 5-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm layers were analyzed. The ZT plots had ˜26 and 15% higher macroaggregate associated C than CT plots in 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil layers, respectively. In macroaggregates of first two soil layers, recalcitrant C was (a) ˜57, 76 and 63%; and (b) 85, 59 and 40% greater in WR + SR, SR and WR plots over NR, respectively. Similar trend was observed for microaggregate associated recalcitrant C. The OXS of C in ZT was ˜21% higher than CT, but residue addition had no impact on OXS. In 15-30 and 30-60 cm soil layers, OXS in WR + SR plots were ˜28 and 31% greater than NR. Although, deep soil layers (15-60 cm) accounted for ˜68% of sequestered C, tillage had no impact on deep soil C sequestration. The SOC accumulation rates in WR + SR, SR and WR plots were ˜9.8, 8 and 5.9 times greater in top layers and ˜8.1, 7.0 and 4.8 times greater in deep layers over NR, respectively. The SOC sequestration rate of WR + SR, SR and WR plots were ˜13.5, 11.5 and 9 times greater in top layers and ˜5.8, 5.6 and 4.5 times greater in deep layers over NR, respectively. Only ˜85% of total SOC stock in top soil was stored in soil aggregates. Contrarily, of total sequestered SOC in top soil only ˜30% was sequestered by aggregates of that layer indicating the role of silt + clay fraction in SOC sequestration in tropical Inceptisol. Residue addition significantly improved SOC sequestration in soil aggregates. Despite storing ˜85% of total SOC, aggregates could store only 30% of SOC in 0-15 cm soil layer. Thus, SOC sequestration in tropical soil is very sluggish and would require long time to meet saturation deficit. Interestingly, crop yield was significantly influenced by active and labile C of bulk soils and aggregates, but not by recalcitrant C in ZT plots. Thus, ZT involving crop residue retention have great potential to enhancing C sequestration and stability in deep soil and soil aggregates to sustain soil health and crop production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInceptisols 3aagricultural conservation practice 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclay fraction 3aconventional tillage 3acrop residues 3acrop yield 3aexperimental design 3along term effects 3ano-tillage 3aoxidative stability 3asilt 3asoil aggregates 3asoil aggregation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3asoybeans 3atopsoil 3atropical soils 3awheat 3aIndia 0aConservation agriculture 0aMacro- and micro-aggregates 0aSoil organic carbon sequestration 0aZero-tillage versus Conventional tillage 0aSubtropical India1 aGhosh, Avijit1 aBhattacharyya, Ranjan1 aBiswas, Dipak Ranjan1 aDas, Tapas Kumar1 aDas, Shrila1 aSingh, Geeta0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Aug. 09, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016800169520087500337592002801212650002301240650002001263650002801283650001201311650001201323650001901335650001101354650001301365650001401378650002101392650002201413650001101435653002201446653003001468653003401498653003101532653002201563700001601585700001701601700001801618700001501636773010601651856008701757852000901844655001201853IND60639454020221123043749.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, Wenjun14aThe sequential Fenton oxidation and sulfomethylation pretreatment for alleviating the negative effects of lignin in enzymatic saccharification of sugarcane bagasse  aThe sugarcane bagasse (SCB) was pretreated by the sequential Fenton oxidation and sulfomethylation pretreatment (FSP) for reducing the lignin inhibition in enzymatic saccharification.

They are considered locally in the scope of certain operations such as urban development, mining, or activities that are being assessed in the environment impact assessment procedures or spatial and strategical planning. Regarding the protection and the planning processes connected with it, geomorphological features should be considered in the right scale and with all of its values and services that are being provided to the environment on a landscape scale. In this paper, geodiversity and its role in landscape evolution will be connected and explained with the example of subgeomorphological region Ogulinsko-plašćanska Zavala, in the mountainous Dinaric karst part of Croatia. As it has been a region with long human and nature interaction, and a region with preserved natural and seminatural landscapes, it is a suitable area for such an analysis. In order to properly assess the geomorphological features as one of the determinants of landscape, the basis for environment impact assessment procedures and spatial planning procedures, geoecological analysis of geodiversity and landscape services occurrence and spatial distribution is carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3ahumans 3akarsts 3alandscapes 3amountains 3aurban development 3aCroatia 0alandscape typology 0ageodiversity 0arelative relief assessment method1 aBuzjak, Nenad0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2020 June 01, v. 39, no. 2 p.130-144dSciendowJournal:23080x1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eko-2020-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010800153300001600261520097500277592002801252650002701280650002701307650002901334650001901363650001801382650002301400650001801423650001101441650000901452650001101461650001901472700001901491700002001510700001701530773011901547856007401666852000901740655001201749IND60640101720221117191937.0190504e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064010172DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra22098j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Lin10aLiposome containing nutmeg oil as the targeted preservative against Listeria monocytogenes in dumplings  ap. 978-986.  aIn this study, the antibacterial activities of nutmeg oil and nutmeg oil encapsulated in liposome were evaluated. First, nutmeg oil exhibited a significant antibacterial effect on L. monocytogenes by damaging the integrity of the cell membrane, leading to the leakage of ATP and nucleic acid. Subsequently, nutmeg oil was encapsulated in liposome to enhance its chemical stability using a thin film dispersion method. The optimal Zeta potential (−49.2 mV) and entrapment efficiency (26.90%) of liposome were achieved at 5.0 mg mL⁻¹ nutmeg oil encapsulation. Finally, the selective antibacterial activity for L. monocytogenes using pore-forming toxins (PFTs) to trigger the release of nutmeg oil from liposome was examined by time-kill analysis and gas chromatography (GC). The long-term antibacterial activity test showed that nutmeg oil encapsulated in liposome could extend the treatment time and improve the antibacterial effect on L. monocytogenes in dumplings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantibacterial properties 3acell membranes 3aencapsulation 3agas chromatography 3anucleic acids 3anutmeg 3aoils 3atoxins 3azeta potential1 aZhang, Xuejing1 aZhao, Chengting1 aCui, Haiying0 tRSC advances.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 6, no. 2 p.978-986dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra22098j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245013600175300002000311500001900331520135900350592002801709596008601737596005901823596008901882650001301971650001801984650001502002650001402017650001302031651001102044651001002055700003202065700002902097700003902126700006002165773015402225856008302379852000902462655001202471IND60739390520221119043205.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073939052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12213-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, Muryllo Santos12aA scientometric analysis of ecotoxicological studies with the herbicide atrazine and microalgae and cyanobacteria as test organisms  ap. 25196-25206.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtrazine (ATZ) is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. A scientometric study was conducted to analyze the evolution of research on ATZ. The study also looked at the use of microalgae and cyanobacteria as biological models for toxicity tests during the period from 1959 to 2019, in the category of toxicology of Web of Science. The results show an increase in the number of scientific publications mainly in the USA, Canada, and China. The majority of papers was published in journals with high impact factors, demonstrating the relevance of such studies. About 83% of the studies aimed to evaluate the effect of ATZ on non-target organisms. From those, 7.5% included microalgae and cyanobacteria. The majority of them worked with chlorophyceae to perform toxicity bioassays of ATZ and analyze its sublethal effects. The gaps identified by this analysis included a small number of collaborations between research groups from different countries; the number of studies with terrestrial organisms, which are larger in comparison to aquatic organisms; and the fact that none of the studies with ATZ and microalgae was performed in the field. These findings can point out to researchers and funding agencies the gaps in knowledge on the toxic effects of ATZ and guide the development of new research projects as well as environmental policies.  aPublisher supplied data  aPQ 309605/2017-2cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aIFS I-2-A/5350-2cInternational Foundation for Science  aIFS I-2-A/5350-2 (co-financed)cOrganisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 3aatrazine 3aecotoxicology 3amicroalgae 3apollution 3aresearch 3aCanada 3aChina1 aBarbosa, Fabiana Gonçalves1 aGuimarães, Pablo Santos1 aMartins, Camila De Martinez Gaspar1 aZanette, Juliano1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8107-24680 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 20 p.25196-25206dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12213-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015500157300002000312520109300332592002801425650001101453650002201464650001001486650002401496650001601520650001001536650001501546650001901561650001901580650002401599650001901623650001301642650001401655700001901669700001801688700001701706773012401723856007401847852000901921655001201930IND60640101820221117191909.0190504e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064010182DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra22102a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Xuqiang10aModulating photogenerated electron transfer with selectively exposed Co–Mo facets on a novel amorphous g-C₃N₄/CoₓMo₁₋ₓS₂ photocatalyst  ap. 23709-23717.  aNovel photocatalysts, g-C₃N₄/CoₓMo₁₋ₓS₂ with different exposed facets of Co–Mo, were employed as catalysts for the examination of facet-dependent catalytic activity toward photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting with Eosin Y photosensitized as an antenna molecule under visible light irradiation. The studies showed that the g-C₃N₄/CoₓMo₁₋ₓS₂ photocatalysts had higher activities than g-C₃N₄/MoS₂ and g-C₃N₄/CoSₓ. The promoter Co atoms associated with Mo displayed synergistic effects and efficiently induced photo-generated charge carriers and electron transfer.

Extreme weather events such as urban flooding disrupt transportation networks with delays, diversions, and partial or full closure of roads and, thereby, influence human movement patterns. Most studies in the field of transportation network failure due to urban flooding are focused only on micro-scale, in-situ approaches rather than referring to the holistic impact on the entire transportation system. Moreover, such approaches are failed to address the changes in travel behaviour concerning their trip purpose, mode choice, and income which can be changed due to inundation. Hence, this study presents a novel approach to assess the entire transportation system failure due to urban flooding. Consequently, the impact of urban flooding on human movement patterns was assessed. The proposed framework is developed based on the network centrality measures, namely, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. The study is predominantly based on Open-Source GIS tools and the case study is carried out in Colombo, Sri Lanka which has the highest concentration of population and transportation network. The hotspots of the failure of the network were statistically and spatially illustrated. The study revealed three key findings; (a) the fragmented network due to inundated road segments triggers the spatial changes in the accessibility, particularly decreasing the accessibility in most of the core areas whereas increasing the accessibility in some peripheral areas which are not significant under the baseline condition (2) the functional changes of the entire transport network occurs due to flooding events (3) the considerable changes in the trip length occurs due to the disruption of transport network links and the impact is mostly notable in long-distance trips compared to short distance trips. The proposed framework can be utilized as a planning tool for both disaster practitioners and infrastructure operators in identifying the flood risk; and prioritizing flood mitigation investments, thereby, making the transportation system more robust to extreme flooding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aflood control 3ageography 3ahumans 3aincome 3arisk 3atravel 3aSri Lanka 0aCritical infrastructure 0aNetwork analysis 0aTransportation resilience 0aTransport planning 0aUrban planning 0aUrban simulation 0aGIS1 aJayasinghe, Amila1 aKalpana, Hasintha Nawod1 aWijegunarathna, Eshi Eranga1 aMahanama, P.K.S.0 tApplied geography.g2022 Oct., v. 147 p.102772-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.1027723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245013500161520219900296592002802495650001702523650001702540650001102557650002902568650003902597650001202636650001902648650002102667650001402688650001502702650001502717650000902732650001102741650002002752650001702772650001202789650002002801650001802821650001202839650003102851650001602882650000902898653002202907653001902929653001602948653002402964653003002988700002703018773009803045856008403143852000903227655001203236IND60656998220221120192017.0190815e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065699822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2019.1043522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Pu10aEffects of soil organic residue amendment on losses of dissolved organic carbon, P, Cu and Zn via surface runoff from arable soils  aDissolved organic carbon (DOC) constitutes the largest carbon pool in surface waters, with soil being its main source via surface and subsurface runoff. Amendment with organic residues can reduce soil erosion and surface runoff, but little is known how this affects the amount and composition of DOC losses via surface runoff and the associated transfer of nutrients and pollutants. In this study, artificial rainfall experiments were conducted on three pairs of soil runoff plots with contrasting organic matter management. A mixture of grass and wheat straw residues was incorporated into the topsoil of one plot in each pair (OI treatment) but not into the other (control). Artificial rainfall was applied onto both treatments at an intensity of 49.1 mm h−1, and surface runoff samples were collected at designated time steps for analysis of DOC, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), copper (TDCu) and zinc (TDZn) concentrations, as well as for characterization of DOC by UV–vis absorbance (SUVA254 and E2:E3) and fluorescence spectroscopy (FI) indexes. The organic amendment reduced the loss rates of DOC, TDP, TDCu and TDZn by reducing surface runoff, although increasing the concentrations of DOC, TDP and TDCu. Regardless of the treatment, DOC, TDP and TDCu concentrations were always maximal at the onset of runoff and then continuously decreased after the initial flush. The observed relationships of TDP and TDCu concentrations with DOC indicate that the export of “dissolved” P and Cu primarily occurred in DOC-bound form, while the concentration of TDZn was not correlated with that of DOC. Surface runoff from the amended soils generally contained more hydrophilic and low molecular weight DOC (as indicated by low SUVA254 and high E2:E3 and FI values), particularly at high DOC concentrations. The ratio between TDCu and DOC concentration showed a positive relationship to DOC aromaticity (as indicated by SUVA254 values) in the OI treatment. The results indicate that organic amendment can reduce total rates of dissolved element losses with surface runoff, but attention should also be paid to the composition of lost DOC and the concentrations of DOC-associated solutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3acarbon sinks 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agrasses 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular weight 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil amendments 3asoil erosion 3asolutes 3asubsurface flow 3asurface water 3atopsoil 3atotal dissolved phosphorus 3awheat straw 3azinc 0aOrganic amendment 0aSurface runoff 0aHeavy metal 0aUV–vis absorbance 0aFluorescence spectroscopy1 aSchulin, R.q(Rainer),0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Dec., v. 195dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010700168300001400275520177700289592002802066650002502094650001602119650000902135650001802144650001202162650002002174650001502194650001202209650001302221650000902234650001502243650001802258653001802276653001802294653002502312653002502337653002002362653001902382700002502401700001402426700001802440700001702458773011602475856008802591852000902679655001202688IND60581038720221119055703.0190318e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058103872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoizat, A.10aAntibiotic use by farmers to control mastitis as influenced by health advice and dairy farming systems  ap. 61-72.  aMastitis is a bacterial disease common in dairy farms. Although knowledge about mastitis and its optimal technical management and treatment is now available, some dairy farmers still use antibiotics in inappropriate ways. Antibiotic use by farmers can be influenced by personal restraints and motivations, but it can be assumed that external drivers are also influential. The main purpose of this article is thus to analyse the choices of antibiotic and alternative medicine use for mastitis treatment and investigate the possible influence of two unexplored external drivers in dairy farms: (i) the health advice offered to farmers by farm advisors and veterinarians, (ii) the dairy farming system, as defined by combining the market valuation chosen for the milk, the level of intensification, and the perceived pressure related to investments. Research was based on 51 individual semi-structured interviews with farmers and their corresponding veterinarians and farm advisors. Based on verbatim, the use of antibiotics and alternative medicine by farmers for mastitis treatment, the vet-farmers interactions, and the dairy farming systems are described. The advisory relationships between farmers and farm advisors and between farmers and veterinarians influenced the implementation of selective dry cow therapy, but had very little effect on the use of alternative medicines by farmers, who were more willing to experiment alternative medicines than their advisors. The dairy farming system had very little influence on antibiotic use: some misuse of antibiotics was found whatever the farming system. Systematic dry cow therapy was also a widespread habit in all dairy farming systems except organic. The use of alternative medicine was common in all farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative medicine 3aantibiotics 3acows 3adairy farming 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3ainterviews 3amarkets 3amastitis 3amilk 3amotivation 3aveterinarians 0aVeterinarians 0aFarm advisors 0aQualitative approach 0aAlternative medicine 0aIntensification 0aMilk valuation1 aBonnet-Beaugrand, F.1 aRault, A.1 aFourichon, C.1 aBareille, N.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 146 p.61-72dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010600167520103700273592002801310650002101338650002901359650002101388650001401409650002001423650001701443650001101460650003901471650001901510650001701529650002401546650001801570650001701588653003001605653001901635653000901654653001901663653002101682700001501703700001701718700001901735700001201754700001401766700001701780773010801797856008601905852000901991655001202000IND60790006220221116151353.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079000622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1199672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jinliu10aVis-UV Upconverting bacteriostatic hydrophobic bacterial cellulose film for personal protective masks  aMasks are key to personal protection and their bacteriostatic properties, which are generally overlooked, should be maximized. Towards this goal, a YPS-Pr-Li/BC upconversion antibacterial composite film was prepared by mixing upconversion powder with bacterial cellulose (BC) using a vacuum assisted method. When combined with the low surface energy of stearic acid (STA), the resulting YPS-Pr-Li/BC/STA film had an improved hydrophobic surface. The developed film was characterized by FT-IR, SEM, XRD, and fluorescence spectrophotometry. The results showed that the composite film was successfully prepared and had ultraviolet, visible upconversion luminescence. The bacteriostatic experiments showed that the material had excellent bacteriostatic performance against E. coli and S. aureus under visible light, with a bacteriostatic rate reaching 99 %. The in-vitro cytotoxicity tests showed that YPS-Pr-Li/BC/STA had excellent biocompatibility and could be used in personal protective clothing with close contact with human skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3acellulose 3acomposite films 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3aluminescence 3aprotective clothing 3askin (animal) 3astearic acid 0aUpconversion luminescence 0aBacteriostasis 0aMask 0aHydrophobicity 0aBiocompatibility1 aZhao, Hang1 aZhang, Liang1 aChai, Shouning1 aLiu, Hu1 aWang, Yao1 aXue, Juanqin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 297 p.119967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1199673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011900173520153300292592002801825650001701853650002501870650001101895650002001906650001101926650001901937650000901956650001701965651000901982653002301991653001902014653003402033653001502067653001602082653002402098700002702122700002002149700002102169773009002190856008502280852000902365655001202374IND60731452420221120153037.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafaeipour, Ali10aIdentifying challenges and barriers for development of solar energy by using fuzzy best-worst method: A case study  aEnergy is a main factor for sustainable and economic development of many countries in the world. The objective of this paper is to investigate barriers facing solar energy development in Iran through a case study conducted on the Alborz Province. A questionnaire was designed and then submitted to the professionals in the field of solar energy. First, the identified barriers are classified into five categories of technical, legal, economic, sociocultural, and support by help of experts. Then, the fuzzy Best-Worst method is used to determine importance of the identified criteria and sub-criteria for development of the solar energy sector in the region. The findings indicate that the primary barriers to solar energy development are economic factors which are related to the adverse impact of the uncertain economic conditions including the sanctions against Iran. Because of the high risk of new business, domestic people do not have enough ambition and interest in starting new renewable energy projects. The low price of fossil fuels (in the economic category as sub-criteria), has the most significant impact on the stagnation of this sector, which is related to the ease of access to energy in Iran and its effect on the interest in renewable energy use. Supporting the private sectors by receiving financial incentives can help development of the renewable energy sector in the province. By using similar research for other regions, decision makers can accurately identify challenges for development of solar energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asolar energy 3aIran 0aRenewable energies 0aPrioritisation 0aFuzzy BWM (Best worst method) 0aChallenges 0aDevelopment 0aSolar energy sector1 aAlvandimanesh, Marzieh1 aNajafi, Fatemeh1 aIssakhov, Alibek0 tEnergy.g2021 July 01, v. 226 p.120355-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245018000200300001800380500002000398520150500418592002801923596005401951650002002005650001802025650001202043650002102055650001702076650002402093650001102117650002502128650001202153650002202165650001302187650001502200650001602215650001502231650001002246650001002256700002302266700001602289773012102305856007302426852000902499655001202508IND60669594520221118103058.0190920e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066959452DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.151952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChybicki, Igor J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4054-889010aBayesian quantification of ecological determinants of outcrossing in natural plant populations: Computer simulations and the case study of biparental inbreeding in English yew  ap. 4077-4096.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe mating system is a central parameter of plant biology because it shapes their ecological and evolutionary properties. Therefore, determining ecological variables that influence the mating system is important for a deeper understanding of the functioning of plant populations. Here, using old concepts and recent statistical developments, we propose a new statistical tool to make inferences about ecological determinants of outcrossing in natural plant populations. The method requires codominant genotypes of seeds collected from maternal plants within different locations. Using extensive computer simulations, we demonstrated that the method is robust to the issues expected for real‐world data, including the Wahlund effect, inbreeding and genotyping errors such as allele dropout and allele misclassification. Furthermore, we showed that the estimates of ecological effects and outcrossing rates can be severely biased if genotyping errors and genetic differentiation are not treated explicitly. Application of the new method to the case study of a dioecious tree (Taxus baccata) allowed revealing that female trees that grow in lower local densities have a greater tendency towards mating with relatives. Moreover, we also demonstrated that biparental inbreeding is higher in populations that are characterized by a longer mean distance between trees and a smaller mean trunk perimeter. We found these results to agree with both the theoretical predictions and the history of English yew.  aPublisher supplied data  aUMO‐2014/15/B/NZ9/04404cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3aBayesian theory 3aTaxus baccata 3aalleles 3aallelic dropouts 3acase studies 3acomputer simulation 3adioecy 3aenvironmental impact 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainbreeding 3aoutcrossing 3aprediction 3aseeds 3atrees1 aIszkuło, Grzegorz1 aSuszka, Jan0 tMolecular ecology.g2019 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.4077-4096dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.151953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01322naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245004200159300001600201500002000217520040700237592002800644650001300672650001300685651001500698700002300713700001800736700002100754700001800775773013100793856007500924852000900999655001201008IND60779956320221117030908.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077995632DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.124392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermans, Johan10a1020.

One of the most important components of forest fire management is the forecasting of fire danger conditions. Here, our aim was to critically analyse the following issues, (i) current operational forest fire danger forecasting systems and their limitations; (ii) remote sensing-based fire danger monitoring systems and usefulness in operational perspective; (iii) remote sensing-based fire danger forecasting systems and their functional implications; and (iv) synergy between operational forecasting systems and remote sensing-based methods. In general, the operational systems use point-based measurements of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, wind speed and direction, relative humidity, precipitations, cloudiness, solar radiation, etc.) and generate danger maps upon employing interpolation techniques. Theoretically, it is possible to overcome the uncertainty associated with the interpolation techniques by using remote sensing data. During the last several decades, efforts were given to develop fire danger condition systems, which could be broadly classified into two major groups: fire danger monitoring and forecasting systems. Most of the monitoring systems focused on determining the danger during and/or after the period of image acquisition. A limited number of studies were conducted to forecast fire danger conditions, which could be adaptable. Synergy between the operational systems and remote sensing-based methods were investigated in the past but too much complex in nature. Thus, the elaborated understanding about these developments would be worthwhile to advance research in the area of fire danger in the context of making them operational.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3afire hazard 3aforest fire management 3aforest fires 3amonitoring 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3aspatial data 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awind speed 0aFire occurrence 0aMeteorological/environmental variables 0aSystem development 0aSpatial dynamics 0aOptical/thermal/radar imaging1 aHassan, Quazi K.0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2015 June, v. 104 p.224-236dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The 3D Optical Metrology (3DOM) unit of the Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK) in Trento (Italy) has collected VHR satellite imagery, as well as aerial and terrestrial data over Trento for creating a complete testfield for investigations on image radiometry, geometric accuracy, automatic digital surface model (DSM) generation, 2D/3D feature extraction, city modelling and data fusion. This paper addresses the radiometric and the geometric aspects of the VHR spaceborne imagery included in the Trento testfield and their potential for 3D information extraction. The dataset consist of two stereo-pairs acquired by WorldView-2 and by GeoEye-1 in panchromatic and multispectral mode, and a triplet from Pléiades-1A.

However, safe and alternative methods such as those based on organic materials need to be developed. Our study has evaluated (i) the effects of four organic amendments with different biochemical compositions that are abundantly produced in the study area (Guadeloupe, French West Indies) on soil nematode communities and (ii) some of the suppression mechanisms of banana parasitic nematodes, especially those involving the soil food web. This study is based on a microcosm experiment comparing sugarcane bagasse, sugarcane sludge, plant residues and sewage sludge. All amendments except sewage sludge decreased the root abundances of plant–parasitic nematodes, by 96% in the case of sugarcane bagasse. For this treatment, soil densities of carnivorous nematodes were six times higher than the treatments without organic amendment. Plant residues and bagasse were mainly composed of materials that are difficult to decompose, namely cellulose and lignins. These organic materials favored a fungal decomposition pathway and permitted development of carnivorous nematode populations and increased the Channel Index (CI). Pratylenchus coffeae control after sugarcane refinery sludge application remains unexplained. Lastly, sewage sludge, composed mainly of easily degradable compounds, did not permit nematode control, and only bacterivorous nematode populations were enhanced by this treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPratylenchus coffeae 3abananas 3acellulose 3achemical composition 3anematicides 3anematode control 3apests 3aplant residues 3apopulation growth 3asewage sludge 3asoil density 3asoil food webs 3asoil nematodes 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3aGuadeloupe1 aVillenave, Cécile1 aRisede, Jean-Michel1 aRoger-Estrade, Jean1 aThuries, Laurent1 aDorel, Marc0 tApplied soil ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 49 p.59-67dElsevier B.V.x0929-13937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04212naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245009400212300001200306520186600318592002802184650000802212650001602220650001902236650001002255650001602265650001802281650002202299650001302321650003802334650002702372650002302399650002702422650001802449650001702467650003802484650001902522650002202541650001802563650001102581650001002592650001502602650000902617650003202626650001202658650002002670650003202690650002202722653001702744653001602761653001802777653001202795653001302807653000902820653000802829653000802837653001502845653000802860653000702868653001102875653001102886653000802897653000902905653000902914653001002923653000802933653000802941653000802949700002702957700002602984700002603010700002903036700002503065700002803090700001403118773012203132856008303254852000903337655001203346IND60530821420221118203451.0180905e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053082142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnim.2016.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasi, Laureane Nunes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9472-730410aInflammatory state of periaortic adipose tissue in mice under obesogenic dietary regimens  ap. 1-7.  aHigh-fat diet or high-sugar diet causes obesity and a chronic low-grade inflammation that leads to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation of the surrounding fat of thoracic aorta namely periaortic adipose tissue (PAAT) has been associated with increased prevalence of vascular diseases in obesity. C57Bl/6 male mice (12 weeks of age) fed a whole grain-based commercial diet (WGD), refined carbohydrate diet (RCD), refined carbohydrate diet plus sweetened condensed milk ad libitum (RCD + CM) or high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks were studied. Serum fatty acid (FA) composition was evaluated by gas chromatography. The cellularity (as indicated by DNA and protein contents) and the inflammatory state (as indicated by the contents of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, leptin and adiponectin measured by ELISA) of the PAAT and thoracic aorta (TA) were evaluated. Both obesogenic regimens (RCD + CM and HFD) increased the content of total fatty acids (FA) in serum and the cellularity of the PAAT compared to WGD. RCD + CM increased serum monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) levels and HFD increased serum saturated fatty acid (SFA) levels compared to WGD. RCD (one of the diets used as control) and RCD + CM increased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10 and VCAM-1 in the PAAT compared to WGD. Mice fed with HFD showed decreased contents of TNF-α, VCAM-1 and IL-10 in the PAAT compared to animals fed RCD. The RCD raised the levels of SFA in serum, cellularity and inflammatory state in the PAAT compared to WGD. In conclusion, the effects of obesogenic dietary regimens on PAAT can be interpreted differently when the results are compared with WGD or RCD. We found marked changes in the PAAT and no significant modifications in TA indicating this adipose tissue as the major starting point of vascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3aaorta 3ablood serum 3acarbohydrates 3aconcentrated milk 3adiabetes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3aleptin 3amales 3ametabolism 3amice 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3aobesity 3aprotein content 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular diseases 0aInflammation 0aEndothelium 0aHigh-fat diet 0aSucrose 0aCytokine 0aPAAT 0aWGD 0aRCD 0aRCD + CM 0aHFD 0aFA 0aICAM-1 0aVCAM-1 0aSFA 0aPUFA 0aMUFA 0aNFκB 0aBAT 0aWAT 0aSEM1 aCrisma, Amanda Rabello1 aMartins, Amanda Roque1 ado Amaral, Catia Lira1 aTorres, Rosângela Pavan1 aMancini Filho, Jorge1 aHirabara, Sandro Massao1 aCuri, Rui0 tJournal of nutrition & intermediary metabolism.g2016 Dec., v. 6 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23272x2352-38597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnim.2016.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001600259500001500275520111700290592002801407650002301435650002301458650001601481650002001497650001501517650002701532650002201559650001501581653002301596653002101619653001801640653001601658653002701674653001301701653005601714700001501770773010701785856008601892852000901978655001201987IND60539697920221116231752.0190318e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053969792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez, R.F.10aPrediction limits of a catchment hydrological model using different estimates of ETp  ap. 216-228.  a2019-12-06  aA joint deterministic–stochastic protocol based on Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) was applied to the modelling of a medium size catchment using two significantly different sets of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) data, estimated through a Penman-based method. Modelling error was accounted using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. Both, water routing and water balance related parameters were considered in the analysis. The research revealed that the hypothesis of the less correct ETp data set being appropriate for the current modelling could not be rejected since model parameters adjusted to compensate for the use of significantly different ETp data sets. The GLUE analysis demonstrated that the model predictions exhibited some sensitivity to the hydraulic conductivity of one of the geological layers. Furthermore, the study revealed a considerable error attached to the simulation of both high and low flows, as well as, piezometric levels, for every ETp data set, which was most likely magnified by the coarse time and spatial scales used in the current modelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aevapotranspiration 3auncertainty 3adata collection 3awatersheds 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 0aEvapotranspiration 0aModel resolution 0awater balance 0aUncertainty 0aHydrological modelling 0aMIKE SHE 0aGeneralised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimator (GLUE)1 aHampel, H.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 May 26, v. 513 p.216-228dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014500162300002000307520129500327592002801622650001401650650002201664650002101686650001401707650002501721650002101746650001501767650002201782650001301804650001201817650001101829650001401840650001301854700001701867773012501884856007402009852000902083655001202092IND60617189120221119052909.0181024e20180925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061718912DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra06981f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerasawa, Naohiro10aSelf-standing cellulose nanofiber/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)/ionic liquid actuators with superior performance  ap. 33149-33155.  aThis paper describes new actuators with cellulose nanofiber/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)/ionic liquid (CNF/PEDOT:PSS/IL) structures. Devices containing these structures exhibit higher strain and maximum generated stress than those based on only PEDOT:PSS/IL. The new actuator system contains an electrode, which is an electrochemical capacitor, and which consists of both a faradaic capacitor (FC) and a small electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), i.e., PEDOT:PSS. This combined capacitor plays the role of an FC and a base polymer, and the CNF skeleton is used in the place of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This device therefore functions differently from traditional CNT/PVdF–HFP/IL actuators, which are only used as EDLC units and from PEDOT:PSS/vapor-grown carbon nanofibers (VGCF)/IL actuators, which are used as hybrid (FC and EDLC) units. The developed films are novel, robust, and flexible, and demonstrate potential as actuator materials for wearable energy-conversion devices. A double-layer charging kinetic model, which is similar to that previously proposed for PEDOT:PSS/CNT/IL actuators, is developed to explain the oxidation and reduction of PEDOT:PSS. This model successfully simulates the frequency-dependent displacement response of actuators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3acarbon nanofibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3aelectrical equipment 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3akinetics 3aliquids 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apolymers1 aAsaka, Kinji0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 25, v. 8, no. 58 p.33149-33155dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06981f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012500162300001800287520112400305592002801429650001301457650002201470650001401492650001401506650001401520650002301534650001901557650002001576650001601596650002001612650001301632650001301645700002401658700002201682700002001704773012301724856007401847852000901921655001201930IND60662609820221116141648.0190906e20110504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066260982DNAL7 a10.1039/c1gc15064b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzarnecki, Paweł10aSimple and practical direct asymmetric aldol reaction of hydroxyacetone catalyzed by 9-amino Cinchona alkaloid tartrates  ap. 1280-1287.  aA novel organocatalytic procedure for the direct aldol reaction of unprotected acetol and activated aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 9-amino-9-epi-Cinchona ditartrates is presented. The protocol presented avoids the use of problematic solvents and toxic reagents as well as chromatographic purification of the products – instead a simple extraction has been applied for the isolation of pure aldols from the reaction mixture. This catalytic system provides exclusively linear aldols with quantitative yields and good syn-diastereoselectivity and enantioselectvitiy up to 90% ee. Further upgrading of the enantiomeric excess of syn-aldols up to 99% ee is easily accomplished by a single and reliable crystallization. The use of cinchonine or quinine-derived catalysts gives access to both enantiomers of syn-aldols for which the absolute configuration has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The operationally convenient and scalable organocatalytic procedure using cheap and renewable chemicals – both acetol and the catalysts, offers a sustainable and green way for the synthesis of a number of α-keto-syn-diols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinchona 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaldehydes 3aalkaloids 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromatography 3acrystallization 3aenantiomers 3agreen chemistry 3asolvents 3atoxicity1 aPlutecka, Agnieszka1 aGawroński, Jacek1 aKacprzak, Karol0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 May 4, v. 13, no. 5 p.1280-1287dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1gc15064b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001600304520126300320592002801583650001601611650001101627650001701638650002401655650001001679650000901689650001301698650002401711650001601735650001501751650001501766650000901781650001501790650001701805653001201822653001901834653001101853653002101864653003301885653002801918700001601946700001301962700001201975700001701987773010902004856008602113852000902199655001202208IND50068313720221120222931.0190319e20130827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006831372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2013.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dejian10aRoot hair development of Poncirus trifoliata grown in different growth cultures and treated with 3-indolebutyric acid and ethephon  ap. 389-397.  aCitrus plants are generally believed to possess few or even no root hair whose function is to uptake nutrient and water from soils. This study compared the development of root hair of a citrus rootstock, Poncirus trifoliata, in four types of cultures or treated with 3-indolebutyric acid and ethephon. It was found that root hair of lateral root grew in sand culture compared with yellow-soil and solution culture in which no initiation was observed. Taproot hair grew best and evenly distributed on MT Agar culture, while in sand culture, Hoagland-solution culture, and yellow soil culture few or no root hair initiation was observed. For P. trifoliata, MT Agar culture showed the best performance on root hair. With regard to the effect of regulators such as 3-indolebutyric acid (IBA) and ethephon (ETH), our result showed that the optimum concentration of IBA and ETH for root hair growth was 1.0μmolL−1 since IBA and ETH at this concentration could best promote root hair initiation and elongation. Besides, the effect of IBA on root hair growth was stronger than ETH at equal concentrations. Furthermore, our results showed that unlike Arabidopsis or Oryza sativa, the root hair of P. trifoliata could initiate from any epidermal cell (random type).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCitrus 3aOryza sativa 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3aacids 3aagar 3aethephon 3aindole butyric acid 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 3arootstocks 3asand 3asoil water 3awater uptake 0aDensity 0aEpidermal cell 0aLength 0aParaffin section 0aScanning electron microscope 0aStereoscopic microscope1 aXia, Renxue1 aCao, Xiu1 aShu, Bo1 aChen, Chunli0 tScientia horticulturae.g2013 Aug. 27, v. 160 p.389-397dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013200166520108800298592002801386650001701414650001401431650001601445650001001461650001401471650001901485650001901504650001701523650001301540650001701553653000801570653002601578653002901604653001801633653001301651653001401664700001601678700001701694700006301711700002101774700002101795700001901816700002001835700005701855773010501912856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60775927120221120155214.0220628e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077592712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1133012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibu, M.C.10aWhite LED active α-Fe2O3/rGO photocatalytic nanocomposite for an effective degradation of tetracycline and ibuprofen molecules  aThe formation of phase pure magnetically separable α-Fe₂O₃ and α-Fe₂O₃/rGO nanostructures were achieved through a simple hydrothermal technique. The properties of synthesized materials were investigated through different analytical techniques. The formation of phase pure FO and FO/rGO nanostructures were confirmed by XRD analysis with crystallite size of about ∼42 nm and ∼65 nm, respectively. The morphological analysis reveals the formation of sphere-like nanoparticles with high agglomeration. The UV-DRS analysis clearly shows the enhanced visible-light activity of FO/rGO nanoparticles. The BET analysis revealed the mesoporous property of FO/rGO nanocomposite. The enhancement in the photoinduced charge transfer process is observed after including rGO nanoparticles with FO. The photocatalytic efficiency of nanomaterials was analyzed using tetracycline and ibuprofen as model organic pollutants under white LED irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic degradation ability of FO/rGO nanocomposite is studied against both tetracycline and ibuprofen molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallites 3aibuprofen 3airradiation 3alight 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3aphotocatalysis 3aporous media 3aresearch 3atetracycline 0arGO 0aWhite LED irradiation 0aPharmaceutical pollutant 0aPhotocatalyst 0aKinetics 0aMechanism1 aBenoy, M.D.1 aShanavas, S.1 aHaija, Mohammad Abu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5846-06621 aDuraimurugan, J.1 aKumar, G.

Nociception is mediated by mechanical, chemical, or microbial stimuli that evoke unpleasant feelings, alerting the host of the risk of tissue damage. Such diverse arrays of noxious stimuli trigger various escape reactions, usually altering immune homeostasis. Notably, nociceptors can recognize cytokines or pathogens via sensory molecules or innate immune receptors, participating in immune responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that activated nociceptors produce various humoral factors that affect the immune system and act like endocrine/paracrine signals. Thus, understanding the interplay between the nociceptive and immune systems may open new avenues for the development of an interdisciplinary research field, hereinafter referred to as ‘senso‐immunology’. This review will discuss the physiological relevance of the senso‐immune system in the host defense context, focusing on how senso‐immune research might yield novel treatments to cure pain and inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data  cTakeda Science Foundation  aJP16K15665cKAKENHI  aJP18H02970cKAKENHI  aJP16K15665cKAKENHI  aJP19K22712cKAKENHI  cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  cLotte Foundation  cKowa Life Science Foundation  cKanzawa Medical Research Foundation  cAkashi Medical Foundation  cYakult Bioscience Research Foundation  cIchiro Kanehara Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences and Medical Care  cJapan Dairy Association  cLydia O'Leary Memorial Pias Dermatological Foundation  cCanon Foundation  cJapan Intractable Diseases Research Foundation  cUehara Memorial Foundation  cTerumo Life Science Foundation  cInoue Foundation for Science  cNakajima Foundation  cLife Science Foundation 3acytokines 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3ainterdisciplinary research 3anociception 3apain 3arisk0 tFEBS journal.g2022 July, v. 289, no. 14 p.4132-4145dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.158463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009000166300001600256520176200272592002802034653003102062653001102093653001302104653001502117653001602132653001602148700001602164700002402180700001902204773010202223856008202325852000902407655001202416IND60602689120221117160505.0180711e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060268912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clay.2014.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalvatzi, S.10aTolerance and efficacy study of palygorskite incorporation in the diet of laying hens  ap. 643-647.  aThe objective of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of palygorskite inclusion in the diet of laying hens. A total of 135 Lohmann Brown hens, aged 21weeks, were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (n=45): group C (control), group S (fed a diet with 1% palygorskite, standard-level) and group T (fed a diet with 9.1% palygorskite, multi-fold of standard-level). All hens were kept in commercial laying cages (3 hens per cage, 15 replicates per group). Hens of group T were used only for the first eight weeks (tolerance study period), while hens of groups C and S were kept for another sixteen weeks (efficacy study period). In each group, laying percentage, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, mortality and egg quality characteristics were assessed. The results showed that feeding a ration with 9.1% palygorskite (group T) did not have any negative effects on laying percentage (%), feed conversion ratio or health of hens. However, the body weight of hens in group T was significantly lower (P<0.001) while their feed intake was higher (P<0.001) compared to those of groups C and S for the 8-week experimental period. Furthermore, the produced eggs had significantly (P<0.001) lighter coloured egg yolk. The incorporation of 1% palygorskite in the ration for 24weeks improved laying percentage (by 2.6%, P<0.05) and feed conversion ratio (by 4.6%, P<0.05); feed intake and body weight of hens were unaffected. The produced eggs had significantly lighter eggshell and yolk colour (P<0.001) as well as increased eggshell thickness (P<0.05). It was concluded that palygorskite is a tolerable material which has the potential to improve laying hen performance and influence egg quality traits when used at recommended levels.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPalygorskite (attapulgite) 0aSafety 0aEfficacy 0aLaying hen 0aEgg quality 0aPerformance1 aArsenos, G.1 aTserveni-Goussi, A.1 aFortomaris, P.0 tApplied clay science.g2014 Nov., v. 101 p.643-647dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26773x0169-13177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2014.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169300001600267500001400283520143500297536055801732592002802290596001302318596001402331596000902345596001502354596002002369596002102389650001602410650002002426650001002446650002302456650001702479650001802496650002402514650001802538650004302556650001002599653000802609653002002617653002602637653002502663700001302688700001902701700001702720700001302737700001302750700001702763700001402780700001602794700001702810700001402827700001702841773012702858856008502985852000903070655001203079IND60720421720221120201301.0201214e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072042172DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2020.17568232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiaohong10aMyHCs developmental expression patterns and its effect on muscle fibre characteristics in pig  ap. 176-183.  aNAL-light  aThis study comprehensively explored muscle fibre characteristics and expression patterns of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) family in skeletal muscles of Large White and Mashen pigs exhibiting differences in muscle fibre development in postnatal muscle growth. Muscle fibre density and diameter were analysed using haematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression patterns of MyHCI, MyHCIIa, MyHCIIx and MyHCIIb were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The muscle fibre diameter increased and density decreased gradually with aging. In individuals of the same age, the muscle fibre diameter was significantly lower and density was significantly higher in Mashen than in Large White pigs. The MyHCI expression increased, whereas that of MyHCIIa first increased and then decreased. The expression of MyHCI and MyHCIIa was significantly higher in Mashen. The expression of MyHCIIx and MyHCIIb decreased with increasing age; their expression was significantly lower in Mashen pigs. Muscle fibre diameter was negatively correlated with MyHCI expression and positively correlated with MyHCIIx and MyHCIIb expression (except the expression of MyHCI in psoas major). Muscle fibre diameter, muscle fibre density, and MyHCs expression follow certain patterns in skeletal muscles. These results provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism responsible for pig growth performance and meat quality.  aThanks to all the staff of the Datong pig farm.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the concentration of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and the FAME profile of transesterified lipids, phospholipids and pigments extracted under varied supercritical temperatures and pressures. The scCO₂ extraction results are compared with conventional solvent extraction to evaluate differences in the efficiency and nature of the extracted materials. Algae harvested by centrifugation (vs. lyophilization) demonstrated a similar extraction efficiency in scCO₂, indicating potential energy benefits by avoiding conventional algal mass dehydration prior to extraction. Centrifuged algae and optimized extraction conditions (6000 psi; 100 °C) resulted in comparable FAME yields to conventional processes, as well as increased selectivity, reflected in the decreased pigment, nitrogen and phospholipid contamination of the FAME. Cell pre-treatments—sonication, microwave, bead beating and lyophilization—showed an enhancement in extraction yield in both conventional solvent and scCO₂ extraction, allowing for improved extraction efficiencies. This study suggests that scCO₂, a green solvent, shows great potential for algal lipid extraction for the sustainable production of biodiesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetradesmus dimorphus 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acentrifugation 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afreeze drying 3afuel production 3agreen chemistry 3aharvesting 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphospholipids 3apigments 3apotential energy 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aZimmerman, Julie0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 June 7, v. 13, no. 6 p.1422-1429dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1gc15068e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01120naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245004300159300001600202500002000218520026500238592002800503650001400531650001300545651002000558700001600578700002100594773013100615856007500746852000900821655001200830IND60779956820221117030331.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077995682DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.124402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, Graham10a1019.

The richest natural sources are brewer's yeast, raw fruits (in the pulp) and cereal germs, but also animal products. It is absorbed by active and saturable transport in the proximal small intestine and phosphorylated in the liver (into an active form). It is an essential cofactor of enzymes involved in energy and alcohol metabolism. Magnesium is a major cofactor involved in the metabolism of thiamine and a factor of resistance to supplementation. Thiamine flows in the formed elements of the blood and stocks are virtually nil, so signs of deficiency can appear quickly. The causes of deficiency are often multifactorial. Apart from alcoholism, insufficient intake is due to digestive symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) or malabsorption, or a carbohydrate rich diet and poor in thiamine. Some medications may also worsen the deficit. A high genetic susceptibility may explain the variability of clinical presentations, i.e. dry vs. wet B1 deficiency. The testing of blood vitamin B1 is weakly contributory, since it only represents a very small proportion of the body's stock. Two clinical presentations are conventionally described: the “dry” is the neurological one: Wernicke encephalopathy, sometimes associated with a Korsakoff syndrome, and a polyneuropathy, resulting mainly from nutritional disorders including deficiencies in all group B vitamins; its prevalence is largely underestimated; the “wet” one mainly includes cardiac insufficiency. The prevention of these clinical deficiencies must be systematic in all patients with digestive disorders, including prolonged vomiting and diarrhea, and in any patient at risk of refeeding syndrome, a situation also described after digestive surgery, especially obesity surgery, using oral or parenteral supplementation. In case of evocative neurological symptoms, B1 supplementation must be initiated without delay, combined with a magnesium supplementation, and without waiting for the blood test results. The absence of B1 toxicity, even with large doses, and the imperfection of biological markers encourage the preventive and empirical treatment of all patients suspected of thiamine deficiency, without worrying about blood level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol abuse 3aalcohols 3aanimal products 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3abrewers yeast 3acarbohydrates 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3aencephalopathy 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3ahematologic tests 3aliver 3amagnesium 3amalabsorption 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3apatients 3apulp 3araw fruit 3arefeeding syndrome 3arisk 3aseed germ 3asmall intestine 3asurgery 3athiamin 3atoxicity 3avomiting 0aThiamine 0aEncéphalopathie de Gayet-Wernicke 0aChirurgie bariatrique 0aSyndrome de renutrition inappropriée 0aBéribéri 0aVitamin B1 0aWernicke encephalopathy 0aObesity surgery 0aRefeeding syndrome 0aBeriberi1 aMichot, Niasha1 aBrunaud, Laurent1 aMalgras, Aurélie0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2017 Sept., v. 31, no. 3 p.176-180dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245013400179300001300313520158100326592002801907653001601935653001401951653002801965653002701993700002502020773010302045856008202148852000902230655001202239IND60602689320221117160603.0180711e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060268932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clay.2015.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalek, Nik Ahmad Nizam Nik10aCharacterization and antibacterial activity of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) immobilized on kaolinite with different CPB loadings  ap. 8-14.  aThis paper discusses the formation of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB), a cationic surfactant quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), immobilized on kaolinite with different initial CPB concentrations ([CPB]i) and their effect on the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. The CPB-immobilized kaolinites were characterized by a CHNS analyzer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential (ZP) analysis and the amount of CPB adsorbed on kaolinite. The antibacterial assay of the samples was studied through the disk diffusion technique (DDT) against E. coli as a model bacterium. The amount of CPB adsorbed on kaolinite did not affect the structure of the parent kaolinite but affected the overall charge of the kaolinite and eventually affected their antibacterial activity. CPB-immobilized kaolinite with [CPB]i above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) possessed antibacterial activity because of reversal of the charge from negative to positive on the kaolinite surfaces, as proven by ZP analysis, which could allow the action of CPB molecules against bacteria cells. This was due to the bilayer formation of surfactant molecules via hydrophobic bonding of their long hydrocarbon chains on the kaolinite surfaces at surfactant concentrations above the CMC value. Therefore, one of the important factors in producing antibacterial agents from surfactant immobilized kaolinite (organo-clay) is by loading excess surfactant on the clay above its CMC level to ensure bilayer formation of surfactant molecules on clay surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 0aOrgano-clay 0aKaolinite 0aCetylpyridinium bromide 0aAntibacterial activity1 aRamli, Nur Isti'anah0 tApplied clay science.g2015 June, v. 109-110 p.8-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26773x0169-13177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01206naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006700164300001600231500002000247520035500267592002800622650001500650650001900665651001000684700001900694773013100713856007500844852000900919655001200928IND60779956920221117030114.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077995692DNAL7 a10.1111/curt.124382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRankin, David W.

Twenty-three local doe goats aged 3–6 years, which were not pregnant and had BCS ranging from 1–3 on a scale of 1–5, were studied. Blood samples were collected before slaughtering for biochemical analyses. After the goats were killed, the ovaries were collected for follicle and corpus luteum (CL) examination. Ovarian follicular fluid was aspirated for biochemical analyses. Most blood biochemistry parameters of the goats with BCS 1–3 did not show significant differences (P>0.05). The ovaries with BCS 1 were acyclic; whereas the ovaries with BCSs 2 and 3 were cyclic. The ovarian follicular fluid concentrations of glucose, Ca, and Mg in the goats with BCS 1 were significantly lower than those of the goats with BCSs 2 and 3. The levels of TP, ALB, and cholesterol in the ovarian follicular fluid were significantly correlated with the blood results (P<0.05). In conclusion, Kacang goats with poor body conditions showed ovarian dysfunction. The levels of TP, ALB, and cholesterol in follicular fluid were related to the blood metabolite levels.  aThis research was financially supported by the Ministry of Research,Technology, andHigher Education, Republic of Indonesia (Number 1823/UN1/ DITLIT/DIT-LIT/LT/2018).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus 3aadults 3aanimal research 3ablood 3ablood chemistry 3abody condition 3acholesterol 3acorpus luteum 3afemales 3afollicular fluid 3aglucose 3ametabolites 0aBiochemistry 0abody condition score 0afollicle 0aKacang goat 0aovary1 aSarmin, Sarmin1 aYanuartono, Yanuartono0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.201-206dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2020.17643613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003200191245009400223300001400317506007600331520116300407592002801570506003701598650002201635650001401657650001101671650002201682650001101704650001301715650001501728650002601743650001901769653002801788653001301816653002101829653000901850700001101859700001301870700002001883700002101903773009501924856008402019852000902103655001202112IND60554521020221207090822.0161024e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055452102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2013.04.0042doi7 aPMC40089352pmcid7 a235840852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzalez-Galarza, Faviel F.12aA tutorial for software development in quantitative proteomics using PSI standard formats  ap. 88-97.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Human Proteome Organisation — Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) has been working for ten years on the development of standardised formats that facilitate data sharing and public database deposition. In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards — mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, which can be used to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from http://code.google.com/p/psi-standard-formats-tutorial.

This region which is a key hydropower region of North America lacks long-term hydrological series, and tree-ring proxies are seen here as the best alternative for the extension of the climatic series beyond instrumental records. Thus, ring widths, ring densities and stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ18O) were used to perform paleohydrological reconstructions. The following reconstruction techniques were evaluated for each variable reconstructed: partial least square (PLS) regression applied to all of the tree-ring series, PLS regression applied to selected tree-ring series, and the best analogue method (BAM) applied to selected tree-ring series. These three reconstructions were then combined in a composite reconstruction.Reconstruction verification shows that the annual and summer water supply reconstruction quality is good. Conversely, the verification tests disqualified our spring water supply reconstruction. The reconstructed long-term water supply variations over the last two centuries are dominated by decadal to sub-decadal fluctuations, including distinct long hydrological periods during which water supplies change in intensity and variability. Annual water supplies (Qann) inversely correlate with both winter and summer indices. Annual water supplies (Qann) inversely correlate with Arctic oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter and summer indices. Also, AO indices also influence Qann to a greater degree than NAO indices.

The compounds were prepared by melt processing in a twin screw extruder with 3mass% of nanoparticles and the resulting nanocomposites were physically and mechanically characterized to evaluate the effect of the different reactive groups available for interactions within the polymer matrix. The nanocomposites prepared with either the unmodified montmorillonite (Mt) or the modified (m-Mt) form presented similar or improved thermal and mechanical properties of the matrix, while those prepared with organically modified halloysite (m-Hal) presented a general decrease in the properties compared to neat PHBV. The differences between the properties can be attributed to the different interactions of the clay minerals with the modifier and with the polymer. In the m-Hal the amino groups are located at the edges and freely react with the carbonyl groups of the PHBV decreasing its molecular weight. In the m-Mt, these groups are confined to the clay mineral interlayer and thus the interactions with the polymer are nondestructive.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiodegradable polymer nanocomposites 0aHalloysite 0aMontmorillonite 0aSurface modification 0aMechanical properties1 aCarli, Larissa N.1 aCrespo, Janaina S.1 aMauler, Raquel S.0 tApplied clay science.g2015 Oct., v. 115 p.157-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26773x0169-13177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clay.2015.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012200171520204500293592002802338650001502366650001502381650001202396650002102408650001202429650002302441650000902464650002302473650001102496650001702507650000702524650001302531650001302544650001502557650001102572650002202583650001702605650001402622650001602636650001302652650002002665650001602685653002002701653001202721653002502733653002002758653002102778653001602799700005602815700001702871773010502888856008502993852000903078655001203087IND60775927420221120155155.0220628e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077592742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1133282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Pratibha13aAn insight into the green synthesis of SiO2 nanostructures as a novel adsorbent for removal of toxic water pollutants  aGreen synthesis of nanomaterials is a sustainable, biologically safe, reliable, and eco-friendly approach. Green synthesis is beneficial to reduce the devastating effects of the traditional chemical synthesis methods and particularly aims at decreasing the usage of toxic chemicals. This review deals with the green synthesis of silica nanoparticles (SiO₂ NPs) with emphasis on the engineering surface properties for enhanced adsorption capability and their applications as novel nano-adsorbents for water pollutants removal. Green synthesized SiO₂ NPs have shown excellent adsorption properties with higher adsorption capacity of 150-200 mg/g and more than 95% removal for various toxic water pollutants along with reusability for more than 5 cycles. These SiO₂ NPs show fascinating physical and chemical properties i.e. tunable size (5 nm to more than 100 nm), low toxicity, biocompatibility, high porosity, higher specific surface area (500–-700 m²/g) making them attractive/suitable for several applications in biomedical, agriculture, catalysis, construction, water treatment, etc. Commonly, highly pure SiO₂ NPs are synthesized from organic chemicals (very expensive and highly toxic in nature) as a precursor that led to high production costs, high energy consumption, and environmental hazards. On the other hand, green synthesis of SiO₂ NPs from natural resources like biomass that includes rice husk, bamboo leaves/stem, sugarcane bagasse, corn cobs, wheat straw, etc. is cost-effective, less toxic, and eco-friendly which has been discussed in detail. Furthermore, the effect of key synthesis parameters (i.e., temperature, time, concentration, pH, etc.) on the morphology, size, purity, and specific surface area of SiO₂ NPs have been summarized. Finally, the applications of SiO₂ NPs as nano-adsorbents for the removal of toxic water pollutants (i.e., heavy metal cations, anions, dyes, etc.) including the adsorption mechanisms along with the future scope, challenges, and suggestions have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abamboos 3abiocompatibility 3abiomass 3acatalytic activity 3acorn 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aheavy metals 3apH 3aporosity 3aresearch 3arice hulls 3asilica 3asugarcane bagasse 3asurface area 3asynthesis 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 3awheat straw 0aGreen synthesis 0aBiomass 0aSilica nanoparticles 0aNano-adsorbents 0aWater pollutants 0aReusability1 aPrakash, Jai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9474-76471 aKaushal, Raj0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept., v. 212 p.113328-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1133283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245009300199300001400292520134000306592002801646650002001674650002101694650002701715650002401742650002801766650001701794650002501811650002101836650001401857650001001871650001701881650004301898650001801941650001801959650001001977653002701987653003102014653001002045653002202055700001602077700001602093700001902109700001802128700001702146773011302163856008202276852000902358655001202367IND60530185820221122231609.0180830e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053018582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2016.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3383-122510aIdentification of four squid species by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  ap. 22-29.  aSquids are distributed worldwide, including many species of commercial importance, and they are often made into varieties of flavor foods. The rapid identification methods for squid species especially their processed products, however, have not been well developed. In this study, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) systems based on specific primers and TaqMan probes have been established for rapid and accurate identification of four common squid species (Ommastrephes bartramii, Dosidicus gigas, Illex argentinus, Todarodes pacificus) in Chinese domestic market. After analyzing mitochondrial genes reported in GenBank, the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene was selected for O. bartramii detection, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for D. gigas and T. Pacificus detection, ATPase subunit 6 (ATPase 6) gene for I. Argentinus detection, and 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rDNA) gene for designing Ommastrephidae-specific primers and probe. As a result, all the TaqMan systems are of good performance, and efficiency of each reaction was calculated by making standard curves. This method could detect target species either in single or mixed squid specimen, and it was applied to identify 12 squid processed products successfully. Thus, it would play an important role in fulfilling labeling regulations and squid fishery control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDosidicus gigas 3aIllex argentinus 3aOmmastrephes bartramii 3aTodarodes pacificus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acytochrome b 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adomestic markets 3afisheries 3agenes 3amitochondria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asquid 0aSpecies identification 0aQuantitative real-time PCR 0aSquid 0aMitochondrial DNA1 aFeng, Junli1 aLiu, Shasha1 aZhang, Yanping1 aJiang, Xiaona1 aDai, Zhiyuan0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2016 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.22-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:3743x0890-85087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2016.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013400158300001800292520037000310592002800680650001300708650001400721650002300735650002000758650001400778650001500792650001500807650001300822700001600835700002200851700002300873773012400896856007401020852000901094655001201103IND60662610220221122030427.0190906e20110705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066261022DNAL7 a10.1039/c1gc15076f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Yongbo10aSolvent free aerobic oxidation of alcohols with 1-methyl-2-azaadamantane N-oxyl as a recyclable catalyst through phase separation  ap. 1659-1663.  aAn expedient, non-metallic green protocol for aerobic oxidation of alcohols was established. 1-Methyl-2-azaadamantane N-oxyl was used as the core catalyst due to its superior chemical stability and catalytic performance.

Investigation of the formation of NOₓ precursors during their pyrolysis is significant. Based on the pyrolysis of three typical IBWs, medium-density fiberboard waste (MFW), Chinese herb residue (CHR), and tea stalk waste (TSW), in a horizontal tubular quartz reactor, similarities and differences between the formation characteristics of NH₃ and HCN were investigated with the help of chemical absorption–spectrophotometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis technologies. The results indicated that amide-N was the overwhelming nitrogen functionality in lignocellulosic IBWs, determining the dominance of NH₃ among NOₓ precursors. However, the ratio and total yield of HCN-N and NH₃-N could be changed by affecting intrinsic formation pathways owing to pyrolysis conditions as well as physicochemical properties. Joint effects of thermal conditions on each NOₓ precursor yield were sequenced as rapid pyrolysis at high temperatures > slow pyrolysis at high temperatures > rapid pyrolysis at low temperatures ≈ slow pyrolysis at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the heating rate during slow pyrolysis had an ignorable impact. As a result, during rapid pyrolysis at high temperatures, larger particle size (0–900 μm) could significantly decrease the total yield by 16–17 wt % as well as favor NH₃-N yield, while both pyrolysis atmosphere and moisture content presented limited effects. Furthermore, different thermal stability of amide-N type together with distinctive fuel components in three lignocellulosic IBWs led to their differences on the ratio of TSW > CHR > MFW at all temperature ranges and the total yield of MFW > CHR > TSW at low temperatures. However, total yield at high temperatures was observed to be 20–45 wt %, which had no relationship with fuel types. These observations will provide some helpful guidance regarding clean thermal reutilization of lignocellulosic IBWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiomass 3afiberboards 3afuels 3ahydrogen cyanide 3alignocellulose 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3aquartz 3atea 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3awastes 3awater content 3aChina1 aYin, Xiuli1 aHuang, Yanqin1 aYuan, Hongyou1 aXie, Jianjun1 aWu, Chuangzhi1 aShen, Zhenxing1 aCao, Junji0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 31, no. 9 p.9557-9567dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b015593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01369naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013200157300002000289520036300309592002800672650001300700650002600713650002500739700001500764700001300779700001600792700001800808700002100826773012500847856007400972852000901046655001201055IND60617189720221119052901.0181024e20180919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061718972DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra07027j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Songyan10aPhosphorus pentoxide/metal chloride mediated efficient and facile catalytic conversion of fructose into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural  ap. 32533-32537.  aPhosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅)/metal chloride mixtures could significantly improve 5-HMF yield and selectivity for the catalytic conversion of fructose under mild conditions, whereas neither P₂O₅ nor tested metal chloride alone gave reasonable performances.

Transporting the manure back to the cropland used to produce the feed can be difficult and uneconomical. Technology such as a centrifuge can be used to extract nutrients into a more concentrated form for more efficient transport. A dairy farm with 2000 cows and 1400 ha of land in Pennsylvania was simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model to evaluate the feasibility of extracting phosphorus (P) to reduce transport requirements on farm or to produce a concentrated P product for off-farm use. On this farm where manure must be transported to distant cropland to obtain uniform distribution, P extraction with a centrifuge provided a better ratio of nitrogen and P contents for use on nearby cropland and reduced transport costs for nutrients applied to more distant cropland. The centrifuge was found to be more practical and economical when used with manure scraped from the barn floor than with flushed manure because much less material was handled. Moving less material through the centrifuge both improved extraction efficiency and reduced electricity consumption, providing more economical P extraction. To avoid long-term accumulation of soil P on the farm with less land (2000 cows and 1100 ha) where concentrate feed (27% of total feed) was imported, centrifuge extraction provided a material with a high P concentration exported from the farm for other uses. Extracting the P for off-farm use cost about $2.51/kg P, which was greater than the price of phosphate fertilizer, but the extract also included other nutrients and micronutrients of value to crops. A centrifuge provides a useful tool for extracting and concentrating manure P, but the economic benefit to the producer depends upon the value of the full array of nutrient contents in the product, other manure handling practices, and the end use of the extracted material. Reducing the risk of eutrophication of surface waters provides additional benefit to society.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAaNot given 3aagriculture 3abarns 3acropland 3adairy farming 3adairy manure 3aelectric energy consumption 3aeutrophication 3aexports 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3aherds 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aprices 3arisk 3asociety 3asoil 3aPennsylvania1 aReiner, Michael R.1 aFishel, Sarah K.1 aChurch, Clinton Dean0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2022, v. 38, no. 2 p.321-330dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.148633Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7747361  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011100152300002000263520130200283592002801585650001601613650001101629650001301640650001701653650002501670650002801695650002501723650001901748650002401767650001401791650001301805650001301818700001901831700001401850700001801864773012501882856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60617189820221119052825.0181024e20180927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061718982DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra07032f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Di14aThe construction of a sandwich structured Co₃O₄@C@PPy electrode for improving pseudocapacitive storage  ap. 33374-33382.  aSandwich structured hybrids consisting of a Co₃O₄ nanowire as the core, amorphous carbon (C) as the inner shell and a polypyrrole (PPy) outer layer as the exodermis are synthesized via a hydrothermal method and constant current electropolymerization. The formation mechanism and growth stage of PPy on carbon surfaces is investigated and it was discovered that PPy layer thickness, corresponding to nucleation time of the polymer, as the dynamic factor, can influence the pseudocapacitive properties of the obtained composites. The carbon layer acts as both a network to increase the electric conductivity and a buffer agent to reduce volume expansion of Co₃O₄ during ion insertion/extraction to achieve higher capacitance and better cyclic stability. So for a capacitor, the Co₃O₄@C@PPy electrode delivers a higher areal capacitance of 2.71 F cm⁻² at 10 mA cm⁻² (1663 F g⁻¹ at 6.1 A g⁻¹) and improved rate capability compared to Co₃O₄ and Co₃O₄@C. An asymmetric device is assembled by the Co₃O₄@C@PPy hybrids as a cathode and a relatively high energy density of 63.64 W h kg⁻¹ at a power density of 0.54 kW kg⁻¹ is obtained, demonstrating that the sandwich structured Co₃O₄@C@PPy hybrids have enormous potential for high-performance pseudocapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acathodes 3acobalt oxide 3adevelopmental stages 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrical equipment 3aenergy density 3ahot water treatment 3ananowires 3apolymers 3apyrroles1 aZhang, Mingyue1 aChen, Zhi1 aLiu, Xiao-Xia0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 27, v. 8, no. 58 p.33374-33382dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra07032f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245006900178300001800247520066300265592002800928650001500956650001900971650001900990650001701009650001001026650002101036650001101057650001601068650001101084650002301095650001601118650001301134700001801147700002301165773010501188856008901293852000901382655001201391IND60580506020171114000000.0170921e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058050602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b015772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Alberto,10aMicroscopic Characterization of CO2 and H2S Removal by Sulfolane  ap. 9800-9813.  aThe properties of sulfolane as a physical absorbent for CO₂ and H₂S acid gases are studied by using density functional theory and molecular dynamics computational chemistry methods with the objective of obtaining a microscopic picture of the use of this solvent for natural gas sweetening purposes.

While most of the early work on ILCs was based on murine studies, our knowledge on human ILCs is rapidly accumulating, opening novel perspectives towards the translation of ILC biology into the clinic. In this State‐of‐the‐Art Review, we focus on the current knowledge of these most recently discovered members of the lymphocyte family and highlight their role in three major burdens of humanity: infectious diseases, cancer, and allergy and/or autoimmunity. IL‐22‐producing type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) have become established as important players at the interface between gut epithelia and intestinal microbiome and are implicated in protection from inflammatory bowel disease, the control of graft‐versus‐host disease and intestinal graft rejection. In contrast, type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) exert pro‐inflammatory functions and contribute to the pathology of asthma and allergy, which has already been started to be pharmacologically targeted. The contribution of ILCs to the control of viral infection constitutes another emerging topic. Finally, ILCs seem to play a dual role in cancer with beneficial and detrimental contributions depending on the clinical setting. The exploitation of the therapeutic potential of ILCs will constitute an exciting task in the foreseeable future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3aautoimmunity 3agraft rejection 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amice 3atherapeutics1 aUhrberg, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9553-19870 tFEBS journal.g2022 July, v. 289, no. 14 p.3967-3981dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.158663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01530naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007700163300001600240520040100256592002800657650002100685650002300706650002600729650002300755650001800778650001900796700002000815700001600835700001600851700001400867700002100881700001800902700002200920773013100942856007401073852000901147655001201156IND60660773420221119055036.0190827e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066077342DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08029g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamberlain, T.

The state of Santa Catarina (SC) has few epidemiological data regarding TB in prisons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of circulating strains in prisons of SC. The study comprised 95 clinical samples from six prisons. Among the cases included, all subjects were male, predominantly caucasians, and young adults, with low education level. The positive smear in the TB diagnosis comprised 62.0% of cases. About 50% of subjects had some condition associated with TB. The Spoligotyping results showed that the most frequent lineages were LAM (50.7%), T (22.2%) and S (11.6%). The 12-loci MIRU generated 62 different genotypes. The MSTs showed evolutionary relationships between Mycobacterium tuberculosis spoligotypes from SC and evolutionary relationships between the prison isolates and studied parameters. This first study on TB in prison units of SC highlighted the predominance of SIT216/LAM5, and SIT34/S. Interestingly, his profile was found to be different from that observed in a previous study performed with the state's general population. This data shows the need for continued surveillance of episodes of TB occurring among prison inmates in an emerging country like Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3acorrectional institutions 3adeveloping countries 3agenotype 3alow educational status 3amales 3amolecular epidemiology 3amonitoring 3aprison inmates 3atuberculosis 3ayoung adults 3aBrazil 0aTuberculosis 0aPrison 0aMolecular epidemiology 0aSpoligotyping 0a12-MIRU 0aSanta Catarina1 aNogueira, Christiane Lourenço1 aPrim, Rodrigo Ivan1 aScheffer, Mara Cristina1 aAlves, Eduardo Venâncio1 aRovaris, Darcita Büerger1 aZozio, Thierry1 aRastogi, Nalin1 aBazzo, Maria Luiza0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Mar., v. 58 p.34-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011500171300001800286520138100304592002801685650002101713650002601734650001301760650001201773650001701785650002101802650003301823650002001856650001601876650004401892650001301936650001101949650001401960700002701974700002002001700002102021700002502042700003102067773011802098856008302216852000902299655001202308IND60548697620221118004507.0160905e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054869762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.6b006152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTowle, Kaitlyn M.10aSolution Structures of Phenol-Soluble Modulins α1, α3, and β2, Virulence Factors from Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 4798-4806.  aPhenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) are peptide virulence factors produced by staphylococci. These peptides contribute to the overall pathogenicity of these bacteria, eliciting multiple immune responses from host cells. Many of the α-type PSMs exhibit cytolytic properties and are able to lyse particular eukaryotic cells, including erythrocytes, neutrophils, and leukocytes. In addition, they also appear to contribute to the protection of the bacterial cell from the host immune response through biofilm formation and detachment. In this study, three of these peptide toxins, PSMs α1, α3, and β2, normally produced by Staphylococcus aureus, have been synthesized using solid-supported peptide synthesis (SPPS) (PSMα1 and PSMα3) or made by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli (PSMβ2). Their three-dimensional structures were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. PSMα1 and PSMα3 each consist of a single amphipathic helix with a slight bend near the N- and C-termini, respectively. PSMβ2 contains three amphipathic helices, which fold to produce a “v-like” shape between α-helix 2 and α-helix 3, with α-helix 1 folded over such that it is perpendicular to α-helix 3. The availability of three-dimensional structures permits spatial analysis of features and residues proposed to control the biological activity of these peptide toxins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aerythrocytes 3aeukaryotic cells 3aheterologous gene expression 3aimmune response 3aneutrophils 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeptides 3atoxins 3avirulence1 aLohans, Christopher T.1 aMiskolzie, Mark1 aAcedo, Jeella Z.1 avan Belkum, Marco J.1 aVederas, J.

Chromatographic separation of the active fraction resulted in the isolation of 15 trichothecene-based sesquiterpenes, including four new compounds, namely chartarenes A–D (1–4). The structures of the new compounds were determined on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical conversion. Compounds 1–15 exerted potent or selective inhibition against a panel of tumor cell lines including HCT-116, HepG2, BGC-823, NCI-H1650, and A2780, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 10⁻² to 10 μM. In addition, these compounds showed potent inhibition against tumor-related kinases FGFR3, IGF1R, PDGFRb, and TRKB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStachybotrys chartarum 3acell lines 3achromatography 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aethyl acetate 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 3 3afractionation 3afungi 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aneoplasm cells 3asesquiterpenoids 3aspectral analysis 3atyrosine1 aLiu, Dong1 aCheng, Zhongbin1 aProksch, Peter1 aLin, Wenhan0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 23, v. 7, no. 12 p.7259-7267dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26956g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014100159300001800300520148500318592002801803650001101831650001001842650001301852650002101865650002601886650001501912650001201927650001101939650002701950650001101977650001201988650001602000650001102016700001602027700001602043700001702059773012202076856007402198852000902272655001202281IND60641464020221118010159.0190505e20170118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064146402DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26965f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengchao10aGas-phase conformational preference of the smallest saccharide (glycolaldehyde) and its hydrated complexes with bridged hydrogen bonding  ap. 6242-6250.  aGlycoaldehyde (GA, HOCH₂CHO) is the simplest sugar unit of the carbohydrates and the only sugar to have been detected in interstellar space to date. In the present report, the conformation of GA and its flexible hydrated complexes have been investigated in the gas phase by using mass-selected infrared (IR) spectroscopy based on vacuum-ultraviolet single photon ionization (118 nm). With the aid of theoretical calculations, the neutral GA bearing a ring-type intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction was confirmed to be the dominant isomer in the gas phase. Moreover, the water molecules in the monohydrated complexes preferentially broke the intramolecular hydrogen bond and bridged the carbonyl oxygen and hydroxyl hydrogen of GA with two additional intermolecular H-bonds, revealing the “working rules” governing preferred binding. The theoretical results confirmed that the existence probability of the two lowest energy conformations stabilized by two intermolecular hydrogen bonds would be larger than that of the next two isomers with one intramolecular plus one intermolecular hydrogen bond. Structural investigation of hydrated GA conformers has revealed that the water molecules play the role of a bridge through intermolecular H-bonds, achieving selective population of specific GA molecular conformations. These results suggest that these hydrogen-bonded bridge structures in the hydrated complexes may provide good models for recognition in larger systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3agases 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aionization 3aisomers 3amodels 3amolecular conformation 3aoxygen 3aphotons 3aprobability 3asugars1 aHu, Yongjun1 aZhan, Huaqi1 aChen, Jiaxin0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 18, v. 7, no. 11 p.6242-6250dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26965f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012600169300001600295520162200311592002801933650002301961650002701984650002202011650002002033650001102053650000902064650000902073650001202082650001302094650003002107650002402137650001102161650001402172650002302186651001802209653003002227653002102257653002002278653001402298653001402312700001602326700001502342773015002357856008202507852000902589655001202598IND60546571720221119035935.0160903e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054657172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2014.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacksasitorn, S.10aPCBs refocused: Correlation of PCB concentrations in Green Bay legacy sediments with adjacent lithophilic, invasive biota  ap. 215-221.  aGreen Bay sediments exhibit a gradient of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations from the mouth of the Fox River to the northern end of the bay. This study explored whether the sediment concentration gradient was reflected along Green Bay's rocky (non-depositional) eastern coast in a suspension feeder, the invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis), as well as in the main predator on quagga mussels, the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). We performed congener-specific PCB analyses on quagga mussels and round gobies collected from ten sites along the east shore of Green Bay. PCB results were compared with sediment data. Regression analyses showed that mussel tissue PCB concentrations followed sediment PCB concentrations (F1,6=16.4, P=0.007) except at two sites near Sturgeon Bay where cleaner Lake Michigan water enters in tidal pulses. Round goby PCB concentrations also followed the sediment trends (F1,7=8.17, P=0.024). However, only a weak relationship between PCB concentrations in quagga mussel and round goby was found (P=0.085), even though the species are trophically linked. Here, ontogenetic and seasonal details of round goby diet strongly influenced PCB concentrations such that in areas adjacent to high sediment PCB concentrations, fish length dictated round goby's PCB concentration (F1,14=7.46, P=0.016). Overall, our findings indicate that these exotic benthos refocus PCBs in near-shore regions in a pattern similar to that observed in sediments. Our results also highlight the need to understand trophic details in order to track contaminant bioaccumulation accurately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena bugensis 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3abenthic organisms 3abioaccumulation 3acoasts 3adiet 3afish 3amussels 3aontogeny 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asediments 3asuspension feeding 3aLake Michigan 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aInvasive species 0aBioaccumulation 0aSediments 0aGreen Bay1 aJanssen, J.1 aGray, K.A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2015 Mar., v. 41 p.215-221dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes Research.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2014.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003700140245018900177500002000366520180400386592002802190650001502218650001102233650001602244650001202260650001202272650001302284650001702297650002202314650001302336650001102349650001102360650001202371650001202383650000702395650001802402650001802420650001502438650001202453650002302465650001502488650001802503700004002521700003402561700004002595700002902635700003002664773011502694856007402809852000902883655001202892IND60587226920221118035820.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058722692DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.132962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa Silva, Dairane Gabriela Leite10aEffect of the addition of guava, apple, mango, or banana on the physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics and on the acceptance of Minas Frescal cheese during cold storage  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of adding guava (20g/100 g), apple (20g/100 g), mango (10g/100 g) or banana (15g/100g) on physical and chemical characteristics and on acceptance of Minas Frescal cheese during cold storage (4 °C for 28 days) was evaluated. Fruit addition caused an increase in acidity and moisture content and decreases in ash content and consistency of the products. Cheeses with apple and mango presented firmness (on day 28) and acceptance similar to that of traditional cheese in most attributes, while the use of banana and guava requires some improvements. During cold storage, the cheeses with fruits behaved similarly to the traditional cheese, with decrease in pH and cohesiveness and increase in titratable acidity. Coliforms and Salmonella ssp. counts were within the limits established. It can be concluded that it is possible to develop Minas Frescal cheese flavored with fruits that have appropriated chemical composition, physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics and acceptance. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Promotion of the consumption of fruits and vegetables has become a public health priority in many countries in the last decade. Development of new cheese products will benefit both manufacturers and consumers. Manufacturers will be able to expand their market and profitability from new cheese products and consumers will have more choice to purchase and consume various types of cheese products. Minas Frescal cheeses flavored with fruits with appropriated chemical composition, physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics and acceptance were achieved by using 10 g/100g of mango or 20 g/100g of apple. The use of banana and guava requires some improvements, especially in appearance and texture attributes, although they have not been rejected by consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aapples 3aash content 3abananas 3acheeses 3acohesion 3acold storage 3acoliform bacteria 3afirmness 3afruits 3aguavas 3amangoes 3amarkets 3apH 3aprofitability 3apublic health 3apurchasing 3atexture 3atitratable acidity 3avegetables 3awater content1 aDa Silva, Isabela Carolina Ferreira1 aDe Oliveira, Juliana Ferreira1 aBellini, Elizabeth Szwako Liniewicz1 aKlososki, Suellen Jensen1 aPimentel, Tatiana Colombo0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Dec., v. 41, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.132963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014700161300001800308520142600326592002801752650001601780650002201796650001201818650002101830650001101851650001101862650001401873650002801887650001701915650002101932650002601953650001201979650001401991650001102005650001002016650001302026650002102039650001302060700001902073700001802092700001502110700001802125700001302143773012202156856007402278852000902352655001202361IND60641464120221118010013.0190505e20170123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064146412DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26966d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jiang-Feng10aSix new coordination compounds based on rigid 5-(3-carboxy-phenyl)-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid: synthesis, structural variations and properties  ap. 7217-7226.  aSix new coordination compounds Ni(cppca)(H₂O)₄·2H₂O (1), Co(cppca)(H₂O)₄·2H₂O (2), {Cd₂(cppca)₂(H₂O)₅}ₙ (3), {[Cd₃(cppca)₂(H₂P₂O₇)(H₂O)₆]·2H₂O}ₙ (4), {Cu(Hcppca)₂}ₙ (5) and {[Mn₇(cppca)₆(Hcppca)₂(H₂O)₁₀]·2H₂O}ₙ (6) have been obtained by reactions of the corresponding metal salts and the rigid ligand 5-(3-carboxy-phenyl)-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (H₂cppca) under solvothermal conditions. All the compounds were fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The single-crystal X-ray analyses showed that compounds 1–6 have rich structural chemistry ranging from mononuclear (1 and 2), one-dimensional (3 and 4), two-dimensional (5) to three-dimensional (6) structures. Moreover, the framework of compound 6 may be simplified into a 3-nodal net with Schlafli symbol {4²·6}{4²·8²·10²}{4³·6²·8·10⁴}₂, which shows an unprecedented (3,4,5)-connected topology net. The fluorescent properties of compounds 3 and 4 were investigated in the solid state and in various solvent emulsions, which indicated that compounds 3 and 4 are both highly sensitive fluorescent probes for the acetone molecules.

Ancillary ligands carry favorable light-harvesting abilities and are therefore crucial in determining the overall power conversion efficiencies. The use of ancillary ligands having aliphatic chains and/or π-extended aromatic units decreases charge recombination and permits the collection of a large fraction of sunlight. This review aims to provide insight into the relationship between ancillary ligand structure and DSSC properties, which can further guide the function-oriented design and synthesis of different sensitizers for DSSCs. This review outlines how the new and rapidly expanding class of chelating ancillary ligands bearing 2,2′-bipyridyl, 1,10-phenanthroline, carbene, dipyridylamine, pyridyl-benzimidazole, pyridyl-azolate, and other aromatic ligands provides a conduit for potentially enhancing the performance and stability of DSSCs. Finally, these classes of Ru polypyridyl complexes have gained increasing interest for feasible large-scale commercialization of DSSCs due to their more favorable light-harvesting abilities and long-term thermal and chemical stabilities compared with other conventional sensitizers. Therefore, the main idea is to inspire readers to explore new avenues in the design of new sensitizers for DSSCs based on different ancillary ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbenes 3acommercialization 3aligands 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asolar radiation1 aShahroosvand, Hashem1 aGrätzel, Michael,1 aNazeeruddin, Mohammad Khaja0 tChemical Reviews.g2016 Aug. 24, v. 116, no. 16 p.9485-9564dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.chemrev.5b006213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245006500168520083500233592002801068650002101096650002801117650002501145650001001170650003601180650003201216650002201248650001601270650001701286650004401303650004301347650005201390650001301442650001801455653001601473653002401489653002201513653001201535653001401547700001601561700001301577700001701590700001601607700001301623700002001636700001401656700001301670773009801683856008801781852000901869655001201878IND60682958720221117215635.0200228e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068295872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1122882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gang10aChemical constituents from shells of Xanthoceras sorbifolium  aThree undescribed triterpenes and four previously unreported saponins, along with two known ones, were isolated from shells of Xanthoceras sorbifolium (Sapindaceae).

Western blot, RT-qPCR, and docking experiments further validated that the regulation of iNOS and IL-1β expressions was involved in the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of these two compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aXanthoceras sorbifolium 3achemical composition 3adrugs 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aminocycline 3anitric oxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asaponins 3atriterpenoids 0aSapindaceae 0aTriterpene saponins 0aNeuroinflammation 0aDocking 0aMicroglia1 aXie, Yumeng1 aZhou, Di1 aYang, Yanqiu1 aLiu, Jingyu1 aHou, Yue1 aCheng, Maosheng1 aLiu, Yang1 aLi, Ning0 tPhytochemistry.g2020 Apr., v. 172 p.112288-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1122883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04466naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013800211300001100349520247500360592002802835596009702863596009702960650002603057650001203083650001303095650001103108650001803119650001903137650001103156650001403167650001503181650001903196650001503215650001903230650001903249650001703268650001503285650001803300650001203318650001303330650001403343650001403357650001103371650002403382651001603406700002203422700001903444700002303463700006003486700006003546700006303606773011503669856008303784852000903867655001203876IND60762161620221117095213.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216162DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-03113-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHäfliger, Irene M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5648-963X10aDSP missense variant in a Scottish Highland calf with congenital ichthyosis, alopecia, acantholysis of the tongue and corneal defects  ap. 20.  aBACKGROUND: Ichthyosis describes a localized or generalized hereditary cornification disorder caused by an impaired terminal keratinocyte differentiation resulting in excessive stratum corneum with the formation of more or less adherent scales. Ichthyosis affects humans and animals. Two rare bovine forms are reported, the severe harlequin ichthyosis and the less severe congenital ichthyosis, both characterized by a severe orthokeratotic lamellar hyperkeratosis. RESULTS: A 2-weeks-old purebred Scottish Highland calf was referred because of a syndrome resembling congenital ichthyosis. The clinical phenotype included diffuse alopecia and a markedly lichenified skin covered with large and excessive scales. Additionally, conjunctivitis and ulceration of the cornea were noted. Post-mortem examination revealed deep fissures in the diffusely thickened tongue and histopathological findings in the skin confirmed the clinical diagnosis. Whole-genome sequencing of the affected calf and comparison of the data with control genomes was performed. A search for private variants in known candidate genes for skin phenotypes including genes related with erosive and hyperkeratotic lesions revealed a single homozygous protein-changing variant, DSP: c.6893 C>A, or p.Ala2298Asp. The variant is predicted to change a highly conserved residue in the C-terminal plakin domain of the desmoplakin protein, which represents a main intracellular component of desmosomes, important intercellular adhesion molecules in various tissues including epidermis. Sanger sequencing confirmed the variant was homozygous in the affected calf and heterozygous in both parents. Further genotyping of 257 Scottish Highland animals from Switzerland revealed an estimated allele frequency of 1.2%. The mutant allele was absent in more than 4800 controls from various other cattle breeds. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first report of combined lesions compatible with congenital ichthyosis, alopecia, acantholysis of the tongue and corneal defects associated with a DSP missense variant as the most likely underlying cause. To the best of our knowledge, this study is also the first report of a DSP-related syndromic form of congenital ichthyosis in domestic animals. The results of our study enable genetic testing to avoid the unintentional occurrence of further affected cattle. The findings were added to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) database (OMIA 002243-9913).  aPublisher supplied data  a31003A_172911cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a31003A_172911cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung 3aMendelian inheritance 3aalleles 3aalopecia 3acalves 3acell adhesion 3aconjunctivitis 3acornea 3adatabases 3adesmosomes 3agene frequency 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3ahistopathology 3ahomozygosity 3aichthyosis 3akeratinocytes 3amutants 3anecropsy 3aphenotype 3apurebreds 3atongue 3aveterinary medicine 3aSwitzerland1 aKoch, Caroline T.1 aMichel, Astrid1 aRüfenacht, Silvia1 aMeylan, Mireille1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0191-56861 aWelle, Monika M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4876-51121 aDrögemüller, Cord1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9773-522X0 tBMC veterinary research.g2022 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.20-20dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-03113-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245013700159300001800296520095200314592002801266650001301294650001401307650002301321650002001344650001701364650001901381650001201400650001101412650001301423650001701436650001401453650001301467650001701480700001401497700001201511700005901523700001601582773017101598856008001769852000901849655001201858IND60632289220221118173107.0190314e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063228922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b060892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Ping10aCorrelation of the Vanadium Precursor and Structure Performance of Porous VOX-SiO₂ Solids for Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Propane  ap. 4065-4073.  aVOX-SiO₂ catalysts have been synthesized by the one-pot method using different vanadium precursors, namely, ammonium metavanadate (NH₄VO₃; VO₃–, V⁵⁺), vanadium acetylacetonate [V(acac)₃; organic complex, V³⁺], and vanadyl sulfate (VOSO₄; VO²⁺, V⁴⁺). The influence of different vanadium precursors on the structure–performance relationship of these catalysts is studied on the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. The catalysts derived from VO₃– attain a mesoporous structure with fairly high specific surface area and large pore volume, while those prepared with V(acac)₃ or VOSO₄ display a microporous structure. It is noted that VOX-SiO₂ catalysts derived from NH₄VO₃ present a better catalytic performance, and low-polymerized VOX species display better intrinsic activity compared with isolated species. This study may contribute to the selection of vanadium precursors for the one-pot synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3apropane 3asilica 3asulfates 3asurface area 3asynthesis 3avanadium 3avanadyl ions1 aChen, Yan1 aYan, Xi1 aLang, Wan-Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2407-82271 aGuo, Ya-Jun0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 58, no. 10 p.4065-4073dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b060893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03411naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245011200177300001600289500001500305520159000320592002801910650002901938650003001967650002101997650002602018650001802044650001402062650003202076650001102108650001802119650001402137650001002151650001202161650002502173650001502198650003202213650004402245650002602289650003902315650003502354650001802389650004102407650001202448650003402460650003002494650005502524653002002579700001802599700001802617700001602635773011302651856004802764852000902812655001202821IND4472989920221118002918.0121003e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447298992DNAL7 a216561392pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3373-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Wen10aExpression of family 3 cellulose-binding module (CBM3) as an affinity tag for recombinant proteins in yeast  ap. 789-798.  a2019-12-06  aEasy and low-cost protein purification methods for the mass production of commonly used enzymes that play important roles in biotechnology are in high demand. In this study, we developed a fast, low-cost recombinant protein purification system in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris using the family 3 cellulose-binding module (CBM3)-based affinity tag. The codon of the cbm3 gene from Clostridium thermocellum was optimized based on the codon usage of P. pastoris. The CBM3 tag was then fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (CBM3-EGFP) or with inulinase and expressed in P. pastoris to demonstrate its ability to function as an affinity tag in a yeast expression system. We also examined the effects of glycosylation on the secreted CBM3-tag. The secreted wild-type CBM3-EGFP was glycosylated; however, this had little influence on the adsorption of the fusion protein to the regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC; maximum adsorption capacity of 319 mg/g). Two CBM3-EGFP mutants lacking glycosylation sites were also constructed. The three CBM3-EGFPs expressed in P. pastoris and the CBM3-EGFP expressed in Escherichia coli all had similar RAC adsorption capacity. To construct a tag-free recombinant protein purification system based on CBM3, a CBM3-intein-EGFP fusion protein was expressed in P. pastoris. This fusion protein was stably expressed and the self-cleavage of intein was efficiently induced by DTT or L-cysteine. In this study, we were able to purify the recombinant fusion protein with high efficiency using both intein and direct fusion-based strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aEscherichia coli 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aglycosylation 3ainulinase 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3ayeasts 3abiotechnology 3acellulose 3agenes 3amutants 3apurification methods 3aadsorption 2aAffinity Labelsxmetabolism 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aClostridium thermocellumxgenetics 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aGlycosylation 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgenetics 2aInteins 2aPichiaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Bindingxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aPichia pastoris1 aWang, Dongmei1 aGao, Xiaolian1 aHong, Jiong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 Aug., v. 91, no. 3 p.789-798dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3373-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015800153500002000311520163400331592002801965650003201993650002102025650002102046650002002067650004102087650002302128650001302151650002302164650000902187650001102196650002302207650001002230650002002240650003202260650001102292650001602303650001202319650002302331700001302354700001302367700001802380700001502398700001502413700001302428700001502441700001402456700002102470773011502491856007402606852000902680655001202689IND60587227120221118035832.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058722712DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.132672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Jian10aEffects of different salts and temperature on the binding force between the myosin and the volatile compounds of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthysmolitrix)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article studied the effect of different salts and heating temperature on the binding of silver carp volatile compounds and myosin. The binding ability of myosin was determined by measuring the relative headspace concentration of the volatile compounds in the presence of each myosin using solid‐phase microextraction and GC/MS analysis. The results showed that: after treated with KCl and NaCl solution, the binding force between myosin and this four volatile compounds whole decreased; after treated with MgCl₂ and CaCl₂, the binding force between myosin and hexanal, heptanal, 1‐octene‐3‐alcohol decreased, and when its concentration were beyond 2.5 mol·L⁻¹, the binding force between myosin and hexanol increased. After treated with different temperature, the binding force between myosin and hexanal, heptanal, 1‐octene‐3‐alcohol whole decreased and moreover, the higher the heating temperature the lower the binding force. On the contrary, the binding force between myosin and hexanol increased with the rose of heating temperature. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthysmolitrix) was selected as the preferred materials to product freshwater‐fish surimi because of its good gel‐forming ability. However, its application in surimi products is restricted due to the inherent smell thus reducing the value of the processing. Myosin which composed the important part of the meat is not only influence the surimi texture but also influence the release of volatile compounds. Hence, it is extremely essential to research the interaction between volatile compounds and fish protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3abinding capacity 3acalcium chloride 3afreshwater fish 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3ahexanols 3amagnesium chloride 3ameat 3amyosin 3apotassium chloride 3asmell 3asodium chloride 3asolid phase microextraction 3asurimi 3atemperature 3atexture 3avolatile compounds1 aQiao, Yu1 aLi, Yang1 aHu, Jianzhong1 aWang, Chao1 aDing, Anzi1 aLiao, Li1 aWu, Wenjin1 aWang, Lan1 aXiong, Guangquan0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Dec., v. 41, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.132673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245009300212300001600305506007600321520123400397592002801631506003701659650000801696650002501704650001301729650001201742650001601754650001901770650001801789700001801807700002301825700001801848700001801866700001601884700002601900700001601926700002001942700001801962700002501980700002302005700002102028700001702049773007302066856008202139852000902221655001202230IND60551716020221207054433.0161019e20150507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055171602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.0342doi7 aPMC44286712pmcid7 a259576852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPefanis, Evangelos10aRNA Exosome-Regulated Long Non-Coding RNA Transcription Controls Super-Enhancer Activity  ap. 774-789.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have ablated the cellular RNA degradation machinery in differentiated B cells and pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by conditional mutagenesis of core (Exosc3) and nuclear RNase (Exosc10) components of RNA exosome and identified a vast number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) with emergent functionality. Unexpectedly, eRNA-expressing regions accumulate R-loop structures upon RNA exosome ablation, thus demonstrating the role of RNA exosome in resolving deleterious DNA/RNA hybrids arising from active enhancers. We have uncovered a distal divergent eRNA-expressing element (lncRNA-CSR) engaged in long-range DNA interactions and regulating IgH 3′ regulatory region super-enhancer function. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ablation of lncRNA-CSR transcription decreases its chromosomal looping-mediated association with the IgH 3′ regulatory region super-enhancer and leads to decreased class switch recombination efficiency. We propose that the RNA exosome protects divergently transcribed lncRNA expressing enhancers by resolving deleterious transcription-coupled secondary DNA structures, while also regulating long-range super-enhancer chromosomal interactions important for cellular function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aembryonic stem cells 3aexosomes 3ahybrids 3amutagenesis 3anon-coding RNA 3aribonucleases1 aWang, Jiguang1 aRothschild, Gerson1 aLim, Junghyun1 aKazadi, David1 aSun, Jianbo1 aFederation, Alexander1 aChao, Jaime1 aElliott, Oliver1 aLiu, Zhi-Ping1 aEconomides, Aris N.1 aBradner, James E.1 aRabadán, Raúl,1 aBasu, Uttiya0 tCell.g2015 May 07, v. 161 p.774-789dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012000175300001100295520139400306592002801700650002801728650002201756650001101778650001901789650001301808650001501821650001401836650001001850650002001860650002401880650001401904651000901918700002501927700005701952700002102009700001702030700002002047700002802067700002002095700002602115700003402141700003302175700002802208700002102236700002002257773011502277856008302392852000902475655001202484IND60762161820221117094612.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216182DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-03131-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajimohammadi, Bahador10aOccurrence and genetic characterization of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato from domestic animals in Central Iran  ap. 22.  aBACKGROUND: The species complex of Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.) causes cystic echinococcosis distributed worldwide. There is no genotype information from hydatid cysts in the intermediate hosts in Central Iran. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the hydatid cysts in livestock slaughtered in an abattoir in this region. Six hundred fifty-seven hydatid cysts were isolated from 97 animals, including sheep, cattle, camels, and goats slaughtered in Yazd abattoir from September 2018 to January 2020. The demographic data was collected as well as cyst location, fertility, and viability. Out of 657 samples, 164 samples were genotyped. Then, phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGAX. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS version 16.0 by chi-square with a significant difference of less than 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 164 samples, the G1-G3 complex genotype had the most frequency in samples, with 135 cases recognized. The G6/G7 was observed in 19 isolates and G5 was reported in nine samples. One sample was detected as Taenia hydatigena. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that G1-G3 and G6/G7 genotypes were presented in all animals, but G5 was reported only in cattle, goats, and camels. It is the first molecular identification of cystic echinococcosis in Central Iran. Hence, reporting G5 in livestock in this area should be considered due to transmission to humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aTaenia hydatigena 3acattle 3aechinococcosis 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aphylogeny 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3aveterinary medicine 3aviability 3aIran1 aDalimi, Abdolhossein1 aEslami, Gilda1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4521-40591 aAhmadian, Salman1 aZandi, Sajad1 aBaghbani, Ahmad1 aHosseini, Saeedeh Sadat1 aAskari, Vahideh1 aSheykhzadegan, Maryam1 aArdekani, Mehrnoosh Nabizadeh1 aBoozhmehrani, Mohammad Javad1 aRanjbar, Mohammad Javad1 aGhoshouni, Hamed1 aVakili, Mahmood0 tBMC veterinary research.g2022 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.22-22dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-03131-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245014400171300001800315520121600333592002801549650001301577650001401590650001401604650001901618650000901637650001201646650001601658650001301674650001501687650001901702650003301721650001801754650002401772650002101796700006401817700002401881700002601905700002701931700002301958700002501981773017002006856008002176852000902256655001202265IND60632289420190426000000.0190314e20190208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063228942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b061132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilivojević, Ana D.10aNovel Approach for Flavonoid Esters Production: Statistically Optimized Enzymatic Synthesis Using Natural Oils and Application in Cosmetics  ap. 3640-3649.  aThe present work describes application of natural triglycerides for lipase-catalyzed esterification of structurally diverse flavonoids—esculin, naringin, and phloridzin. Ester mixtures with laurate, linolenate, or linoleate as prevailing products were obtained in reactions with coconut, linseed, and sunflower oils, respectively. By using response surface methodology, the influences of key experimental factors—reaction time, substrates, and enzyme concentrations—for transesterification of esculin with linseed oil were investigated. High molar conversion (78.5%), product yield (19.13 mg/mL), and specific yield (2.83 mmol/gₑₙzyₘₑ) were achieved at optimized conditions. Determined optimums were successfully applied in esculin transesterification with other two oils. Furthermore, esculin ester mixtures were incorporated in gel emulsions, and their effect on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as well as skin sensitivity was examined. Obtained results have shown significant hydration effect and good dermatological compatibility without irritating effects of all examined preparations containing oil-derived esculin esters, making them very prospective for application in skin care products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoconuts 3acosmetics 3aemulsions 3aesterification 3agels 3alinseed 3alinseed oil 3anaringin 3aphloridzin 3aprocess design 3aresponse surface methodology 3asunflower oil 3atransesterification 3atriacylglycerols1 aĆorović, Marija M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9432-79171 aSimović, Milica B.1 aBanjanac, Katarina M.1 aBlagojević, Stevan N.1 aPjanović, Rada V.1 aBezbradica, Dejan I.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 08, v. 58, no. 9 p.3640-3649dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b061133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01466naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011300160300002000273520035500293592002800648650002700676650001100703650001100714650002300725650001700748650002100765650001900786650001100805650001500816700001700831700001700848700002000865773013600885856007401021852000901095655001201104IND60660774120221119054935.0190827e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066077412DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08044k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jia-Liang12aA ratiometric fluorescent probe with unexpected high selectivity for ATP and its application in cell imaging  ap. 15411-15414.  aNaphthalimide–rhodamine compound (NR) is developed as a ratiometric fluorescent probe for ATP detection based on the FRET mechanism.

The results showed that percent weight gain (PWG), specific growth rate (SGR), and feed intake (FI) were decreased by reducing dietary protein from 34 to 32% (P < 0.05). Supplying low-protein diet with optimal ETSP increased previously mentioned indices of juvenile Jian carp (P < 0.05), which also had no significant difference with the high-protein diet (34%CP) (P > 0.05). Compared with the low-protein diet, appropriate ETSP supplementation in the low-protein diet increased (P < 0.05) (1) the trypsin, lipase, and amylase activities in the hepatopancreas; (2) cholecystokinin concentration in the proximal intestine; (3) the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activities in all intestinal segments; and (4) the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of trypsin, lipase, and amylase in hepatopancreas and γ-GT in the mid (MI) and distal (DI) intestine, alkaline phosphatase in MI, and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase and target of rapamycin in all intestinal segments. At the same time, appropriate ETSP supplementation in the low-protein diet downregulated the mRNA levels of AKP in the DI and eIF4E-binding protein 2 in all intestinal segments (P < 0.05). In conclusion, adding 10 g ETSP/kg diet in the low-protein diet can restore the growth performance and digestive and absorptive abilities to the levels in group with 34% dietary protein. Supplementation of optimal ETSP in the low-protein diet enhanced the digestive and absorptive abilities and regulated the signaling molecules related to the TOR signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aamylases 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acarp 3acholecystokinin 3aenzyme activity 3afeed intake 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3ahepatopancreas 3ahigh protein diet 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alow protein diet 3amessenger RNA 3arapamycin 3asoy protein 3aspecific growth rate 3atarget of rapamycin signaling pathways 3atrypsin 3aweight gain1 aJiang, Weidan1 aFeng, Lin1 aLiu, Yang1 aWu, Pei1 aJiang, Jun1 aZhang, Yongan1 aZhou, Xiaoqiu0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1657-1675dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-017-0400-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01409naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010000153300001800253520031700271592002800588650002300616650001300639650001300652650001800665650001500683700001600698700001200714700001500726700001500741700001700756700001600773700001600789700001400805773013300819856007400952852000901026655001201035IND60660774220221119055014.0190827e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066077422DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08045a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, T.10aDroplet-assisted fabrication of colloidal crystals from flower-shaped porphyrin Janus particles  ap. 1367-1370.  aA facile fabrication of flower-shaped porphyrin Janus colloids with oriented arrangement was demonstrated based on the interfacial assembly and water droplet template.

Testing this pattern is difficult because of the complexity of distributions across wide geographical areas. An alternative strategy, however, is to measure species’ distributional patterns along elevational gradients. We applied this strategy to examine whether lowland forest birds are indeed less common near their upper range limits on a Bornean mountain, and tested co‐occurrence patterns among species for potential causes of attenuation, including signatures of habitat selection and competition at the periphery of their ranges. LOCATION: Mt. Mulu, Borneo. TAXON: Rain forest birds. METHODS: We surveyed lowland forest birds on Mt. Mulu (2,376 m), classified their elevation‐occupancy distributions using Huisman–Olff–Fresco (HOF) models, and examined co‐occurrence patterns of species pairs for signatures of shared habitat patches and interspecific competition. RESULTS: For 39 of 50 common species, occupancy was highest at sea level then gradually declined near their upper range edges, in keeping with a “rare periphery” hypothesis. With respect to habitat selection, lowland species do not appear to cluster together at sites of patchy similar habitat near their upper range limits; neither are most lowland species segregated from potential montane competitors where ranges overlap. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: High relative abundance at sea level implies that species inhabit “truncated niches” and are not currently near the limits of their fundamental niche, unless unknown critical response thresholds exist. However, indirect effects of increasing temperature predicted under climate change scenarios could still influence lower range limits of lowland species indirectly by altering habitat, precipitation regimes and competitive interactions. The lack of non‐random co‐occurrence patterns implies that patchy habitat and simple pairwise species interactions are unlikely to be responsible for upper range limits in most species; diffuse competition across diverse rain forest bird communities could still play a role.  aPublisher supplied data  a1241059cDivision of Environmental Biology  a8753‐10cNational Geographic Society  cLouisiana Board of Regents 3aBorneo 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aforest birds 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific competition 3alowland forests 3arain forests 3asea level 3atemperature1 aStyring, Alison R.1 aRahman, Mustafa A.1 aSheldon, Frederick H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0815-87800 tJournal of biogeography.g2019 Nov., v. 46, no. 11 p.2583-2596dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.136913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002100170245008400191300001600275520157500291592002801866650002001894650001501914650001601929650002001945650002001965650001501985650000902000650001702009650003802026650001402064650002402078650002002102653002002122653001902142653001502161653002102176653002002197700002002217700002002237700002402257700002002281700002102301773010402322856008502426852000902511655001202520IND60113343620221119094716.0160903e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011334362DNAL7 a240016782pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurmi, Elizabeth13aAn integrated representation of the services provided by global water resources  ap. 456-462.  aWater is essential not only to maintain the livelihoods of human beings but also to sustain ecosystems. Over the last few decades several global assessments have reviewed current and future uses of water, and have offered potential solutions to a possible water crisis. However, these have tended to focus on water supply rather than on the range of demands for all water services (including those of ecosystems). In this paper, a holistic global view of water resources and the services they provide is presented, using Sankey diagrams as a visualisation tool. These diagrams provide a valuable addition to the spatial maps of other global assessments, as they track the sources, uses, services and sinks of water resources. They facilitate comparison of different water services, and highlight trade-offs amongst them. For example, they reveal how increasing the supply of water resources to one service (crop production) can generate a reduction in provision of other water services (e.g., to ecosystem maintenance). The potential impacts of efficiency improvements in the use of water are also highlighted; for example, reduction in soil evaporation from crop production through better farming practices, or the results of improved treatment and re-use of return flows leading to reduction of delivery to final sinks. This paper also outlines the measures needed to ensure sustainable water resource use and supply for multiple competing services in the future, and emphasises that integrated management of land and water resources is essential to achieve this goal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aecosystems 3aevaporation 3afarming systems 3aland management 3alivelihood 3asoil 3awater supply 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Resources 0aGlobal analysis 0aWater services 0aEcosystems 0aWater management 0aLand management1 aRichards, Keith1 aFenner, Richard1 aAllwood, Julian M.,1 aKopec, Grant M.1 aBajželj, Bojana0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 129 p.456-462dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.07.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01168naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245004400164300001600208520033800224592002800562650001400590650001700604650001900621650001700640700001700657700001800674700001200692773010500704856004800809852000900857655001200866IND4412560220221118003036.0130425e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441256022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-008-9091-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTantray, M.

Results showed that fish subjected to higher stocking density presented lower final body weights (FBW), specific growth ratio (SGR), and gonad adipose tissue index (GAI) (P < 0.05). Lower lipid content was observed in the liver, gonad adipose tissue and muscle in sturgeons held in HSD group (P < 0.05). The serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) decreased significantly with increasing stocking density, while no significant change was observed for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Furthermore, the cDNAs encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) were isolated in Amur sturgeon, respectively. The full-length LPL cDNA was composed of 1757 bp with an open reading frame of 501 amino acids, while the complete nucleotide sequences of HL covered 1747 bp encoding 499 amino acids. In the liver, the activities and mRNA levels of LPL were markedly lower in HSD group, which were consistent with the variation tendency of HL. Fish reared in HSD group also presented lower levels of activities and mRNA expression of LPL in the muscle and gonad. Moreover, the expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in both the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly upregulated in HSD group. Overall, the results indicated that high stocking density negatively affects growth performance and lipid deposition of Amur sturgeon to a certain extent. The downregulation of LPL and HL and the upregulation of PPARα may be responsible for the lower lipid distribution of Amur sturgeon in higher stocking density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser schrenckii 3aadipose tissue 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alipid content 3alipoprotein lipase 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aopen reading frames 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3arearing 3askeletal muscle 3astocking rate 3asturgeon 3atriacylglycerols1 aWen, Haishen1 aLi, Yun1 aLi, Jifang1 aHe, Feng1 aNi, Meng0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1707-1720dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-017-0403-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245015600162300001800318520106500336592002801401650001101429650001301440650001301453650001301466650002201479650000901501650001201510650002201522650001101544650001101555650001901566650001001585650001301595700001501608700001501623700005401638700005701692773017101749856008001920852000902000655001202009IND60632289820221118172740.0190314e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063228982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b061622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haifeng10a110th Anniversary: Concurrently Coating and Doping High-Valence Vanadium in Nickel-Rich Lithiated Oxides for High-Rate and Stable Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 4108-4115.  aSurface engineering and heteroelement doping are recognized as highly effective protocols to enhance nickel (Ni)-rich lithiated oxides. Herein, we report the kilogram-scale preparation of the concurrent coating and doping of high-valence vanadium (V) in Ni-rich LiNi₀.₈₁₅Co₀.₁₅Al₀.₀₃₅O₂ (denoted as V-NCA) cathode materials. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is greatly restricted by removing the residual lithium salts after the reaction with a vanadium source. In the subsequent low-temperature process, the coating of vanadium compounds (V₂O₅, Li₃VO₄) and the doping of V ions have been realized, which remarkably decreases the dissolution of active materials and the Li⁺/Ni²⁺ disorder. Consequently, the stable reversible specific capacity increases by 17.7% at 0.1 C (202.6 mAh g–¹) and by 59.6% at 5 C (147 mAh g–¹) compared with the pristine NCA. We also assembled a pouch cell of 650 mAh (3.33 g of V-NCA) by choosing graphite as the anode material, in which 89.2% capacity retention is achieved after 500 cycles at 1 C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acoatings 3agraphene 3ahydrofluoric acid 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3anickel 3aoxides 3aprocess design 3asalts 3avanadium1 aLi, Yugang1 aHu, Yanjie1 aJiang, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4388-65481 aLi, Chunzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7897-58500 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 58, no. 10 p.4108-4115dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b061623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245008600210300001800296506007600314520118300390592002801573506003701601650001301638650003201651650004901683650001201732650004401744650003301788700001801821700002301839700002501862700001801887700001901905700002301924700002301947700002101970700002301991700002302014700002302037773007502060856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60551716520221207054510.0161019e20150521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055171652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.0432doi7 aPMC44418532pmcid7 a259816652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManglik, Aashish10aStructural Insights into the Dynamic Process of β2-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling  ap. 1101-1111.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce signals from the extracellular environment to intracellular proteins. To gain structural insight into the regulation of receptor cytoplasmic conformations by extracellular ligands during signaling, we examine the structural dynamics of the cytoplasmic domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) using 19F-fluorine NMR and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy. These studies show that unliganded and inverse-agonist-bound β2AR exists predominantly in two inactive conformations that exchange within hundreds of microseconds. Although agonists shift the equilibrium toward a conformation capable of engaging cytoplasmic G proteins, they do so incompletely, resulting in increased conformational heterogeneity and the coexistence of inactive, intermediate, and active states. Complete transition to the active conformation requires subsequent interaction with a G protein or an intracellular G protein mimetic. These studies demonstrate a loose allosteric coupling of the agonist-binding site and G-protein-coupling interface that may generally be responsible for the complex signaling behavior observed for many GPCRs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagonists 3abeta-2 adrenergic receptors 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein-protein interactions1 aKim, Tae Hun1 aMasureel, Matthieu1 aAltenbach, Christian1 aYang, Zhongyu1 aHilger, Daniel1 aLerch, Michael T.1 aKobilka, Tong Sun1 aThian, Foon Sun1 aHubbell, Wayne L.1 aProsser, R. Scott1 aKobilka, Brian K.,0 tCell.g2015 May 21, v. 161 p.1101-1111dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245017300170300001100343520176100354592002802115650001702143650002802160650002002188650002102208650002302229650002002252650001402272650002102286650001302307650002402320700002102344700002302365700003102388700002702419773011502446856008302561852000902644655001202653IND60762162220221117094231.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216222DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-021-03125-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPongkan, Wanpitak10aShort-term melatonin supplementation decreases oxidative stress but does not affect left ventricular structure and function in myxomatous mitral valve degenerative dogs  ap. 24.  aBACKGROUND: Cardiac wall stress and high oxidative stress are often found in cases of myxomatous mitral valve degenerative (MMVD) disease and can lead to myocardial injuries and cardiac dysfunction. Melatonin, an antioxidant, has been shown to exert cardioprotection in laboratory animal models. However, its effect on metabolic parameters and left ventricular (LV) adaptation in MMVD dogs has rarely been investigated. This clinical trial hypothesized that a melatonin supplement for 4 weeks would improve metabolic parameters, LV structure (diameters and wall thickness), and LV function in MMVD dogs. Blood profiles, echocardiograms, and oxidative stress levels were obtained from 18 dogs with MMVD stage B2 and C at baseline and after prescribed Melatonin (2 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Eleven dogs with MMVD stage B2 and C, which received a placebo, were evaluated as a control group. RESULTS: In this clinical trial, the baseline plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was no different between the treatment and placebo groups. The post-treatment plasma MDA levels (4.50 ± 0.63 mg/mL) in the treatment group was significantly decreased after 4 weeks of melatonin supplementation compared to pre-treatment levels (7.51 ± 1.11 mg/mL) (P = 0.038). However, blood profiles and LV structure and function investigated using echocardiography were found not to different between pre-and post-treatment in each group. No adverse effects were observed following melatonin supplementation.

Results showed that the LAL content increased significantly (p < .05) when the protein concentration, pH, heating temperature, and time (>10 min) increased respectively. Addition of sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP, ∼0.6%, wt/wt) significantly (p < .05) reduced LAL content by 35.5%. We concluded that STPP can effectively inhibit the LAL formation during thermal treatment of WPC under the alkaline condition (e.g., pH 8.5). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Whey proteins have been widely used in food industry. It is necessary to investigate the lysinoalanine (LAL) (a cross‐linked amino acid) content in heat‐treated whey protein products. The LAL formation during thermal treatment of whey protein concentrate solutions at high pH values was inhibited by adding sodium tripolyphosphate (a food additive).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acrosslinking 3afood additives 3afood industry 3afunctional properties 3aheat treatment 3anutritive value 3apH 3aprotein content 3asodium tripolyphosphate 3atemperature 3awhey protein concentrate1 aZhao, Changhui1 aGuo, Mingruo0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Dec., v. 41, no. 6dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.135013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014900176300001100325520210100336592002802437650002102465650001502486650001002501650001102511650002102522650001102543650001402554650001402568650004302582650001302625650000902638650001002647650001702657650002402674650001202698650001502710651001102725651001002736651001102746700001602757700002402773700002302797700002402820700002202844700002102866700006102887700003302948773011502981856008303096852000903179655001203188IND60762162320221117094436.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076216232DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-022-03138-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiarello, Flavia Pruiti10aAujeszky’s disease in hunting dogs after the ingestion of wild boar raw meat in Sicily (Italy): clinical, diagnostic and phylogenetic features  ap. 27.  aBACKGROUND: Aujeszky's disease is caused by Suid Herpes Virus-1 and species belonging to the genus Sus scrofa are the main reservoir hosts. This virus, however, is capable of infecting and causing severe disease, with an almost constant fatal outcome in other species, both domestic and wild (carnivores, monogastric herbivores and ruminants). Moreover, the possibility of transmission to humans has been demonstrated. This study reports and describes the clinical, diagnostic, pathological and phylogenetic aspects of two cases of Aujeszky's disease in two hunting dogs following the ingestion of infected wild boar raw meat. These cases are contextualized in the province of Messina (Sicily), where a high prevalence of Aujeszky's disease has been recorded (average of 12,20% in the period 2010–2019) in farmed pig, and with evidence of spread to other species. A severe outbreak in cattle has recently been reported in these areas. Nevertheless, cases of Aujeszky's disease in dogs are rarely reported and this study represents the first well-documented report in this species in Sicily. CASE PRESENTATION: After a wild boar hunt, two dogs showed neurological symptoms and intense itching unresponsive to therapy. Diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease was made based on clinical suspicion, anamnestic information and confirmed by the isolation of the virus from the brain of both dogs. In addition, molecular typing, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the Real-Time PCR products were performed. The sequences studied were placed in the Italian Clade 1 along with the sequences obtained from wild boars and hunting dogs from Italy and France. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of this disease in non-natural hosts in Sicilian multi-host epidemiological contexts suggests that the risk of inter-species transmission is concrete and that attention should be paid to developing disease control programs in these territories. The data obtained from genome sequencing of the two SuHV-1 isolates contribute to the enrichment of the GenBank with unknown sequences and the phylogenetic analysis implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAujeszky disease 3aSus scrofa 3abrain 3acattle 3adisease severity 3agenome 3aingestion 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araw meat 3arisk 3aswine 3atherapeutics 3aveterinary medicine 3aviruses 3awild boars 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aMoreno, Ana1 aMiragliotta, Nicola1 aAntonino, Aliberti1 aFiasconaro, Michele1 aPurpari, Giuseppa1 aAmato, Benedetta1 aIppolito, Dorotea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2997-72801 aDi Marco Lo Presti, Vincenzo0 tBMC veterinary research.g2022 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.27-27dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-022-03138-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009500173300001600268520174300284592002802027650003902055650001602094650001402110650002202124650001302146650005802159651001002217651001502227651001502242651001102257651001802268651001802286653000902304653000902313653001002322653000702332653000802339653001302347653000902360653001502369653001902384653002702403700002502430700002502455700002202480700001902502700002402521700002302545700005902568773011502627856008502742852000902827655001202836IND60591521020221116224123.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059152102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaugaliyeva, Аida10aGenotyping of Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus strains in Kazakhstan using MLVA-15  ap. 135-144.  aCurrently, although the prevalence of brucellosis in Kazakhstan remains high, there are limited data available on the genetic diversity of circulating Brucella strains. Here, MLVA was employed to genotype a panel of 102 Brucella isolates collected from eight Kazakh regions and neighboring countries (Russia, Kyrgyzstan) during the period 1935–2017. MLVA-11 analysis classified 64 B. abortus strains into genotypes 72, 82, 331, 71, 341 and 69, while one genotype was novel, having no correspondence within the MLVA international database. MLVA-11 analysis of 37 B. melitensis strains showed 100% identity with genotypes 116, 114 and 11. One B. suis strain was classified into genotype 33.Phylogeography based on MLVA-15 demonstrated that all B. abortus and B. melitensis strains belonged to “Abortus C” and “East Mediterranean” lineages, respectively. B. abortus strains from Kazakhstan and Russia resulted genetically related to Portuguese, Brazilian and US isolates, suggesting ancient spread of these lineages from Europe westwards to South America and eastwards to Turkey, Russia and Asia. Most of Kazakh B. melitensis isolates were related to strains circulating in China, likely due to long-term trading partnerships between the two countries.In fine-scale MLVA-15 analysis, 17 B. abortus and 12 B. melitensis genotypes were identified; among them 12 are novel. Interestingly, epidemiological information supporting molecular data were retrieved for two clusters within the B. abortus group, thus proving that MLVA is an appropriate tool for effective traceback analyses. Our findings suggest that molecular genotyping should be applied systematically to support control plans for eradication of brucellosis in Kazakhstan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3abrucellosis 3adatabases 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amultiple-locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis 3aChina 3aKazakhstan 3aKyrgyzstan 3aRussia 3aSouth America 3aUnited States 0aVNTR 0aMLVA 0aUPGMA 0aGT 0aMST 0aBrucella 0aMLVA 0aGenotyping 0aPhylogeography 0aMolecular epidemiology1 aSultanov, Akhmetzhan1 aUsserbayev, Bekbolat1 aBaramova, Sholpan1 aModesto, Paola1 aAdambayeva, Akmaral1 aAcutis, Pier Luigi1 aPeletto, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8684-898X0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Mar., v. 58 p.135-144dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013800211300001600349520149100365592002801856650001701884650001101901650001801912650001401930650002001944650001301964650001101977650001501988650002302003650002302026650001602049650001102065650001202076653001502088653001202103653002602115653002902141653003202170653002202202700002102224700002102245700001702266700002002283700001802303700002002321700001902341700002202360700001902382700002702401773011502428856008502543852000902628655001202637IND60591521120221116223940.0201202e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059152112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2017.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Grazia, Simona1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7748-088010aMolecular evolutionary analysis of type-1 human astroviruses identifies putative sites under selection pressure on the capsid protein  ap. 199-208.  aHuman astroviruses (HAstV) are important enteric pathogens that can be classified into eight sero/genotypes (HAstV-1 to -8). Although the various HAstV types show global spread, type-1 strains tend to be predominant. Molecular analysis of the genomic region encoding the capsid protein (ORF2) has revealed discrete sequence variation, with different lineages within each HAstV type and at least three major lineages have been identified within HAstV-1. Longitudinal epidemiological surveillance has revealed temporal shift of the various HAstV-1 lineages. Metadata analysis of HAstV-1 sequences available in the databases also revealed temporal shifts of the circulation of HAstV-1 lineages, suggesting possible antigenic-related mechanisms of selection at the sub-genotype level. By comparison of HAstV-1 capsid sequences, lineage-defining residues under positive selection were identified. Structural analysis of HAstV-1 capsid allowed identifying at least six residues exposed on the virion surface. Two residues were located in the VP34 (shell region) whilst four residues were mapped in the VP25/27 (protruding region) of HAstV capsid protein, in proximity of the putative receptor binding S site. These findings suggest that mechanisms similar to those observed and/or hypothesized for other enteric viruses are also shaping the evolution of HAstVs, with intra-typic diversification being a possible mechanism to decrease the antigenic pressure to which these viruses are exposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstroviridae 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3adatabases 3aenteropathogens 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aselection pressure 3asequence diversity 3asubgenotype 3avirion 3aviruses 0aAstrovirus 0aHAstV-1 0aPhylogenetic analyses 0aCapsid protein structure 0aSelection pressure analysis 0aGenetic evolution1 aLanave, Gianvito1 aBonura, Floriana1 aUrone, Noemi1 aCappa, Vincenzo1 aLi Muli, Sara1 aPepe, Arcangelo1 aGellért, Akos1 aBanyai, Krisztian1 aMartella, Vito1 aGiammanco, Giovanni M.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 Mar., v. 58 p.199-208dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013400163300001800297520178900315592002802104596007102132596005902203650001702262650001902279650001402298650001502312650001202327650001802339650001002357650000902367650001702376650002202393650002102415650001402436650001602450650002002466700001602486700001502502700005702517773012402574856008302698852000902781655001202790IND60770421620221118135243.0220427e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077042162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07120-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping10aAutophagy modulation in resveratrol protective effects on steroidogenesis in high-fat diet-fed mice and H2O2-challenged TM3 cells  ap. 2973-2983.  aBACKGROUND: Autophagy dysregulation and oxidative stress play critical pathophysiological roles in developing obesity-related metabolic health disorders. This study aims to investigate how autophagy modulation is related to resveratrol (RSV) antioxidant activities and preventive effects on steroidogenesis decline associated with a high-fat diet (HFD) and oxidative damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were fed with HFD with or without supplement RSV (400 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 16 weeks. The control group was fed with a standard diet with no RSV or the same amount of RSV. Mouse Leydig cell line TM3 cell was used for in vitro studies. Oxidative stress was induced in TM3 cells with H₂O₂, followed by RSV treatment plus autophagy activator rapamycin or autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine, respectively. RSV supplement could upregulate proteins level of StAR and mitochondrial proteins COX4 and mtTFA, indicating the amelioration of steroidogenesis decline and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by HFD. Antioxidants such as GPx4 and SOD2 were improved by RSV as well. The observation of autophagosomes and the changes in expressions of LC3II/I, Beclin1, and Atg7 indicated that RSV could reverse the autophagy defect associated with HFD. 3-methyladenine inhibition of autophagy partially abolished RSV protection on mitochondrial function and steroidogenesis in H₂O₂-challenged TM3 cells. However, the combination use of rapamycin and RSV did not improve protection on Leydig cells against oxidative damage. CONCLUSIONS: The stimulation of autophagy by RSV is closely linked to its antioxidant actions and positive impact on steroidogenesis in HFD mice. The findings suggest RSV is protective against obesity-related Leydig cell impairment.  aPublisher supplied data  a2108085MH259cAnhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a81471504cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aLeydig cells 3aautophagosomes 3aautophagy 3acell lines 3adecline 3ahigh fat diet 3amales 3amice 3amitochondria 3amolecular biology 3aoxidative stress 3arapamycin 3aresveratrol 3asteroidogenesis1 aLin, Mengyu1 aChen, Chao1 aLv, Zheng-mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5562-38250 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.2973-2983dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07120-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008000169300001600249520156600265592002801831650002501859650002501884650002001909650001401929650001201943650001401955650001001969650001501979650001401994650001302008650001402021651001602035653001002051653001702061653001202078653002102090700002202111700001902133700002402152773015002176856008202326852000902408655001202417IND60546572720221119035923.0170627e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054657272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2015.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBall, Suzanne C.10aTen-fold decline in Mysis diluviana in Lake Champlain between 1975 and 2012  ap. 502-509.  aMysis diluviana is an important mid-trophic level omnivore in many lakes, but studies of Mysis in Lake Champlain are rare. We used an unpublished 1975 study as a baseline to test for changes in contemporary Mysis populations in Lake Champlain. Invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) were first reported in 1993 and 2003, respectively. Based on the negative relationships of these two species with Mysis and Mysis prey in the Great Lakes, we hypothesized a decline in Mysis in Lake Champlain since 1975 and tested this by repeating the 1975 study in 2012. We found a nearly ten-fold decrease in mean density (±SD) between 1975 (712±373individuals/m2) and 2012 (82±48individuals/m2; p=0.002). Despite the decline, Mysis growth rates appeared similar between the two studies, although fecundity significantly increased by 3 embryos/female in 2012 (p=0.002). Mysis vertical distribution appeared similar in both years, while the horizontal distribution appeared limited to deeper bathymetric strata in 2012 compared to 1975. Data from a long-term monitoring program from 1992 to 2008 indicate the decline occurred abruptly in the mid-1990s, which coincided with zebra mussel establishment although a direct link between the two is not evident. Alewife did not invade Lake Champlain until 2003 and can be ruled out as a contributing factor to the decline. We hypothesize that the combination of predation by alewife and smelt and shifts in the planktonic food web may prevent Mysis from recovering to pre-1995 densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlosa pseudoharengus 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aMysis diluviana 3afecundity 3afemales 3afood webs 3alakes 3amonitoring 3aomnivores 3aplankton 3apredation 3aGreat Lakes 0aMysis 0aDemographics 0aDensity 0aInvasive species1 aMihuc, Timothy B.1 aMyers, Luke W.1 aStockwell, Jason D.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2015 June, v. 41 p.502-509dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Great Lakes Research.x0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2015.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03860naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245017000206300001800376500001900394500002000413520201100433592002802444596002902472596003002501596003002531650002002561650001802581650001402599650002102613650001102634650001802645650002002663650003102683650002402714650001602738650001902754650001402773650001202787650001202799650001902811650001402830650001602844650002902860650001802889700006402907700007202971700007303043773012003116856007303236852000903309655001203318IND60678910920221121035450.0191218e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067891092DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.153002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellantuono, Anthony J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3646-077610aFree‐living and symbiotic lifestyles of a thermotolerant coral endosymbiont display profoundly distinct transcriptomes under both stable and heat stress conditions  ap. 5265-5281.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aReef‐building corals depend upon a nutritional endosymbiosis with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae for the majority of their energetic needs. While this mutualistic relationship is impacted by numerous stressors, warming oceans are a predominant threat to coral reefs, placing the future of the world's reefs in peril. Some Symbiodiniaceae species exhibit tolerance to thermal stress, but the in hospite symbiont response to thermal stress is underexplored. To describe the underpinnings of symbiosis and heat stress response, we compared in hospite and free‐living transcriptomes of Durusdinium trenchii, a pan‐tropical heat‐tolerant Symbiodiniaceae species, under stable temperature conditions and acute hyperthermal stress. We discovered that symbiotic state was a larger driver of the transcriptional landscape than heat stress. The majority of differentially expressed transcripts between in hospite and free‐living cells were downregulated, suggesting the in hospite condition is associated with the shutdown of numerous processes uniquely required for a free‐living lifestyle. In the free‐living state, we identified enrichment for numerous cell signalling pathways and other functions related to detecting and responding to a changing environment, as well as transcripts relating to mitosis, meiosis, and motility. In contrast, in hospite cells exhibited enhanced transcriptional activity for photosynthesis and carbohydrate transport as well as chromatin modifications and a disrupted circadian clock. Hyperthermal stress induced drastic alteration of transcriptional activity in hospite, suggesting symbiotic engagement with the host elicited an exacerbated stress response when compared to free‐living D. trenchii. Altogether, the dramatic differences in gene expression between in hospite and free‐living D. trenchii indicate the importance of considering symbiotic state in investigations of symbiosis and hyperthermal stress in Symbiodiniaceae.  aPublisher supplied data  a1503483cNSF‐OCE RAPID  a1453519cNSF‐IOS CAREER  a69757‐00 47cPSC‐CUNY 3aSymbiodiniaceae 3acarbohydrates 3achromatin 3acircadian clocks 3acorals 3aendosymbionts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3alifestyle 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3aphotosynthesis 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome1 aDougan, Katherine E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6951-53901 aGranados‐Cifuentes, Camila1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2832-39041 aRodriguez‐Lanetty, Mauricio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3007-28410 tMolecular ecology.g2019 Dec., v. 28, no. 24 p.5265-5281dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.153003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001700170245014400187300001600331520142200347592002801769650002301797650001001820650001101830650002001841650001101861650002001872650001901892650001801911650001901929650002001948650003401968650002102002650003802023650005002061650005502111650002402166650002302190650003102213650003002244650002502274651001102299653003002310653002702340653002302367653001102390653001602401653002902417700001802446700002702464700001802491773010402509856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60113344120221119100240.0160903e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011334412DNAL7 a239168352pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHattab, Nour10aNeural network and Monte Carlo simulation approach to investigate variability of copper concentration in phytoremediated contaminated soils  ap. 134-142.  aThe statistical variation of soil properties and their stochastic combinations may affect the extent of soil contamination by metals. This paper describes a method for the stochastic analysis of the effects of the variation in some selected soil factors (pH, DOC and EC) on the concentration of copper in dwarf bean leaves (phytoavailability) grown in the laboratory on contaminated soils treated with different amendments. The method is based on a hybrid modeling technique that combines an artificial neural network (ANN) and Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). Because the repeated analyses required by MCS are time-consuming, the ANN is employed to predict the copper concentration in dwarf bean leaves in response to stochastic (random) combinations of soil inputs. The input data for the ANN are a set of selected soil parameters generated randomly according to a Gaussian distribution to represent the parameter variabilities. The output is the copper concentration in bean leaves. The results obtained by the stochastic (hybrid) ANN-MCS method show that the proposed approach may be applied (i) to perform a sensitivity analysis of soil factors in order to quantify the most important soil parameters including soil properties and amendments on a given metal concentration, (ii) to contribute toward the development of decision-making processes at a large field scale such as the delineation of contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abeans 3acopper 3adecision making 3aleaves 3aneural networks 3apolluted soils 3asoil analysis 3asoil pollution 3asoil properties 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCopperxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aModels, Theoretical 2aMonte Carlo Method 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aStochastic Processes 0aFrance 0aArtificial neural network 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aSoil contamination 0aCopper 0aBean leaves 0aSoil factors variability1 aHambli, Ridha1 aMotelica-Heino, Mikael1 aMench, Michel0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 129 p.134-142dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011900155300001600274520029200290592002800582650001900610650001400629650002800643650001300671650001500684650001300699650001700712700001800729700001600747700001300763700001700776773013100793856007400924852000900998655001201007IND60660774920221119054850.0190827e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066077492DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc08062a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aDirect synthesis of ordered imidazolyl-functionalized mesoporous polymers for efficient chemical fixation of CO₂  ap. 682-684.  aOrdered imidazolyl-functionalized mesoporous polymers (IM-MPs) are directly synthesized by an evaporation-induced self-assembly method, which are further functionalized with bromoethane and employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for the cycloaddition of CO₂ to epoxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acycloaddition reactions 3aepoxides 3aimidazoles 3apolymers 3aporous media1 aLiu, Tingying1 aWu, Haihong1 aWu, Peng1 aHe, Mingyuan0 tChemical communications.g2014 Dec. 11, v. 51, no. 4 p.682-684dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc08062a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014900160300001800309520171800327592002802045650002502073650001802098650002702116650002202143650001602165650002302181650001602204650002202220650002502242650000902267650000902276650001002285650001302295650001002308650002102318650002602339650001202365650001002377650002102387650002402408650004302432650005202475650002202527650001102549650002402560650001202584700001402596700002002610700001702630700001802647700001202665700001802677773011402695856008102809852000902890655001202899IND60583466120221119144502.0171015e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058346612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10695-017-0394-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huan10aMolecular characterization of the CD79a and CD79b and its role against Aeromonas hydrophila infection in Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus)  ap. 1571-1585.  aCD79a and CD79b heterodimers are the important signaling components of B cell receptor (BCR) complex which plays a crucial role in B cell development and antibody production. In the present study, CD79a and CD79b homologues from Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus), namely MaCD79a and MaCD79b, were identified and their expression at early developmental stages and under constitutive and stimulated conditions were investigated. The cDNA sequences for MaCD79a and MaCD79b contained open reading frame of 678 and 636 bp in length for 225 and 211 amino acid residues, respectively. The conserved features and important functional residues were found by sequence analysis. RT-PCR analysis revealed that transcripts of MaCD79s were detected in eggs and hatchling at 1–3 and 5–11 days post hatching (dph), but not detected at 13–17 and 19–27 dph, and constantly detected from 30 dph. Tissue distribution analysis showed that MaCD79s was most highly expressed in immune tissues, such as the spleen, head kidney, and kidney; the relatively low levels were detected in the heart, gill, and liver. Results of in situ hybridization also confirmed that MaCD79s is mainly expressed in systematic immune organs. Meanwhile, similar to IgM, MaCD79s-expressing cells in mucosal immune organ including the digestive track and gill were observed. Additionally, significant upregulation of MaCD79s was seen in the head kidney and spleen of Chinese sucker injected with Aeromonas hydrophila by quantitative real-time PCR. Taken together, our findings provided further information regarding fish CD79s gene and its role in adaptive immunity, which will contribute to the preservation and aquaculture of Chinese sucker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aB-lymphocytes 3aMyxocyprinus asiaticus 3aadaptive immunity 3aamino acids 3aantibody formation 3aaquaculture 3acomplementary DNA 3adevelopmental stages 3aeggs 3afish 3agenes 3ahatching 3aheart 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ain situ hybridization 3akidneys 3aliver 3amucosal immunity 3aopen reading frames 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aspleen 3atissue distribution 3atissues1 aLi, Yujin1 aZhang, Xiaoping1 aWang, Yafeng1 aZhang, Wufeng1 aWu, Xia1 aWang, Zhijian0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1571-1585dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-017-0394-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245010700163500002200270520114900292592002801441650001801469650001601487650002601503650002501529650002501554650002901579650001701608650001901625650001501644650002201659653003601681653002301717653001501740653001101755653002601766700002801792700002101820700002101841700001301862700001601875700001801891700002901909700001801938700001301956773005301969856008502022852000902107655001202116IND60560265820221119165643.0170105s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056026582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jie10aPaper-based capacitive sensors for identification and quantification of chemicals at the point of care  aPre-press version  aThe identification and quantification of chemicals play a vital role in evaluation and surveillance of environmental health and safety. However, current techniques usually depend on costly equipment, professional staff, and/or essential infrastructure, limiting their accessibility. In this work, we develop paper-based capacitive sensors (PCSs) that allow simple, rapid identification and quantification of various chemicals from microliter size samples with the aid of a handheld multimeter. PCSs are low-cost parallel-plate capacitors (~$0.01 per sensor) assembled from layers of aluminium foil and filter paper via double-sided tape. The developed PCSs can identify different kinds of fluids (e.g., organic chemicals) and quantify diverse concentrations of substances (e.g., heavy metal ions) based on differences in dielectric properties, including capacitance, frequency spectrum, and dielectric loss tangent. The PCS-based method enables chemical identification and quantification to take place much cheaply, simply, and quickly at the point-of-care (POC), holding great promise for environmental monitoring in resource-limited settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum foil 3acapacitance 3adielectric properties 3aelectrical equipment 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aheavy metals 3ainfrastructure 3ametal ions 3aorganic compounds 0aenvironmental health and safety 0aanalytical methods 0alabel-free 0asensor 0apoint-of-care testing1 aYew, Chee-Hong Takahiro1 aChen, Xiaoshuang1 aFeng, Shangsheng1 aYang, Qu1 aWang, Shuqi1 aWee, Wei-Hong1 aPingguan-Murphy, Belinda1 aLu, Tian Jian1 aXu, Feng0 tTalanta.g2016, dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245012800185300001800313520174300331592002802074650003302102650001002135650002002145650000902165650003102174650002002205650001002225650002002235650002202255650001402277650001602291650001602307650001502323650001802338650001502356650001302371650000902384650000902393650001602402650001602418650001202434650001602446650002402462650002402486650001102510650001402521650001602535650003202551650000902583650002302592650003402615650001402649650000902663700001502672700002002687700001502707700001902722773011602741856008402857852000902941655001202950IND50060260320221118232208.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006026032DNAL7 a230892912pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, L.A.10aAmelioration of the periparturient relaxation of immunity to parasites through a reduction in mammalian reproductive effort  ap. 1127-1134.  aThe degree of periparturient relaxation of immunity to gastrointestinal parasites has a nutritional basis, as overcoming protein scarcity through increased protein supply improves lactational performance, enhances local immune responses and reduces worm burdens. Herein lactating rats, re-infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, are used to test the hypothesis that a similar and rapid improvement of immunity can be achieved through reducing nutrient demand at times of dietary protein scarcity. Reducing litter size from 12 to three pups during lactation resulted, as expected, in cessation of maternal body weight loss and increased pup body weight gain compared with dams which continued to nurse 12 pups. This increase in performance concurred with a rapid decrease in parasitism; within 3days post nutrient reduction, a 87% reduction in the number of worm eggs found in the colon and 83% reduction in worm burdens was observed, which concurred with increased local immune responses, i.e. 70% more mast cells and 44% more eosinophils in the small intestinal mucosa, to levels similar to those in dams nursing three pups throughout. However, there were no concurrent changes in goblet cell hyperplasia, serum anti-N. brasiliensis-specific antibody levels or mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-10 or IL-13 in the mesenteric lymph nodes. To our knowledge the current study is the first to employ a litter reduction strategy to assess the rate of immune improvement upon overcoming nutrient scarcity in a non-ruminant host. These data support the hypothesis that periparturient relaxation of immunity to gastrointestinal nematodes can be reduced by restoring nutrient adequacy and, importantly, that this improvement can occur very rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNippostrongylus brasiliensis 3acolon 3adietary protein 3aeggs 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agene expression 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aintestinal mucosa 3alactation 3alitter size 3alymph nodes 3amast cells 3amessenger RNA 3aparasitism 3aproteins 3apups 3arats 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aColonxparasitology 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLitter Size 2aNippostrongylusximmunology 2aOvum 2aParasite Egg Count 2aPeripartum Periodximmunology 2aPregnancy 2aRats1 aSakkas, P.1 aHoudijk, J.G.M.1 aKnox, D.P.1 aKyriazakis, I.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2012 Dec., v. 42, no. 13-14 p.1127-1134dElsevier Ltdx0020-75197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015800168300001400326520144600340592002801786650001801814650002201832650001501854650001301869650002701882650001301909650001401922650001101936650001901947650002001966650001401986650002802000650000902028650002002037650001102057650001902068650000902087650001302096650001402109650001302123650002502136653002502161653002002186653000902206653001202215653001802227700001702245700001902262700001702281700001202298700001302310700001702323700001702340700001902357773009602376856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60602686820221121224403.0180711e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060268682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Chunyi10aIncorporation of conserved nucleoprotein into influenza virus-like particles could provoke a broad protective immune response in BALB/c mice and chickens  ap. 35-42.  aWe engineered influenza A/goose/GD/1996 (H5N1) (clade 0) virus-like particles (VLPs) by coinfecting Sf9 cells with triple/quadruple recombinant baculovirus that expressed hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix 1 (M1) with or without nucleoprotein (NP). VLP3 (HA, NA, and M1) and VLP4 (HA, NA, M1, and NP) vaccines (containing 1μg HA) with oil emulsion were administered to mice and chickens by intramuscular injection, and the immune responses were analyzed. The VLP-vaccinated mice demonstrated high antigen specific antibody titers and effective cellular immune responses. The mice and chickens vaccinated with VLP4 demonstrated more robust humoral and cellular immune responses than those vaccinated with VLP3. The VLP4 vaccine afforded 100% protection against a heterologous lethal influenza virus challenge (clade 2.3.4) whereas the VLP3 vaccine conferred 50% protection in chickens. These results implied that the incorporation of conserved NP protein into the VLPs could elicit a broad protective immune response in BALB/c mice and chickens. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first report describing the immunological profile of the NP-containing VLPs vaccines in mice and chicken models, and the results demonstrate that the non-infectious, genome less VLPs, particularly those containing NP, represent a promising strategy for the development of a safe and effective vaccine to control pandemic influenza.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaculoviridae 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3achickens 3aemulsions 3agenome 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3aintramuscular injection 3amice 3amixed infection 3amodels 3anucleoproteins 3aoils 3apandemic 3asialidase 3avaccines 3avirus-like particles 0aVirus-like particles 0aImmune response 0aH5N1 0aVaccine 0aNucleoprotein1 aTian, Guobin1 aChen, Xianxian1 aLiu, Qiliang1 aMa, Jun1 aXu, Shun1 aLi, Xiaoming1 aChen, Hualan1 aCao, Yongchang0 tVirus research.g2015 Jan. 02, v. 195 p.35-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011500160300001600275520117800291592002801469650002201497650001301519650001701532650001401549650001901563650001101582650001401593650001201607650001701619650002101636650001801657650001201675651001001687653002501697653002401722653002201746653001401768700001201782700001201794700001301806700001901819700001701838700001601855773010901871856008201980852000902062655001202071IND60570406520221122032815.0180904e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057040652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2017.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Shuo10aEpidemiology, Evolution, and Pathogenesis of H7N9 Influenza Viruses in Five Epidemic Waves since 2013 in China  ap. 713-728.  aH7N9 influenza viruses were first isolated in 2013 and continue to cause human infections. H7N9 infections represent an ongoing public health threat that has resulted in 1344 cases with 511 deaths as of April 9, 2017. This highlights the continued threat posed by the current poultry trade and live poultry market system in China. Until now, there have been five H7N9 influenza epidemic waves in China; however, the steep increase in the number of humans infected with H7N9 viruses observed in the fifth wave, beginning in October 2016, the spread into western provinces, and the emergence of highly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 influenza outbreaks in chickens and infection in humans have caused domestic and international concern. In this review, we summarize and compare the different waves of H7N9 regarding their epidemiology, pathogenesis, evolution, and characteristic features, and speculate on factors behind the recent increase in the number of human cases and sudden outbreaks in chickens. The continuous evolution of the virus poses a long-term threat to public health and the poultry industry, and thus it is imperative to strengthen prevention and control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3achickens 3aepidemiology 3aevolution 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3amarkets 3apathogenesis 3apoultry industry 3apublic health 3aviruses 3aChina 0aH7N9 influenza virus 0afive epidemic waves 0ahighly pathogenic 0aevolution1 aGu, Min1 aLiu, Di1 aCui, Jie1 aGao, George F.1 aZhou, Jiyong1 aLiu, Xiufan0 tTrends in microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 25, no. 9 p.713-728dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2017.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008400172300001500256520177000271592002802041650002202069650003602091650001402127650001102141650001302152650001802165650001402183650001602197650001502213650001302228650000902241650000902250650001402259653003602273653001202309653001302321653001302334653001702347653001802364700002002382700002102402700003102423700002802454700002502482700002702507700002502534700003202559773009002591856008502681852000902766655001202775IND60551315820221122003053.0161018e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055131582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Fernanda10aMethylglyoxal can mediate behavioral and neurochemical alterations in rat brain  ap. 93-101.  aDiabetes is associated with loss of cognitive function and increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are elevated in diabetes and AD and have been suggested to act as mediators of the cognitive decline observed in these pathologies. Methylglyoxal (MG) is an extremely reactive carbonyl compound that propagates glycation reactions and is, therefore, able to generate AGEs. Herein, we evaluated persistent behavioral and biochemical parameters to explore the hypothesis that elevated exogenous MG concentrations, induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion, lead to cognitive decline in Wistar rats. A high and sustained administration of MG (3μmol/μL; subdivided into 6days) was found to decrease the recognition index of rats, as evaluated by the object-recognition test. However, MG was unable to impair learning-memory processes, as shown by the habituation in the open field (OF) and Y-maze tasks. Moreover, a single high dose of MG induced persistent alterations in anxiety-related behavior, diminishing the anxiety-like parameters evaluated in the OF test. Importantly, MG did not alter locomotion behavior in the different tasks performed. Our biochemical findings support the hypothesis that MG induces persistent alterations in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex, related to glyoxalase 1 activity, AGEs content and glutamate uptake. Glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100B content, as well as S100B secretion (astroglial-related parameters of brain injury), were not altered by ICV MG administration. Taken together, our data suggest that MG interferes directly in brain function and that the time and the levels of exogenous MG determine the different features that can be seen in diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aadvanced glycation end products 3acognition 3acortex 3adiabetes 3aglutamic acid 3aglycation 3ahippocampus 3alocomotion 3apatients 3arats 3arisk 3asecretion 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aAnxiety 0aDementia 0aDiabetes 0aGlyoxalase 1 0aMethylglyoxal1 aPandolfo, Pablo1 aGalland, Fabiana1 aTorres, Felipe Vasconcelos1 aDutra, Márcio Ferreira1 aBatassini, Cristiane1 aGuerra, Maria Cristina1 aLeite, Marina Concli1 aGonçalves, Carlos Alberto,0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 164 p.93-101dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013800168300001000306520181800316592002802134650001402162650001302176650001602189650000902205650001502214650002202229650001002251650001502261650002102276650002302297650002402320700005702344700002202401700003002423700003102453700003202484773011702516856008302633852000902716655001202725IND60722897620221121234407.0211208e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072289762DNAL7 a10.1186/s13717-020-00276-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYucedag, Cengiz14aThe impacts of altitude and seed pretreatments on seedling emergence of Syrian juniper (Juniperus drupacea (Labill.) Ant. et Kotschy)  ap. 7.  aBACKGROUND: Syrian juniper is an economically important species and in danger of extinction. For these reasons, the best seedling production methods of the species should be determined and its plantations should be established. The aim of the study is to examine the impacts of altitude and different pretreatment combinations of cold and warm stratifications, citric acid, shaking seeds in bottles with crushed glass, and different stimulating agents including Baikal EM1, Biohumus, Polystimulin A6 and K hormones (PS-A6 and PS-K) on seed germination of Syrian juniper. To conduct the study, the cones of the Syrian junipers were collected from three different altitudes (1000, 1200, and 1400 m a.s.l.) within the boundaries of Forest Management Directorate of Bozyazı, Mersin in Turkey. The seeds were subjected to three replicates per one treatment (altitude in interaction with pretreatment). There were 100 seeds per replicate. RESULTS: Two-way ANOVA revealed significant effects of altitude, pretreatment, and their interaction on seedling emergence of Syrian juniper. Seeds from higher altitudes had higher germination rates in all pretreatments. The highest percent emergence (85%) was recorded in the combination consisting of shaking with crushed glass, both cold and warm stratification, and successive application of stimulators PS-A6 and PS-K. All the treatments with most germinating seeds encompassed shaking in crushed glass or soaking in citric acid, both warm and cold stratifications, and application of stimulating agents. CONCLUSIONS: The use of seeds from higher altitudes should be considered for seedling production of Syrian juniper due to their higher germination potential. Beyond altitudinal differences, specific pretreatments can rise germination potential more than twofold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus 3aaltitude 3acitric acid 3acold 3aextinction 3aforest management 3aglass 3agovernance 3aseed germination 3aseedling emergence 3aseedling production1 aCetin, Mehmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8992-02891 aOzel, Halil Baris1 aAbo Aisha, Adel Easa Saad1 aAlrabiti, Osama B.

MgO precursors were mixed and aged with salts to control the composition and morphology. The MgO composites exhibited a CO₂ sorption capacity of 73 wt % in pure CO₂ at 240 min and 300 °C and achieved a sorption capacity of 25 wt % within 10 min because of a high sorption rate. When a cyclic test was conducted with pure CO₂ sorption for 60 min at 325 °C and N₂ regeneration for 15 min at 425 °C (60/15 min cycle) as a reference, the cyclic capacity was 45 wt % after 30 cycles. On the other hand, considering the applicable capture processes, the sorption capacity during a fast cycle (10/5 min cycle) was 18 wt % under the same gas and temperature conditions. Finally, the working capacity of the MgO composite was evaluated under a simulated emission gas (29% CO₂, 3% H₂O, and balance N₂) at 300 °C for sorption and CO₂ at 450 °C for regeneration because of the importance of water vapor and CO₂ regeneration in the evaluation. The rearrangement of the salts and the MgO grains during the initial cycles led to an enhanced working capacity. However, the working capacity declined along the subsequent cycles due to sintering, and it was severe under CO₂ regeneration. However, the working capacity for the wet mixture sorption and CO₂ regeneration stabilized after 20 cycles at 23 and 4.6 wt % for 60/15 min and 10/5 min cycles, respectively. The results indicate that the as-synthesized MgO composites are feasible for the practical application of precombustion CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3afuels 3amagnesium oxide 3anitrogen 3asodium carbonate 3asodium nitrate 3asorption 3atemperature 3awater vapor1 aHo, Keon1 aVũ, Anh Tuấn,1 aLee, Chang-Ha0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 31, no. 9 p.9725-9735dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b014283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008900169300001400258520142500272592002801697650001301725650002201738650001401760650002001774650003501794650001401829650002401843650001101867650002501878650001501903651001301918653000801931653001001939653001601949653001101965653001901976700001901995700005802014773010502072856008602177852000902263655001202272IND60539695720221116231510.0190219e20140526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053969572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Woo-Seop10aDevelopment and application of GIS-based PRISM integration through a plugin approach  ap. 58-67.  aA PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) QGIS-plugin was developed on Quantum GIS platform in this study. This Quantum GIS plugin system provides user-friendly graphic user interfaces (GUIs) so that users can obtain gridded meteorological data of high resolutions (1km×1km). Also, this software is designed to run on a personal computer so that it does not require an internet access or a sophisticated computer system. This module is a user-friendly system that a user can generate PRISM data with ease. The proposed PRISM QGIS-plugin is a hybrid statistical-geographic model system that uses coarse resolution datasets (APHRODITE datasets in this study) with digital elevation data to generate the fine-resolution gridded precipitation. To validate the performance of the software, Prek Thnot River Basin in Kandal, Cambodia is selected for application. Overall statistical analysis shows promising outputs generated by the proposed plugin. Error measures such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) were used to evaluate the performance of the developed PRISM QGIS-plugin. Evaluation results using RMSE and MAPE were 2.76mm and 4.2%, respectively. This study suggested that the plugin can be used to generate high resolution precipitation datasets for hydrological and climatological studies at a watershed where observed weather datasets are limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrology 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3awatersheds 3aCambodia 0aGIS 0aPRISM 0aQuantum GIS 0aPlugin 0aPractical view1 aChun, Jong Ahn1 aKang, Kwangmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6833-28860 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 May 26, v. 513 p.58-67dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009400169300001600263520109400279592002801373650001101401650002101412650001401433650002601447650002201473650001501495650001201510650002701522650003001549651001001579653002201589653001701611653001101628653001401639653001201653653001101665700001701676700001801693773010901711856008601820852000901906655001201915IND50068313520221120222942.0190319e20130827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006831352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2013.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiao-ying10aGenetic diversity and relationships among 47 loquat varieties revealed by EST-SSR markers  ap. 375-382.  aThe genetic diversity and relationships of 47 loquat varieties sourced from different geographic locations were studied by using EST-SSR markers derived from apple. Results show that 33 pairs of apple EST-SSR primers had clear amplification products in loquat cultivars, with a comparatively high transferability rate of 67.3% in loquat, among which 22 pairs of primers could amplify polymorphic PCR products. Otherwise, among the 29 recovered fragments, 80% of the PCR products contained the SSR markers. The genetic relationships of all the 47 loquat accessions were analyzed by using polymorphic EST-SSR markers, showing that these markers could clearly separate loquat samples. Based on the cluster analysis, all the loquat varieties clustered into two groups with accessions from China and Spain respectively. The clusters obtained agree with the origins of the cultivars. This study confirms that the EST-SSR markers from apple are suitable for studying genetic diversity among loquat varieties. The polymorphic markers obtained will be used for loquat genotyping in further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3aloquats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aChina 0aGenetic diversity 0aRelationship 0aLoquat 0aVarieties 0aEST-SSR 0aMarker1 aXu, Hong-xia1 aChen, Jun-wei0 tScientia horticulturae.g2013 Aug. 27, v. 160 p.375-382dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2013.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01913naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009300160300001800253520083400271592002801105650001301133650002401146650001701170650001101187650002801198650001001226650002001236650001301256650002401269650001101293650001901304650002001323773012501343856007401468852000901542655001201551IND60662607720221116141633.0190906e20110830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066260772DNAL7 a10.1039/c1gc00022e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowker, Michael10aSustainable hydrogen production by the application of ambient temperature photocatalysis  ap. 2235-2246.  aHydrogen production by water splitting is a holy grail of science, being one route to a non-fossil fuel and a potential source of clean energy. It is essential to use a non-polluting energy source to drive the reaction and one way is to utilise sunlight energy, combined with a way to overcome the kinetic limitations of the reaction. The production of hydrogen by the photocatalytic cleavage of water can overcome these energetic hurdles. This area of science is briefly reviewed here, focussing on two routes, namely i) the use of sacrificial agents such as alcohols to act as oxygen scavengers and liberate hydrogen only and ii) by direct water splitting to produce both hydrogen and oxygen. The factors which are important in determining the characteristics of effective photocatalytic water splitting systems are elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aambient temperature 3aclean energy 3aenergy 3afree radical scavengers 3afuels 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3asolar radiation0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 Aug. 30, v. 13, no. 9 p.2235-2246dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1gc00022e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009100168300001000259520143100269592002801700596011101728650002601839650002401865650002101889650001401910650002401924650002001948650001001968650001601978650001401994650001402008650001102022650002102033650001302054650001702067650001202084700001502096700001602111700001602127700002002143700001902163773011702182856008302299852000902382655001202391IND60722897820221117161318.0220109e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072289782DNAL7 a10.1186/s13765-020-00581-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Jeongyeon10aDouble-stranded RNA confers resistance to pepper mottle virus in Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 1.  aRNA interference (RNAi) is a regulatory mechanism of gene expression mediated by small RNAs. By using the RNAi technique, exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) designed to target mRNA, suppresses target gene expression levels in plants. In this study, we adopted the RNAi mechanism as a tool to protect plants from viruses. We designed and synthesized several dsRNAs targeting the pepper mottle virus (PepMoV) genes HC-Pro and NIb. When used on Nicotiana benthamiana plants, these dsRNAs protected the plant against viral infection over a specific period. By optimizing dsRNA and virus injection time, the protection efficiency of dsRNA by targeting virus genes could be maximized. It seems that exogenous dsRNA-derived RNA-induced silencing complex was able to defend the host against viral infection instantly. Furthermore, each dsRNA designed to target different regions within a transcript had varying levels of effects on virus survival in the host plants. When targeting the middle part of both the NIb and HC-Pro genes using the dsRNAs, the highest viral growth inhibitory effect was observed. An RLM-5′ RACE was performed using plant leaves infected with PepMoV after dsRNA treatment and it was observed that most of the mRNA cleavages occurred close to the 3′ part within the dsRNA target position on the mRNA. These results suggest that the dsRNA tool can be used as a plant vaccine platform for crop protection.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ01333001cThe Next-Generation BioGreen 21 Program, Rural Developmental Administration, Republic of Korea 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPepper mottle virus 3aRNA interference 3achemistry 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahost plants 3ainfection 3ainjection 3aleaves 3aplant protection 3avaccines 3aviral growth 3aviruses1 aFang, Miao1 aLee, Dowhan1 aPark, Minsu1 aKim, Kook-Hyung1 aShin, Chanseok0 tApplied biological chemistry.g2021 Dec., v. 64, no. 1 p.1-1dSpringer SingaporewJournal:27084x2468-08347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00581-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245006700166300001600233520162100249592002801870650001901898650000901917650001201926650001501938650001401953650002601967650001501993650001902008650001502027650001902042650002902061650002002090650002002110650002102130650001502151650001602166650001502182650002502197700001902222773011102241856008202352852000902434655001202443IND4471592720221117022330.0150812e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447159272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2011.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Karin,10aReview of the remediation strategies for soil water repellency  ap. 208-221.  aMany regions of the world are predicted to experience water scarcity due to more frequent and more severe droughts and increased water demands. Water use efficiency by plants can be negatively affected by soil water repellency (SWR). It is timely to review existing techniques to remedy SWR. Ideally remediation addresses the origins of a problem. However, the fundamental mechanisms of how and why SWR develops are still poorly understood. In this review it was hypothesized that SWR occurs where the balance of input–decomposition of organic matter is impaired, due to either increased input or decreased decomposition rates of hydrophobic substances. Direct and indirect strategies to remedy SWR were distinguished. While direct remediation aims at abolishing the causes of SWR, indirect strategies seek to manage sites with SWR by treating its symptoms. The 12 reviewed strategies include applying surfactants, clay, slow-release fertilizers, lime, and fungicides, bioremediation of SWR through stimulating earthworms, choosing adapted vegetation, irrigation, cultivation, soil aeration and compaction. Some of the techniques have been applied successfully only in laboratory experiments. Our review highlights that it is not straightforward to cure SWR based on easily measurable and site-specific soil and vegetation properties, and that long-term, large-scale field experiments are required to improve the understanding of the evolution of SWR as cornerstone to develop cost-effective and efficient remediation strategies. We also identified current research gaps around the diagnosis and prevention of SWR.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3aclay 3adrought 3aearthworms 3aevolution 3afield experimentation 3afungicides 3ahydrophobicity 3airrigation 3aorganic matter 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asoil compaction 3asoil properties 3asoil remediation 3asoil water 3asurfactants 3avegetation 3awater use efficiency1 aDeurer, Markus0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2011 Nov., v. 144, no. 1 p.208-221dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2011.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014600174300001600320520158800336592002801924650002201952650002301974650002901997650002002026650001802046650001202064650001502076650000902091650002302100650001702123650002302140650001502163650001502178650001502193650002002208650001502228650001302243650001402256650001702270650002202287650001402309650002502323650001802348650001602366653002302382653002502405653002302430653002902453653002502482700001702507700002902524700001702553700002102570700002602591773011202617856008202729852000902811655001202820IND60591254220221121142109.0190411e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059125422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarikrishnan, Ramasamy10aEffect of Agaricus bisporus enriched diet on growth, hematology, and immune protection in Clarias gariepinus against Flavobacterium columnare  ap. 245-251.  aThe purpose of the present study was to find out the effect of dietary enriched button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels on growth performance, hematology, nonspecific immune responses, and disease resistance in catfish, Clarias gariepinus against Flavobacterium columnare for a period of four weeks. The percentage weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were higher in the infected fish fed with 5% A. bisporus enriched diet than with 1% and 10% diets. The red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), hematocrit (PCV), and haemoglobin (Hb) values are similar (p > .05) among the experimental groups at the end of fourth week. The phagocytic activity, complement activity, and lysozyme activity were significantly enhanced in the infected fish fed with 5% A. bisporus diet during the experimental period; however, it was significantly enhanced with 10% A. bisporus enriched diet only on weeks 2 and 4. On the other hand, the respiratory burst (RB) activity increased significantly in the infected fish fed with 5% and 10% A. bisporus enriched diets. When fed with 5% A. bisporus diet the cumulative mortality was very low (10%), followed by a high survival rate (89%) in the infected fish; nevertheless, the cumulative mortality was 25% and 20% while it was 74% and 79% when fed with 1% and 10% enriched diets. The present study recommends a dietary supplement of A. bisporus at 5% or 10% level to achieve better growth without side effect, and enhance the nonspecific immune system that prevent mortalities from F. columnare infection in C. gariepinus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aClarias gariepinus 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aadverse effects 3aanimal growth 3acatfish 3acomplement 3adiet 3adisease resistance 3aerythrocytes 3agrowth performance 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3aimmune response 3aleukocytes 3alysozyme 3amushrooms 3aphagocytosis 3arespiratory burst 3ashellfish 3aspecific growth rate 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain 0aClarias gariepinus 0aCumulative mortality 0aGrowth performance 0aFlavobacterium columnare 0aNonspecific immunity1 aNaafar, Adil1 aMusthafa, Mohamed Saiyad1 aAhamed, Anis1 aArif, Ibrahim A.1 aBalasundaram, Chellam0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Feb., v. 73 p.245-251dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245007700174300001300251520226200264592002802526650002002554650001402574650000902588650001502597650001602612653000902628653000802637653000802645653001102653653000802664653000802672653000802680653001202688653001602700653001902716653001602735653001702751653001202768700001902780700002302799700002202822773011402844856008702958852000903045655001203054IND60532467220221117164554.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053246722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2014.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayment, Diana J.10aApplied personality assessment in domestic dogs: Limitations and caveats  ap. 1-18.  aModern behavioural tests for domestic dogs are commonly employed across a variety of fields, including the assessment of companion, assistance, working and sporting dogs. While there is increasing scientific attention on the development and evaluation of behavioural tests used to assess personality, a lack of robust assessment of the validity and reliability of many test protocols currently in use ‘on the ground’ has led to the repeated questioning of their use by both the scientific community and the public. This is particularly prevalent within the welfare sector, where consequences for dogs that are identified as behaviourally unsuitable for rehoming are dire. Despite the large body of work dedicated to canine personality and behavioural test development, relatively few reported protocols have been demonstrated to accurately and reliably predict behavioural traits in dogs, according to accepted validation and reliability assessment protocols used by psychologists. Inconsistencies in the terminology used to describe behaviour, tests and canine personality are common within the literature pertaining to applied personality testing of dogs, making discussion of the usefulness of such tests within the applied environment difficult. Furthermore, highly relevant information gained from the fields of psychology and ethology, such as the limitations of behaviour-only scoring systems, the need to assess both temporal and contextual stability during personality testing, and the effects of arousal, impulsivity and affective state on behaviour, is seemingly overlooked by some test developers, resulting in array of test protocols that suffer from similar, predictable design limitations. This review discusses the most prominent considerations and limitations relevant to the assessment of personality through behavioural tests in domestic dogs, and suggests possible mechanisms through which these limitations may be investigated and addressed. In particular, it is recommended that the results of shelter-based behavioural test batteries are interpreted within the limitations of the context in which they are performed, and test developers consider other methods with which personality may be assessed within the shelter environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3abatteries 3adogs 3apsychology 3aterminology 0aDIAS 0aDMA 0aFFM 0a5-HIAA 0aHPA 0aSAM 0aDog 0aShelter 0aPersonality 0aBehaviour test 0aTemperament 0aCoping style 0aShyness1 aDe Groef, Bert1 aPeters, Richard A.1 aMarston, Linda C.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2015 Feb., v. 163 p.1-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2014.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015900166300001600325520132900341592002801670650005001698650001401748650001201762650001301774650001501787650001701802650004101819650002301860650001901883650001801902650003301920650003201953650002001985650001602005650002202021650001202043650001102055653001202066653001202078653000802090653000802098653000802106653000802114653000902122653000902131653000902140653002502149653001702174653003202191653000902223653004302232700002002275700001802295700002302313773011602336856008602452852000902538655001202547IND60554518620221122204935.0180905e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055451862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZali, Sara10aNew nanostructure of polydimethylsiloxane coating as a solid-phase microextraction fiber: Application to analysis of BTEX in aquatic environmental samples  ap. 287-295.  aElectrospinning technique was used to convert polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) sol-gel solution to a new nanostructure on a stainless steel wire. The surface morphology of the fiber was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It showed a diameter range of 30⿿60nm for PDMS nanoparticles with a homogeneous and porous surface structure. The applicability of this coating was assessed for the headspace SPME (HS-SPME) of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) from water samples followed by gas chromatography⿿mass spectrometry. The important parameters affecting extraction efficiency such as extraction time and temperature, desorption conditions, agitation rate and ionic strength were investigated and optimized.Under the optimized conditions, LODs and LOQs of 0.3⿿5μgL⿿¹ and 1⿿10μgL⿿¹ were obtained, respectively. The method showed linearity in the broad range of 1⿿5000μgL⿿¹ with correlation coefficient of >0.99. Inter-day and intra-day precisions of the developed method ranged from 2.43% to 6.54% and from 5.24% to 13.73%, respectively. The thermal stability of the fiber was investigated on stainless steel wire. It was found to be durable at 260°C for more than 360min. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied for quantification of BTEX in real water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3aagitation 3abenzene 3acoatings 3adesorption 3aethylbenzene 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aionic strength 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atoluene 3axylene 0aHS-SPME 0aGC⿿MS 0aSIM 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aRSD 0aPDMS 0aBTEX 0aMRLs 0aPolydimethylsiloxane 0aElectrospray 0aSolid phase microextraction 0aBTEX 0aGas chromatography⿿mass spectrometry1 aJalali, Fahimeh1 aEs-haghi, Ali1 aShamsipur, Mojtaba0 tJournal of chromatography.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 1033-1034 p.287-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245006900166300001000235500001100245520138300256592002801639650002801667650001801695650001201713650001801725650002701743650002201770650001501792650001001807650001001817650001201827650002201839650001201861773012701873856008302000852000902083655001202092IND60722898020221122174547.0220106e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072289802DNAL7 a10.1186/s40104-020-00526-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavindran, V.10aProgress in ileal endogenous amino acid flow research in poultry  ap. 5.  aReview  aThe progress in our understanding of the endogenous protein concept over the past century is reviewed. Non-dietary proteins found in the digesta at the terminal ileum of poultry, known as endogenous protein loss, are comprised of digestive secretions, mucus and sloughed gut epithelial cells. The measurement of this loss is of fundamental importance because it is an indicator of gut metabolism and is essential to adjust apparent estimates of ileal amino acid digestibility. The ileal endogenous amino acid losses comprise of two components, namely basal and specific losses. The basal losses are fixed and associated with feed dry matter intake, whereas the specific losses are variable and induced by the presence of dietary components such as fibre and anti-nutrients. Currently there is no methodology available to directly measure the specific endogenous losses and these losses are calculated by determining the basal and total (basal plus specific) losses and, then subtracting the basal losses from total losses. The seminal features, specific applications and shortcomings of available methodologies are briefly outlined as well as the practical challenges faced in using the published endogenous amino acid loss values for true digestibility corrections. The relevance of taurine as a component of endogenous protein flow in poultry is identified for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantinutritional factors 3abiotechnology 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3adigestible amino acids 3adry matter intake 3aepithelium 3aileum 3amucus 3apoultry 3aprotein depletion 3ataurine0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.5-5dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-020-00526-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245014600204300001600350520065900366592002801025650002401053650002201077650000901099650000701108653001801115653002501133700002001158700001901178773009401197856008201291852000901373655001201382IND60530819420221117162104.0210124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053081942DNAL7 a274191972pmid7 aPMC49363282pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjayi, E.O.10aData showing chemical compositions of the essential oils of the leaves of Cymbopogon citratus obtained by varying pH of the extraction medium  ap. 599-604.  aThis article describes the various chemical components as obtained from the oils in the leaves of Cymbopogon citratus using hydrodistillation and solvent-free microwave extraction methods.

In the first experiment (Exp. 1), three grazing heights of 15, 25, and 35 cm were evaluated, with bulls receiving 0.3% of body weight (BW) of supplement (161 g kg–¹ crude protein (CP) and 20.1 MJ kg–¹ gross energy (GE)); in the second experiment (Exp. 2), supplementation levels were decreased as grazing height increased: (1) low height (15 cm) and high supplementation (0.6% BW: 142 g kg–¹ CP and 18.9 MJ kg–¹ GE (LH-HS)); (2) moderate height (25 cm) and moderate supplementation (0.3% BW: 161 g kg–¹ CP and 20.1 MJ kg–¹ GE (MH-MS)) or (3) high height (35 cm) without supplementation (HH-WS). Ingestive behaviour was evaluated by direct visual observations, and intake using markers. It was used 9 paddocks each experiment. The experimental design was completely randomized, analysing effects by polynomial orthogonal contrasts (Exp. 1) and Tukey test (Exp. 2). In Exp. 1, a linear decreasing response to daily grazing time (P < 0.01) was observed, whereas a linear increasing response to herbage intake (P < 0.01) was observed with increased grazing height. In Exp. 2, LH-HS bulls had lower herbage intake (P < 0.01) than their counterparts. Bulls from both experiments showed increased grazing activity after 12 PM (P < 0.05). The herbage intake substitution effect of supplements can be explored as a production strategy, as the adjustment of supplementation levels can promote high dry matter intake as well as performance in beef cattle, in conditions of low grazing height or low forage allowance, even with a high stocking rate.  aThe authors would like to thank the ‘São Paulo Research Foundation’ [Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) grant numbers 2012/14956-6 and 2012/20264-0] and ‘Trouw Nutrition Brasil’ for their financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  a#2012/14956-6,#2012/20264-0  aNo grant number 3aanimal research 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3aforage 3agrasses 3ayearlings 0aBite rate 0aherbage intake 0asupplements 0atropical grasslands1 aMalheiros, Euclides Braga1 aAguilar, Natalia María1 aRomanzini, Elieder Prates1 aFerrari, Adriana Cristina1 aNave, Renata La Guardia1 aMullinks, John Travis1 aReis, Ricardo Andrade0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.28-33dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2020.17159853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011700175300001400292520233800306592002802644650001502672650002002687650001402707650002602721650002102747650001102768650001202779650002002791650000902811650001202820653000902832653002402841653001402865653001502879700001902894700002002913773011502933856008703048852000903135655001203144IND60532467420221117164542.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053246742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2014.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Jessica E.14aThe influence of neonatal environment on piglet play behaviour and post-weaning social and cognitive development  ap. 69-79.  aResearch has shown that the domestic pig is highly playful throughout its development and that play is an important aspect of social and cognitive development. Therefore, the neonatal environment is fundamental to successful stimulation of play in neonatal pigs, which could have indirect and direct socio-cognitive effects on pigs post-weaning and therefore influence social interactions known to cause welfare concerns (e.g. aggression during mixing). This study investigated how play pre- and post-weaning developed in two neonatal environments (NE); the conventional farrowing crate (NEC) and a more environmentally complex alternative PigSAFE pen (NEP) and to discover whether this had an effect on piglet’ cognitive abilities in spontaneous object recognition tests for two retention times (15 and 60min) post-weaning. Hourly focal sampling was used to record play behaviours pre- and post-weaning in 72 piglets of mixed sex (36 per NE) from a total population of 117 piglets from 12 litters. Out of the 72 piglets, 24 were used in the cognitive spontaneous object recognition tests five weeks post-weaning. Linear mixed models showed that NEP piglets displayed play behaviours quicker after birth than NEC piglets: locomotor (F=7.62(1, 11), P=0.020); sow interaction (F=5.27(1, 11), P=0.045); and social interaction (F=23.61(1, 11), P<0.001). NEP piglets played more pre-weaning than NEC piglets (F=5.06(1, 71), P=0.051) and despite initial higher levels of aggression at weaning, displayed less chronic aggression post-weaning as indicated by lesion scores of all piglets (F=27.05(1, 116), P<0.001). NE was shown to have a significant effect on the 15min cognitive retention test; with NEP piglets spending more time interacting with the novel object than the familiar, compared to NEC piglets (F=5.39(1, 23), P=0.045). There was no NE effect for the 60min retention test. It was concluded that play is fundamental to successful socio-cognitive development (e.g. aggressive conflicts) and relates to play function theories of training for the unexpected. Its effect on play behaviours are short-term and highly dependent on present environmental stimulus, suggesting that any long-term benefits play may have on an animal's welfare can only be achieved by regular stimulation throughout its life (e.g. constant enrichment).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3acognition 3acognitive development 3afarrowing crates 3amodels 3apiglets 3aplay activities 3asows 3aweaning 0aPlay 0aAlternative housing 0aFarrowing 0aEnrichment1 aIson, Sarah H.1 aBaxter, Emma M.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2015 Feb., v. 163 p.69-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2014.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01405naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245004400211300001600255506007600271520039500347592002800742506003700770650002100807650002200828650001100850700002200861773011600883856008300999852000901082655001201091IND60570407020221207132558.0181002e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057040702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2017.06.0062doi7 aPMC56215172pmcid7 a286694552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMateyak, Maria K.10aBreaking the Silos of Protein Synthesis  ap. 587-588.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein synthesis requires factors that are proposed to enhance discrete steps.

It is suggested that this scheme could be used at the European level in reviewing project proposals involving animal experimentation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal experimentation 3aethics 3alaboratories 3alaws and regulations 3atransgenesis1 aMepham, T.

The reaction produced chiral Strecker adducts, α-aminonitriles, in excellent chemical yields (94–98%) and diastereoselectivities (95 : 5 to >99%). This synthesis was confirmed to follow the GAP chemistry (group-assistant-purification chemistry) process, which can avoid traditional chromatography and recrystallization purifications, i.e., the pure chiral α-aminonitriles bearing a chiral N-phosphonyl group can be simply obtained by washing the solid crude products with hexane. The chiral N-phosphonyl auxiliary can be easily cleaved under mildly acidic conditions and quantitatively recycled by a one-time extraction with n-butanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3abutanol 3achromatography 3acrystallization 3acyanides 3adiastereoselectivity 3agreen chemistry 3ahexane 3aimines 3amoieties 3awashing1 aWever, Walter1 aPindi, Suresh1 aMilles, Raizada1 aGu, Peng1 aShi, Min1 aLi, Guigen0 tGreen chemistry.g2011 May 4, v. 13, no. 5 p.1288-1292dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1gc15029d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015900172300001600331520049600347592002800843650003900871650001500910650001000925650001300935650001300948650001600961653003900977653001601016653002801032653001401060653002101074700002001095700002401115700002201139773009801161856008601259852000901345655001201354IND60602687320221121192850.0180711e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060268732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2014.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sung Hyun,10aInterchange of L polymerase protein between two strains of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) genotype IV alters temperature sensitivities in vitro  ap. 203-206.  aViral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) has four genotypes (I–IV) and sub-lineages within genotype I and IV.

Recently, poly‐γ‐glutamic acid (γ‐PGA) as a soil amendment has been increasingly applied in agricultural development. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of γ‐PGA on soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity under wetting‐drying (W‐D) conditions. Specifically, this study investigated the influence of different γ‐PGA application rates (wt%: 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6%) on the soil water characteristic curve, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ), and the other hydraulic characteristic parameters (saturated water content [θₛ], field capacity [FC], permanent wilting point [PWP], and available water content [AWC]). Results showed that γ‐PGA significantly increased sandy soil water retention by increasing θₛ, FC, PWP, and AWC. Poly‐γ‐glutamic acid could decrease the proportion of large pore size (2–15 μm) and Kₛ and enhance the proportion of particles with small pore size (0.2–2 μm). Nevertheless, the effect of γ‐PGA on hydraulic properties of sandy soil depended on γ‐PGA application rate and the number of W‐D cycles. Under 8‐W‐D and 12‐W‐D, there was no significant difference on soil water retention among all treatments. Increasing the application rate of γ‐PGA was not more effective; P3 (1.2%) and P4 (1.6%) treatments had little difference in soil water holding capacity. This study quantitatively investigated effects of γ‐PGA on soil water retention under different W‐D cycles. Our results suggest that 1.2% might be recommended as an appropriate γ‐PGA application amount.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aapplication rate 3afield capacity 3aporosity 3asandy soils 3asoil amendments 3asoil water 3asoil water characteristic 3asoil water retention 3awater content1 aShi, Wenjuan1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8577-85450 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 July, v. 86, no. 4 p.904-917dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009800169300001800267520134400285592002801629650001001657650001501667650001201682650001601694650001401710650002501724650002801749650002501777650002401802650001701826650001001843650001501853650001101868650000901879650001801888650002101906650002301927650001101950650000901961700001701970700002101987773010502008856008902113852000902202655001202211IND60580504020221118044915.0170921e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058050402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b014542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yumei10aCellulase Adsorption during the Hydrolysis of Organosolv- and Organocat-Pretreated Beech Wood  ap. 9507-9516.  aIn a biorefinery, only a complete raw material cellulose saccharification, at high consistencies, leads to high sugar concentrations and thereby to high yields in the subsequent fermentation. However, enzymatic hydrolysis is significantly hampered by a strong slowdown of the reaction after its start, which may be explained, e.g., by enzyme inactivation, inhibition, or compositional and structural changes of the biomass. Effective pulp enzymatic hydrolysis strongly depends on the biomass pretreatment. We studied enzyme adsorption to three cellulosic materials and its effect on the reaction rate during hydrolysis. The maximal cellulase adsorption decreased from 137.7 mg protein/g biomass via 106.1 mg protein/g biomass to 88.8 mg/g biomass for α-cellulose, organocat, and organosolv material, respectively. The initial reaction rates directly correlated to the amount of adsorbed enzyme as predicted by the adsorption isotherms. However, the adsorbed cellulase loading increased dramatically during the reaction and drifted away from the adsorption isotherm. One reason was the changes in substrate composition, e.g., lignin content increased from 22% to 42% for organosolv beech wood during hydrolysis. Most importantly, the cellulases irreversibly adsorbed to the pulp with proceeding hydrolysis, such that they were inactivated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acellulose 3acellulosic materials 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme inactivation 3afermentation 3afuels 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3apulp 3araw materials 3asaccharification 3asorption isotherms 3asugars 3awood1 aAnders, Nico1 aSpieß, Antje C.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Sept. 21, v. 31, no. 9 p.9507-9516dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b014543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011400173300001600287520169200303592002801995506003702023650000802060650001902068650001602087650001702103650001302120650001802133650001502151650001702166650002302183700002002206700001802226700002002244700002202264773013202286856008302418852000902501655001202510IND60774734020221207101353.0220422e199911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077473402DNAL7 a10.1177/026119299902701s102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Meer, Miriam10aWelfare Assessment of Transgenic Animals: Behavioural Responses and Morphological Development of Newborn Mice  ap. 857-868.  aFour groups of mice of the same inbred strain, but with different transgenic backgrounds (no treatment; integration of a functional corticotrophin-releasing factor [CRF] gene construct; integration of a non-functional CRF gene construct; transgenic technique without integration of a DNA construct) were compared, in order to identify and quantify indicators of discomfort in transgenic animals. This approach enables us to differentiate between the effects of the technique of transgenesis and the effects caused by the expression of the transgene. This paper emphasises the search for differences in the early post-natal development of the animals. To this end, newborn mice have been subjected to various behavioural tests; moreover, their growth and morphological characteristics were measured from birth up to the age of 3 weeks. The results indicate that the presence of the microinjected DNA-construct influences the survival rate during the first 2–3 days after birth. The average loss of pups was about 10%, in contrast to the groups without the DNA construct, in which none of the pups died. The increase in the relative body weight of pups with a functional CRF construct was significantly lower than in the other groups, but only during the first 11 days. No significant differences in morphological characteristics or behavioural development were observed between the four groups. This approach was found to be adequate for detecting a broad variety of behavioural and morphological characteristics. Before general conclusions about the extent to which the technique of transgenesis affects animal welfare can be drawn, more transgenic lines should be studied in this way.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aanimal welfare 3abody weight 3alaboratories 3aneonates 3asurvival rate 3atransgenes 3atransgenesis 3awelfare assessment1 aCosta, Patrizia1 aBaumans, Vera1 aOlivier, Berend1 avan Zutphen, Bert0 tATLA.

However, eggs can trigger severe allergic reactions, especially in infants and children. The reactions are mostly IgE-mediated with a range of symptoms related to nose and throat and further can lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis. A total of ten allergens have been recognized to date and researchers are actively working on understanding their structure-function relationship which could help reduce the allergy incidences. Major egg allergens are abundant in egg white which include ovalbumin (OA), ovomucoid (OVM), ovotransferrin (OVT) and lysozyme (Lys). In addition to allergens, avidin present in egg white is also extensively studied due to its anti-nutritional properties. Avidin is known to form a complex with biotin which makes it unavailable for absorption.This review focuses on the effects of thermal and non-thermal processing methods on the structure and functional properties of various egg proteins including a wide range of allergens and anti-nutrients.Novel processing techniques including various non-thermal techniques show promising results in reducing the allergic reactions of egg. Anti-nutrients like avidin can be partly inactivated under combined high-pressure processing and heat treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aanaphylaxis 3aantinutritional factors 3aavidin 3abiotin 3achildren 3aegg albumen 3aeggs 3afood processing 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ainfants 3alipids 3alysozyme 3anonthermal processing 3anose 3anutrients 3aovalbumin 3aovomucin 3astructure-activity relationships 3athroat 0aEgg white proteins 0aAvidin 0aThermal processing 0aNon-thermal processing 0aNovel processing 0aEgg allergy1 aVanga, Sai Kranthi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1632-48971 aWang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3117-91731 aRaghavan, Vijaya0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2018 Aug., v. 78 p.188-196dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245021700209300001600426520108200442592002801524650001801552650002301570650001501593650001101608650001801619650001501637650002001652650001601672650002501688650002601713650001701739650000901756650002101765650001701786650002601803653001801829653001401847653002401861653002701885653004201912653003501954653006801989700002602057700001602083700002002099773009402119856008202213852000902295655001202304IND60530819920221117162100.0210124e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053081992DNAL7 a275082272pmid7 aPMC49501372pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinye, Helena M.10aData on characterizing the gene expression patterns of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis genes: CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, CLN5 and their association to interneuron and neurotransmission markers: Parvalbumin and Somatostatin  ap. 741-749.  aThe article contains raw and analyzed data related to the research article “Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis genes, CLN2, CLN3, CLN5 are spatially and temporally co-expressed in a developing mouse brain” (Fabritius et al., 2014) [1]. The processed data gives an understanding of the development of the cell types that are mostly affected by defective function of CLN proteins, timing of expression of CLN1, CLN2, CLN3 and CLN5 genes in a murine model. The data shows relationship between the expression pattern of these genes during neural development. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify known interneuronal markers for neurotransmission and cell proliferation: parvalbumin, somatostatin subpopulations of interneurons. Non-radioactive in-situ hybridization detected CLN5 mRNA in the hippocampus. Throughout the development strong expression of CLN genes were identified in the germinal epithelium and in ventricle regions, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. This provides supportive evidence that CLN1, CLN2, CLN3 and CLN5 genes may be involved in synaptic pruning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acell proliferation 3acerebellum 3acortex 3adata analysis 3aepithelium 3agene expression 3ahippocampus 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3ainterneurons 3amice 3aneurodevelopment 3asomatostatin 3asynaptic transmission 0aNeurogenetics 0aCLN genes 0aCLN1/CLN2/CLN3/CLN5 0aEmbryonic neurogenesis 0aNeurotransmission, molecular genetics 0aNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses 0aNeuronal differentiation, neuroplasticity, and synaptic pruning1 aFabritius, Anna-Liisa1 aVesa, Jouni1 aPeltonen, Leena0 tData in Brief.g2016 Sept., v. 8 p.741-749dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2016.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012900163300001800292500002000310520073000330592002801060596002701088650001401115650001201129650001301141650001101154650001901165650001401184650002601198650002501224700001501249700001901264700002001283700006101303773011601364856008001480852000901560655001201569IND60779955020221117030610.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077995502DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.143442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsami, Midori10aCrystal structures of human glyoxalase I and its complex with TLSC702 reveal inhibitor binding mode and substrate preference  ap. 1458-1467.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman glyoxalase I (hGLO I) is an enzyme for detoxification of methylglyoxal (MG) and has been considered an attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. In our previous report, the GLO I inhibitor TLSC702 induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Here, we determined the crystal structures of hGLO I and its complex with TLSC702. In the complex, the carboxyl O atom of TLSC702 is coordinated to Zn²⁺, and TLSC702 mainly shows van der Waals interaction with hydrophobic residues. In the inhibitor‐unbound structure, glycerol, which has similar functional groups to MG, was bound to Zn²⁺, indicating that GLO I can easily bind to MG. This study provides a structural basis to develop better anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data  a17K07316cJSPS KAKENHI 3aapoptosis 3aenzymes 3aglycerol 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aneoplasms 3asubstrate specificity 3avan der Waals forces1 aAndo, Koki1 aShibuya, Asuka1 aTakasawa, Ryoko1 aYokoyama, Hideshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3137-27930 tFEBS letters.g2022 June, v. 596, no. 11 p.1458-1467dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.143443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245006400173520215100237592002802388650002002416650002002436650002202456650001902478650002002497650002002517650001402537650001502551650002002566650001002586650001702596650001402613653001502627653001502642653002402657653002302681653001502704653002502719700002002744700002602764700002402790773010302814856008802917852000903005655001203014IND60775925620221121195527.0220614e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077592562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1040352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBault, Valentin10aPost-Ordovician trilobite diversity and evolutionary faunas  aTrilobites were the most successful clade of marine invertebrates during the Cambrian, as highlighted by Sepkoski's Cambrian Evolutionary Fauna. After the Cambrian they were still abundant, widespread and highly diversified. Previous analyses show that trilobite diversity dynamics during the Ordovician can be summarized by several trilobite evolutionary faunas. Trilobites, however, were severely affected by the end-Ordovician extinction event, and never again reached such a high diversity. Here we investigate the evolutionary history of trilobites after this crisis by evaluating how their diversity dynamics are structured in evolutionary faunas and what could be the environments influencing these faunas. Using occurrences from the Paleobiology Database, we estimate the post-Ordovician palaeobiodiversity of trilobites by coverage rarefaction (SQS) and identify trilobite evolutionary faunas by means of factor analysis. During the Silurian, trilobite taxonomic richness was relatively high and the Silurian Fauna was dominated by the families that appeared in the Ordovician and survived the end-Ordovician extinction, such as Odontopleuridae and Encrinuridae. A Devonian Fauna established progressively since the end of the Silurian as other families diversified, such as Acastidae and Tropidocoryphidae. The Early Devonian records the highest post-Ordovician diversity, probably favoured by the spreading of epicontinental shallow seas. Abrupt sea-level changes and anoxic events during the Middle Devonian strongly reduced trilobite diversity and brought both Silurian and Devonian Faunas close to their disappearance. During the Late Devonian, trilobite diversity was low and dominated by phacopids and proetids, which characterize a Kellwasser Fauna. Finally, the Hangenberg event (end-Devonian) affected all existing trilobite clades and the following Tournaisian diversification led to the Late Palaeozoic Fauna, composed of phillipsiids and brachymetopids. Despite an important diversity decrease in the Visean–Serpukhovian, this fauna was the only one to persist until the extinction of trilobites at the end of the Permian.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambrian period 3aDevonian period 3aOrdovician period 3aPermian period 3aSilurian period 3aTournaisian age 3adatabases 3aextinction 3afactor analysis 3afauna 3apaleontology 3asea level 0aTrilobites 0aPalaeozoic 0aEvolutionary faunas 0aPalaeobiodiversity 0aExtinction 0aEnvironmental events1 aBalseiro, Diego1 aMonnet, C.q(Claude),1 aCrônier, Catherine0 tEarth-science reviews.g2022 July, v. 230 p.104035-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1040353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245016400215300001600379506007600395520143600471592002801907506003701935650002701972650001501999650005602014650001902070650001502089650002202104650001402126650002402140650001002164650001602174650001302190650003302203650003302236650002202269653006402291653003502355653005302390653001602443653001602459700001402475700001902489700001602508700001302524700001402537700001702551700003402568773009802602856008602700852000902786655001202795IND60602687720221207075717.0180711e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060268772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2014.10.0212doi7 aPMC71143782pmcid7 a254495712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shuangcheng14aThe DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 positively regulates the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus by interacting with viral Nsp9 in vitro  ap. 217-224.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been recognized to play important roles in viral replication. The present study first screened that the DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) was a cellular protein interacting with the Nsp9 of PRRSV by a yeast two-hybrid method in a pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cDNA library. Next, DDX5 was shown to interact with viral Nsp9 in the co-transfected HEK293 cells with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, and the interaction between endogenous DDX5 and Nsp9 was also confirmed in MARC-145 cells infected with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses. Then, the interacting domains between DDX5 and Nsp9 were determined to be the DEXDc and HELICc domains in DDX5 and the RdRp domain in Nsp9, respectively. Moreover, in the HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell lines co-transfected with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, Nsp9 was shown to co-localize with DDX5 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern, and meanwhile in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, endogenous DDX5 was also found to co-localize with Nsp9. Finally, silencing the DDX5 gene in MARC-145 cells significantly impacted the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 could slightly enhance viral replication. These findings indicate that DDX5 positively regulates the replication of PRRSV via its interaction with viral Nsp9 in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDEAD-box RNA helicases 3aLentivirus 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3acDNA libraries 3acell lines 3acomplementary DNA 3acytoplasm 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amacrophages 3aplasmids 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirus replication 0aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 0aNonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) 0aDEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) 0aInteraction 0aReplication1 aGe, Xinna1 aWang, Xiaolong1 aLiu, Aijing1 aGuo, Xin1 aZhou, Lei1 aYu, Kangzhen1 aThīanchai ʻĪamwō̜ramēt,0 tVirus research.g2015 Jan. 02, v. 195 p.217-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014200171300001400313500001400327520144800341592002801789650002001817650002101837650001801858650002001876650002501896650001601921650001601937650001401953650000901967650001801976650001001994650001602004650002302020650002002043650001902063653002802082653001802110653001102128653002202139653001302161653001602174700001502190700001802205700001802223700001502241700001702256700001602273700001402289700001702303773012502320856008502445852000902530655001202539IND60720420120221122121536.0201214e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072042012DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2020.17323942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Yuan-yuan10aEffects of galacto-oligosaccharide on growth performance, feacal microbiota, immune response and antioxidant capability in weaned piglets  ap. 63-69.  aNAL-light  aThe present experiment investigated the effects of galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) on growth performance, faecal microbiota, immune response and antioxidant capability in weaned piglets. Ninety 28-day-old weaned piglets were randomly allocated into 5 treatments with 6 replicate pens per treatment and 3 piglets per pen (n = 18). These five diets were formulated by adding 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/kg GOS to the basal diet, respectively. The experiment was lasted for 28 days. Body weight and feed intake were determined. Faeces samples were collected to detect the amount of microbiota. Blood samples were used to determine antioxidative and immune parameters. The results indicated that GOS supplementation improved the growth performance, increased the number of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria and decreased the number of Escherichia coli in a linear or quadratic dose-dependent manner. Dietary GOS decreased serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a quadratic dose-dependent manner, but increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in a linear or quadratic dose-dependent manner. Moreover, GOS supplementation promoted the activities of antioxidant enzyme in a linear or quadratic dose-dependent manner during the experiment. The levels of MDA quadratically decreased on d 28. These results suggested that GOS exhibited positive effects on growth performance, immune function and antioxidant capability in weaned piglets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aanimal research 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acytokines 3adiet 3adose response 3afeces 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3amicroorganisms 0aGalacto-oligosaccharide 0aweaned piglet 0agrowth 0afaecal microbiota 0aimmunity 0aantioxidant1 aLi, Ke-nan1 aXu, Yuan-qing1 aWu, Ying-zhao1 aShi, Lu-lu1 aGuo, Shi-wei1 aYan, Su-mei1 aJin, Xiao1 aShi, Bin-lin0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 48, no. 1 p.63-69dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2020.17323943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01698naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245004300155300001800198500001900216520057200235592002800807650001800835650001300853650001400866653001200880653001800892653002800910700002100938700001700959700002400976700002101000700001901021700001601040773018601056856007301242852000901315655001201324IND60692350720221119174809.0200502e20071023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069235072DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.703492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSUZUKI, Rie10aReaction of Retinol with Peroxynitrite  ap. 2596-2599.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe reactivity of retinol with peroxynitrite, which is a strong oxidant and has been reported to induce several biological damages, was investigated. 13-cis-14-nitroretinol (1), 13-trans-14-nitroretinol (2), 13-apo-β-carotenone (3), retinal (4), 11,14-epoxyretinol (5), and 11,15-epoxyretinol (6) were identified as reaction products of retinol with peroxynitrite.

The results showed that the E. coli contamination products greatly affected the innate and humoral immune response transcripts. Hence, the impact of E. coli contamination products present in the individual rAHSV4 proteins on the translational immune response was determined. The combined amplification effects of synergistic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), TNF-α and IL-1β signalling induced potent pro-inflammatory responses that were too overwhelming for the anti-inflammatory cytokines and regulators to control. In addition to inducing robust B cell and antibody-mediated responses, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of the innate-like B cells and subsequent polyreactive (natural) antibody responses could potentially contribute to endotoxin tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican horse sickness virus 3aB-lymphocytes 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibodies 3acytokines 3aendotoxins 3ahorses 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3alipopolysaccharides 3aserotypes 3atranscriptomics 3avirulence 0aADCC 0aAHS 0aAHSV4 0aAPCs 0aBCRs 0aDAMPs 0aDAP 0aE. coli, 0aFcR 0aFcεRI 0aFcγR 0aFO B cells 0aGCs 0aIgG 0aLAL 0aLPS 0aMDP 0aMPLA 0aMZ B cells 0aNLRs 0aPAMPs 0aPBMC 0aPC 0aPRRs 0aPtC 0arAHSV4 proteins 0aRLRs 0aTAP 0aTCRs 0aTfh cells 0aTLRs 0aRecombinant proteins 0alipopolysaccharide 0aendotoxin tolerance 0ainnate-like B cells 0apolyreactive (natural) antibodies 0ahyperinflammation1 aTshilwane, Selaelo Ivy1 aVan Kleef, Mirinda1 aPretorius, Alri0 tMolecular immunology.g2022 Sept. 29, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2022.09.013  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245017600160520167900336592002802015650001202043650001002055650001302065650001302078650001602091650001702107650002902124650001302153650001702166650001402183650001402197650001402211650000902225650001702234650002802251650002402279651001202303700002402315700002002339700002702359700002902386773015802415856007502573852000902648655001202657IND60649242120221117100228.0190703e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064924212DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi80602482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachri, Imane 10aMachine Learning Algorithms for Automatic Lithological Mapping Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study from Souk Arbaa Sahel, Sidi Ifni Inlier, Western Anti-Atlas, Morocco  aRemote sensing data proved to be a valuable resource in a variety of earth science applications. Using high-dimensional data with advanced methods such as machine learning algorithms (MLAs), a sub-domain of artificial intelligence, enhances lithological mapping by spectral classification. Support vector machines (SVM) are one of the most popular MLAs with the ability to define non-linear decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature space by solving a quadratic optimization problem. This paper describes a supervised classification method considering SVM for lithological mapping in the region of Souk Arbaa Sahel belonging to the Sidi Ifni inlier, located in southern Morocco (Western Anti-Atlas). The aims of this study were (1) to refine the existing lithological map of this region, and (2) to evaluate and study the performance of the SVM approach by using combined spectral features of Landsat 8 OLI with digital elevation model (DEM) geomorphometric attributes of ALOS/PALSAR data. We performed an SVM classification method to allow the joint use of geomorphometric features and multispectral data of Landsat 8 OLI. The results indicated an overall classification accuracy of 85%. From the results obtained, we can conclude that the classification approach produced an image containing lithological units which easily identified formations such as silt, alluvium, limestone, dolomite, conglomerate, sandstone, rhyolite, andesite, granodiorite, quartzite, lutite, and ignimbrite, coinciding with those already existing on the published geological map. This result confirms the ability of SVM as a supervised learning algorithm for lithological mapping purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aSahel 3aalluvium 3aandesite 3acartography 3acase studies 3adigital elevation models 3adolomite 3agranodiorite 3alimestone 3aquartzite 3asandstone 3asilt 3aspatial data 3asupport vector machines 3asystem optimization 3aMorocco1 aHakdaoui, Mustapha 1 aRaji, Mohammed 1 aTeodoro, Ana  Cláudia1 aBenbouziane, Abdelmajid 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 May 29, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80602483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015500167300001800322520155500340592002801895650002001923650001801943650004301961650002302004650001002027650001302037650001402050650001102064650001902075650002702094650001202121650001302133650002802146650002502174700002502199700002202224700002002246700002402266773009902290856008102389852000902470655001202479IND50069306020221120070012.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006930602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-013-0633-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGailing, Oliver10aGenetic mapping of EST-derived simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) to identify QTL for leaf morphological characters in a Quercus robur full-sib family  ap. 1361-1367.  aThe availability of genomic resources such as expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) markers in adaptive genes with high transferability across related species allows the construction of genetic maps and the comparison of genome structure and quantitative trait loci (QTL) positions. In the present study, genetic linkage maps were constructed for both parents of a Quercus robur × Q. robur ssp. slavonica full-sib pedigree. A total of 182 markers (61 AFLPs, 23 nuclear SSRs, 98 EST-SSRs) and 172 markers (49 AFLPs, 21 nSSRs, 101 EST-SSRs, 1 isozyme) were mapped on the female and male linkage maps, respectively. The total map length and average marker spacing were 1,038 and 5.7 cM for the female map and 998.5 and 5.8 cM for the male map. A total of 68 nuclear SSRs and EST-SSRs segregating in both parents allowed to define homologous linkage groups (LG) between both parental maps. QTL for leaf morphological traits were mapped on all 12 LG at a chromosome-wide level and on 6 LG at a genome-wide level. The phenotypic effects explained by each single QTL ranged from 4.0 % for leaf area to 15.8 % for the number of intercalary veins. QTL clusters for leaf characters that discriminate between Q. robur and Quercus petraea were mapped reproducibly on three LG, and some putative candidate genes among potentially many others were identified on LG3 and LG5. Genetic linkage maps based on EST-SSRs can be valuable tools for the identification of genes involved in adaptive trait variation and for comparative mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus petraea 3aQuercus robur 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3aisozymes 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alinkage groups 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3apedigree 3aquantitative trait loci 3aspatial distribution1 aBodénès, Catherine1 aFinkeldey, Reiner1 aKremer, Antoine1 aPlomion, Christophe0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2013 Oct., v. 9, no. 5 p.1361-1367dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-013-0633-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245013300210300001600343520170700359592002802066596007902094596008302173650001302256650001502269650001302284700001802297700003502315773009802350856008302448852000902531655001202540IND60779429220221119145657.0220608e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077942922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12228-021-09691-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Agustina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4768-664X12aA critical review of type specimens for Polygala species (Polygalaceae) collected during the Malaspina Expedition of 1789–1794  ap. 107-122.  aThe names of sixteen species of Polygala (Polygalaceae) collected by Luis Née and Thaddeus Haenke during the Malaspina Expedition of 1789–1794 were published mostly by C.

Resale and/or redistribution of a large part of the collected specimens to various herbaria had hindered proper application of these names. Based on a thorough study of the original material, manuscripts, and pertinent literature, a critical review of the type collections for Polygala acuminata Willd., P. coridifolia C.Presl, P. gnidioides Willd., P. linarifolia Willd., P. minutiflora C.Presl, P. mucronata Willd., P. myrtilloides Willd., P. neaei DC., P. pavonii Chodat, P. polifolia C.Presl, P. quadrangula C.Presl, P. ramosissima Cav., P. sulcata Willd., P. tenella Willd., P. thesioides Willd., and P. velutina C.Presl is here presented.

Using water hyacinth to remove nutrients from water bodies and to produce biogas is another technically feasible option for the control of water hyacinth, but its environmental and economic performances are not well understood. This study collected data from an experimental biogas plant to develop a lifecycle analysis and a cost benefit analysis for the control of water hyacinth proliferation in a eutrophic lake in China. Comparison was made between the alternative option of using water hyacinth for biogas production and the current practice of disposing it in landfills. The results reveal that the biogas option is economically feasible with a positive energy balance. The removal of water hyacinth to produce biogas can contribute to water quality improvement and GHG emission reduction whose values, however, depend on the processing scale of the biogas plant. Since both the current approach and the biogas option can remove nutrients from water bodies, the additional value of water quality improvement resulting from the biogas option is only possible when the processing scale of the biogas plant is greater than the amount of water hyacinth disposed by landfill. The emission of methane deserves attention when water hyacinth is disposed by landfill. The biogas option can respond to China's policies on water pollution control, renewable energy development, and energy saving and emission reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3abiogas 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconomic performance 3aemissions 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental assessment 3agreenhouse gases 3alakes 3alandfills 3amethane 3anutrients 3aplanting 3apollution control 3asurface water 3awater analysis 3awater policy 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater treatment 2aBiofuelsxeconomics 2aCost-Benefit Analysis 2aDecision Support Techniques 2aEichhornia 2aEutrophication 2aLakes 2aMethanexbiosynthesis 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aWeed Controlxeconomicsxmethods. 3aChina 0aChina1 aCalderon, Margaret M.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 110 p.246-253dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04183naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100001900191245010200210300001400312506007600326506003100402520220100433592002802634596006002662506003702722650002002759650002402779650001402803650002402817650001502841650002002856650001802876650001302894650001002907650001502917650002902932650002602961650002002987650001603007650002203023650001003045650000903055650001403064651001203078651003003090653001603120653001503136653003603151653001203187653001203199700006503211700002003276773011303296856008503409856004503494961000903539852000903548655001203557IND60584395420221215142822.0200515e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058439542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0102chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFord, Scott A.10aEffects of wind disturbance and salvage harvesting on macrofungal communities in a Pinus woodland  ap. 31-46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aNatural disturbances alter the biophysical conditions of ecosystems, influencing patterns of structure, composition, and successional dynamics. Following high severity natural disturbance in forest ecosystems, land-managers sometimes employ salvage harvesting to harvest trees killed or damaged by the disturbance agent. Despite its widespread practice, the effects of salvage harvesting on many ecosystem functions and species assemblages are still poorly understood. This study presents the first attempt to document and analyze the effects of salvage harvesting on macrofungal communities following catastrophic wind disturbance. On 27 April 2011, an EF3 tornado damaged forest stands within the Oakmulgee Ranger District of the Talladega National Forest in west-central Alabama, USA. Following the event, portions of some stands were subject to salvage harvesting. In 2016, we established three treatments, undisturbed, tornado disturbed, and salvage harvested, in stands that were dominated by Pinus palustris P. Miller prior to the 2011 disturbance events. Throughout the sample period, 546 occurrences of 84 macrofungal species were recorded. Tornado disturbed areas hosted the highest macrofungal species richness overall. Undisturbed areas hosted the highest species richness for ectomycorrhizal macrofungi. Salvage harvested areas had reduced species richness for both saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal macrofungi compared to tornado disturbed plots. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and permutational multivariate analysis of variance indicated that all three treatments differed in macrofungal community composition. The results indicated that salvage harvesting following catastrophic wind disturbance has the capacity to reduce macrofungal species richness and fruiting abundance. The reduction in deadwood volume and alterations to the ectomycorrhizal-associating plant community documented at salvage harvested sites is likely responsible for the observed differences in macrofungal fruiting patterns. The implications of reduced macrofungal richness in the early stages of forest development following catastrophic disturbance should be subject to long-term studies.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Forest Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000069590 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus palustris 3acommunity structure 3adead wood 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest stands 3afruiting 3afungi 3aharvesting 3amultidimensional scaling 3amultivariate analysis 3asalvage logging 3asaprotrophs 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3awind 3awoodlands 3aAlabama 3aTalladega National Forest 0aDisturbance 0aMacrofungi 0aPinus palustris (longleaf pine) 0aSalvage 0aTornado1 aKleinman, Jonathan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9914-92161 aHart, Justin L.0 tForest ecology and management.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 407 p.31-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.10.0103Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5843954  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02206naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245008700164520132400251592002801575650001601603650001501619650001101634650001501645650001301660651001001673700003001683773011801713856007601831852000901907655001201916IND60748589920221122054828.0210827e20210727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074858992DNAL7 a10.3390/land100807862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLøvschal, Mette 13aDe-/Fencing Grasslands: Ongoing Boundary Making and Unmaking in Postcolonial Kenya  aAcross contemporary East Africa, fencing is spreading with incredible speed over hundreds of thousands of hectares of rangelands, fundamentally reconfiguring land tenure dynamics. But why is this happening now, what are the precursors, and what will happen in the years to come? In this article, we ask how pre- and post-colonial landscape gridding perpetuate a slow violence across the landscape through processes of de-/fencing. Fencing, we argue, is embedded in a landscape logic that favours exclusive rights and conditioned access. In two case studies from grazing lands in Kenya, we explore how people engage with the tension of an imposed landscape logic of fencing by either asserting or challenging its very physicality. We propose that de-/fencing are ways of anticipating long-standing land tenure uncertainties. Moreover, we use our cases to explore different points of reference along the mattering of land tenure boundaries as well as the sort of horizons to which fencing leads. We also use this knowledge to improve our understanding of parallel prehistoric cases of large-scale landscape enclosure. By unfolding the intertwined socio-political and material nature of gridded landscapes, we seek to bring the study of fencing out of conservation literature and into its wider culture-historical context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland tenure 3alandscapes 3apeople 3arangelands 3aviolence 3aKenya1 aGravesen, Marie Ladekjær0 tLand.g2021 July 27, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100807863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01056naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007600206300001600282520015800298592002800456650001500484650001600499651001200515651000900527700002100536700001900557773009800576856008300674852000900757655001200766IND60779429420221119145858.0220608e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077942942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12228-022-09701-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFawcett, Susan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5021-177910aTwo new species of Goniopteris (Thelypteridaceae) from Ecuador and Peru  ap. 148-154.  aTwo new species of Goniopteris are described from Ecuador and Peru: G. deltata and G. yanachagae.

A primary question arises as to the lifespan of stream restoration features. This study develops a framework to identify relevant parameters, design criteria and survival thresholds for ten multidisciplinary restoration techniques:•Parameterize relevant features, notably, (1) bar and floodplain grading; (2) berm setback; (3) vegetation plantings; (4) riprap placement; (5) sediment replenishment; (6) side cavities; (7) side channel and anabranches; (8) streambed reshaping; (9) structure removal; and (10) placement of wood in the shape of engineered logjams and rootstocks.•Identify survival thresholds for parameters, where the feature life ends when the threshold value is exceeded.•Compare parameter thresholds with spatial data of topographic change and hydrodynamic forces as a result of hydrodynamic modelling of multiple discharges.The discharge or topographic change rate that is related to the lowest (flood) return period spatially determines the feature’s lifespan in years.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aengineering 3afloodplains 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic models 3alongevity 3aplanning 3arootstocks 3asediments 3aspatial data 3astream channels 3atopography 3avegetation 3awood1 aPasternack, G.B.1 aBratovich, P.M.1 aRabone, G.1 aSimodynes, D.0 tMethodsX.g2019, v. 6 p.756-759dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2019.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245008900164520153700253592002801790650001401818650002001832650000901852650001501861650001301876650002601889700002101915700002101936700002301957773015801980856007502138852000902213655001202222IND60649242420221117100338.0190703e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064924242DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi80602512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnopková, Dajana 10aNavigation in Indoor Environments: Does the Type of Visual Learning Stimulus Matter?  aThis work addresses the impact of a geovisualization&rsquo;s level of realism on a user&rsquo;s experience in indoor navigation. The key part of the work is a user study in which participants navigated along a designated evacuation route previously learnt in a virtual tour or traditional 2D floor plan. The efficiency and effectiveness of completing the task was measured by the number of incorrect turns during navigation and completion time. The complexity of mental spatial representations that participants developed before and after navigating the route was also evaluated. The data was obtained using several qualitative and quantitative research methods (mobile eye tracking, structured interviews, sketching of cognitive maps, creation of navigation instructions, and additional questions to evaluate spatial orientation abilities). A total of 36 subjects (17 in the &ldquo;floor plan&rdquo; group and 19 in the &ldquo;virtual tour&rdquo; group) participated in the study. The results showed that the participants from both groups were able to finish the designated navigation route, but more detailed mental spatial representations were developed by the &ldquo;virtual tour&rdquo; group than the &ldquo;floor plan&rdquo; group. The participants in the virtual tour group created richer navigation instructions both before and after evacuation, mentioned more landmarks and could recall their characteristics. Visual landmark characteristics available in the virtual tour also seemed to support the correct decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3adecision making 3aeyes 3ainterviews 3alearning 3aquantitative analysis1 aŠvedová, Hana 1 aKubíček, Petr 1 aStachoň, Zdeněk 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2019 May 29, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi80602513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04278naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245017600174300001800350520204700368592002802415650002202443650001502465650001602480650001402496650000902510650001002519650001302529650001402542650002302556650001202579650001002591650001402601650000902615650001902624650001402643650001402657650001602671650001102687650001202698653001402710653001602724653001702740653002302757653001602780653001702796653001102813653001202824653001002836653000702846653000702853653000702860653000902867653000602876653000802882653000802890653000802898653000702906653000902913653000902922653000902931653000902940653000902949653000802958653000902966653000702975653000802982653000802990653000902998653000803007653000803015653000703023653000903030653000803039653000903047653000703056653000703063700002003070700001803090700002203108700001603130773009903146856008603245852000903331655001203340IND60607576220221121015421.0190319e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060757622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieler, Michael M.12aA cell culture-derived whole virus influenza A vaccine based on magnetic sulfated cellulose particles confers protection in mice against lethal influenza A virus infection  ap. 6367-6374.  aDownstream processing and formulation of viral vaccines employs a large number of different unit operations to achieve the desired product qualities. The complexity of individual process steps involved, the need for time consuming studies towards the optimization of virus yields, and very high requirements regarding potency and safety of vaccines results typically in long lead times for the establishment of new processes. To overcome such obstacles, to enable fast screening of potential vaccine candidates, and to explore options for production of low cost veterinary vaccines a new platform for whole virus particle purification and formulation based on magnetic particles has been established. Proof of concept was carried out with influenza A virus particles produced in suspension Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The clarified, inactivated, concentrated, and diafiltered virus particles were bound to magnetic sulfated cellulose particles (MSCP), and directly injected into mice for immunization including positive and negative controls. We show here, that in contrast to the mock-immunized group, vaccination of mice with antigen-loaded MSCP (aMSCP) resulted in high anti-influenza A antibody responses and full protection against a lethal challenge with replication competent influenza A virus. Antiviral protection correlated with a 400-fold reduced number of influenza nucleoprotein gene copies in the lungs of aMSCP immunized mice compared to mock-treated animals, indicating the efficient induction of antiviral immunity by this novel approach. Thus, our data proved the use of MSCP for purification and formulation of the influenza vaccine to be fast and efficient, and to confer protection of mice against influenza A virus infection. Furthermore, the method proposed has the potential for fast purification of virus particles directly from bioreactor harvests with a minimum number of process steps towards formulation of low-cost veterinary vaccines, and for screening studies requiring fast purification protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantibodies 3abioreactors 3acellulose 3adogs 3agenes 3aimmunity 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3akidneys 3alungs 3amagnetism 3amice 3anucleoproteins 3aprotocols 3ascreening 3avaccination 3avirion 3aviruses 0aInfluenza 0aVaccination 0aPurification 0aMagnetic particles 0aFormulation 0aImmunization 0aTCID50 0aOD450nm 0aaMSCP 0aaq 0aCB 0aCV 0acPCA 0ad 0aDVH 0aDSP 0aHAU 0aHA 0aHSPG 0aA/PR 0ai.p. 0aMDCK 0aMSCP 0aMVA 0aNAFL 0aNP 0aPBS 0aPCA 0ap.i. 0aPFB 0aRSD 0aRT 0aSRID 0aSEM 0aSCMA 0aVB 0aWB1 aFrentzel, Sarah1 aBruder, Dunja1 aWolff, Michael W.1 aReichl, Udo0 tVaccine.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 34, no. 50 p.6367-6374dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007300151245005500224500002200279520070900301592002801010653000801038653000801046653000801054653000801062653000801070653002101078653002001099653002001119653001101139653001101150773009601161856005201257852000901309655001201318IND60795445020221121135035.0221004e20220924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079544502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2022.1108762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapadopoulos, Konstantinos G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8217-594410aAdvantageous symmetric cross-ownership and mergers  aPre-press version  aWe model an industry where a subset of firms is interlinked via a reciprocal and symmetric share exchange agreement. Under quantity competition, a merger aiming at acquisition of market power can be reproduced by the same firms under a symmetric cross-ownership scheme. Under linear demand, a non-controlling symmetric cross-ownership scheme is always advantageous to its members if at least (2−2)(1+n) firms in an n-firm industry participate. The threshold drops to (1+n)/2 for relatively low levels of cross-ownership. Cross-ownership schemes require fewer participants than mergers to be advantageous and can be more profitable than equal size mergers. Unlike mergers, a unique stable scheme exists.  aPublisher supplied data 0aD43 0aL11 0aL13 0aL41 0aG34 0aCommon ownership 0aCross-ownership 0aMinority stakes 0aCartel 0aMerger0 tEconomics letters.g2022 Sept. 24,  p.110876-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2022.110876  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245005900211300001600270506007600286520033700362592002800699506003700727650001800764650001800782650001200800650001400812650001600826773008000842856008200922852000901004655001201013IND60092616220221207132452.0141103e20120203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009261622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.0252doi7 aPMC45447042pmcid7 a223049082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTracey, Kevin J.,10aImmune Cells Exploit a Neural Circuit to Enter the CNS  ap. 392-394.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with the appearance of autoreactive T cells in the central nervous system.

Adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) are essential components of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue. They give rise to mature adipocytes and play a critical role in maintaining adipose tissue function. However, the molecular heterogeneity and functional diversity of ASPCs are still poorly understood. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis has identified distinct subtypes of ASPCs in murine and human adipose tissues, providing new insights into the cellular complexity of ASPCs among multiple fat depots. This review summarizes the current knowledge on ASPC populations, including their markers, functions, and regulatory mechanisms. Targeting one or several of these cell populations may ameliorate metabolic disorders by promoting adaptive hyperplastic adipose growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aadipocytes 3aenergy metabolism 3afunctional diversity 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amice 3awhite adipose tissue 0aAdipose tissue 0aASPCs 0ascRNA-seq 0aCommitted preadipocytes 0aRegulatory progenitors1 aZhou, Haiyan1 aDeng, Tuo0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2022 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.308-315dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2022.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245004600208300001800254506007600272520070000348592002801048506003701076650001101113650001301124650002001137650001201157650002401169650001901193650001201212650001101224650001101235650002201246700002201268773013101290856007801421852000901499655001201508IND60649242620221207075503.0190703e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064924262DNAL7 a10.3390/insects30410842doi7 aPMC45535642pmcid7 a264667272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMott, Christine M.10aInsulin Modifies Honeybee Worker Behavior  ap. 1084-1092.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe insulin signaling pathway has been hypothesized to play a key role in regulation of worker social insect behavior.

Treatment of winter worker bees with bovine insulin, used as a proxy for honeybee insulin, increased the bees’ sucrose response threshold. Treatment of summer nurse bees with bovine insulin significantly decreased the age at which foraging was initiated.

The expressed SaPIN2a in transgenic lettuce showed inhibition of plant endogenous trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities, suggesting that SaPIN2a can regulate proteolysis in plant cells. To further investigate the physiological role of SaPIN2a, we produced transgenic nightshade and lettuce plants overexpressing SaPIN2a from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Overexpression of SaPIN2a in transgenic plants was demonstrated by northern blot and western blot analysis. SaPIN2a-overexpressing transgenic nightshade plants showed significantly lower height than wild-type plants. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that chloroplast-like organelles with thylakoids, which are not present in enucleate SEs of wild-type plants, were present in the enucleate SEs of SaPIN2a-overexpressing transgenic plants. This finding is discussed in terms of the possible role played by SaPIN2a in the regulation of proteolysis in SEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCauliflower mosaic virus 3aNorthern blotting 3aSolanum americanum 3aWestern blotting 3abiotechnology 3alettuce 3apromoter regions 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteolysis 3athylakoids 3atransmission electron microscopy 0achloroplast-like 0aphloem 0aproteinase inhibitor 0asieve elements1 aOUYANG, Xue-Zhi1 aXIA, Kuai-Fei1 aHuang, Yufeng,1 aPAN, Wen-Bi1 aCAI, Ying-Peng1 aXu, Xinping,1 aLI, Baojian1 aXU, Zeng-Fu0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Nov. 23, v. 71, no. 11 p.2759-2765dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.703623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011700165300001800282520114300300592002801443650001801471650002501489650001501514650001801529650001301547650002001560650000901580650001901589650001401608650002101622650001001643650002501653650001201678653003101690653001901721653001801740653001201758700001201770700001501782700001801797700001901815700001401834700001701848700001501865700001401880700001701894773009901911856008602010852000902096655001202105IND60607576420221120233539.0190319e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060757642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Cheng10aReplacing the decoy epitope of PCV2b capsid protein with a protective epitope enhances efficacy of PCV2b vaccine  ap. 6358-6366.  aMicrobial pathogens may evolve decoy epitopes to evade host immune responses. In recent years, a decoy epitope has been identified in the capsid protein (CP) of porcine circovirus type 2b (PCV2b) to divert the immune response away from protective epitopes in pigs. To avoid the decoy effect, we designed and produced a recombinant PCV2b CP (ΔCP) by replacing the decoy epitope with a neutralizing B cell epitope derived from CP and tested the ability of ΔCP to induce protective antibody responses in mice and pigs. As expected, the ΔCP, unlike inactivated PCV2b vaccines, recombinant PCV2b CP, and natural PCV2b infection, did not induce anti-decoy epitope antibodies. Although unable to form typical virus-like particles (VLPs), the ΔCP could increase the production of the anti-PCV2b antibodies among which no antibody against the decoy epitopes, and therefore induces improved protective immune responses in pigs challenged with PCV2b. These results provide an alternative strategy for development of recombinant subunit vaccines against PCV2b, and possibly other viruses, by replacing the decoy epitope with a protective epitope.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aPorcine circovirus-2 3aantibodies 3acoat proteins 3aepitopes 3aimmune response 3amice 3aneutralization 3apathogens 3asubunit vaccines 3aswine 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 0aPorcine circovirus type 2b 0aCapsid protein 0aDecoy epitope 0aVaccine1 aLi, Xin1 aLiu, Jiwei1 aDiao, Wenzhen1 aZhang, Leichao1 aXiao, Yue1 aWei, Hongfei1 aYu, Yongli1 aYu, Yaqin1 aWang, Liying0 tVaccine.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 34, no. 50 p.6358-6366dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245006600187300001600253520192100269592002802190653001802218653001802236653003002254653002802284653002502312653002402337700002202361700002202383700002402405700002202429700002302451773013602474856010102610852000902711655001202720IND60130008720221120202818.0151126e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013000872DNAL7 a10.2111/1551-5028(2005)58[284:TUOBMM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreuter, Urs P.14aThe Use of Brush Management Methods: A Texas Landowner Survey  ap. 284-291.  aAdoption of effective brush management methods is critical to achieving many rangeland management objectives. However, landowners have often been reluctant to adopt new practices. In April 2000, a questionnaire was mailed to the 1 058 landowners in 48 Texas counties to identify factors that influence land management decisions, especially with respect to brush management practices, including Brush Busters treatments. Brush Busters is a Texas-based program developed to expedite the adoption of ““select”” individual plant treatments through the use of environmentally safe methods. Overall, landowners were ““neutral”” to ““dissatisfied”” with regard to the amount of brush on their land. Two primary reasons for wanting to decrease brush were to increase forage production and to conserve water. Kind of brush and cost of brush control were important factors determining the preferred treatment type. In general, the most effective methods were considered to be mechanical treatments for juniper (Juniperus ashei) and individual plant herbicide treatments for mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.). Mechanical treatments and aerial herbicide applications were perceived to be the most expensive methods, followed by individual plant herbicide treatments, and fire was considered to be the least expensive method. Our study indicated that landowners' satisfaction with Brush Busters' select methods will likely result in an increase in the use of individual plant herbicide treatments for controlling brush. Our study emphasized that a key for enhancing the adoption of sound rangeland management practices is the development and effective dissemination of user-friendly information about low-cost techniques that produce quick results. Easily visible demonstration sites and the establishment of cooperative groups could accelerate the adoption of such practices.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBrush Busters 0abrush control 0ainformation dissemination 0alandowner participation 0arangeland management 0atechnology adoption1 aAmestoy, Heidi E.1 aKothmann, Mort M.1 aUeckert, Darrell N.1 aMcGinty, W.

In spite of their size, they are –– like many species of mosquitoes –– completely harmless to man. The larvae are predaceous on other mosquitoes and aquatic organisms that inhabit both natural and artificial containers. Because this habitat is the source of several medically important species of mosquitoes, there is warrant for evaluating the potential of Toxorhynchites as a biological control agent under various conditions. Toxorhynchites is not seen as a panacea for the control of all container-inhabiting mosquitoes. However, it has demonstrated practical potential in certain restricted but important situations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aContainer-inhabiting mosquitoes 0asource reduction 0apredaceous larvae 0arearing 0aoviposition0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2007 July, v. 23, no. sp2 p.118-127dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282007%2923%5B118%3ATABA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245013700154520182600291592002802117650002202145650001702167650001202184650002302196650002602219650001402245650001302259650001102272650001902283650001202302651001002314700001502324700001902339700001802358773011802376856007602494852000902570655001202579IND60748590320221116194609.0210827e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074859032DNAL7 a10.3390/land100807892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Yi 10aHow to Evaluate the Green Utilization Efficiency of Cultivated Land in a Farming Household? A Case Study of Shandong Province, China  aThe behavior of farming households is the most direct factor involved in the transition of cultivated land utilization from high-input/high-output to green and sustainable utilization mode. Improving farming households’ green utilization efficiency of cultivated land (GUECL) is of great significance in facilitating agricultural green development in China. However, there are few studies on GUECL based on the micro-perspective of farming households that cover the comprehensive benefits to the economy, ecology, and society. This paper builds a theoretical analysis framework of farming households’ green utilization of cultivated land and uses the super-efficiency EBM model and a questionnaire to conduct an empirical analysis of 952 farming households in Shandong Province to evaluate the green utilization efficiency of cultivated land. The results show that the GUECL of the farming households is generally not high, with an average value of 0.67, and can be further improved. The higher the GUECL, the lower the input and undesired output per unit yield and per unit output value. Tobit regression results show that a farming household’s per capita income is significantly positively correlated with the GUECL, while agricultural insurance, agricultural subsidies, cultivated land scale, cultivated land fragmentation, and regional economic level are significantly negatively correlated with the GUECL. In addition, recommendations can be made on promoting and innovating agricultural green development technology, popularizing and publicizing farming households’ thoughts on the green utilization of cultivated land, and ensuring and improving rural green life so as to provide a reference for promoting green transition of cultivated land utilization with diversified coordination and multiple measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3aecology 3aempirical research 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ainsurance 3aland use 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3asociety 3aChina1 aLyu, Xiao 1 aPeng, Wenlong 1 aXin, Zongfei 0 tLand.g2021 July 28, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100807893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245009400160300001800254500001900272500002000291520143500311592002801746596006101774596006101835596007901896650004401975650001702019650001002036650001902046650001402065650001802079650001602097650001702113650002102130650001802151650001002169650002102179650001702200650002602217650001802243650003802261650001902299700001702318700001402335700001702349700001102366700001302377700001802390700005602408773012602464856007902590852000902669655001202678IND60714384220221121222035.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071438422DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.154092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jin10aEffect of nanoliposomal entrapment on antioxidative hydrolysates from goose blood protein  ap. 3034-3042.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, the encapsulation of goose blood hydrolysate (GBH) was performed within nanoliposomes. We investigated the physicochemical properties, stability, antioxidant indices, the morphology of nanoparticles, the digestion stability in simulated gastrointestinal fluid, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. GBH was successfully encapsulated into nanoliposomes using reverse‐phase evaporation method. The entrapment efficiency of GBH‐loaded nanoliposomes was about 70.99 ± 2.85%, the average particle size was 93.3 ± 2.45 nm, the zeta‐potential of GBH‐loaded nanoliposomes was −30 mV, and the morphology of GBH‐loaded nanoliposomes was characterized by transmission electron microscope. Moreover, the results of DSC and FTIR showed that the GBH nanoliposome was more stable than the empty liposomes due to hydrogen bond complexation between liposome and GBH. The release of GBH from nanoliposomes could be significantly controlled, and the release ratios were 48.9 ± 2.96% in simulated gastric fluid and 59.9 ± 5.30% in simulated intestinal fluid, respectively, proving that degradation rate of antioxidant activities of GBH encapsulated in nanoliposomes was decreased. In conclusion, nanoliposomes embedding is a promising and effective way to increase the stability of hydrolysates from GBH and produce various types of functional food.  aPublisher supplied data  a31771993cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (  a31271903cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (  a2011BFA024cInternational Cooperation Project of Hubei province of China ( 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3ablood proteins 3adigestion 3aencapsulation 3aevaporation 3afood science 3afunctional foods 3agastric juice 3ageese 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysates 3aintestinal secretions 3aparticle size 3atransmission electron microscopes 3azeta potential1 aWu, Mengting1 aYang, Kun1 aZhao, Manman1 aWu, Di1 aMa, Jing1 aDing, Baomiao1 aSun, Weiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8719-17210 tJournal of food science.g2020 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.3034-3042dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.154093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002200162245001500184300001600199520044000215592002800655653001700683653001600700653001300716653002100729653001300750653001300763653001600776653001600792773015600808856011000964852000901074655001201083IND60128988720221119161540.0151124e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012898872DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2007)23[225:M]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenrick, Clive A.10aMethoprene  ap. 225-239.  aA brief overview is presented of the discovery and development of s-methoprene and some other juvenile hormone mimics.

This paper developed the drying model by coupling penetration theory and two dimensional Markov chain to simulate the sludge drying kinetics in a double-axis paddle dryer. A series of sludge drying experiments were carried out in a double-axis continuous paddle dryer so as to study the influences of sludge flowrate, stirrer speed, tilt angle, overflow height and dryer wall temperature on the drying mechanism. During the drying process, sludge crusting occurred in some experiments according to different operating conditions. It was a phenomenon that sludge in some cells adhered and then formed crust on the heat transfer surface with moisture content decreasing leading a decrease in sludge drying rate in the cells. Thus, in order to more accurately explain the sludge crusting in partial operating conditions, the viscous zone was introduced. The crusting drastically increases the heat transfer resistance which occurs easily in high wall temperature, high overflow height, high sludge flowrate and low stirrer speed condition while the tilt angle of the dryer has little effect on crusting.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.2019YFC1907000cNational Key R&D Program of China  aNo. 51976188cNational Nature Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2018C03041cScience and Technology Plan Project of Zhejiang Province  a2018C03007cScience and Technology Plan Project of Zhejiang Province  aNo. 2018B10023cKey Project of Innovation of Science and Technology of Ningbo City 3aMarkov chain 3abiomass 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3awater content1 aChen, Shaoqing1 aWang, Fei0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2022 July, v. 13, no. 7 p.3403-3421dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-022-01734-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003400113040001800147100002000165245008700185300002000272500000900292520112200301592002801423650001201451650001901463650001701482650001901499650001701518650001701535650002001552650002701572650001401599650002501613650002301638650001801661650001301679650001201692650000801704650001201712650001601724650002501740700002501765773013701790852000901927856011201936856008102048961001302129655001202142IND4437556820221121062921.0191226e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443755682DNAL7 a10113/432842hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2006.0302c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanna, Wayne W.10aDevelopment and Impact of Vegetative Propagation in Forage and Turf Bermudagrasses  ap.

Risks were taken, innovative approaches were used, new equipment was developed and modified, and public institutions and private industry teamed up to make what we have today a reality. In the 1940s and 1950s, pioneering discoveries and advances were made in inventing equipment, establishing protocols, and developing consumer confidence. Vegetative reproduction in bermudagrass revolutionized the golf and athletic field industries by providing a superior, high-quality, uniform playing surface. It maximized profitability of the forage industry for cattle (Bos taurus) by providing the very best genotypes for farmers and ranchers to plant for grazing and hay. Although vegetative propagation of forage and turf started with Cynodon hybrids in a small area of the United States, the practice has expanded on a commercial scale to numerous species around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon 3aforage grasses 3aforage crops 3alawns and turf 3aturf grasses 3agolf courses 3aathletic fields 3avegetative propagation 3acultivars 3aagricultural history 3aconsumer attitudes 3aprofitability 3agenotype 3agrazing 3ahay 3ahybrids 3amethodology 3alaboratory equipment1 aAnderson, William F.0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 May, v. 100, no.

Although electroacupuncture (EA) has been widely used to alleviate various kinds of pain, the underlying mechanism of EA analgesia requires further investigation. This study investigated the relationship between EA-induced analgesia and ERK signaling involved in pain hypersensitivity. METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into control, model, EA and sham EA groups. Inflammatory pain model was induced by injecting of 100 μl Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the plantar surface of a hind paw. Rats in the EA group were treatment with EA (constant aquare wave, 2 Hz and 100 Hz alternating frequencies, intensities ranging from 1-2 mA) at 5.5 h, 24.5 h and 48.5 h. Paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) were measured before modeling and at 5 h, 6 h, 25 h and 49 h after CFA injection. Rats were killed and ipsilateral side of the lumbar spinal cords were harvested for detecting the expressions of p-ERK1/2, Elk1, COX-2, NK-1 and CREB by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, western blot analysis and EMSA. Finally, the analgesic effect of EA plus U0126, a MEK (ERK kinase) inhibitor, on CFA rats was examined. RESULTS: Inflammatory pain was induced in rats by hindpaw injection of CFA and significantly increased phospho-ERK1/2 positive cells and protein levels of p-ERK1/2 in the ipsilateral spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH). CFA up-regulated of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein expression at 6 h after injection and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1) expression at 49 h post-injection, in the SCDH. EA, applied to Zusanli (ST36) and Kunlun (BL60), remarkably increased the pain thresholds of CFA injected rats, significantly suppressed ERK1/2 activation and COX-2 protein expression after a single treatment, and decreased NK-1 mRNA and protein expression at 49 h. EA decreased the DNA binding activity of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a downstream transcription factor of ERK1/2, at 49 h after CFA injection. Moreover, EA and U0126 synergistically inhibited CFA-induced allodynia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that EA produces analgesic effect by preventing the activation of ERK1/2-COX-2 pathway and ERK1/2-CREB-NK-1 pathway in CFA rats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aadjuvants 3aalternative medicine 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesic effect 3abinding proteins 3acyclic AMP 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3apain 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3aspinal cord 3atranscription factors1 aFang, Jun-Fan1 aLiang, Yi1 aDu, Jun-Ying0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.285-285dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013100167300001600298520106200314592002801376650001901404650001701423650001401440650002301454650001701477650001801494650002501512650002001537650001601557650001501573650001301588650001801601650001201619650000901631650003201640651001201672653001201684653001701696653002301713653001401736653002101750653002401771700002701795700001801822700002001840773010601860856008701966852000902053655001202062IND60536211920221116143017.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053621192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupp, Gerd10aImpacts of increasing bioenergy use on ecosystem services on nature and society exemplified in the German district of Görlitz  ap. 131-140.  aAccording to the energy policies of the European Union and Germany, the proportion of renewable sources for energy will be increased significantly in the coming years. The extended cultivation of energy crops can lead to conflicts, e.g. severe impacts on various ecosystem services based on groundwater, soils, biodiversity and the overall appearance of the scenery. Energy crops compete with food production, and moreover, they have various ecological, economic and social implications. There is a need for improved spatial planning instruments to regulate energy crop cultivation and to reduce the impact on ecosystems and landscapes. As economic, ecological and social aspects are involved, we see the concept of Ecosystem Services as a suitable tool to analyze the impacts of an increased growth of energy crops. This concept not only acts as a stimulus to finding appropriate solutions for enhancing sustainable land management on a regional level, but also provides a holistic view with which to address the demands for improved regulative frameworks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3aecosystem services 3aenergy crops 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental impact 3afood production 3agroundwater 3alandscapes 3aplanning 3asocial impact 3asociety 3asoil 3asustainable land management 3aGermany 0aBiomass 0aEnergy crops 0aEcosystem services 0aScenarios 0aLegal frameworks 0aTransdisciplinarity1 aSteinhäußer, Reimund1 aBastian, Olaf1 aSyrbe, Ralf-Uwe0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Dec., v. 83 p.131-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015700176520100800333592002801341650001601369650002101385650003001406650001801436650001001454650002101464650001501485650001301500650001501513650001701528653002501545653001201570653001401582653001401596653001101610653001701621700002101638700002101659700001901680700005901699700005801758700001901816700005901835700006101894773009901955856008502054852000902139655001202148IND60731730320221120052738.0210428e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073173032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2021.1010452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGippet, Jérôme M.W.10aLand-cover and climate factors contribute to the prevalence of the ectoparasitic fungus Laboulbenia formicarum in its invasive ant host Lasius neglectus  aUnderstanding the distribution of parasites is crucial for biodiversity conservation. Here, we studied the distribution of the ectoparasitic fungus Laboulbenia formicarum in native and invasive Lasius ants in a 2000 km² area. We screened over 16,000 ant workers in 478 colonies of five different species. We found that Lab. formicarum was rare in native Lasius species but infected 58% of the colonies of the invasive species Las. neglectus. At landscape scale, Lab. formicarum presence could not be explained by geographic and genetic distances between Las. neglectus colonies but was associated with hotter and dryer climatic conditions and its prevalence in colonies increased with urbanization. Within infected colonies, fungal prevalence varied from 0 to 100 percent within meters and was negatively correlated with impervious ground cover. In a changing world, our findings emphasize the importance of land-use and climatic factors in shaping the distribution and prevalence of fungal parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaboulbenia 3aLasius neglectus 3abiodiversity conservation 3aectoparasites 3afungi 3ainvasive species 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aurbanization 0aBiological invasions 0aDisease 0aLandscape 0aParasites 0aThalli 0aUrbanization1 aColin, Théotime1 aGrangier, Julien1 aWinkler, Fiona1 aHaond, Marjorie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2573-12861 aDumet, Adeline1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2249-10851 aTragust, Simon1 aMondy, Nathalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4479-70531 aKaufmann, Bernard1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9097-34520 tFungal ecology.g2021 June, v. 51 p.101045-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000080x1754-50487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2021.1010453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245010000203300001600303500002000319520181700339592002802156650001202184650002002196650002302216650002402239650001002263650002302273650001102296650001902307650002402326650002102350700006102371700005702432773012602489856008002615852000902695655001202704IND60769145420221121032657.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914542DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.138982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoll, Karen D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2893-616110aAlluring restoration strategies to attract seed‐dispersing animals need more rigorous testing  ap. 649-652.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn a recently published paper, Silva et al. conclude that placing fruit feeders (induced seed dispersal) in restored tropical forests serves to enrich the diversity of animal species and seeds in recovering forests and therefore is a cost‐effective tropical forest restoration strategy. We argue that due to poor experimental design and choice of response variables measured, the data presented do not provide rigorous support that induced seed dispersal enhances tropical forest recovery. The authors present data on animal visitation to two fruit feeders in a single 7‐year old restoration site in the Brazilian Atlantic forest over a 2‐year period. Their study has no replication and lacks no‐intervention controls with which to compare the effect of this restoration strategy. These experimental design shortcomings prevent them from demonstrating the efficacy of fruit feeders for attracting animals or enriching vegetation recovery. Like many faunal attraction studies, Silva et al. (2020) do not present any data on seedling recruitment; such data are needed to demonstrate that restoration strategies enhance vegetation recovery. Nor do they provide cost estimates for induced seed dispersal as compared to other empirically supported restoration strategies. Synthesis and applications. Promoting enticing restoration methods to attract animals into a restoration site without rigorous data to support the value added of such strategies for enhancing faunal abundance and forest vegetation recruitment has the potential to misguide the investments of scarce restoration resources. We recommend standards for evaluating novel restoration methods to determine whether they are cost‐effective approaches to include in the diverse toolbox needed to meet ambitious global forest restoration targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aapplied ecology 3acost effectiveness 3aexperimental design 3afauna 3aforest restoration 3afruits 3aseed dispersal 3aspecies recruitment 3atropical forests1 aJoyce, Francis H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6699-18421 aReid, John L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7390-20940 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 59, no. 3 p.649-652dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.138983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01791naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012500152300001800277520067100295592002800966650002400994650001901018650001501037650002301052650001601075650001401091650002001105650002201125650001401147700001701161700002201178700001301200773013301213856007401346852000901420655001201429IND60660895420221123032048.0190827e20150402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066089542DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc00752f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wei10aSynthesis of bradyrhizose, a unique inositol-fused monosaccharide relevant to a Nod-factor independent nitrogen fixation  ap. 6964-6967.  aThe symbiosis of Bradyrhizobium sp.

However, the molecular mechanism regulating PD secretion has not been reported. In our study, we successfully constructed cDNA libraries in ovules between PD secretion and PD withdrawal stages, and identified 2975 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These genes were involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and hormone-related pathways. We especially identified DEGs related to jasmonic acid (JA) metabolism and signal transduction, including Gb_39942 (SDP1), Gb_03931 (OPR2), and Gb_18696 (4CLL4), which were all upregulated at the stage of PD secretion in Ginkgo biloba L. Gb_17431 (TIF3B) and Gb_17432 (TIF9), which encode the negative regulator JAZ protein, were downregulated during this period. We also found that KO1 (Gb_05787 and Gb_38576) and GA20ox1 (Gb_16591), which are related to gibberellin (GA) synthesis, were upregulated, whereas Gb_17754, encoding the GA receptor GID1, was downregulated during PD secretion. From these results, we predicted that JA and GA may play important roles in the regulation of PD secretion in G. biloba ovules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo biloba 3abiosynthesis 3afatty acid metabolism 3afatty acids 3agene expression regulation 3ajasmonic acid 3apollination 3asecondary metabolites 3asecretion 3asexual reproduction 3asignal transduction 0apollination drop 0aGA 0aJA1 aMao, Danyang1 aZhang, Tiantian1 aJiang, Bei1 aLu, Zhaogeng1 aWang, Li0 tBotany.g2021, v. 99, no. 5 p.251-260dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl44657x1916-28047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2020-01133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03883naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100003500187245010300222300001200325506007600337520177000413592002802183506003702211650003402248650002102282650001502303650001202318650001502330650001902345650002502364650002502389650001902414650001302433650001702446650001402463650002202477650001102499650000902510650002302519650001102542650001402553650001102567650001902578650002102597650001702618650001702635650001202652650002402664650001702688651001102705700004302716700003902759700003702798700003102835700002202866700002802888700003002916700003002946773013102976856008103107852000903188655001203197IND60574960520221207110308.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057496052DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-2812doi7 aPMC41310342pmcid7 a250867812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvila Acevedo, José Guillermo10aPhotoprotection of Buddleja cordata extract against UVB-induced skin damage in SKH-1 hairless mice  ap. 281.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in using botanical agents to prevent skin damage resulting from solar UV-irradiation. Buddleja cordata is a plant that is known as “tepozan”. Some people in Mexico use the leaves of this plant to treat tumours, abscesses, sores and burns. The purpose of this study is to investigate the photoprotective properties of Buddleja cordata methanolic extract (BCME) against UVB-induced skin damage in SKH-1 hairless mice at the macroscopic and histological levels. METHODS: BCME was characterised to determine its spectroscopic, chromatographic and antioxidant (DPPH, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) properties. To conduct the photoprotection studies, BCME was applied topically to the skin of SKH-1 mice before acute exposure to UVB for 10 minutes. The murine skin samples were used for macroscopic and histological studies to assess tissue damage. Penetration of active components of BCME into stratum corneum on the dorsal area of mice was investigated in vivo by the tape stripping method. Moreover, genotoxicity of BCME was evaluated in a Vicia faba cell root micronucleus model. RESULTS: BCME displayed absorbance over the entire UVB spectrum, and its principal components included verbascoside and linarin. BCME exhibited antioxidant activity and significantly scavenged hydroxyl radicals. BCME reduced erythema, sunburn cell production, vessel congestion and epidermal thickening of UVB irradiated mouse skin. BCME penetrate the skin of mice. BCME did not exhibit genotoxic activity in the micronucleus test. CONCLUSION: The topical administration of BCME protected against acute UVB-induced damage in mouse SKH-1 skin, and our results suggest that BCME may potentially prevent photodamage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBuddleja cordata 3aVicia faba 3aabscess 3aabsorbance 3aacute exposure 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidant activity 3achromatography 3aerythema 3agenotoxicity 3ahistology 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aleaves 3amice 3amicronucleus tests 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3apeople 3aphotostability 3aradiation injury 3askin lesions 3aspectroscopy 3asunburn 3atopical application 3averbascoside 3aMexico1 aEspinosa González, Adriana Montserrat1 aCampos, Diana Matamoros De Maria y1 aBenitez Flores, José del Carmen1 aDelgado, Tzasna Hernández1 aMaya, Saul Flores1 aContreras, Jorge Campos1 aLópez, José Luis Muñoz1 aGarcía Bores, Ana María0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.281-281dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245012500157520229200282592002802574650003302602650001702635650001602652650001402668650002702682650001302709650002702722650002002749650003102769650002502800650001402825650002302839650001002862650001602872650001702888650002202905700001902927700001402946700001802960700001602978700001802994700001603012700001403028773012003042856007803162852000903240655001203249IND60757680820221120053635.0211125e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768082DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bo 10aChanges of Metabolites and Gene Expression under Different Feeding Systems Associated with Lipid Metabolism in Lamb Meat  aThe effects of the different feeding systems, graze feeding (GSF), time-limited graze feeding (GF), and stall-feeding (SF)) on the fatty acid content, metabolites, and genes expression of the longissimus dorsi (LD) in Tan lambs were investigated in the present study. Thirty-nine 4-month-old male Tan lambs with similar body weight (24.91 ± 1.74 kg) were selected and divided into the three feeding systems (n = 13) randomly. Lambs were slaughtered after 83 days of the feeding trails, and LD muscle samples were collected for further analysis. The results indicated that different feeding systems have no significant effect on short-chain fatty acids in Tan lambs (p > 0.05). However, the total saturated fatty acids (∑SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (∑MUFA) in the GSF and GF groups were lower than those in the SF group (p < 0.001). The total polyunsaturated fatty acids (∑PUFA) in the GSF group were higher than those in the GF and SF groups (p < 0.001). Moreover, in the comparison of both GF vs GSF groups and SF vs GSF groups, metabolomic analysis showed that metabolites such as cis-(6,9,12)-linolenic acid, arachidic acid, acetylcarnitine, and L-carnitine with lower concentration were significantly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathway (p < 0.05), but metabolites such as phosphorylcholine, glycerophosphocholine, cytidine 5’-diphosphocholine, and glycerol-3-phosphate with higher concentrations were enriched in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis of the results indicated that in the comparison of the GSF group with the SF group, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) such as LIPC, ERFE, FABP3, PLA2R1, LDLR, and SLC10A6, were enriched in the steroid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism pathways. In addition, differential metabolites and genes showed a significant correlation with the content of ∑SFA, ∑MUFA, and ∑PUFA in lamb meat (p < 0.05). These findings demonstrated that the feeding system was an important factor in regulating fatty acid content by affecting lipid-metabolism-related metabolites and gene expression in muscle, and graze-feeding system provided lamb meat with higher ∑PUFA content than time-limited-grazing and stall-feeding systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3abiosynthesis 3abody weight 3acarnitine 3acholesterol metabolism 3acytidine 3afatty acid composition 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglycerophospholipids 3alamb meat 3alongissimus muscle 3amales 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aphosphorylcholine1 aZhao, Xingang 1 aLi, Zhen 1 aLuo, Hailing 1 aZhang, Hao 1 aGuo, Yanping 1 aZhang, Can 1 aMa, Qing 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 28, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101126123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015500168300001600323520136400339592002801703650002501731650002501756650005301781650002001834650002901854650002301883650001801906650001601924650001801940650002801958650001501986700002202001700001802023700002402041773011402065856008402179852000902263655001202272IND60113122020221121234257.0141111e20131018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosheen, Asia10aFast comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography method for fatty acid methyl ester separation and quantification using dual ionic liquid columns  ap. 118-123.  aSafflower oil is a complex mixture of C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids amongst other fatty acids, and achieving separation between these similar structure components using one dimensional gas chromatography (GC) may be difficult. This investigation aims to obtain improved separation of fatty acid methyl esters in safflower oil, and their quantification using comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC×GC). Here, GC×GC separation is accomplished by the coupling of two ionic liquid (IL) column phases: the combination of SLB-IL111 with IL59 column phases was finally selected since it provided excellent separation of a FAME standard mixture, as well as fatty acids in safflower and linseed oil, compared to other tested column sets. Safflower oil FAME were well separated in a short run of 16min. FAME validation was demonstrated by method reproducibility, linearity over a range up to 500mgL⁻¹, and limits of detection which ranged from 1.9mgL⁻¹ to 5.2mgL⁻¹ at a split ratio of 20:1. Quantification was carried out using two dilution levels of 200-fold for major components and 20-fold for trace components. The fatty acids C15:0 and C17:0 were not reported previously in safflower oil. The SLB-IL111/IL59 column set proved to be an effective and novel configuration for separation and quantification of vegetable and animal oil fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aanimal fats and oils 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adetection limit 3afatty acid methyl esters 3agas chromatography 3aionic liquids 3alinseed oil 3asafflower oil 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3avegetables1 aMitrevski, Blagoj1 aBano, Asghari1 aMarriott, Philip J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Oct. 18, v. 1312 p.118-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007100177520239200248592002802640650001402668650001302682650002002695650001302715650001702728650001802745650001002763650001202773650002402785650001102809650001402820650001202834650001302846650001402859650001402873650000902887650001102896650001302907650001602920650001602936653001602952653001102968653002002979653001302999653001203012653002303024700002403047773011103071856008603182852000903268655001203277IND60720942620221116142943.0220606e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072094262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1099772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Mohammad Rizwan10aShrimp as a substantial source of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines  aIn the present work, fifteen mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclicamines (HAs)were studied in cooked Caridean shrimp (pink) and Penaeid shrimp (tiger, white and brown). The cooking methods were used as stir-frying, broiling and steaming under controlled temperature and time, and HAs determination was performed by SPE/UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. HAs 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 2-Amino-1,6-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (DMIP), 1-Methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (Harman) and 9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (Norharman) were identified (0.05–22.48 ng/g) in all stir-fried and broiled shrimp, whereas 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) was only found (0.08–0.35 ng/g) in stir-fried shrimp. HAs 2-Amino-3,7,8-trimethyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (7,8-DiMeIQx) and, α-carbolines 2-Amino-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (AαC) and 2-Amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b]indole (MeAαC), γ-carbolines 3-Amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-Amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) and δ-carbolines 2-Amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-α:3́,2́-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) and 2-Aminodipyrido[1,2-α:3́,2́-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2) were not detected or found below quantification limit. Brown shrimp (stir-fried) appeared to be more contaminated which constitutes total HAs (81.93 ng/g) followed by pink (70.41 ng/g), tiger (53.02 ng/g) and white (33.57 ng/g). Steaming method does not yield any HAs, and the cause might be elucidate that shrimp were not directly in contact with cooking pan or fire which affect the HAs formation. Food precursors (protein, moisture, fat, creatine and glucose) were also measured in raw and cooked shrimp to investigate the influence on HAs formation. Creatine (3.85 mg/g) and glucose (0.43 mg/g) were found at higher concentrations in brown shrimp, generates high amounts of HAs. Our findings have illustrated that the cooking method, shrimp types and precursors are the main contributors to the formation of HAs. The outcomes from this work could be applied to estimate the HAs human intake globally and add to steaming cooking method in such types of food products that diminish the risk of HAs exposure, and thus to get healthier food quality and security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeidae 3abroiling 3acarcinogenicity 3acreatine 3afood quality 3afood research 3afoods 3aglucose 3aheterocyclic amines 3ahumans 3aimidazole 3aindoles 3amutagens 3apyridines 3aquinoline 3arisk 3ashrimp 3asteaming 3astir frying 3atemperature 0aCarcinogens 0aShrimp 0aCooking methods 0aCreatine 0aGlucose 0aSPE/UPLC-ESI-MS/MS1 aĀjama, Mohāmmada,0 tFood research international.g2021 Feb., v. 140 p.109977-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1099773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245013800205300001600343520088200359592002801241650001101269650002301280650001101303650001801314650001201332650001801344650001701362650001401379650001401393650001601407653002601423653001801449653002101467653003901488700001401527700001701541700001601558700001601574700001301590700001901603700001801622700001301640773009001653856008501743852000901828655001201837IND60750140120221122042755.0211009e20211030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075014012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Dandan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6709-587410aHighly dispersed Ni nanocatalysts supported by MOFs derived hierarchical N-doped porous carbon for hydrogenation of dicyclopentadiene  ap. 855-863.  aN-doped carbon possesses the advantages of electronic modification and immobilization of metal nanoparticles. Hence, N-doped carbon-based metal catalysts have received extensive attention. This study prepared uniformly dispersed Ni nanoparticles (24.0 wt%) on porous N-doped carbon, which was fabricated via the high temperature pyrolysis of nitrogen-rich ZnNi MOFs with 1H-1,2,3-triazole as the ligand. The 1H-1,2,3-triazole as a high energy ligand could volatilize violently to form a N-doped macroporous carbon-based structure. Zn acted as a fence and prevented the accumulation of Ni during the pyrolysis of ZnNi MOFs. The synergistic effect from the abundant porous structure together with uniformly dispersed Ni nanoparticles proves the excellent catalytic activity toward the hydrogenation of dicyclopentadiene, showing 100% DCPD conversion and >99% THDCPD selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3ahydrogenation 3aligands 3ananocatalysts 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3asynergism 3atemperature 0aZnNi MOFs derivatives 0aPorous carbon 0aNi nanocatalysts 0aHydrogenation of dicyclopentadiene1 aZhao, Jie1 aTao, Zhiping1 aGao, Hongyi1 aFu, Zhaolin1 aYan, Rui1 aZhu, Zhongpeng1 aShu, Xingtian1 aWang, Ge0 tCarbon.g2021 Oct. 30, v. 184 p.855-863dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012800161300001800289520033800307592002800645650001600673650001700689650001700706650001200723650001200735650001400747650002100761700001900782700001900801700001800820700002000838700002300858773013300881856007401014852000901088655001201097IND60660895720221123004424.0190827e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066089572DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc00764j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuno, Takashi10aIsolation of a 1,4-diketone intermediate in oxidative dimerization of 2-hydroxyanthracene and its conversion to oxahelicene  ap. 4607-4610.  aOxidation of 2-hydroxy-9,10-dialkynylanthracenes resulted in highly regioselective dimerization to furnish metastable dearomatized 1,4-diketones rather than stable aromatic diols.

To achieve further knowledge on the factors influencing the sensory quality and consumers’ preferences and perception, European traditional and modern fresh market tomato varieties were grown and evaluated in France, Italy, and Spain. Different growing conditions were tested in France (soilless vs. soil) and in Spain (open field vs. greenhouse), while in Italy fruits were evaluated at two ripening stages. Fruit quality was assessed by integrating physicochemical analyses, sensory profiles, and consumer tests. In all three countries, overall modern varieties were perceived as having more intense “tomato flavor” and “overall flavor” than traditional ones. In France and Spain, consumers’ preferences were more oriented towards modern varieties than traditional ones. Significant growing condition effects were found on sensory and physicochemical traits, while the effect on consumers’ overall liking was not significant, largely depending on the genotype. A fair agreement between product configurations from descriptive analysis by trained assessors and Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) questions by consumers was observed. Penalty-lift analysis based on CATA allowed identifying positive and negative drivers of liking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflavor 3afresh market 3afruit quality 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3asoil 3atomatoes 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aSpain1 aCammareri, Maria 1 aCottet, Valentine 1 aFontanet, Lilian 1 aJost, Michel 1 aMoneta, Elisabetta 1 aPalombieri, Samuela 1 aPeparaio, Marina 1 aRomero del Castillo, Roser 1 aSaggia Civitelli, Eleonora 1 aSpigno, Patrizia 1 aVitiello, Antonella 1 aNavez, Brigitte 1 aCasals, Joan 1 aCausse, Mathilde 1 aGranell, Antonio 1 aGrandillo, Silvana 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011000175300001600285520142400301592002801725650004401753650001501797650002201812650000901834650002901843650001401872650001601886650001701902650003801919650001601957650002101973650001101994650001402005650002102019650001502040650002602055650001102081650001302092650002102105650001902126650002002145653002702165653001902192653001902211653002202230653001802252700002402270700002302294700002402317773013102341856008702472852000902559655001202568IND60591714420221120103714.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Fawal, Gomaa F.10aHydroxyethyl cellulose hydrogel for wound dressing: Fabrication, characterization and in vitro evaluation  ap. 649-659.  aIn this study, new hydrogel membranes were developed based on hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) supplemented with tungsten oxide for further implementing in wound treatment. HEC hydrogel membranes were fabricated and crosslinked using citric acid (CA). Various tests were carried out including FTIR, XRD, porosity measurements, swelling, mechanical properties, gel fraction, and thermal gravimetric analysis to evaluate the efficiency of the prepared membranes as wound dressing material. In addition, wound healing activity of the examined membranes for human dermal fibroblast cell line was investigated employing in vitro scratching model. Furthermore, the potency of the prepared membranes to suppress wound complications was studied via determination of their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities exploiting MTT, ELISA, and disk agar diffusion methods. The results demonstrated that the HEC hydrogel membranes revealed an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial efficacy. Moreover, HEC improved the safety of tungsten oxide toward normal human cells (white blood cells and dermal fibroblast). Furthermore, HEC membranes loaded with WO3 revealed the highest activities against Salmonella sp. pursued by P. aeruginosa in compared with the negative HEC hydrogel membrane. The current approach corroborated that HEC amended by tungsten oxide could be applied as a promising safe candidate for wound dressing material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSalmonella 3aX-ray diffraction 3aagar 3aantibacterial properties 3acellulose 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibroblasts 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3ain vitro studies 3aleukocytes 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aporosity 3athermogravimetry 3atungsten oxide 3awound treatment 0aHydroxyethyl cellulose 0aTungsten oxide 0aWound dressing 0aAnti-inflammatory 0aAntibacterial1 aAbu-Serie, Marwa M.1 aHassan, Mohamed A.1 aElnouby, Mohamed S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.649-659dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024002800134024001200162040001800174100001900192245011200211300001600323500002000339506017300359520158300532592002802115596015302143650001302296650002202309650001202331650001402343650001202357650001002369650001302379650001102392650001602403650001202419650001302431650001102444650001202455650001702467650001602484650001002500650001602510700006102526700005602587773011102643856011402754856007502868956008502943961001303028852000903041655001203050IND60647119320221214225601.0220805e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064711932DNAL7 a3638222aris7 a10113/64711932hdl7 a10.1002/cche.101502doi8 ans16442  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Soojeong10aSolvent retention capacity application to assess soft wheat flour quality for making white‐salted noodles  ap. 497-507.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gluten development of wheat flour under a limited amount of water is essential for dough sheeting and cutting in preparation of noodle, and for cooking and textural properties of noodles. Soft wheat flour of relatively high gluten strength, low damaged starch content, and low water absorption could be suitable for the requirement. The study was aimed at exploring the potential uses of solvent retention capacity (SRC) test for evaluation of soft wheat flour quality for making white‐salted noodles. FINDINGS: Ten soft wheat varieties exhibited large differences in SRC values. Lactic acid SRC and gluten performance index (GPI) showed significant correlations with weight gain and firmness of the cooked noodles. Among the flour characteristics, GPI appeared to be the best predictor of cooked noodle firmness, with the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.96, p < 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Flour SDS sedimentation volume, lactic acid SRC, and GPI were significantly correlated with weight gain and texture of cooked noodle. Soft wheat flours with GPI >0.60 were found to be suitable for making white‐salted noodles. SIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: Solvent retention capacity analysis could be successfully applied for selecting soft wheat cultivars suitable for white‐salted noodles. For this sample set, among the flour quality parameters, GPI was the most reliable predictor for firmness of cooked noodles and could be effectively used for identification of noodle wheat varieties and grains by wheat breeding programs and noodle manufacturers.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No. PJ012579cCooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Department by the Rural Development Administration, Korea. 3aTriticum 3abreeding programs 3acooking 3acultivars 3acutting 3adough 3afirmness 3agluten 3alactic acid 3anoodles 3asolvents 3astarch 3atexture 3awater uptake 3aweight gain 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aBaik, Byung‐Kee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2475-83481 aKweon, Meera1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3073-68980 tCereal chemistry.g2019 May, v. 96, no. 3 p.497-507dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1935x0009-03527nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64711933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cche.101503Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/363822.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010900168300001600277520123400293592002801527650002301555650005001578650002501628650002901653650001101682650002201693650001801715650001001733651001101743651001001754651001801764653001801782653001601800653002001816653001801836653002001854700002701874773010701901856008502008852000902093655001202102IND60584169820221122031921.0181002e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058416982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonda, Masato10aBiomonitoring of chlorophenols in human urine from several Asian countries, Greece and the United States  ap. 487-493.  aChlorophenols (CPs) are used in the production of pesticides and preservatives. Although human exposure to CPs has been known for years, current exposure levels to these chemicals in Asian countries are not known. In this study, we analyzed concentrations of eight CPs in 300 human urine samples collected from nine countries. Of these CPs, 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol were found at the highest median concentrations (median for all nine countries: 1.78 and 0.34 ng/mL, respectively). Pentachlorophenol was found in 59% of the samples analyzed at a median concentration of 0.07 ng/mL. Urine samples from Japan had the highest concentration of total CPs (median: 16.7 ng/mL) with 2,5-dichlorophenol accounting for 93.1% of the total concentration. The estimated daily intake (DI) for precursors of dichlorophenols varied widely, but several samples showed values higher than the acceptable DI recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These results suggest that CP exposure, especially to dichlorophenols, is prevalent in several countries, particularly in Asia, suggesting a pressing need for further assessment of the global sources and potential health effects of these chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aaverage daily intake 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahumans 3apentachlorophenol 3apreservatives 3aurine 3aGreece 3aJapan 3aUnited States 0aChlorophenols 0aHuman urine 0aAsian countries 0aBiomonitoring 0aDichlorophenols1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Jan., v. 232 p.487-493dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011600176300001600292520119100308592002801499650002301527650001201550650001101562650001501573650002001588650001201608650001101620650001901631650001701650650002401667650000901691650001101700653001201711653001301723653002201736653002001758653003001778653002301808700002401831773010601855856008701961852000902048655001202057IND60536212720221116141737.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053621272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Thomas H.10aProduction of fuel range oxygenates by supercritical hydrothermal liquefaction of lignocellulosic model systems  ap. 206-215.  aLignocellulosic model compounds and aspen wood are processed at supercritical hydrothermal conditions to study and understand feedstock impact on biocrude formation and characteristics. Glucose and xylose demonstrate similar yield of biocrude and biochar, similar biocrude characteristics, and it is hypothesized that reaction mechanisms for the two model compounds are indistinguishable. Glucose and xylose are main sources of substituted cyclopentenones and substantial contributors to oxygenated aromatics mainly in the range of C6–C9 number of carbon atoms, and potential, sustainable biogasoline candidates. Lignin yields predominantly aromatic biocrudes having similar C6–C9 number of carbon atoms. Model mixtures show good predictability in the distribution of substituted cyclopentenones and oxygenated aromatics, but aspen wood-derived biocrude is more aromatic than predicted by model mixtures. The work extends previous work on the understanding of the chemical mechanisms of lignocellulose liquefaction and the biocrude formation. Potential applications for the biocrudes are identified, where significant sustainability issues for the transport sector can be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abiochar 3acarbon 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3aglucose 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aliquefaction 3areaction mechanisms 3awood 3axylose 0aBiofuel 0aBiocrude 0aWood liquefaction 0aModel compounds 0aHydrothermal liquefaction 0aReaction mechanism1 aRosendahl, Lasse A.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Dec., v. 83 p.206-215dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245015000202300001600352520141800368592002801786650004401814650003701858650001101895650001101906650001301917650002101930650001101951650001101962650001601973653003601989653002702025653001602052653002302068653003202091700005402123700001702177700001802194700001302212700001702225700005502242700005702297773009002354856008502444852000902529655001202538IND60750140520221121020806.0211009e20211030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075014052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Ju1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2070-704912aA flexible and free-standing Cl−-doped PPy/rGO film as cathode material for ultrahigh capacity and long-cycling sodium based dual-ion batteries  ap. 836-845.  aSodium based dual-ion batteries (SDIBs) recently garnered considerable interest for stationary energy storage due to their decent energy and power densities with low cost. However, the limiting factors in the application of SDIBs are their unsatisfactory cyclability and capability. Here, a flexible and free-standing Cl⁻-doped PPy/rGO film (Cl-PPy/rGO) was prepared and directly used as cathode electrodes in SDIBs. The Cl-PPy/rGO possesses a robust sandwich structure and consists of 3D rGO conductive network with dispersive Cl-PPy nanoparticles, which can facilitate electron and ion diffusion. Benefiting from the sandwich structure and the π-π interaction between PPy and rGO, the Cl-PPy/rGO shows superior electrochemical performances in SDIBs with sodium metal anode, especially high capacity (422 mAh g⁻¹ at 100 mA g⁻¹) and long-cycling stability (74% of capacity retention at 500 mA g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles), as well as exhibiting remarkable reversible capacity (183.4 mAh g⁻¹ at 100 mA g⁻¹) for SDIBs with hard carbon anode. The ion storage mechanism of Cl-PPy/rGO was revealed by combination studies of cyclic voltammetry, ex-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This study not only provides a simple strategy to fabricate high performance cathode for SDIBs but reveals the ion storage mechanism of redox-active polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3asodium 3avoltammetry 0aSodium based dual-ion batteries 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aPolypyrrole 0aFree-standing film 0aUltrahigh cycling stability1 aZou, Degui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7531-14231 aChe, Zhennan1 aWeng, Junying1 aJi, Ying1 aZhu, Meiling1 aLi, Aixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9271-55371 aZhou, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2181-38040 tCarbon.g2021 Oct. 30, v. 184 p.836-845dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001400150245010900164300001800273520169300291592002801984650001902012650001602031650001602047650001302063650001402076650001602090650001702106650000902123650002402132650001202156650002502168650001202193650001702205651001002222700001802232700001802250700001602268700001702284700001602301700001702317700001602334700001702350773008702367856008602454852000902540655001202549IND4461736820221119143419.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446173682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrera, C.10aOchratoxin A in cocoa and chocolate products from the Italian market: Occurrence and exposure assessment  ap. 1663-1667.  aThree hundred samples of cocoa and chocolate-based products were randomly collected in South, Center and North Italy. One hundred and seventy nine, out of the 300 samples analyzed, were positive for ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination, representing 60% of the purchased products. All 40 cocoa samples showed OTA contamination, while grouping all the chocolate products the positive samples accounted for 53%. The mean OTA concentration levels for cocoa and chocolate products were well below the corresponding Italian legal limits. Teenagersâ male age group resulted as the highest consumers for cocoa powder (2.9Â g per day), while the OTA highest weekly intake was reported for the younger age groups (0.10 and 0.38Â ng/kg bw/week, for infant and children respectively). With respect to chocolate products, the highest daily consumption and the highest intake are reported for children (7.3Â g and 0.57Â ng/kg bw/week, respectively). As far as single chocolate products are concerned, the highest weekly intake is referred to the consumption of Easter chocolate eggs by the infant/children age group (0.10Â ng/kg bw/week). The overall analysis of the exposure assessment suggests that the very low value of body weight for infant and children categories drives the exposure calculations. On the basis of the risk assessment carried out in this study, the exposure to OTA, due to the consumption of cocoa and chocolate products, is to be considered not a major concern. Therefore, the Italian Superior Council of Health considered the data arising from this study, adequate to repeal the existing Italian legal limits and to align national legislation with the EU provisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadolescents 3abody weight 3achildren 3achocolate 3acocoa beans 3acocoa powder 3aeggs 3aexposure assessment 3ainfants 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3aochratoxin A 3aItaly1 aDebegnach, F.1 aDe Santis, B.1 aIafrate, E.1 aPannunzi, E.1 aBerdini, C.1 aPrantera, E.1 aGregori, E.1 aMiraglia, M.0 tFood control.g2011 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.1663-1667dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171300001400300520121100314592002801525650001801553650002501571650001801596650001701614650001701631650001301648650001601661650001401677650002301691650001201714650001901726650002801745650002301773650001301796650001301809650002001822650001401842650002701856653003201883653003101915653002501946700001901971700001701990700002302007700002202030700002202052700001602074700002302090700002102113773012902134856008702263852000902350655001202359IND60591714520221120103706.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrabelsi, Imen10aPhysicochemical, techno-functional, and antioxidant properties of a novel bacterial exopolysaccharide in cooked beef sausage  ap. 11-18.  aThis work investigates the effects of partial replacement of vitamin C (Vit C) with a purified exopolysaccharide (EPS-Ca6) produced by Lactobacillus sp. Ca6, on the antioxidant activities of cooked beef sausages during refrigerated storage. The physicochemical, techno-functional and viscosity properties of EPS-Ca6 were also studied. Functional properties of EPS-Ca6 were determined based on Water Holding Capacity (WHC), Oil Holding Capacity (OHC), emulsification activity, and foaming ability.EPS-Ca6 demonstrated excellent emulsifying and emulsion stabilizing properties. It was able to emulsify several food-grade oils and hydrophobic compounds, particularly corn oil and diesel with emulsification indexes of 90 and 100%, respectively at a concentration of 0.5%. The effect of EPS-Ca6 on oxidative processes in cooked beef sausages during storage up to 12days at 4°C was evaluated. The obtained results showed a high rate (p<0.05) of oxymyoglobin (OxyMb) and low lipid oxidation. Overall, our findings provided evidence that EPS-Ca6 could be used as a natural additive for maintaining storage stability of cooked beef sausages, and could replace synthetic polymer in several industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acold storage 3acooked foods 3acorn oil 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aexopolysaccharides 3afoaming 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustrial applications 3alipid peroxidation 3apolymers 3asausages 3astorage quality 3aviscosity 3awater holding capacity 0aExopolysaccharide (EPS-Ca6) 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aCooked beef sausages1 aKtari, Naourez1 aTriki, Mehdi1 aBkhairia, Intidhar1 aBen Slima, Sirine1 aSassi Aydi, Sameh1 aAydi, Samir1 aAbdeslam, Asehraou1 aBen Salah, Riadh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.11-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245015400215300001600369520157600385592002801961650001301989650002602002650001402028650001902042650001402061650002302075650001802098650001302116651001002129653002102139653001402160653001202174653002402186653001702210700002602227700002602253700001702279700001902296773010702315856008502422852000902507655001202516IND60584169920221122031920.0181002e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058416992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Abhishek1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9531-641910aRealtime chemical characterization of post monsoon organic aerosols in a polluted urban city: Sources, composition, and comparison with other seasons  ap. 310-321.  aReal time chemical characterization of non-refractory submicron aerosols (NR-PM1) was carried out during post monsoon (September–October) via Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) at a polluted urban location of Kanpur, India. Organic aerosol (OA) was found to be the dominant species with 58% contribution to total NR-PM1 mass, followed by sulfate (16%). Overall, OA was highly oxidized (average O/C = 0.66) with the dominance of oxidized OAs (60% of total OA) as revealed by source apportionment. Oxidized nature of OA was also supported by very high OC/EC ratios (average = 8.2) obtained from simultaneous offline filter sampling. High and low OA loading periods have very dramatic effects on OA composition and oxidation. OA O/C ratios during lower OA loading periods were on average 30% higher than the same from high loading periods with significant changes in types and relative contribution from oxidized OAs (OOA). Comparison of OA sources and chemistry among post monsoon and other seasons revealed significant differences. Characteristics of primary OAs remain very similar, but features of OOAs showed substantial changes from one season to another. Winter had lowest OOA contribution to total OA but similar overall O/C ratios as other seasons. This reveals that processing of primary OAs, local atmospheric chemistry, and regional contributions can significantly alter OA characteristics from one season to another. This study provides interesting insights into the seasonal variations of OA sources and evolution in a very polluted and complex environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aevolution 3amonsoon season 3aoxidation 3aseasonal variation 3aspectrometers 3asulfates 3aIndia 0aOrganic aerosols 0aOxidation 0aSources 0aSeasonal variations 0aPost monsoon1 aMandariya, Anil Kumar1 aChakraborti, Ruparati1 aGupta, Tarun1 aTripathi, S.N.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Jan., v. 232 p.310-321dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.09.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245017500180300001600355520091400371592002801285650001401313650001301327650001101340650001301351650001301364650004101377650001101418650003001429700002601459773009601485856008401581852000901665655001201674IND60113122420221121234316.0141111e20131018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwarda, Radosław Łukasz10aTwo-dimensional high-performance thin-layer chromatography of tryptic bovine albumin digest using normal- and reverse-phase systems with silanized silica stationary phase  ap. 152-154.  aAmong many advantages of planar techniques, two-dimensional (2D) separation seems to be the most important for analysis of complex samples.

We use a nonparametric, nonlinear approach to quantify these effects on the Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the Gulf of California. We show that the effect of fishing pressure and environmental variability are comparable. Furthermore, when predicting total catches, the best models account for both drivers. By using empirical dynamic programming with average environmental conditions, we calculated optimal policies to ensure long-term sustainable fisheries. The first policy, the equilibrium maximum sustainable yield, suggests that the fishery could sustain an annual catch of ∼2.16 × 10⁵ tonnes. The second policy with dynamic optimal effort, reveals that the effort from 2 to 4 years ago impacts the current maximum sustainable effort. Consecutive years of high effort require a reduction to let the stock recover. Our work highlights a new framework that embraces the complex processes that drive fisheries population dynamics yet produces simple and robust advice to ensure long-term sustainable fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardinops sagax 3afisheries 3aissues and policy 3apelagic fish 3apopulation dynamics 3aGulf of California1 aEzcurra, Exequiel1 aBrias, Antoine1 aVelarde, Enriqueta1 aDeyle, Ethan1 aCisneros-Montemayor, Andrés M.1 aMunch, Stephan B.1 aSugihara, G.,1 aAburto-Oropeza, Octavio0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 5 p.623-630dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009900164300001600263520100800279592002801287650002201315650001601337650001601353650002201369650001701391650002101408650002101429650003401450650002001484650001601504653001601520653002801536653003101564700001501595700001701610773013101627856008701758852000901845655001201854IND60591714620221120103540.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mei10aEffect of ultrasound pretreatment on enzymolysis and physicochemical properties of corn starch  ap. 848-856.  aIn the paper, the effects of ultrasound on the enzymolysis properties of corn starch were investigated. The results showed that the rate of enzymolysis changed with the change of ultrasonic conditions. Ultrasound pretreatment starches reduced the time in liquefaction process, and resulted in significantly higher DE value in saccharification process. DE value was negatively correlated to PV, BV, SV, To, Tp, ΔHg, DO, DD, N-O'KI, RC, Mw and DP, respectively, and positively correlated to Mw/Mn. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the relative crystallinity was reduced, and the starch exhibited an A-pattern. Scanning electron microscope indicated that the notch and groove appeared on the surfaces of starch granules. The polarized cross of starch becomes smaller or even disappear. It was concluded that enzymolysis efficiency of different ultrasound pretreatment to changes due to its effect not only on the physicochemical properties, but also on the structural characteristics of corn starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acorn starch 3acorrelation 3acrystal structure 3aliquefaction 3amolecular weight 3asaccharification 3ascanning electron microscopes 3astarch granules 3aultrasonics 0aCorn starch 0aUltrasonic pretreatment 0aPhysicochemical properties1 aLi, Junxun1 aZhu, Chuanhe0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.848-856dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009100165300001400256520144300270592002801713650001801741650001601759650001301775650002101788650001301809650001901822653001701841653003501858653001801893653002301911653003301934700001501967700002101982700006702003700002202070700007002092773008802162856008502250852000902335655001202344IND60750140720221121020741.0211030e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075014072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Ming10aMultifunctional epoxy nanocomposites reinforced by two-dimensional materials: A review  ap. 57-81.  aEpoxy resins are thermosetting polymers with an extensive set of applications such as anticorrosive coatings, adhesives, matrices for fibre reinforced composites and elements of electronic systems for automotive, aerospace and construction industries. Τhe use of epoxy resins in many high-performance applications is often restricted by their brittle and flammable nature, the relatively low fracture toughness and poor thermal and electrical properties. Various two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene (Gr), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal dichalcogenides and MXenes, provide vast opportunities to endow multifunctional properties and reinforce epoxy resins for advanced applications. In this review, the current literature status of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with 2D materials has been thoroughly examined. The structures and intrinsic properties of epoxy resins and two-dimensional materials have been briefly summarized. Recent advances in the strategies of incorporating 2D materials into epoxy matrices have also been presented. Most importantly, the mechanical, tribological, thermal, electrical, flame retardant and anticorrosive properties of epoxy nanocomposites reinforced with 2D materials have been reviewed in detail. Finally, the current status of the field along with future perspectives have been discussed with regards to the effectiveness of various 2D nanofillers towards reinforcement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3abrittleness 3aepoxides 3aflame retardants 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 0aEpoxy resins 0aTwo-dimensional (2D) materials 0aGraphene (Gr) 0aBoron nitride (BN) 0aMolybdenum disulphide (MoS2)1 aZhang, Han1 aTzounis, Lazaros1 aSantagiuliana, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5256-23881 aBilotti, Emiliano1 aPapageorgiou, Dimitrios G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5558-50400 tCarbon.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 185 p.57-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024000900148040001800157100001700175245012800192300001600320520096000336592002801296650001001324650001001334650001201344650003001356650003501386650003401421650001001455650002601465650003901491650002101530650002101551650004001572650002201612650006901634650002101703650002601724700001501750700001801765773013101783856008101914852000901995655001202004IND60080814320221120143126.0140811e201409  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008081432DNAL7 a249728382pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1322-62doi7 2aris  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasuhara, A.10aEvidence of PCDD/Fs and PCBs Contamination in Trees Grown in Forests Far from Their Production and Contamination-Free Areas  ap. 365-369.  aPolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in trees grown in pathless forests were analyzed to investigate their dispersal patterns in the atmosphere.

The results of the present study indicate that PCDD/Fs and PCBs are transferred over long distances in the atmosphere and accumulated in the contamination-free areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPinus 3aforests 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3atrees 2aBenzofuransxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aFagusxchemistry 2aPinusxchemistry 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aSpecimen Handling 2aPolychlorinated Dibenzodioxinsxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aTreesxchemistry 2aWastewaterxanalysis.1 aKatami, T.1 aShibamoto, T.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 Sept. , v. 93, no. 3 p.365-369dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1322-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011600166300001600282520122200298592002801520650002501548650001601573650001601589650001601605650002201621650002501643650001101668700001401679773011601693856008101809852000901890655001201899IND60438778120221120164700.0151023e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043877812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-015-4195-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin’an10aComparison of the morphometric dynamics of fast-growing and slow-growing strains of turbot Scophthalmus maximus  ap. 890-894.  aThe dynamics of changes in body shape of fast-growing and slow-growing strains of turbot Scophthalmus maximus, and of the differences in body shape between the two strains, were evaluated from 3 to 27 months of age. The ratios of total length/body length, body width/body length and total length/body width were used as morphometric indices. The two strains exhibited different temporal trends in total length/body length but similar trends in body width/body length and total length/body width. Generally, body width/body length of the two strains increased with time and total length/body width decreased. Thus, the bodies of both fast-growing and slow-growing strains of turbot changed from a narrow to a more rounded shape. However, the ratio total length/body length was generally lower, body width/body length was mostly higher and total length/body width was consistently lower in the fast-growing strain than in the slow-growing strain. Correlation analysis of the three shape ratios with body weight showed that total length/body length and total length/body width were unsuitable, and that width/body length was suitable, for use as a phenotypic marker for selective breeding of turbot for growth in weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScophthalmus maximus 3abody length 3abody weight 3amorphometry 3aselection methods 3aslow-growing strains 3aturbot1 aMa, Aijun0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2015 July, v. 33, no. 4 p.890-894dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4195-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011300168300001600281520172200297592002802019650001402047650001402061650001202075650001102087650001402098650003502112650001602147650001902163650001002182651001202192651001202204651001102216653002002227653002402247653001702271653004002288653001202328653002502340700001802365700002202383700002202405700001902427700001602446700001902462700002302481700002202504700002002526700006002546700002102606700001902627700001902646700002102665700002402686700001902710700002902729773010602758856008702864852000902951655001202960IND60536213120221116141754.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053621312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupi, Carlo10aEvaluating sampling designs and deriving biomass equations for young plantations of poplar and willow clones  ap. 196-205.  aShort-rotation intensive culture (SRIC) for bioenergy production is at its pre-commercial stage in Canada. To be economically viable, these types of plantations need an accurate examination of actual yields, which requires precise and efficient estimation methods (i.e., specific allometric equations and sampling methods). At six SRIC plantations from three Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario and Alberta), 6 willow and 10 poplar clones were sampled and clone allometric equations were developed to estimate plant biomass. A stem selection approach was successfully used to develop plant allometric equations, reducing the number of stems to be measured by up to 81% in coppiced plantations relative to traditional stem equations. Clone-specific equations were more accurate than equations for groups of clones, but the difference in terms of RMSE% was generally small (less than 5%). Using extensive measurements of all the plants inside a plantation and a simulation approach, we also compared five sampling methods (simple random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling, random and systematic cluster sampling) to estimate total biomass inside the plantation. Simple random sampling and stratified random sampling were the most efficient methods (i.e., increased precision for equal sample size) for the estimation of average plant biomass, survival and total plantation biomass. Stratified random sampling (based on the position inside the plantation) made it possible to reduce the sample size as compared to simple random sampling, but only at higher levels of precision (e.g., 25 less plants at 5% precision). Applications of sampling using remote sensing techniques and GIS are briefly discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3aclones 3aequations 3ageographic information systems 3aplantations 3aremote sensing 3astems 3aAlberta 3aOntario 3aQuebec 0aRandom sampling 0aStratified sampling 0aCoppice SRIC 0aClone-specific allometric equations 0aBiomass 0aMulti-stemmed plants1 aLarocque, Guy1 aDesRochers, Annie1 aLabrecque, Michel1 aMosseler, Alex1 aMajor, John1 aBeaulieu, Jean1 aTremblay, Francine1 aGordon, Andrew M.1 aThomas, Barb R.1 aVézina, André,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3601-60311 aBouafif, Hassine1 aCormier, Denis1 aSidders, Derek1 aKrygier, Richard1 aThevathasan, Naresh1 aRiopel, Martin1 aFerland-Raymond, Bastien0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Dec., v. 83 p.196-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003700134024001200171040001800183100001500201245016500216300001600381506017300397520106900570650002701639650004101666650002501707650002001732650001201752650001701764650001501781650001401796650001301810650001501823650000901838650001001847650002301857700001801880700002101898700001901919700002001938773010501958856011402063856008402177956013602261961000902397852000902406655001202415IND60647119520221214225601.0190516e20190509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064711952DNAL7 a10113/64711952hdl7 a3961902aris7 a10.1007/s12230-019-097 12-z2doi8 ans16454  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, W.14aThe Weed Link in Zebra Chip Epidemiology: Suitability of Non-crop Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae to Potato Psyllid and “Candidatus Liberibacter Solanacearum”  ap. 262-271.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPotato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli) is a vector of BCandidatus Liberibacter solanacearum^, the pathogen associated with potato zebra chip disease. While the psyllid apparently colonizes potato from non-crop Solanaceae or Convolvulaceae, the identity of these weed sources is uncertain. We examined susceptibility of ten non-crop species (one Convolvulaceae and nine Solanaceae) to potato psyllid and Liberibacter, with an emphasis on psyllid populations (northwestern and western haplotypes) and plant species that are present in the Pacific Northwest. Psyllids of the western haplotype survived and developed on all plant species, while psyllids of the northwestern haplotype survived on all species except Solanum physalipholium. All species except Lycium barbarum and Convolvulus arvensis were susceptible to Liberibacter. Results of our study provide the most extensive examination of plant suitability to potato psyllid and Liberibacter and will lead to improved capabilities of predicting which potato fields are at risk to arrival of infective psyllids. 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aCandidatus Liberibacter solanacearum 3aConvolvulus arvensis 3aLycium barbarum 3aSolanum 3aepidemiology 3ahaplotypes 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3aprediction 3arisk 3aweeds 3azebra chip disease1 aHorton, David1 aMiliczky, Eugene1 aWohleb, Carrie1 aWaters, Timothy0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2019 May 9, v. 96 p.262-271wJournal:jnl56713x1874-93807nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64711953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-019-097 12-z3Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/2019%20Cooper%20et%20al.%20Am%20J%20Pot%20Res_weed%20link.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012100165300001600286520114000302592002801442650001201470650001401482650001701496650001301513650002501526650001401551650001001565650001801575650001301593650001201606651001001618700001601628700001601644773011601660856008101776852000901857655001201866IND60438778220221120160843.0151023e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043877822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-015-4159-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Yuangao10aIsolation and characterization of halophilic bacteria and archaea from salt ponds in Hangu Saltworks, Tianjin, China  ap. 862-868.  aA total of 26 isolates were obtained from solar salt ponds of different salinities (100, 150, 200, and 250) in Hangu Saltworks Co.

Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that five bacteria genera Halomonas, Salinicoccus, Oceanobacillus, Gracibacillus, and Salimicrobium and one archaea genera Halorubrum were present. The genus Halomonas was predominant with eight strains distributed in a salinity range of 100–200, followed by Halorubrum with six strains in salinity 250. Based on the genus and original sampling salinity, eight bacterial and two archaeal isolates were selected for further morphological, physiological, and biochemical characterization. All of the bacterial strains were moderately halophilic with the optimal salinity for growth being either 50 or 100, while two archaeal strains were extremely halophilic with an optimal growth salinity of 200. Additionally, we put forth strain SM.200-5 as a new candidate Salimicrobium species based on the phylogenic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and its biochemical characteristics when compared with known related species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aHalomonas 3aSalinicoccus 3abacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aponds 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3astrains 3aChina1 aXu, Gaochao1 aSui, Liying0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2015 July, v. 33, no. 4 p.862-868dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4159-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04531naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001400187245017200201300001200373506007600385520232900461592002802790506003702818650003402855650001602889650001502905650002002920650002502940650002602965650001302991650001003004650001803014650001603032650002803048650002403076650001703100650001503117650003203132650001603164650002003180650001203200650001503212650001803227650001703245650001003262650001003272650000903282650001403291650004303305650001203348650004803360650001303408650001903421650000903440650001103449650001203460650001903472650001603491700001703507700001703524700001903541700001603560773013103576856008103707852000903788655001203797IND60574961220221207124550.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057496122DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-2612doi7 aPMC41256972pmcid7 a250558512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Nan10aWeight loss herbal intervention therapy (W-LHIT) a non-appetite suppressing natural product controls weight and lowers cholesterol and glucose levels in a murine model  ap. 261.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in industrialized countries. Obesity increases the risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes. Unfortunately, conventional obesity drug treatment is often associated with adverse effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate a novel natural formula, Weight loss herbal intervention therapy (W-LHIT), developed from traditional Chinese medicine, for weight control in a high-fat-diet (HFD) induced obesity murine model. METHODS: Two sets of experiments were performed. In experiment 1, 14-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were fed with HFD for 21days and then separated into 3 weight-matched groups. One group continued on the HFD as obese-controls. Two groups were switched from HFD to normal fat level diet (NFD) and sham or W-LHIT treated. In experiment 2, 25-week-old obese mice, following 2weeks acclimatization, received either W-LHIT or sham treatment while maintained on HFD. In both sets of experiments, NFD fed, age matched normal weight mice served as normal controls. Body weight and food intake were recorded. Epididymal fat pad weight, serum glucose and cholesterol levels, as well as PPARγ and FABP4 gene expression in epididymal fat tissue were analyzed at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: In experiment 1, W-LHIT treated obese mice lost body weight 12.2 ± 3.8% whereas sham treated mice lost 5.5 ± 2.8% by day 10 after switching from the HFD to the NFD, without reduction of chow consumption. In experiment 2, W-LHIT treated obese mice maintained on the HFD had significantly lower body weight (8 fold less) than the sham treated mice. W-LHIT treatment also reduced epididymal fat pad weight, blood cholesterol and glucose levels versus sham treated mice without reduced chow consumption. In addition, significantly increased PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ) and FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4) gene expression were found in epdidymal fat tissues. Liver and kidney function and hematology testing results of W-LHIT treated mice were within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: W-LHIT significantly and safely reduced body weight, normalized glucose and cholesterol levels in obese mice, without suppression of appetite, and increased adipocyte PPARγ and FABP4 gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aacclimation 3aadipocytes 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal disease models 3aappetite 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3acholesterol 3acoronary artery disease 3adeveloped countries 3adrug therapy 3aepididymis 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3afood intake 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahematology 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypertension 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3aneoplasms 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aplacebos 3arenal function 3arisk 3astroke 3atissues 3aweight control 3aweight loss1 aChung, Danna1 aLiu, Changda1 aLiang, Banghao1 aLi, Xiu-Min0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.261-261dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008700168300001400255520142500269592002801694650001801722650003401740650001301774650002301787650001301810650000701823650001601830650001201846653001201858653001201870653001401882700001301896700001801909700001701927700001601944773012901960856008702089852000902176655001202185IND60591714820221120103622.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xiuting10aDextrin-uricase conjugate: Preparation, characterization, and enzymatic properties  ap. 28-32.  aUricase was conjugated with dextrin to improve its stability. Firstly, dextrin was succinylated into dextrin monosuccinate with the functional group, carboxylic acid, and dextrin monosuccinates with different degree of substitution (DS) were prepared. Secondly, dextrin-uricase conjugate was synthesized by uricase and dextrin monosuccinate, which was verified by size-exclusion chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. Thirdly, it was found that the conjugate degree of the dextrin-uricase conjugate was positively related to the DS of dextrin monosuccinate, but the activity was seriously lost and difficult to recover by α-amylase. When the molar ratio of dextrin monosuccinate (DS=0.283) to uricase was 30:1, the conjugate degree of dextrin-uricase conjugate reached 22.1% and the activity was decreased to 40.4%. After triggered by α-amylase, the activity was recovered to 83.4%. Finally, the enzymatic properties of this dextrin-uricase conjugate were investigated and compared with those of free uricase. The optimal pH and temperature of the dextrin-uricase conjugate was 9.0 and 45°C, respectively, whereas the optimal pH and temperature of free uricase was 8.5 and 45°C, respectively. Furthermore, dextrin-uricase conjugate was more resistant to simulated physiological conditions and trypsin. These results suggested that the stability of uricase could be ameliorated by conjugation with dextrin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3aanion exchange chromatography 3adextrins 3agel chromatography 3amoieties 3apH 3atemperature 3atrypsin 0aDextrin 0aUricase 0aConjugate1 aWang, Yu1 aLiu, Chengmei1 aJin, Zhengyu1 aTian, Yaoqi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.28-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011500162300001600277500002900293520123200322592002801554650001401582650001201596650001401608650001301622650001601635650001101651650001401662650001601676700002101692700001401713700002101727700001701748700001501765773014101780856007901921852000902000655001202009IND60736224120221119133959.0210504s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073622412DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2020-01492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Luoliang10aComparing a suite of surplus-production-based stock status identification approaches and management procedures  ap. 599-611.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aDifferent approaches have been used to identify fishery stock status when only biomass and catch data are available. However, the performance of the approaches may be affected by the uncertainties derived from different sources (e.g., model misspecification, stock productivity changing, observation error). Here, we propose that the observed biomass associated with the highest calculated surplus production can be used as an indicator (Bₕᵢgₕₑₛₜ_S) to identify stock status. We develop a management procedure (MP) atop a widely used method (i.e., Gcontrol) by incorporating Bₕᵢgₕₑₛₜ_S in the harvest control rule. Two simulations are conducted to compare the stock status identification approaches and corresponding MPs. Using Bₕᵢgₕₑₛₜ_S to identify stock status performs better than surplus production modeling approaches in simulated regime shift scenarios. Compared with the old version of Gcontrol, incorporating Bₕᵢgₕₑₛₜ_S or estimated BMSY in the harvest control rule provides more stable and higher yields. This study contributes to the development and evaluation of indicator-based stock status identification approaches and MPs that only require biomass and catch data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadians 3abiomass 3afisheries 3ajournals 3amethodology 3amodels 3asurpluses 3auncertainty1 aHodgdon, Cameron1 aSun, Ming1 aMazur, Mackenzie1 aChen, Xinjun1 aChen, Yong0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 5 p.599-611dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-01493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04590naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006400145245015300209300001600362500002000378520245200398592002802850596005202878596004602930596004702976596008403023596003203107596008003139650002103219650002003240650001503260650001703275650001403292650001203306650003103318650002503349650002603374650002203400650001103422650001503433650001303448650001903461650000903480650001103489650001103500651001303511700006503524700006703589700001803656700006203674700006103736773012603797856008003923852000904003655001204012IND60769146420221121023116.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914642DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.140902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoudreau, Melanie R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6280-559810aUsing habitat suitability and landscape connectivity in the spatial prioritization of public outreach and management during carnivore recolonization  ap. 757-767.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite continued global declines in large carnivore abundance and distribution, some species are recovering. In North America, these recoveries can occur in large areas of suitable habitat in or near areas of human development, increasing the likelihood of human–carnivore conflicts. Understanding the intersection among habitat suitability, connectivity and human–carnivore conflicts can aid in conflict prevention and mitigation. We used GPS collar data from 97 bears and conflict reports collected from 1991 to 2020 to examine black bear Ursus americanus habitat suitability and landscape connectivity in relation to community‐level human–bear conflict occurrences and conflict rates in Missouri, USA. We used conflict–landscape relationships to predict potential community‐level human–bear conflicts given black bear recolonization. Suitable habitat for black bears comprised about 29% of Missouri and was predominantly forest and shrub cover with low habitat fragmentation and human density, and greater spring vegetation productivity. Landscape connectivity was greatest in south‐central Missouri with limited connectivity in northern and eastern portions of the state. Conflict rates were low (61 of 94 communities had 1–2 reported conflicts over 30 years), increased 6.5‐fold from 2000 to 2020, and 75% involved black bear use of anthropogenic food. The presence and rate of conflicts increased with greater amounts of suitable habitat, landscape connectivity and community size, with conflict rate also positively associated with patch density and aggregation and negatively associated with patch area. Of 1,010 communities in Missouri, we identified 99 communities with increased risk of human–bear conflicts based on surrounding landscape characteristics. Synthesis and applications. Our framework integrating landscape attributes and conflict reports can successfully identify communities at greater potential of human–carnivore conflict. In our Missouri case study, we identified 99 out of 1,010 communities which have increased risk of human–bear conflicts, knowledge which will increase the efficiency of education and mitigation rollouts as black bears re‐establish. This framework allows managers to identify communities at greater risk of conflict for many conflict‐prone species and helps prioritize communities for education and conflict mitigation actions, facilitating long‐term coexistence.  aPublisher supplied data  aCFDA15.611cFederal Aid in Wildlife Restoration  aCA76cMissouri Department of Conservation  aCA76BcMissouri Department of Conservation  cMississippi State University Center for Resolving Human‐Wildlife Interactions  cCamp Fire Conservation Fund  cCollege of Environmental Science and Forestry, State University of New York 3aUrsus americanus 3aapplied ecology 3acarnivores 3acase studies 3aeducation 3aforests 3aglobal positioning systems 3ahabitat connectivity 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahuman development 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aoutreach 3aprioritization 3arisk 3ashrubs 3aspring 3aMissouri1 aGantchoff, Mariela G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7098-80721 aRamirez‐Reyes, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7407-071X1 aConlee, Laura1 aBelant, Jerrold L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7021-13381 aIglay, Raymond B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7300-72440 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 59, no. 3 p.757-767dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.140903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200373 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024003800090040001800128100001800146245011500164300001500279520137600294592002801670650002501698650001701723650002001740650002301760650001201783650001101795650002201806650001301828650001301841650001301854650001601867650002201883651001601905700002201921773009901943856008402042852000902126655001202135IND608926520221120100514.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND60892652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2010.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngold, Karin10aHow and why forest managers adapt to socio-economic changes: A case study analysis in Swiss forest enterprises  ap. 97-103.  aForestry is an important source of income for forest owners and those employed in rural areas. In recent years, this sector has had to tackle far-reaching changes taking place in the social, economic and political system. New demands are now being addressed and policies reformulated. As a response to this pressure, new decision-making structures and innovation activities are taking place in the forestry sector. The aim of this paper is to study learning processes on the management level of forest enterprises. We focus on the production of new ecosystem goods and services; a result of such learning and adaptation processes during the last ten years. The main questions we ask are: How did forest enterprises react to the different changes with respect to their products and services? What are the driving forces and causes for learning and adaptation? In order to operationalise this research aim, we conducted a case study analysis among 6 forest owners in Switzerland between 1995 and 2005. We identified the production of new ecosystem goods and services mainly in the category of cultural services. As we expected, the most important impulse for these adaptation activities was the decrease of returns from traditional timber production. However, other explanatory factors such as external contacts and innovation strategies also seemed to play a similar role.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3amanagers 3apolitics 3arural areas 3atimber production 3aSwitzerland1 aZimmermann, Willi0 tForest policy and economics.g2011 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.97-103dElsevier B.V.x1389-93417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2010.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245029900174300001600473520117800489592002801667650001401695650001101709650005301720650000901773650001401782650000901796650002101805650001001826650002201836650000901858650002601867650001201893650002201905700001901927700002201946700002301968700001601991700002002007773009602027856008402123852000902207655001202216IND60113122720221120154443.0141111e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.07.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTranchida, Peter Q.10aAnalysis of the unsaponifiable fraction of lipids belonging to various milk-types by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with dual mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection and with the support of high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry for structural elucidation  ap. 194-201.  aThe present investigation is focused on the use of a comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC×GC) method, with dual mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection (MS/FID), for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the unsaponifiable fraction of milk lipids (cow butter, buffalo, ewe, and goat milks). The structure of many constituents (particularly sterols) was confirmed by using GC–high resolution time-of-flight MS. The GC×GC column set used consisted of a low-polarity first dimension, and a medium-polarity secondary one, both characterized by a high thermal stability. The use of dual detection enabled the attainment of both mass spectral information and relative % FID data. The complexity of the fingerprint, generated by the unsaponifiable fraction, justified the employment of the two-dimensional GC technology. However, it was two other GC×GC characteristics that contributed most to the attainment of promising results, namely sensitivity enhancement and the formation of group-type patterns. Because many milk lipid constituents were not contained in the MS databases employed, exact mass information proved to be valuable for identification purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3abutter 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3acows 3adatabases 3aewes 3aflame ionization 3agoats 3amass spectrometry 3amilk 3aquantitative analysis 3asterols 3athermal stability1 aSalivo, Simona1 aBonaccorsi, Ivana1 aRotondo, Archimede1 aDugo, Paola1 aMondello, Luigi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 1313 p.194-201dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.07.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024001200170040001800182100001600200245005000216300001600266500002000282500000900302506017300311520140500484592002801889650003401917650002501951650001401976650001901990650001502009650001002024650001402034650002302048650002502071650002302096650001202119650001202131650003202143650001402175650002002189650003202209650001902241650002802260650001402288650001902302650001802321650001202339650001402351651001202365651001402377700001902391700001802410700001602428700001902444700001502463700001802478700001802496700002102514700002402535700002102559700002302580700001602603773014402619856011402763856008302877956010902960961001303069852000903082655001203091IND60647119920221214225549.0220819e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064711992DNAL7 a3447282aris7 a10113/64711992hdl7 a10.3198/jpr2017.08.0052crc2doi8 ans16460  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodd, James10aRegistration of ‘HoCP 09‐804’ Sugarcane  ap. 161-169.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  a‘HoCP 09‐804’ (Reg. No. CV‐184, PI 688682) sugarcane (interspecific hybrid of Saccharum spp.) was selected and evaluated by the USDA‐ARS, working cooperatively with the Louisiana State University AgCenter and the American Sugarcane League, Inc. HoCP 09‐804 was selected from a cross between ‘HoCP 02‐625’ and ‘HoCP 01‐523’ made at the USDA‐ARS, Sugarcane Field Station, Canal Point, FL, in 2004 and was released to growers in Louisiana in 2016 because of high cane and sucrose yields. Yields from three crops (plant, first‐, and second‐ratoon) at 12 outfield locations compared well with ‘L 01‐299’, the most widely grown cultivar in Louisiana. The plant‐cane sugar yield (Mg ha⁻¹) of HoCP 09‐804 was significantly greater than L 01‐299. The sucrose content (g kg⁻¹) was second only to ‘HoCP 00‐950’, the standard for high sucrose. HoCP 09‐804 was among the earliest maturing cultivars, ranking second only to HoCP 00‐950, and cold tolerant, similar to ‘HoCP 04‐838’. HoCP 09‐804 is mildly susceptible to smut, leaf scald, and ratoon stunt. HoCP 09‐804 is susceptible to brown rust and mosaic caused by Sorghum mosaic virus. It is moderately susceptible to sugarcane borer. This cultivar's high yield potential, ratooning ability, and cold tolerance make it a useful addition to existing commercial sugarcane cultivars in Louisiana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aDiatraea saccharalis 3aSaccharum 3acold tolerance 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agermplasm evaluation 3agermplasm releases 3agrowers 3ahybrids 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aleaf rust 3apest resistance 3aphysical chromosome mapping 3aplant breeding 3aratoon stunting disease 3aratooning 3ascald diseases 3asmut diseases 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3aFlorida 3aLouisiana1 aDufrene, Edwis1 aPan, Yong-Bao1 aTew, Thomas1 aWhite, William1 aHale, Anna1 aDuet, Michael1 aVerdun, David1 aGrisham, Michael1 aPetrie, I.

Additionally, appearance of undesirable side effects of certain antibiotics and increasing resistance to antibiotics in current clinical use is also a cause for concern. Bacterial cell membranes are a possible target for developing new antibacterial drugs since membrane-based efflux pump systems play an important role in bacterial pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance in bacteria. Hence, the objective of our study was to evaluate bacterial membrane integrity of two species of bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of ethanolic leaf extracts of two plant species Callistemon citrinus and Vernonia adoensis from Zimbabwe. METHODS: Bacterial efflux pump inhibition using both leaf extracts was determined by monitoring the transport of Rhodamine 6 G (R6G) across the cell membrane and IC₅₀ values were obtained. Membrane permeabilizing properties of both extracts were also evaluated using the membrane potential sensitive dye 3’3 dipropylthiadicarbocyanine (diSC3-5). Haemolysis effect of both extracts on sheep erythrocytes was also investigated. RESULTS: Both extracts inhibited bacterial efflux pumps which resulted in the accumulation of R6G inside the cell. The IC₅₀ values for C. citrinus and V.adoensis against S. aureus were 1.44 mg/ml and 1.61 mg/ml, respectively. Both leaf extracts however, showed similar IC₅₀ values of 1.64 mg/ml against P. aeruginosa. Both plant extracts showed some significant effects on permeability of the bacterial membrane when a 24-28% increase of diSC3-5 dye release was observed for S. aureus and 45–53% of dye was released from P. aeruginosa cell membrane after a 60 minute incubation period. In addition, both extracts exhibited haemolytic effects on sheep erythrocytes at concentrations greater than 2.5 mg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: These plant extracts may provide new lead compounds for developing potential efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) or permeabilising agents that could aid the transport of antibacterial agents into bacterial cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCallistemon citrinus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVernonia 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3achemical structure 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3ainfectious diseases 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaf extracts 3amechanism of action 3amembrane potential 3amonitoring 3apathogenicity 3apermeability 3asheep 3atransporters 3aZimbabwe1 aMukanganyama, Stanley0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.278-278dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012000153300001400273500002000287520169800307592002802005596005902033596005902092650002002151650001102171650001302182650001602195650002802211650001202239650001002251650002602261650001002287700005602297700001902353700001602372700002902388773013802417856007402555852000902629655001202638IND60759486220221119215048.0211212e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075948622DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.130762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Na10aFunctional divergence of three glutathione transferases in two biotypes of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae  ap. 79-87.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a significant pest of cereal crops, but molecular factors and mechanisms that underpin its ability to develop differential biotypes on variable host plants are still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the interactions between two plant secondary metabolites (i.e., gramine and gallic acid) and three glutathione S‐transferases (GSTs) of S. avenae. Using artificial diets complemented or not with one of these two plant compounds, we found that gramine had relatively stronger negative effects on fitness of S. avenae biotype 3 (adapted to barley), and gallic acid on that of biotype 4 (adapted to wheat). Gramine significantly induced overexpression of SaveGST1 and SaveGST2 in biotype 4, but not in biotype 3. Gramine also reduced SaveGST3 expression in biotype 4, but not in biotype 3, suggesting biotype‐specific effect of GSTs’ regulation. In the treatments with gallic acid, the overexpression of SaveGST1, but not SaveGST2 or SaveGST3, was significantly induced in both biotypes, suggesting a critical role of SaveGST1 in detoxification of phenolic compounds such as gallic acid. The total constitutive GST activity was much higher in biotype 4 than in biotype 3. Significant increase in GST activity was obtained by the addition of both secondary metabolites in biotype 4, but not in biotype 3, showing significantly higher expression plasticity of GSTs in biotype 4. Thus, both constitutive and induced expression of GSTs could affect the adaptability of S. avenae on plants with variable secondary compounds, and thus contribute to the divergence of biotypes in this aphid species.  aPublisher supplied data  a31572002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31971431cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aSitobion avenae 3abarley 3abiotypes 3agallic acid 3aglutathione transferase 3agramine 3apests 3asecondary metabolites 3awheat1 aLiu, Deguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2216-98301 aZhai, Yingting1 aLi, Xiaosai1 aSimon, Jean‐Christophe0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2022 Jan., v. 170, no. 1 p.79-87dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.130763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245004000171520230400211592002802515650002002543650002102563650001102584650002002595650001402615651001302629653001202642653002002654653001902674653001902693653001302712700002002725700002002745773010302765856008802868852000902956655001202965IND60750141220221121020506.0220124e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075014122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1037912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobert, Boris10aOn the origins of the Iapetus Ocean  aThe Iapetus Ocean opened during the fission of the supercontinent Rodinia, from the breakup of three of its core continental constituents: Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia. The timing of Iapetus opening is still much debated, with estimates ranging from 700 to 550 Ma. Similarly debated is exactly how Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia were positioned relative to each other immediately before their breakup. In this study, we reconsider the timing and framework of Iapetus opening by integrating the fragmentary mid-Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian observational records from these continents. We first demonstrate that paleomagnetic data, despite being both sparse and probably contaminated by some global-scale, non-uniformitarian process in Ediacaran time, support the existence of a wide ocean between these continents by 575 Ma. However, the paleomagnetic data alone are insufficient to allow the formulation of more specific conclusions concerning the timing and paleogeography of Iapetus opening. We therefore conduct an extensive review of the mid-Neoproterozoic to Cambrian geology of eastern Laurentia, western Baltica and western Amazonia which, jointly interpreted with the paleomagnetic constraints, allow us to construct a self-consistent and geodynamically feasible plate tectonic model. In this model, the breakup of Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia was polyphase, involving the spalling of multiple marginal terranes from Laurentia and the successive opening of several oceans, including a composite ‘Iapetus Ocean’. The first phase of continental breakup occurred between eastern Laurentia and western Amazonia at 750–700 Ma, leading to the opening of the Puncoviscana Ocean. This was followed by the opening of the eastern branch of the Iapetus Ocean, between Laurentia and Baltica, at ~590 Ma, which may have been instigated by emplacement of the Central Iapetus Magmatic Province. The western branch of Iapetus subsequently opened at ~550 Ma by the detachment of marginal terranes from eastern Laurentia, following a protracted phase of rifting. We contend that our preferred scenario is the simplest solution given the presently available evidence but throughout this review we underline key outstanding questions and the attendant uncertainties in our preferred model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambrian period 3aEdiacaran period 3amodels 3apalaeogeography 3atectonics 3aAmazonia 0aIapetus 0aPlate tectonics 0aPaleomagnetism 0aNeoproterozoic 0aCambrian1 aDomeier, Mathew1 aJakob, Johannes0 tEarth-science reviews.g2021 Oct., v. 221 p.103791-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1037913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011700178300001800295520121200313592002801525650002401553650002301577650002101600650001501621650001401636650001701650650002801667650001201695650001201707650001901719650002401738650001101762650002101773650001501794650002401809650002201833650001501855653001901870653002601889653002101915700002901936700002201965700003101987700002302018700002102041700002802062700001902090700002302109773013302132856008702265852000902352655001202361IND60591715220221120113752.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.1462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishida, Verônica S.10aImmobilization of Aspergillus awamori β-glucosidase on commercial gelatin: An inexpensive and efficient process  ap. 1206-1213.  aIn this work, a β-glucosidase of Aspergillus awamori with a molecular weight of 180 kDa was produced in solid-state cultures using a mixture of pineapple crown leaves and wheat bran. Maximum production of the enzyme (820 ± 30 U/g substrate) was obtained after 8 days of culture at 28 °C and initial moisture of 80%. The crude enzyme was efficiently immobilized on glutaraldehyde cross-linked commercial gelatin. Immobilization changed the kinetics of the enzyme, whose behavior could no longer be described by a saturation function of the Michaelis-Menten type. Comparative evaluation of the free and immobilized enzyme showed that the immobilized enzyme was more thermostable and less inhibited by glucose than the free form. In consequence of these properties, the immobilized enzyme was able to hydrolyze cellobiose more extensively. In association with Trichoderma reesei cellulase, the free and immobilized β-glucosidase increased the liberation of glucose from cellulose 3- and 5-fold, respectively. Immobilization of the A. awamori β-glucosidase on glutaraldehyde cross-linked commercial gelatin is an efficient and cheap method allowing the reuse of the enzyme by at least 10 times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus awamori 3aTrichoderma reesei 3abeta-glucosidase 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agelatin 3aglucose 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aleaves 3amolecular weight 3apineapples 3asolid state culture 3athermal stability 3awheat bran 0aβ-glucosidase 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aSaccharification1 ade Oliveira, Roselene F.1 aBrugnari, Tatiane1 aCorrea, Rúbia Carvalho G.1 aPeralta, Rosely A.1 aCastoldi, Rafael1 ade Souza, Cristina G.M.1 aBracht, Adelar1 aPeralta, Rosane M.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.1206-1213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009300169520131800262592002801580650002401608650001601632650001601648650001401664650001301678650001301691650001101704650001701715650002501732650001101757650001801768650002101786650001601807650002801823650002401851650001301875650001401888653001901902653003101921653001201952653002401964653001401988653001302002653000802015653000702023653001202030653000802042653000902050653000902059653001002068653000802078653000802086653000902094653002002103653000902123653000902132653001002141653000802151653000902159653000802168653001002176653001402186653001202200700001902212700001502231700001502246700001402261700001602275700001602291700005202307700001402359773011102373856008602484852000902570655001202579IND60720943720221116143028.0220606e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072094372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1099942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Fangping10aEffects of Bacillus megaterium L222 on quality and bacterial diversity of Sichuan paocai  aBacillus sp. was found in the Sichuan paocai, but their possible effects on Sichuan paocai fermentation are still elusive. In this study, the effect of Bacillus megaterium L222 isolated from high-quality homemade Sichuan paocai on the flavor characteristics and bacterial diversity was investigated. Overall, 7 organic acids, 16 free amino acids, and 48 volatile substances were detected in the B. megaterium L222-inoculated paocai (BMP) and spontaneously fermented paocai (SP) within 7 days. The metabolites produced in BMP were significantly different from that in SP, and 13 main flavor-related metabolites were the discriminant markers. The contents of free amino acids in BMP were much higher than that in SP. Compared to the SP group, the BMP group could better maintain the high level of alcohols, which improved the synthesis of esters, and controlled the increase of the content of sulfides. The representative bacteria in BMP were Weissella, Lactococcus, Bacillus, Leuconostoc, and the inoculation of B. megaterium L222 could significantly increase the amount of Weissella and inhibit the growth of opportunistic pathogen and other bacteria during the fermentation process of paocai. This study presents an important basis for the development of B. megaterium L222 as a starter for paocai fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus megaterium 3aLactococcus 3aLeuconostoc 3aWeissella 3aalcohols 3abacteria 3aesters 3afermentation 3afermented vegetables 3aflavor 3afood research 3afree amino acids 3ametabolites 3aorganic acids and salts 3asecondary infection 3asulfides 3asynthesis 0aSichuan paocai 0aFlavor-related metabolites 0aNitrite 0aBacillus megaterium 0aWeissella 0a16S rRNA 0aBMP 0aSP 0aOPLS-DA 0aOAs 0aTOAs 0aFAAs 0aTFAAs 0aVCs 0aLAB 0aHPLC 0aHS-SPME-GC–MS 0aNIST 0aOTUs 0aANOVA 0aPCA 0aPCoA 0aLDA 0aLEfSe 0aTCA cycle 0aPICRUSt1 aYang, Zhenying1 aZhong, Kai1 aHuang, Ji,1 aYu, Zhiyi1 aPeng, Ziyue1 aWu, Yanping1 aBu, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1316-24231 aGao, Hong0 tFood research international.g2021 Feb., v. 140 p.109994-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1099943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013900161300001800300520182100318592002802139650002402167650001502191650002202206650001902228650001502247700001402262773011902276856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60438778820221120134256.0151023e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043877882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-015-4136-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dawei10aEvaluation of wind vectors observed by HY-2A scatterometer using ocean buoy observations, ASCAT measurements, and numerical model data  ap. 1191-1200.  aThe first Chinese microwave ocean environment satellite HY-2A was launched successfully in August, 2011. This study presents a quality assessment of HY-2A scatterometer (HYSCAT) data based on comparison with ocean buoy data, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data, and numerical model data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The in-situ observations include those from buoy arrays operated by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) project. Only buoys located offshore and in deep water were analyzed. The temporal and spatial collocation windows between HYSCAT data and buoy observations were 30 min and 25 km, respectively. The comparisons showed that the wind speeds and directions observed by HYSCAT agree well with the buoy data. The root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of wind speed and direction for the HYSCAT standard wind products are 1.90 m/s and 22.80°, respectively. For the HYSCAT-ASCAT comparison, the temporal and spatial differences were limited to 1 h and 25 km, respectively. This comparison yielded RMSEs of 1.68 m/s for wind speed and 19.1° for wind direction. We also compared HYSCAT winds with reanalysis data from NCEP. The results show that the RMSEs of wind speed and direction are 2.6 m/s and 26°, respectively. The global distribution of wind speed residuals (HYSCAT-NCEP) is also presented here for evaluation of the HYSCAT-retrieved wind field globally. Considering the large temporal and spatial differences of the collocated data, it is concluded that the HYSCAT-retrieved wind speed and direction met the mission requirements, which were 2 m/s and 20° for wind speeds in the range 2–24 m/s. These encouraging assessment results show that the wind data obtained from HYSCAT will be useful for the scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aspatial variation 3awind direction 3awind speed1 aShen, Hui0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2015 Sept., v. 33, no. 5 p.1191-1200dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4136-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245013500208300001600343520150600359592002801865650001601893650001801909650002501927650001901952650001201971650001201983650002301995650001702018650001202035650001702047650002102064650001502085653002102100653002102121653001002142653001902152653001802171653001902189700002302208700001902231700001502250700002002265700001802285773011202303856008202415852000902497655001202506IND60584170320221122231413.0190401e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058417032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.09.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngin, Ayse Basak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1300-464410aN-Methyl-D aspartate receptor-mediated effect on glucose transporter-3 levels of high glucose exposed-SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neurons  ap. 465-471.  aHigh glucose and insulin lead to neuronal insulin resistance. Glucose transport into the neurons is achieved by regulatory induction of surface glucose transporter-3 (GLUT3) instead of the insulin. N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity increases GLUT3 expression. This study explored whether an endogenous NMDA receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid (KynA) affects the neuronal cell viability at high glucose concentrations. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to 150–250 mg/dL glucose and 40 μU/mL insulin. In KynA and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) supplemented cultures, oxidative stress, mitochondrial metabolic activity (MTT), nitric oxide as nitrite+nitrate (NOx) and GLUT3 were determined at the end of 24 and 48-h incubation periods. Viable cells were counted by trypan blue dye. High glucose-exposed SH-SY5Y cells showed two-times more GLUT3 expression at second 24-h period. While GLUT3-stimulated glucose transport and oxidative stress was increased, total mitochondrial metabolic activity was significantly reduced. Insulin supplementation to high glucose decreased NOx synthesis and GLUT3 levels, in contrast oxidative stress increased three-fold. KynA significantly reduced oxidative stress, and increased MTT by regulating NOx production and GLUT3 expression. KynA is a noteworthy compound, as an endogenous, specific NMDA receptor antagonist; it significantly reduces oxidative stress, while increasing cell viability at high glucose and insulin concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aaspartic acid 3abiochemical pathways 3acell viability 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3atoxicology 0aGlucose toxicity 0aOxidative stress 0aGLUT3 0aKynurenic acid 0aSH-SY5Y cells 0aNMDA receptors1 aEngin, Evren Doruk1 aKarakus, Resul1 aAral, Arzu1 aGulbahar, Ozlem1 aEngin, Atilla0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 Nov., v. 109 p.465-471dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.09.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245013800161300001800299520107500317592002801392650001101420650001201431650002301443650001401466700001801480700002301498700001601521773012601537856008201663852000901745655001201754IND60567850620221122181127.0170428e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056785062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b099542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Thi H.10aEffect of Elasticity of the MoS2 Surface on Li Atom Bouncing and Migration: Mechanism from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamic Investigations  ap. 1329-1338.  aBorn–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) has been carried out to investigate the evolution of Li atom trapping on the MoS₂ surface. A single Li atom is fired with an initial kinetic energy level (0.2 or 2.0 eV) and various targeting factors x, which determines the collision angle. After getting trapped, Li is observed to bounce elastically and glide on the MoS₂ surface thanks to the “breathing” vibration of MoS₂. Both firing energy and targeting factor x are shown to have a significant effect on the trapping and gliding processes. It is found that a higher value of targeting factor x (≥0.6) and initial firing energy (2.0 eV) enhances Li migration on the MoS₂ surface. Also, analysis from electronic structure calculations of six representative Li–MoS₂ interacting configurations suggests that there is ionic interaction and partial charge transfer between the absorbed Li atom and MoS₂ monolayer during the bouncing and migration process. The HSE calculations for those structures unveils the metallization of MoS₂ due to Li attachment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3alithium 3amolecular dynamics 3avibration1 aDong, Hieu C.1 aKawazoe, Yoshiyuki1 aLe, Hung M.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 121, no. 2 p.1329-1338dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b099543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002700171245008400198300001600282500001500298520174900313592002802062650001702090650001302107650001202120650001402132650001102146650001002157650002302167650001602190650001102206650001202217650001302229650002902242650001402271650001602285650001702301650001302318650001502331650003002346650003802376650001602414650003102430651001202461651001102473653001102484653001102495700001502506773009602521856005502617852000902672655001202681IND4472226220221119185100.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447222622DNAL7 a213063572pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00790.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadzadeh, Hossein10aBioattenuation in Groundwater Impacted by Landfill Leachate Traced with Î´13C  ap. 880-890.  a2019-12-06  aThe impact on groundwater imparted by the infiltration of high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leachate from capped, unlined landfills can be attenuated by biogeochemical reactions beyond the waste source, although such reactive loss in the aquifer is difficult to distinguish from conservative advective dispersion. Compoundâspecific measurement of Î´13C in carbon species, including CH4, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and the major DOC compounds (acetate, humic acid, and fulvic acid) provides a constraint in this assessment that can assist in exercises of modeling and prediction of leachate transport. The Trail Road municipal landfill near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, hosts an unlined sector which produces a highly enriched leachate (DOC >4500 mg/L) that provides a good site to examine reactive attenuation within the receptor aquifer. Acetate, a sentinel component of leachate DOC (â¼1000 mg C/L), is absent in impacted groundwater. Mass balance calculations together with reaction modeling suggest continued acetate fermentation with calcite control on DIC and Î´13CDIC evolution. In groundwater within 50 m of the landfill, methane concentrations are elevated (â¼10 mg/L), consistent with acetate fermentation, whereas Î´13CCH4 measurements in deeper groundwater range down to â51â° compared with â60â° in the landfill demonstrating oxidative loss. DOC in the deep aquifer is remarkably depleted to values less than â40â° suggesting methanotrophic bacteria selectively consume isotopically light CH4 to fix carbon. Continued reaction of leachate DOC in groundwater is demonstrated by evolution away from conservative mixing lines on diagrams of Î´13C vs. concentrations of DIC and DOC.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aacetates 3acalcite 3alandfills 3amixing 3ahosts 3alandfill leachates 3ahumic acids 3amodels 3amethane 3aaquifers 3adissolved organic carbon 3areceptors 3agroundwater 3afulvic acids 3abacteria 3aprediction 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGroundwater 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 3aOntario 0aCanada 0atrails 0acarbon1 aClark, Ian0 tGround water.g2011 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.880-890dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2010.00790.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007600172300001100248500001100259520108000270592002801350650002301378650005201401650002501453650001301478650001101491650001501502650001301517650001101530650001401541650001701555650001701572650001201589651001001601700001601611700001701627700002301644700006101667773011201728856008301840852000901923655001201932IND60728555120221119160526.0210731e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072855512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12038-021-00145-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Surabhi10aSARS-CoV-2 genomics: An Indian perspective on sequencing viral variants  ap. 22.  aReview  aSince its emergence as a pneumonia-like outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread widely to become a global pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 and since then it has affected more than ten million people and resulted in around 150,000 deaths in the country. Over time, the viral genome has accumulated mutations as it passes through its human hosts, a common evolutionary mechanism found in all microorganisms. This has implications for disease surveillance and management, vaccines and therapeutics, and the emergence of reinfections. Sequencing the viral genome can help monitor these changes and provides an extraordinary opportunity to understand the genetic epidemiology and evolution of the virus as well as tracking its spread in a population. Here we review the past year in the context of the phylogenetic analysis of variants isolated over the course of the pandemic in India and highlight the importance of continued sequencing-based surveillance in the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adisease surveillance 3agenomics 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3apeople 3aphylogeny 3atherapeutics 3aviral genome 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aBanu, Sofia1 aSingh, Priya1 aSowpati, Divya Tej1 aMishra, Rakesh K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6636-73800 tJournal of biosciences.g2021 Dec., v. 46, no. 1 p.22-22dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-021-00145-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013500160300001800295500001400313520111700327592002801444650003501472650001401507650001801521650001201539650001701551650001701568650001701585650002801602650002501630653004201655653001801697700002301715700002101738700001701759700002101776700002001797700001701817773018601834856007302020852000902093655001202102IND60692348120221119174428.0200502e20071123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069234812DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.703042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKAJITANI, Noriko10aMechanism of A23187-Induced Apoptosis in HL-60 Cells: Dependency on Mitochondrial Permeability Transition but Not on NADPH Oxidase  ap. 2701-2711.  aNAL-light  aCalcium ions (Ca²⁺) are involved in a number of physiological cellular functions including apoptosis. An elevation in intracellular levels of Ca²⁺ in A23187-treated HL-60 cells was associated with the generation of both intracellular and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of apoptotic cell death. A23187-induced apoptosis was prevented by cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). The generation of extracellular ROS was suppressed by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium, and by superoxide dismutase, but these agents had no effect on A23187-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the blocking of intracellular ROS by a cell-permeant antioxidant diminished completely the induction of MPT and apoptosis. In isolated mitochondria, the addition of Ca²⁺ induced a typical MPT concomitant with the generation of ROS, which leads to augmentation of intracellular ROS levels. These results indicate that intracellular not extracellular ROS generated by A23187 is associated with the opening of MPT pores that leads to apoptotic cell death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aapoptosis 3abiotechnology 3acalcium 3acyclosporine 3amitochondria 3apermeability 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 0amitochondrial permeability transition 0aNADPH oxidase1 aKOBUCHI, Hirotsugu1 aFUJITA, Hirofumi1 aYANO, Hiromi1 aFUJIWARA, Takuzo1 aYASUDA, Tatsuji1 aUTSUMI, Kozo0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Nov. 23, v. 71, no. 11 p.2701-2711dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.703043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013200157300001800289500001400307520103700321592002801358650001601386650001301402650002301415650001401438650001801452650001601470650003401486650002301520650003001543650001301573650001101586650001901597650002401616653002201640653002001662700001901682700001601701700001801717700001901735700001901754700001701773700001601790700002001806700001801826773018601844856007302030852000902103655001202112IND60692348220221119174519.0200502e20071123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069234822DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.703062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLEE, Yoo-Hyun10aAnti-Histone Acetyltransferase Activity from Allspice Extracts Inhibits Androgen Receptor-Dependent Prostate Cancer Cell Growth  ap. 2712-2719.  aNAL-light  aHistone acetylation depends on the activity of two enzyme families, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and deacetylase (HDAC). In this study, we screened various plant extracts to find potent HAT inhibitors. Hot water extracts of allspice inhibited HAT activity, especially p300 and CBP (40% at 100 μg/ml). The mRNA levels of two androgen receptor (AR) regulated genes, PSA and TSC22, decreased with allspice treatment (100 μg/ml). Importantly, in IP western analysis, AR acetylation was dramatically decreased by allspice treatment. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that the acetylation of histone H3 in the PSA and B2M promoter regions was also repressed. Finally, allspice treatment reduced the growth of human prostate cancer cells, LNCaP (50% growth inhibition at 200 μg/ml). Taken together, our data indicate that the potent HAT inhibitory activity of allspice reduced AR and histone acetylation and led to decreased transcription of AR target genes, resulting in inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aallspice 3aandrogen receptors 3aandrogens 3abiotechnology 3acell growth 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3agrowth retardation 3ahistone acetyltransferase 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aprostatic neoplasms 0aandrogen receptor 0aprostate cancer1 aHONG, Soon Won1 aJUN, Woojin1 aCHO, Hong Yon1 aKIM, Han-Cheon1 aJUNG, Myung Gu1 aWONG, Jiemin1 aKim, Ha-il,1 aKIM, Chang-Hoon1 aYOON, Ho-Geun0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Nov. 23, v. 71, no. 11 p.2712-2719dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.703063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245010300212300001500315506007600330520111300406592002801519506003701547650001401584650001601598650001501614650002301629650002601652650001101678700002101689700002401710700001301734700002301747700003001770700002001800700002401820773008201844856008201926852000902008655001202017IND60092613920221207071937.0141103e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009261392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.0122doi7 aPMC32665452pmcid7 a222654052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnott, Simon R.V.10aForkhead Transcription Factors Establish Origin Timing and Long-Range Clustering in S. cerevisiae  ap. 99-111.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe replication of eukaryotic chromosomes is organized temporally and spatially within the nucleus through epigenetic regulation of replication origin function. The characteristic initiation timing of specific origins is thought to reflect their chromatin environment or sub-nuclear positioning, however the mechanism remains obscure. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Forkhead regulation of origin timing is independent of local levels or changes of transcription. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster origins. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of the epigenetic basis for differential origin regulation and its connection to chromosomal domain organization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3ainterphase 3areplication origin 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts1 aPeace, Jared M.1 aOstrow, A. Zachary1 aGan, Yan1 aRex, Alexandra E.1 aViggiani, Christopher J.1 aTavaré, Simon,1 aAparicio, Oscar M.0 tCell.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 148, no. 1-2 p.99-111dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009400171300001800265520143000283592002801713650001101741650001301752650001601765650002601781650002301807650001201830651001401842653001201856653001301868653001401881653001401895653001501909653002101924700001701945700002001962700001901982700002402001700002002025700001702045700001502062773009902077856008602176852000902262655001202271IND60607574220221122020717.0190319e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060757422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarki, Surendra10aComparison of influenza vaccination coverage between immigrant and Australian-born adults  ap. 6388-6395.  aAustralia has a large immigrant population but there are few data regarding whether influenza vaccine coverage in adults varies according to country of birth. We quantified and compared self-reported influenza vaccination coverage between Australian-born and immigrant residents aged ⩾49years enrolled in a large cohort (the 45 and Up Study), surveyed in 2012 and 2013. Estimated vaccine coverage was adjusted for age, sex and other factors known to be associated with vaccine uptake. Among 76,040 participants included in the analyses (mean age 66.2years), 21.6% were immigrants. In Australian-born adults aged 49–64 and 65+ years the age- and sex-adjusted estimates for influenza vaccination within the year prior to survey was 39.5% (95% CI 38.9–40.0) and 70.9% (70.4–71.5) respectively. The corresponding estimates in immigrants were significantly lower at 34.8% (33.7–35.8) and 64.4% (63.4–65.4) respectively. Among immigrants, coverage varied by region of birth, and was slightly lower among those who spoke a language other than English at home compared to those who only spoke English. Among immigrants there was no significant difference in coverage comparing those who migrated when they were children to those who migrated as adults and coverage did not differ significantly according to years lived in Australia. Programs to increase adult vaccination coverage should consider the needs of immigrants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achildren 3aimmigration 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3asurveys 3aAustralia 0aVaccine 0aCoverage 0aInfluenza 0aAustralia 0aImmigrants 0aCountry of birth1 aDyda, Amalie1 aNewall, Anthony1 aHeywood, Anita1 aMacIntyre, C.

We analyzed Brno considering smart and sustainable city elements, i.e., smart mobility/public transport, smart technology, smart people, smart governance, smart economy, smart living, and smart environment based on transport, energy, and environment referred herein as the smart city and sustainability model. Therefore, we investigated a case study of Brno city in the Czech Republic. We used qualitative techniques such as case study, exploration, observation, and description. We analyzed and comprehended the trends in the various features of smart city and sustainable development of the city of Brno. The findings showed that Brno city is doing its best to maintain smart city models through its governance organs and structures. The city is also working hard to improve some of the aspects that are still lagging. The ongoing developments and the future ones are based on strategic planning for both the short term and long term such as Brno2023, Brno2030, and Brno2050. It was found that Brno has a very well-planned transport system and is integrated with other aspects such as technology, energy, such as the electricity that moves the trolleybuses and trams, and environment. We strongly conclude that even though Brno city still struggles to achieve total sustainability, it is still a model and reflection of a smart and sustainable city. Finally, we noted that Brno city has very good plans and vision the “DNA” of a smart city. However, the implementation still suffers political willingness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agovernance 3aland 3alandscapes 3amodels 3apeople 3apolitics 3apublic transportation 3asustainable development 3aCzech Republic1 aBamwesigye, Dastan 1 aŁukaszkiewicz, Jan 1 aFortuna-Antoszkiewicz, Beata 0 tLand.g2021 Aug. 19, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100808703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010400178300001600282520144100298592002801739650001101767650001601778650001801794650001601812650001601828650001701844650001501861650002801876650002101904650001201925650001401937650001101951650002101962650001901983650001702002650001202019650001102031650001202042650001802054650001802072650001602090650001702106650001102123653001502134653001802149653002102167653002002188653001902208700001802227700004102245700001902286700002702305700003502332773013302367856008302500852000902583655001202592IND60127996720221120173246.0151114e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012799672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-008-9119-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Lenaldo Muniz10aEffect of cytokinins on in vitro development of autotrophism and acclimatization of Annona glabra L  ap. 128-135.  aThe role of cytokinins in the differentiation of the photosynthetic apparatus in micropropagated plants and their effect on the plant's ability to transition from a heterotrophic to an autotrophic condition during acclimatization was investigated. Annona glabra L. shoots were cultured on woody plant medium supplemented with sucrose and different cytokinins to evaluate leaf tissue for chloroplast development, chloroplast numbers, photosynthetic pigmentation, total photosynthetic potential, and soluble sugar content. Plants were transferred to the rooting medium in the presence or absence of sucrose and then acclimatized. Kinetin and benzyladenine (BAP) stimulated chloroplast differentiation. Inclusion of zeatin in the medium induced the formation of greater numbers of chloroplasts in the leaves, while plants cultivated in the presence of only kinetin and BAP demonstrated greater chlorophyll a and carotenoid content. The use of kinetin and BAP during in vitro culture promoted accumulation of dry matter during the acclimatization phase, especially in plants rooted under autotrophic conditions (without sucrose). Kinetin and BAP promoted development of more leaf area and greater plant survival rates in plant acclimatization on both autotrophic and heterotrophic media. The inhibitory effects of thidiazuron on the differentiation of chloroplasts, accumulation of chlorophyll a, and photosynthetic potential were examined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona 3aacclimation 3abenzyladenine 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3acytokinins 3adry matter accumulation 3ain vitro culture 3akinetin 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amicropropagation 3aphotosynthesis 3apigmentation 3arooting 3ashoots 3asucrose 3asugar content 3asurvival rate 3athidiazuron 3awoody plants 3azeatin 0aCytokinins 0aAnnona glabra 0aMicropropagation 0aAcclimatization 0aPhotosynthesis1 aPaiva, Renato1 ade Santana, Joséé Raniere Ferreira1 aAlves, Eduardo1 aNogueira, Rairys Cravo1 aPereira, Fláávia Dioníísio0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2008 Mar., v. 44, no. 2 p.128-135dThe Society for In Vitro Biologyx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11627-008-9119-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011600169300001400285520165400299592002801953650001601981650001201997650002402009650001102033650001302044650002102057650001302078650001402091650004302105650001202148650001402160653000802174653000702182653000702189653000802196653000902204653001102213653000802224653000802232653000702240653001102247653000802258653001102266653001402277653003302291700001502324700002002339700001402359700001502373700001402388700001502402700001402417700001602431700005302447773007202500856008202572852000902654655001202663IND60584393420221120200926.0171024e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058439342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ting-juan10aHigh bone marrow miR-19b level predicts poor prognosis and disease recurrence in de novo acute myeloid leukemia  ap. 79-85.  aOncogenic role of miR-19 family has been identified in human cancers especially in lymphoid malignancies. However, to date, little studies investigated the role of miR-19 family in myeloid malignancies. Herein, we examined miR-19a/b expression and explored its clinical significance in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The detection of miR-19a/b expression was performed by real-time quantitative PCR in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 113 patients and 42 healthy donors. Both miR-19a/b levels were significantly increased in AML patients in contrast to controls. Patients with miR-19a/b overexpression were more frequently occurred in female, and had an older age. Moreover, cases with miR-19a overexpression had a higher frequency of U2AF1, C-KIT and CEBPA mutations, whereas miR-19b overexpressed cases harbored U2AF1 and IDH1/2 mutations. There was no significant association of miR-19a overexpression with complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival (OS) among whole-cohort AML, non-M3 AML, and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). However, although miR-19b overexpression was not correlated with CR rate, patients with miR-19b overexpression presented significantly shorter OS in whole-cohort AML and a trend in non-M3 AML and CN-AML patients. Importantly, our data also showed that miR-19a/b expression level at CR phase was lower than diagnosis time, and was returned to primary level even higher when at relapse phase. Our findings revealed that miR-19a/b overexpression were frequent events in de novo AML patients. Moreover, up-regulation of miR-19b expression was associated with poor prognosis and disease recurrence in AML.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3afemales 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3amutation 3amyeloid leukemia 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arelapse 3aremission 0aAML 0aBM 0aCR 0aFAB 0aHRMA 0aRQ-PCR 0aROC 0aAUC 0aOS 0aCN-AML 0aHCC 0amiR-19 0aPrognosis 0aAcute myeloid leukemia (AML)1 aLin, Jiang1 aZhou, Jing-dong1 aLi, Xi-xi1 aZhang, Wei1 aGuo, Hong1 aXu, Zi-jun1 aYan, Yang1 aMa, Ji-chun1 aQian, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2649-81210 tGene.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 640 p.79-85dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012400166300001800290520186500308592002802173650004702201650001302248650001102261650002302272650001202295650002102307650002602328650002302354650002202377650001502399650002102414650002002435650002002455650001202475651001002487653002602497653002502523653002502548653001002573700002502583700001702608700001802625700001802643700001602661700002502677700001602702773009902718856008602817852000902903655001202912IND60607574320221120171257.0190319e20161111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060757432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Juan10aSeasonal influenza vaccination in China: Landscape of diverse regional reimbursement policy, and budget impact analysis  ap. 5724-5735.  aTo explore the current landscape of seasonal influenza vaccination across China, and estimate the budget of implementing a national “free-at-the-point-of-care” vaccination program for priority populations recommended by the World Health Organization.In 2014 and 2016, we conducted a survey across provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect information on regional reimbursement policies for influenza vaccination, estimated the national uptake using distributed doses of influenza vaccines, and evaluated the budget using population size and vaccine cost obtained from official websites and literatures.Regular reimbursement policies for influenza vaccination are available in 61 mutually exclusive regions, comprising 8 provinces, 45 prefectures, and 8 counties, which were reimbursed by the local Government Financial Department or Basic Social Medical Insurance (BSMI). Finance-reimbursed vaccination was offered mainly for the elderly, and school children for free in Beijing, Dongli district in Tianjin, Karamay, Shenzhen and Xinxiang cities. BSMI-reimbursement policies were limited to specific medical insurance beneficiaries with distinct differences in the reimbursement fractions. The average national vaccination coverage was just 1.5–2.2% between 2004 and 2014. A free national vaccination program for priority populations (n=416million), would cost government US$ 757million (95% CI 726–789) annually (uptake rate=20%).An increasing number of regional governments have begun to pay, partially or fully, for influenza vaccination for selected groups. However, this small-scale policy approach has failed to increase national uptake. A free, nationwide vaccination program would require a substantial annual investment. A cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to identify the most efficient methods to improve coverage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aInternet 3acities 3acost effectiveness 3aelderly 3ahealth insurance 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3alocal government 3apopulation size 3aschool children 3asurveys 3aChina 0aInfluenza vaccination 0aSubsidization policy 0aFinancial management 0aChina1 aAtkins, Katherine E.1 aFeng, Luzhao1 aPang, Mingfan1 aZheng, Yaming1 aLiu, Xinxin1 aCowling, Benjamin J.1 aYu, Hongjie0 tVaccine.g2016 Nov. 11, v. 34, no. 47 p.5724-5735dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245015000157520162400307592002801931650002101959650001201980650001801992650000902010650002102019650001302040650002302053650001102076650000902087650001102096650001102107650001002118651001002128700001802138700001402156700001902170700002102189700002002210773011802230856007602348852000902424655001202433IND60748587520221121030521.0210827e20210819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074858752DNAL7 a10.3390/land100808722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Keyu 10aIntegrating Sponge City Concept and Neural Network into Land Suitability Assessment: Evidence from a Satellite Town of Shenzhen Metropolitan Area  aLand suitability assessment is fundamental in space control planning and land development because of its effects on land use and urban layout. Rainstorms and waterlogging have become one of the most common natural disasters in the coastal areas of China. As a result, the concept of an ecological sponge city was incorporated into the construction of cities in the future. Taking Shenzhen–Shantou special cooperation zone (SSCZ), we constructed a storm flooding model based on the SCS flow generation model and GIS to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of the flooding risk in a rainstorm of 100-year lasting 1 h. Combined with population and economic indicators, a radial basis function (RBF) network was utilized to evaluate the environmental risk, the vulnerability of disaster-bearing bodies, and the rain–flood resilience of sponge cities. The self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) model was used for cluster analysis. Spatial differences were found in the construction suitability of the study area. A suitable construction area (73.59% of the entire area) was located downtown. The construction of the artificial spongy body in the highest vulnerable area (3.25%) needs to be strengthened. The control construction area (3.3%) is located along the banks of the river, with relatively high risk and low resilience of flood control engineering. Ecological construction (19.85%) serves as the sponge body of ecological buffer. The factors of waterlogging, ecology, population, and economy could be integrated comprehensively by applying neural network methods for urban planning and construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aecology 3aflood control 3aland 3aland suitability 3aland use 3ametropolitan areas 3amodels 3arisk 3arivers 3astorms 3atowns 3aChina1 aWang, Zhenyu 1 aSha, Wei 1 aWu, Jiansheng 1 aWang, Hongliang 1 aZhu, Qingliang 0 tLand.g2021 Aug. 19, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100808723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245013400209520129800343592002801641650002601669650001401695650001101709650001701720650002001737650001801757650001601775650001101791653001901802653000901821653001201830653003501842653002501877700002001902700002301922700001801945700002001963700002101983700001902004773012102023856004802144852000902192655001202201IND60795442720221122221131.0221004e202302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079544272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2022.1045622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarretta, Daniella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2124-981210aHydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) agonists induce NET formation and MMP-9 release from bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes  aPeriparturient cows are commonly fed diets supplemented with Niacin (nicotinic acid, NA) because of its anti-lipolytic properties. NA confers its anti-lipolytic effects by activating the hydroxycarboxylic acid 2 receptor (HCA2). HCA2 is also activated by the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and circulating BHB levels are elevated in postpartum dairy cows. The HCA2 receptor is highly expressed in bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and could link metabolic and innate immune responses in cattle. We investigated how HCA2 agonists affected bovine PMN function in vitro. We studied different PMN responses, such as granule release, surface expression of CD11b and CD47, generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and apoptosis. NA, BHB, and 4,4aR,5,5aR-tetrahydro-1H-cyclopropa [4,5] cyclopenta [1,2-c] pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (MK-1903) treatment triggered the release of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), a component of the tertiary granule, from neutrophils. Additionally, all HCA2 agonists induced NETs formation but did not affect surface expression of CD11b and CD47. Finally, none of the HCA2 agonists triggered apoptosis in bovine PMN. This information will give new insights into the potential role of the HCA2 receptor in the bovine innate immune response.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aapoptosis 3acattle 3agelatinase B 3ainnate immunity 3aketone bodies 3aneutrophils 3aniacin 0aNicotinic acid 0aHCA2 0aGPR109A 0aNeutrophil extracellular traps 0aBeta-hydroxybutyrate1 aCreutzburg, Paz1 aBorquez, Katherine1 aQuiroga, John1 aAlarcón, Pablo1 aRivera, Andrés,1 aBurgos, Rafael0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2023 Feb., v. 139 p.104562-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2022.104562  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011700176300001600293520130200309592002801611650002601639650001201665650001301677650002701690650002901717650001901746650001101765650000701776650001901783650001901802650001501821650001601836650002101852650002601873650001501899650001401914653005101928653003501979653001902014653002402033653001602057700002002073773010202093856008502195852000902280655001202289IND60486036020221120041303.0160218e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048603602DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.10885792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSponza, Delia Teresa10aTreatment of olive mill wastewater by photooxidation with ZrO2-doped TiO2 nanocomposite and its reuse capability  ap. 865-879.  aZirconium dioxide (zirconia, ZrO ₂)-doped TiO ₂ (TiO ₂/ZrO ₂) nanocomposite was used for the photocatalytic oxidation of pollutant parameters [COD components (COD ₜₒₜₐₗ, COD dᵢₛₛₒₗᵥₑd and COD ᵢₙₑᵣₜ)], polyphenols (catechol, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid, tyrosol and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) and total polyaromatic amines [aniline, 4-nitroaniline, o-toluidine and o-anisidine] from the olive mill effluent wastewaters at different operational conditions such as at different mass ratios of ZrO ₂ (50, 25, 14, 10 and 5 wt%) in the TiO ₂/ZrO ₂ nanocomposite, at different TiO ₂/ZrO ₂ photocatalyst concentrations (1, 4, 15 and 50 mg/L) and pH values (4.0–7.0–10.0) under 300 W UV irradiations, respectively.

DAPI staining of the treated cells, however, revealed that nuclear DNA was present. Most DNA from the cells subjected to HCT was probably caught in the denatured protein layer during phenol extraction. The efficiency of DNA recovery from proteinase-treated crude extracts from cells subjected to HCT was high. Crude extracts of E. coli K12 cells that had not undergone HCT were intentionally acidified with acetic acid to pH 5.2 to cause acidic coagulation of cytoplasmic proteins. The efficiency of DNA recovery from the acidified extracts was low. These results suggest that in cells subjected to HCT, cytoplasmic pH is reduced to around pH 5.2, and that nuclear DNA becomes entangled in coagulated cytoplasmic proteins. Acidification of the cytoplasm might be the primary mechanism by which HCT inactivates bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aacetic acid 3aacidification 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoagulation 3acytoplasm 3anuclear genome 3apH 3aphenol 0acytoplasmic acidification 0ahigh-pressure carbon dioxide1 aFURUKAWA, Soichi1 aKAWARAI, Taketo1 aWachi, M.q(Masaaki),1 aOGIHARA, Hirokazu1 aYAMASAKI, Makari0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Oct. 23, v. 71, no. 10 p.2522-2526dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.703133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007800167300001400245520131200259592002801571650001001599650002301609650001801632650002301650650001101673650001901684650001801703650001301721650001101734650002301745650001101768650002701779650001401806650000901820650001201829650001101841653002301852653002301875653001801898653001101916653002101927700001701948773013101965856008302096852000902179655001202188IND60127997120221120224617.0151114e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012799712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-008-9123-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanarthanam, B.10aPlantlet regeneration from leaf derived callus of Vanilla planifolia Andr  ap. 84-89.  aVanilla planifolia is a tropical orchid mainly known for the aromatic flavor of its cured pods. Callus cultures were initiated from leaf and nodal explants of V. planifolia. Leaf explants showed better callus initiation than the nodal explants with callus biomass production maximal when cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium containing 4.52 mM 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and 2.22 mM benzyladenine (BAP). Callus transferred to MS basal medium supplemented with 13.32 μμM BAP, and 13.43 μμM naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) showed superior growth response and produced 14.0±±1.0 shoots with an average length of 3.6±±0.1 cm after 40 d. Subsequent transfer of the proliferated shootlets to MS basal medium supplemented with 8.88 μμM BAP and 8.08 μμM NAA produced 12.3±±0.14 plantlets with an average height of 3.6 cm±±0.10 cm. All plantlets produced profuse rooting within 35––40 d after transfer to half-strength MS basal medium supplemented with NAA in combination with indole-3-acetic acid. Rooted plantlets were transferred for hardening, with 80%% of the plantlets becoming successfully established in the field. Potentially, more than 100,000 plantlets could be produced within eight subcultures from callus obtained from leaf explant through the methods described here.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aVanilla planifolia 3abenzyladenine 3abiomass production 3acallus 3acallus culture 3aculture media 3aexplants 3aflavor 3aindole acetic acid 3aleaves 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aplantlets 3apods 3arooting 3ashoots 0aVanilla planifolia 0aShoot regeneration 0aLeaf explants 0aCallus 0aMass propagation1 aSeshadri, S.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2008 Mar., v. 44, no. 2 p.84-89dThe Society for In Vitro Biologyx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11627-008-9123-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03961naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245010900208300001800317500001900335500002000354520229700374592002802671650001402699650000902713650001202722650002202734650001002756650001202766650001202778650001502790650001602805650000902821650001402830650000902844650000702853650000902860650001502869650002102884650001102905650002302916650000902939651001202948700006202960700002203022700005703044700007403101700003003175773012603205856007903331852000903410655001203419IND60714381920221122025818.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071438192DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.154462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOfoedu, Chigozie E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0835-587210aFunctional properties of syrup from malted and unmalted rice of different varieties: A comparative study  ap. 3081-3093.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe continued increase in Nigeria's rice production makes product diversification very fitting, even to underutilized indigenous/local varieties. Further, rice converted to malt can bring about useful products like syrup with enhanced characteristics. In this context, a comparative study involving some functional properties of syrup from malted and unmalted rice of different varieties was carried out. Syrup from either filtered or centrifuged starch hydrolysates of enzyme hydrolyzed rice (malted/unmalted) flours gave rise to filtered unmalted (FUHR), filtered malted (FMHR), centrifuged unmalted (CUHR), and centrifuged malted hydrolyzed rice (CMHR) groups. From these, functional properties, that is, pH, total soluble proteins (TSP), total dissolved solids (TDS), total solids (TS), dextrose equivalent (DE), titratable acidity (TA), apparent brix (°B), specific gravity (SG), syrup yield (SY), and some minerals [calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), and zinc (Zn)] were determined. Results showed syrup from malted with significantly higher (P < 0.05) SY, Brix, pH, SG, TS, TDS, and TSP, but significantly lower (P < 0.05) TA, DE, and mineral contents (Ca, Zn, Fe, and Mg) over the unmalted group. Some significant interactions (P < 0.05) were found, between rice variety, treatment and separation method (TS, TDS, DE, Brix, SY, and Ca), rice variety and treatment (TSP, Zn, Mg, and Fe), as well as rice variety and separation method (TSP, pH). In addition, some positive and negative significant (P < 0.05) correlations between the studied functional properties were found. Overall, malting and processing methods can influence the functional properties of rice syrup—an acceptable specialty ingredient for brewing/beverage production. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Through the application of exogenous enzymes, rice syrup has been successfully produced from locally bred/improved rice varieties commercially available in Nigeria. By comparing some functional properties of syrup from malted and/or unmalted rice, the current research provides useful evidence that locally available rice varieties are potential candidates for product diversification to the food/brewing, pharmaceuticals, and other industries, not only in Nigeria but also in the West Africa subregion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abrix 3acalcium 3acomparative study 3adrugs 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3airon 3amagnesium 3amalt 3apH 3arice 3arice syrup 3aspecific gravity 3astarch 3atitratable acidity 3azinc 3aNigeria1 aOsuji, Chijioke M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2848-97711 aOmeire, Gloria C.1 aOjukwu, Moses1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2244-91351 aOkpala, Charles Odilichukwu R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4475-88871 aKorzeniowska, Małgorzata0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Oct., v. 85, no. 10 p.3081-3093dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.154463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002100167245012400188300001600312520141400328592002801742653001801770653002401788653001801812653001501830653001501845700002701860700002201887700002101909700001901930700001801949773015501967856011502122852000902237655001202246IND60128985320221119160017.0151124e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012898532DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2007)23[299:LEOEGE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLUCIA, ALEJANDRO10aLarvicidal effect of eucalyptus grandis essential oil and turpentine and their major components on aedes aegypti larvae  ap. 299-303.  aIn the search for new alternatives for the control of Aedes aegypti the larvicidal activity of Eucalyptus grandis essential oil and pine resin essential oil (turpentine) and their major components (αα- and ββ-pinene and 1,8-cineole) was determined. Gas chromatography––mass spectroscopy analysis of E. grandis essential oil revealed that its major components are αα-pinene and 1,8-cineole. Similar analysis of turpentine obtained by distillation of the resin pitch of conifers showed that αα- and ββ-pinene are the only major components. Third and early 4th instars of the CIPEIN-susceptible strain of Ae. aegypti were exposed to acetonic solutions of E. grandis essential oil, turpentine, and their major components for 24 h. Turpentine, with an LC₅₀ of 14.7 ppm, was more active than the essential oil of E. grandis (LC₅₀: 32.4 ppm). Larvicidal activity of the essential oil components showed that αα- and ββ-pinene present low LC₅₀ values (15.4 and 12.1 ppm, respectively), whereas pure 1,8-cineole showed an LC₅₀ of 57.2 ppm. These results suggest that αα-pinene in E. grandis and αα- and ββ-pinene in turpentine serve as the principal larvicidal components of both oils. Results obtained on larvicidal effects of essential oil of Eucalyptus grandis and turpentine could be considered a contribution to the search for new biodegradable larvicides of natural origin.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAedes aegypti 0alarvicidal activity 0aessential oil 0aEucalyptus 0aturpentine1 aGONZALEZ AUDINO, PAOLA1 aSECCACINI, EMILIA1 aLICASTRO, SUSANA1 aZERBA, EDUARDO1 aMASUH, HECTOR0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2007 Sept., v. 23, no. 3 p.299-303dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282007%2923%5B299%3ALEOEGE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012300170500002200293520162200315592002801937650002101965650002601986650001002012650001402022650001802036650002902054650001302083650001402096653003602110653001602146653001302162653001002175653000902185700001602194700001902210700001502229700001902244700001702263773008702280856005202367852000902419655001202428IND60795443020221121060702.0221004e20220927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079544302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2022.1026512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Teng-Li10aCharacterization of IncI1/ST71 and IncF18:A−:B1 multidrug-resistance plasmids from an avian Escherichia coli isolate  aPre-press version  aTo characterize IncI1 and IncF18:A−:B1 multidrug-resistance plasmids from an avian Escherichia coli isolate, antibiotic susceptibility testing, conjugation assays, transformation assays, S1-PFGE, and WGS analysis were performed. The 119,457-bp plasmid pEC014–1 with a multidrug-resistance region (MRR) containing four different segments interspersed with six IS26 elements, belonged to incompatibility group I1 and sequence type 71. The 154,516-bp plasmid pEC014–2 with two replicons, typed as FII-18 and FIB-1, carried 14 resistance determinants including blaTEM₋₁b, blaOXA₋₁, oqxAB, dfrA17, aac(6′)-Ib-cr, sul1, sul2, tet(A), floR, catB3, hph(aph(4)-Ia), aacC4(aac(3)-IV), aadA5, arr-3, and a merEDACPTR loci in MRR, and additionally encoded three virulence loci: iroNEDCB, sitABCD, and iucABCD-iutA. Plasmid stability assays showed that pEC014–1 and pEC014–2 were stable in recipient E. coli C600 for at least 15 days of passage. Competition assays were carried out to evaluate the fitness impact of pEC014–2 carriage in vitro, revealing a decrease in host fitness. Growth kinetics showed that the growth rate for pEC014–1 or/and pEC014–2 bearing cells was significantly slower than that of the E. coli C600 host strain in the exponential stage (p < 0.01), with only cells carrying pEC014–1 sustaining rapid growth after 6 h of exponential growth. Our findings highlight the mosaic structures of epidemic plasmid IncI1/ST71 and F18:A−:B1 lineages and contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and dissemination of these multidrug resistance and virulence plasmids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3abirds 3aevolution 3agrowth models 3amultiple drug resistance 3aplasmids 3avirulence 0aExtended-spectrum β-lactamases 0ablaCTX-M-65 0ablaOXA-1 0afosA3 0aTn211 aHe, Dan-Dan1 aLiu, Ying-Ying1 aYu, Li-Jie1 aHu, Gong-Zheng1 aPan, Yu-Shan0 tPlasmid.g2022 Sept. 27,  p.102651-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12341x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2022.102651  aDNAL 7aarticle03941naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245012600210300001600336520176900352592002802121596009602149596007702245596007402322650002502396650002602421650002102447650003102468650001202499650002902511650002302540650001602563650002202579650002902601650002102630650002502651650002002676650001802696650001002714650001702724650001502741650001502756650001502771650001202786650001302798651001102811651001602822653001202838653001702850653001502867653002002882700005902902700002202961700001702983700006503000773013103065856008503196961001303281852000903294655001203303IND60779427620221118031530.0220616e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077942762DNAL7 a10.1094/PBIOMES-05-21-0034-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandel, Shyam L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3726-817X10aComposition of the Microbiomes from Spinach Seeds Infested or Noninfested with Peronospora effusa or Verticillium dahliae  ap. 169-180.  aThe worldwide distribution of plant seeds can disseminate beneficial and plant-pathogenic microorganisms. This phenomenon is of particular concern where seed production is geographically isolated from crop production, as is the case with spinach in the United States. We aimed to characterize the structure and function of spinach seed microbiomes in commercial spinach seed lots originating from Europe and New Zealand. The seed lots we analyzed were infested with Peronospora effusa and Verticillium dahliae, only infested with V. dahliae, or not infested with either of these pathogens. The microbial taxonomic composition and gene function (assessed by gene ontology [GO] terms) of spinach seeds were highly influenced by geographic origin and the status of pathogen infestation. Through taxonomic profiling, we found that potentially plant-beneficial bacterial genera such as Pseudomonas and Pantoea were the most abundant taxa both in infested and noninfested seeds, and Stenotrophomonas was observed in seed lots infested with P. effusa and V. dahliae. Many potential plant pathogens that are not known to be associated with spinach seed were also discovered by metagenomic analysis, including Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Botrytis cinerea, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Fusarium pseudograminearum, Alternaria brassicae, A. solani, Parastagonospora nodorum, and Pyrenophora teres f. teres. Our analysis of the function of prokaryotic genes in de novo assembled metagenomes revealed distinct GO terms associated with the geographic origin of seed lots. This work provides an important first step toward identifying spinach seedborne microorganisms that could be utilized to improve plant health and plant pathogens that could be inadvertently carried to new locations.  aPublisher supplied data  a16SCCMAR0001cUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service  a2016-68004-24931cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)  a2015-51181-24283a2017-51181-26830cUSDA-NIFA Specialty Crop Research 3aAlternaria brassicae 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 3aPantoea 3aParastagonospora nodorum 3aPeronospora effusa 3aPseudomonas 3aPyrenophora teres 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aStenotrophomonas 3aVerticillium dahliae 3acrop production 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3aphytobiome 3aprovenance 3aspinach 3ataxonomy 3aEurope 3aNew Zealand 0aspinach 0ametagenomics 0amicrobiome 0aplant pathology1 aHenry, Peter M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7319-75161 aGoldman, Polly H.1 aMou, Beiquan1 aKlosterman, Steven J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0571-50510 tPhytobiomes journal.g2022 June, v. 6, no. 2 p.169-180dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:26955x2471-29067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PBIOMES-05-21-0034-R3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245010200190300001600292520113200308592002801440653001601468653001701484653001201501653002201513653001901535700002001554700002001574700001901594700001901613773015501632856011501787852000901902655001201911IND60128985620221119155825.0151124e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012898562DNAL7 a10.2987/8756-971X(2007)23[315:DCOHAE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOFFMANN, W.

The effects on droplet-size spectrum (i.e., droplet size) for 3 insecticides (Tempo SC Ultra®®, Anvil 10++10®®, and Aqua-Reslin®®) were also evaluated. Generic solutions were used to simulate the physical properties of the active-ingredient solutions in some tests. Significant differences were observed in the droplet spectrum generated by the different sprayers. The volume median diameter of the equipment tested ranged from 14.9 to 90.5 µµm for the water-based solutions and from 11.7 to 92.4 µµm for the oil-based solutions. The Colt ULV sprayer was the only one tested that complied with label requirements for aerosols, yielding acceptable DV₀.₅ values of 14.9––16.0 µµm with water-based Aqua-Reslin and 14.1 µµm with Anvil 10++10. The information presented will allow equipment operators to make an informed decision when selecting equipment and operational parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAtomization 0adroplet size 0asprayer 0ahand-held sprayer 0avector control1 aWALKER, TODD W.1 aSMITH, VINCE L.1 aMARTIN, DAN E.1 aFRITZ, BRAD K.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2007 Sept., v. 23, no. 3 p.315-320dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F8756-971X%282007%2923%5B315%3ADCOHAE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009600171300001600267520170900283592002801992650003502020650001202055650002402067650001302091650001102104650002602115650002502141650002902166650001702195650000902212650001202221650002502233650001102258650002202269650001802291650002502309650000902334651001102343653001802354653001702372653002602389653002902415653003102444700002302475700001902498773010202517856008502619852000902704655001202713IND60486036320221120031453.0160218e20160402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048603632DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.10904822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTytła, Malwina10aHeavy metals and its chemical speciation in sewage sludge at different stages of processing  ap. 899-908.  aThe analysis of heavy metal concentrations and forms in sewage sludge constitutes an important issue in terms of both health and environmental hazards the metals pose. The total heavy metals concentration enables only the assessment of its contamination. Hence the knowledge of chemical forms is required to determine their environmental mobility and sludge final disposal. Heavy metals speciation was studied by using four-stage sequential extraction BCR (Community Bureau of Reference). This study was aimed at determining the total concentration of selected heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg) and their chemical forms (except for Hg) in sludge collected at different stages of its processing at two municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants in southern Poland. Metals contents in sludge samples were determined by using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). This study shows that Zn and Cu appeared to be the most abundant in sludge, while Cd and Hg were in the lowest concentrations. The sewage sludge revealed the domination of immobile fractions over the mobile ones. The oxidizable and residual forms were dominant for all the heavy metals. There was also a significant difference in metals speciation between sludges of different origin which was probably due to differences in wastewater composition and processes occurring in biological stage of wastewater treatment. The results indicate a negligible capability of metals to migrate from sludge into the environment. Our research revealed a significant impact of thickening, stabilization and hygienization on the distribution of heavy metals in sludge and their mobility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achemical speciation 3achromium 3acopper 3aenvironmental hazards 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental technology 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3amunicipal wastewater 3anickel 3aprocessing stages 3asewage sludge 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 3aPoland 0aSewage sludge 0aheavy metals 0asequential extraction 0asewage sludge processing 0aWastewater Treatment Plant1 aWidziewicz, Kamila1 aZielewicz, Ewa0 tEnvironmental technology.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 37, no. 7 p.899-908dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.10904823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012200159300001200281500002000293520127800313592002801591596005701619596005201676650002601728650002901754650002501783650001501808650001801823650000901841650001001850650002601860651001201886700001801898700001301916700002001929700001901949773012401968856007402092852000902166655001202175IND60787627420221119151158.0220809e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078762742DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1040612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansford, K.

Recently, a number of these specimens have been identified as the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. This species is non‐endemic to the UK and presents a risk to both human and animal health due to its role in the transmission of various tickborne pathogens. Although current climatic conditions in the UK are unlikely to permit the survival of this species outdoors, indoor infestations can occur and this can present a risk of disease transmission within an infested property. This paper documents 40 importation events involving R sanguineus on recently travelled or imported dogs into the UK since 2012. It also provides details of the response following these detections in line with the One Health concept. With the increasing number of dogs travelling or being imported, it is likely that importation and infestation events in the UK will continue and may result in pathogen transmission. It is therefore important to raise awareness of this risk and share lessons learned to improve our prevention and response strategies to this emerging issue.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment for Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)  aD1036cScottish Government and Welsh Government 3aOne Health initiative 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3adisease transmission 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arisk 3aticks 3avector-borne diseases 3aEngland1 aPhipps, L.

The capitulum, which is the main ornamental part of chrysanthemum plants, consists of ligulate marginal ray florets, an attractive corolla (petals), and radially hermaphroditic disc florets, but no stamens. In Asteraceae species, the zygomorphic ray florets evolved from the actinomorphic disc florets. During this process, the zygomorphic ligulate corolla arose and the stamens were aborted. Although molecular genetic research has clarified ray floret development to some extent, the precise molecular mechanism underlying ray floret development in chrysanthemum remained unclear. RESULTS: A CYC2-like gene, Cyc2CL, was cloned from C. morifolium ‘Fenditan’. Subsequent analyses revealed that the alternative splicing of Cyc2CL, which occurred in the flower differentiation stage, resulted in the production of Cyc2CL-1 and Cyc2CL-2 in the apical buds. Prior to this stage, only Cyc2CL-1 was produced in the apical buds. A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of labeled Cyc2CL-1 and Cyc2CL-2 RNA indicated that Cyc2CL-2 was first expressed in the involucre tissue during the final involucre differentiation stage, but was subsequently expressed in the receptacle and floret primordia as the floral bud differentiation stage progressed. Moreover, Cyc2CL-2 was highly expressed in the inflorescence tissue during the corolla formation stage, and the expression remained high until the end of the floral bud differentiation stage. Furthermore, the overexpression of Cyc2CL-1 and Cyc2CL-2 in transgenic Arabidopsis inhibited stamen and petal development. Therefore, both Cyc2CL-1 and Cyc2CL-2 encode candidate regulators of petal development and stamen abortion and are important for the ray floret development in chrysanthemum. CONCLUSION: In this study, we characterized the alternatively spliced transcripts of the CYC2-like gene that differ subtly regarding expression and function. The data presented herein will be useful for clarifying the regulatory mechanisms associated with the CYC2-like gene and may also be important for identifying the key genes and molecular mechanisms controlling the development of ray florets in chrysanthemum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aChrysanthemum morifolium 3aalternative splicing 3acorolla 3adisc florets 3aflowering 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahermaphroditism 3ahybridization 3aray florets1 aSun, Ming1 aPan, Huitang1 aCheng, Tangren1 aWang, Jia1 aZhang, Qixiang0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.105-105dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-02884-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245019300170300001600363520139600379592002801775650002201803650001501825650001601840650000901856650001301865650001501878650001201893650002101905650001701926650000901943650002601952650001901978650001201997650001502009650002002024650001202044653001902056653001902075653000902094653002702103653002102130653002102151700002602172700001802198700001802216700001902234773012502253856008202378852000902460655001202469IND60597091520221121013104.0180624e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059709152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarosio, Federico10aControlling the melt dripping of polyester fabrics by tuning the ionic strength of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane and sodium montmorillonite coatings assembled through Layer by Layer  ap. 142-151.  aThis work deals with the Layer by Layer (LbL) assembly of hybrid organic/inorganic flame retardant coatings made of Octa-ammonium POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) and sodium montmorillonite clay on polyester (PET) fabrics. The effects of ionic strength on the achieved flame retardancy properties were investigated. The coating growth asa function of different ionic strengths was evaluated by infrared spectroscopy. 0.10M NaCl was found able to promote the highest adsorption of each coating species at each deposition step strongly affecting clay stacking as evaluated by X-ray diffraction measurements. The coatings on PET assembled at high ionic strength turned out to be more homogeneous and thicker than the reference one. Thanks to the increased thickness and better surface coverage, the same coatings efficiently suppressed the melt dripping phenomenon and significantly slowed down flame spread rate in horizontal flammability tests with only 2wt% of coating mass added. Furthermore, the same performances were maintained after 1h washing at 70°C. By cone calorimetry, coated fabrics showed a strong reduction in the combustion kinetics by nearly halving the peak of heat release rate. This paper provides an important insight on the viability of tuning deposition of LbL coatings on fabrics employing industrial-like processes by simple modification of ionic strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acalorimetry 3aclay 3acoatings 3acombustion 3afabrics 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aheat 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aionic strength 3amelting 3apolyesters 3asodium chloride 3awashing 0aLayer by Layer 0aIonic strength 0aPOSS 0aSodium montmorillonite 0aPolyester fibers 0aFlame retardancy1 aDi Pierro, Alessandro1 aAlongi, Jenny1 aFina, Alberto1 aSaracco, Guido0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 510 p.142-151dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006300170300001600233520128100249592002801530650001201558650001501570650001201585650001901597650001101616650001601627650001901643650002001662650002501682651001001707653002701717653003701744653002901781653003201810653001801842700001601860700001601876700001701892700001601909700001301925773010401938856008502042852000902127655001202136IND60486036420221120031336.0160218e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048603642DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2015.11189762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Mingliang13aAn improved topographic correction model based on Minnaert  ap. 247-264.  aThe uneven distribution of solar radiation due to topographic relief can significantly change the correlation between reflectance and other features such as biomass in rugged terrain regions. In this article, we use the transfer theory to improve the Minnaert approach. After comparing topographic correction methods for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) imagery acquired from the mountainous region in Beijing, China, we used visual inspection, statistical analysis, and correlation analysis to evaluate the algorithms and performance of the proposed Minnaert-E approach. The results indicate that corrections based on non-Lambertian methods have better performance than those based on the Lambertian assumption. The correction performances can be ranked as the Minnaert-E, followed by the Minnaert and the SCS+C corrections, and, finally, the C-HuangWei correction, which performed the worst. We found that the Minnaert-E approach can effectively weaken the influence of terrain relief on pixels and restore the true reflectance of the pixels in the relief area. Further analysis indicates that the Minnaert-E has a better effect on image processing where the slope gradient is restricted to less than 10° or between 30° and 43°.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asolar radiation 3astatistical analysis 3aChina 0atopographic correction 0anon-Lambertian reflection models 0asky isotropic scattering 0aadjacent terrain reflection 0aLandsat 8 OLI1 aGong, Huili1 aZhao, Wenji1 aChen, Beibei1 aChen, Zheng1 aShi, Min0 tGIScience & Remote Sensing.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 53, no. 2 p.247-264dTaylor & Francisx1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2015.11189763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01979naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007800165520072200243592002800965650002200993650001701015650001701032650002601049650002501075650001101100650001501111650001601126650002201142653004001164653003101204700002001235700001701255700001701272700001901289700002501308700002001333700002001353773009401373856008101467852000901548655001201557IND60725032120221121080053.0210124e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072503212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.12.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadieva, G.F.10aData on the genome analysis of the probiotic strain Bacillus subtilis GM5  aIn the present study, we report data on the draft genome sequence of a lipopeptide producing rhizospheric Bacillus subtilis GM5 isolate.

The heterogeneous nucleation of nano-scale Ca(OH)2 particle on micro-scale spherical ZVI surface was clearly observed by scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The moderate solubility of Ca(OH)2 was demonstrated as the crucial factor in inducing slow nucleation rate and in facilitating the abundant growth of Ca(OH)2 nuclei on mZVI surface. The growth of shell thickness was found to obey the zero order kinetics with the rate constant at about 15nm/h. The Ca(OH)2 shell was demonstrated to be anticorrosive to protect reactive Fe⁰ from oxidation based on standard corrosion test. In addition, the instant aggregation process of mZVI within 120s was slowed down after Ca(OH)2 shell coating. The saturation magnetization of mZVI, measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), was gradually diminished along with the shell formation with a 32% reduction after excluding the Fe⁰ content change effect. This indicated that Ca(OH)2 shell coating can partially eliminated particle-particle or cluster-cluster magnetic attraction force to enhance the dispersion stability and resultantly facilitate the transportation. The dissolution of Ca(OH)2 shell was greatly dependent on the pH value of the background water environment. The pH gradient change resulted from the Ca(OH)2 shell dissolution along mZVI particle transport was illustrated by a conceptual model.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium hydroxide 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3airon 3amagnetism 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3atransportation 0aMicro-sized zero-valent-iron 0aCalcium hydroxide 0aCore-shell structure 0aHeterogeneous nucleation 0aAnti-corrosion 0aAggregation 0aDLVO1 aWang, Xiao-mao1 aLi, Xiao-yan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 510 p.199-206dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.09.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008900165300001100254520135300265592002801618596007701646596008901723650001401812650002101826650002501847650002001872650001401892650002301906650001901929650003301948650001901981650002002000650001202020650001902032650002402051650002402075650002202099650003802121700001802159700001502177700001402192700001802206700001802224700005302242700001302295773012702308856008302435852000902518655001202527IND60728556420221120114857.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072855642DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03233-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Chengjie10aIcariin promotes the repair of PC12 cells by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress  ap. 69.  aBACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is one of the main mechanisms of spinal cord injury (SCI) pathology and can affect the physiological state of neurons. Icariin (ICA), the main pharmacological component of Epimedium, can relieve the symptoms of patients with SCI and has obvious protective effects on neurons through ERS. METHODS: PC12 cells were induced to differentiate into neurons by nerve growth factor and identified by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK8 method, cell viability was detected by SRB assay, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and microstructure of ER was observed by transmission electron microscope. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression of CHOP and Grp78, and qPCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of CHOP and Grp78. RESULTS: The results of CCK8, SRB and flow cytometry showed that ICA could relieve ERS and reduce apoptosis of PC12 cells. The results of transmission microscope showed that ICA could reduce apoptosis of PC12 cells caused by ERS. The results of Western blot and q-PCR showed that ICA could inhibit ERS by down-regulating the expression of CHOP and Grp78. CONCLUSIONS: ICA can inhibit ERS and promote the repair of PC12 cells by down-regulating the expression of CHOP and Grp78. ICA has the potential to promote the recovery of spinal cord injury.  aPublisher supplied data  a81704100,81573997,81973885cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKYCX20_1533c2020 Jiangsu Province Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Project 3aEpimedium 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal injuries 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3aicariin 3amicrostructure 3anerve growth factor 3aphysiological state 3aprotein synthesis 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aYang, Guanglu1 aPan, Yalan1 aWang, Lei1 aTu, Pengcheng1 aZheng, Suyang1 aGuo, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9355-69291 aMa, Yong0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.69-69dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03233-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011100166300001600277500001500293520220100308592002802509650003002537650001402567650001502581650002202596650001302618650002502631650002102656650001302677650002602690650001602716650001902732650001002751653001302761700002102774700001802795700001902813773011602832856008102948852000903029655001203038IND60127997820221122015604.0151024e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012799782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-007-9099-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, M.

This study was performed to explore the frequency and efficiency of introducing multiple genes in soybean by using somatic embryogenesis and microprojectile bombardment transformation. The co-transformation frequency of six selectable marker or reporter genes (GusA, bleomycin resistance, glufosinate resistance, hygromycin resistance, green fluorescent protein, and kanamycin resistance) were followed throughout the T0, T1, and T2 generations. Three bombardment strategies were compared to determine the best method to generate transgenic plants that express the introduced transgenes and have a simple insertion pattern that would facilitate any downstream breeding. The plasmid bombardment treatments were (1) a six-gene-containing plasmid, (2) an equimolar treatment of five individual plasmids that collectively contained the six transgenes of interest (genes of glufosinate and hygromycin resistance were on the same plasmid), and (3) a 1:9 ratio mixture of the five plasmids, in which the plasmid containing the selectable marker used in the regeneration process, hygromycin resistance, was used in ninefold excess to all the other plasmids. Of the six bombardments performed per plasmid treatment, the results of seven independent events for the six-gene plasmid, four events for the 1:9 treatment, and a single regenerated event for the equimolar treatment indicate that containing all the transgenes on one plasmid just had an advantage in terms of frequency of a successful transformation events. Based on Southern analysis, the only events that contained all six transgenes was the one obtained by the equimolar treatment. No event was obtained that expressed all six transgenes, and certain transgenes seem to be non-randomly lost, namely gusA, bleomycin resistance, and glufosinate resistance, regardless of treatment.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the risk factors and their role in the prevalence of swine erysipelas so that one may be able to better prevent and control the swine erysipelas outbreaks in Northeast China. Using spatial clusters, the study area was divided into two parts: South Central Mainland China (hot spots) and Northeast Mainland China (potential outbreak areas). We investigated a total of 31 environmental factors and used the lasso regression and k‐fold cross‐validation methods to determine the main factors involved. Seven risk factors were determined to have a major impact on swine erysipelas. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the contribution of these seven risk factors to the outbreak from 2008 to 2018, in the two research regions. In South Central Mainland China, where swine erysipelas was most prevalent, the extreme maximum temperature [OR = 1.143 (95%CI: 1.032–1.342)], total precipitation [OR = 2.298 (95%CI: 1.410–5.112)] and precipitation ≥0.1 mm [OR = 2.396 (95%CI: 1.329–5.941)] exhibited positive effects. The maximum wind speed [OR = 0.550 (95%CI: 0.303–0.775)] and concentration of O3‐8H‐90 per [OR = 0.876 (95%CI: 0.747–0.980)] exhibited negative effects. Summer was the main season for the erysipelas epidemic in South Central Mainland China. In Northeast China, only the total precipitation [OR = 1.048 (95%CI: 0.900–0.989)] was positively correlated with the prevalence of swine erysipelas, whereas the other factors were not significant. There was no obvious seasonal feature for the epidemic. Through the comparison and analysis of risk factors between the two research regions, more attention should be given to the impacts of high temperature and precipitation on the swine erysipelas epidemic in Northeast China.  aPublisher supplied data  aGA18B203cMajor Program of Applied Technology Research and Development Plan of Heilongjiang Province  a2017YFD0501806cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aerysipelas 3aindustry 3aregression analysis 3aswine erysipelas 3atemperature 3awind speed 3aChina1 aXu, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0682-38551 aOuyang, Maolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0097-08701 aGao, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9190-05621 aGao, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1746-76061 aLi, Sihan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9366-84021 aGao, Hongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3390-22301 aXiao, Jianhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1109-91330 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2021 May, v. 68, no. 3 p.1652-1662dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.138403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04268naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011100156500002000267520220400287592002802491596008202519596005902601650002802660650002102688650002802709650001802737650001002755650001802765650001702783650001002800650000902810650001002819650001602829650001202845650001302857650001802870650001502888650001902903650001902922650001702941650001702958650001202975650003002987650001803017650001003035650001003045650004303055650002103098650001703119650001503136650001703151650001903168650001703187700001503204700002003219700001803239700001603257700005203273700001703325700001703342773012803359856007403487852000903561655001203570IND60749854720221121234005.0210908e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985472DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.138992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Feiyu10aHypoglycemic effects of space‐induced Lactobacillus plantarum SS18‐5 on type 2 diabetes in a rat model  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProbiotics can improve dyslipidemia and promote metabolic control as a therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The hypoglycemic effects of space‐induced Lactobacillus plantarum SS18‐5 on T2DM were explored in 4‐week‐old male Sprague Dawley rats. The normal (N) group was fed a basal diet, while the other groups received a high glucose fat diet. T2DM was established by streptozotocin injection and the T2DM rats were randomly divided into three groups, a diabetic (D) group (T2DM rats treated with saline only), GS18 group (T2DM rats treated with 10⁹ CFU/ml of L. plantarum GS18), and SS18‐5 group (T2DM rats treated with 10⁹ CFU/ml of L. plantarum SS18‐5). After continuous gavage for 6 weeks, blood biochemical indices were measured and livers were collected for histopathological examination. The colon contents were collected for counting of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Lactobacillus sp. The results showed that L. plantarum SS18‐5 effectively controlled the weight of rats, reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin, increased liver glycogen levels, improved abnormal metabolism of blood lipids, enhanced the effect of anti‐lipid peroxidation, alleviated chronic inflammation and fatty liver disease, and regulated the intestinal microbiota by reducing the numbers of E. coli and C. perfringens, and increasing the numbers of Lactobacillus sp. From these results, we conclude that space‐induced L. plantarum SS18‐5 has the potential to improve T2DM by alleviating hypoglycemia and regulating the intestinal microbiota. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: With the exploration of the universe, a large number of studies have observed the changes of microorganisms in space flight, which provided a new method for high‐quality microbial pharmaceuticals in the space environment. In this study, the space environment mutated. Lactobacillus plantarum SS18‐5 can effectively improve the blood glucose of rats with type 2 diabetes, relieve oxidative stress, reduce blood lipid content, enhance immune capacity, and regulate intestinal microflora, which has potential use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBT2017‐004cFullarton Bioengineering Technology (Beijing, China) Co., Ltd.  aKM202010020002cBeijing Municipal Education Commission 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aanimal models 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3acolon 3adiet 3adrugs 3afatty liver 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ahistopathology 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypoglycemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid content 3aliver 3amales 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidation 3aprobiotics 3aspace flight 3astreptozotocin 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Jiyu1 aZhang, Hongxing1 aXie, Yuanhong1 aJin, Junhua1 aLiu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8453-00541 aPang, Xiaona1 aHao, Hongwei0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.e13899-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.138993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166520134900272592002801621650004401649650002901693650002401722650001901746650001201765650001501777650001401792650001901806650001601825650002101841650002101862653003001883653001501913653001101928653003001939653001201969700001801981700006601999700001602065773011802081856008202199852000902281655001202290IND60744785220221121123224.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zhongxian10aInvestigating phosphorus release from lignite-based activated rock phosphate through TG-FTIR analysis  aThe upsurge of phosphorus (P) demands in agriculture and the diminishing high-grade reservoirs of P are a serious challenge in the fertilizer industry. Currently, researchers in the fertilizer industry are exploring the potential of medium-low-grade phosphate rock (PR) resources. This study aims to elucidate the possible activation mechanism of P from a mixture of lignite and low-grade rock-phosphate by assessing the release in various pyrolytic products and calcined solid phosphorus using a thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (TG-FTIR). The results show that a suitable calcination temperature can effectively enhance the release of P from phosphate rock, and TG-FTIR revealed the mechanism that the effect of the calcination temperature has on the release of water-soluble phosphorus from phosphate rock mixed with lignite. Our findings confirm that the thermal treatment of PR + lignite mixture at 150°C (APR150), which is higher than the high pyrolysis temperature of 450–850°C, and the P solubility increased by 50.6% compared to that of non-pyrolytic APR. It is therefore suggested that calcined lignite at 150°C can conceivably be used as an effective substitute for expensive catalysts in the activation of low-grade PR, and thus, the high cost of PR activation can be decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aenvironmental technology 3afertilizer industry 3aheat treatment 3alignite 3aphosphorus 3apyrolysis 3arock phosphate 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3awater solubility 0aLow-grade phosphate rocks 0aHumic acid 0aMixing 0aLow pyrolysis temperature 0aTG-FTIR1 aXiong, Jibing1 aSohail, Muhammad Irfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9687-35671 aYang, Dejun0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101787-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011900173500001900292520185200311592002802163650002702191650001502218650006602233650001502299650003702314650002802351651001902379651001002398653001402408653002202422653001102444700002302455700003102478700002602509700001902535700002102554700002202575773011502597856008402712852000902796655001202805IND60710732220221123042302.0201023e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071073222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2020.1060552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Ramos, Irene10aQuick identification and epidemiological characterization of Francisella tularensis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurrently, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization–Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is being evaluated for its efficacy as a fast bacterial typing tool due to its great speed compared to other molecular methods. In this study, we evaluated MALDI-TOF as a tool for quick identification and typing of Francisella tularensis.This study encompassed 86 strains from two different geographical origins (Spain and the Czech Republic), which were previously characterised by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). The direct colony method was used for microbial identification. High-quality spectra of the 86 strains were obtained and their main spectra profiles (MSPs) were created for epidemiological typing using MALDI-TOF. Based on the MSPs, principal components were generated and a dendrogram was constructed. An in-house MALDI-TOF library entry was created for each group of PFGE and MLVA strains based on their high-quality spectra. Two dendrograms were obtained using these entries and the unique peaks in each entry were searched.All strains were correctly identified to the species level. No clear divisions were found in the 86-strain dendrogram; however, Spanish and Czech strains appeared separately in dendrograms created using MLVA and PFGE entries. Entries from our in-house MALDI-TOF library revealed 2–4 biomarker peaks for the detection of the five PFGE groups and 1–12 biomarker peaks for the detection of the seven MLVA groups. Finally, two and one specific biomarkers were found in the Czech and Spanish strains, respectively.MALDI-TOF can be used to accurately identify F. tularensis strains in less than 15 min. Moreover, data on geographical origin and PFGE and MLVA groups could be obtained in less than one hour after colony growing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrancisella tularensis 3abiomarkers 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aprovenance 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3atandem repeat sequences 3aCzech Republic 3aSpain 0aMALDI-TOF 0aMass spectrometry 0aTyping1 aHernández, Marta,1 aRodríguez-Lázaro, David,1 aGutiérrez, María P.1 aZarzosa, Pilar1 aOrduña, Antonio1 aMarch, Gabriel A.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2020 Oct., v. 177 p.106055-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2020.1060553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012000165300001600285520113300301592002801434650002001462650002301482650002901505650001101534650001301545650002301558650002601581651001201607700001601619700001801635773012901653856008301782852000901865655001201874IND60713608720221120211113.0201023e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071360872DNAL7 a10.1637/0003-0031-184.2.2332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtz, Caleb10aLong-term Macroinvertebrate Assemblages of the West Fork White River, Indiana Improve Following the Clean Water Act  ap. 233-247.  aWe tested macroinvertebrate assemblages collected from 1979–2015 for temporal variation in structure and for impacts of the Clean Water Act of 1974. Collections were at ten sites on the mainstem of the West Fork White River. We used family-level taxonomy for macroinvertebrates that resulted in 77 families and 92,477 individuals. Macroinvertebrate families were further classified by trophic and tolerance traits and tested for temporal variation. We defined river reaches as upstream, urban, and downstream of Muncie, Indiana for analyses. Taxonomic richness increased over the study. A nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis identified high temporal variation as assemblage structure differed among decades. Spatial analyses using NMDS indicated significant differences by river location upstream, urban, and downstream.

Early detection of ASF is challenging because of the wide range of non‐specific clinical signs produced and its relatively low contagiousness. Monitoring pig mortality is a promising approach for early detection of ASF, but such approach has been associated with delay in disease detection in large pig farms. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and suitability of early detection strategies for ASF in large commercial pig farms using mortality monitoring at the pen, room or barn level. The within‐barn spread of the disease was modelled including the non‐homogeneous probabilities of transmission within pens, between pens and between rooms. The performances of early detection surveillance based on mortality thresholds established for different epidemiological units were compared in terms of sensitivity, time to detection and number of false alarms per year. A barn with a capacity of 3,200 pigs divided into 8 rooms with 10 pens each containing 40 pigs per pen was used as an example. Our results show that using room‐ or pen‐based mortality thresholds provided a time to detection of 8 days post‐disease introduction. Similar detection performances could be achieved with barn‐level mortality threshold but at the cost of an increased number of pigs to be tested each year. The different scenarios tested also show that barn characteristics such as baseline mortality rate and pen size had a limited impact on the pen‐level mortality thresholds required for disease early detection. These results offer strong support for using mortality data for early detection of ASF not only in small pig herds but also in large commercial barns. Furthermore, the mortality thresholds defined in this study might be relevant to a wide range of pig production sites.  aPublisher supplied data  cMaple Leaf Foods Inc 3aAfrican swine fever 3abarns 3adisease detection 3adisease transmission 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apork industry 3aswine 3aswine production1 aMeyer, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0105-09261 aHowden, Krista1 aLong, Kathleen1 aPeters, LeeAnn1 aCameron, Angus1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8801-03660 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2021 May, v. 68, no. 3 p.1151-1161dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.137653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003400140245014900174300001800323520185900341592002802200650002002228650001002248650002602258650001002284650001302294650001102307650001102318650001802329650002102347650000902368650001802377650001902395700002002414700003002434700001702464700002002481700001802501773012102519856007402640852000902714655001202723IND60640060420221119172120.0190504e20160104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064006042DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra19793g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, S.

A quality by design approach was used for development and optimization of ANLC. A total of five independent variables were selected, in which three were compositions and two were process variables, while particle size and entrapment efficiency were selected as response variables. The final optimized batch was evaluated by various in vitro characterizations as well as in vivo brain and plasma pharmacokinetic studies. Finally, the ANLC was assessed for efficacy and safety profiling for upto three weeks by a behavior model viz. catalepsy, induced locomotor and paw test in Charles Foster rats. The observed particle size, entrapment efficiency and zeta potential of ANLC was found to be 167.30 ± 7.52 nm, 83.50 ± 2.48% and −4.33 ± 1.27 mV, respectively. Surface characterization studies demonstrated a spherical shape with a smooth surface of ANLC which follows the Korsmeyer–Peppas in vitro release kinetic model (r² = 0.9911, n = 0.53). A brain pharmacokinetic study indicated a significantly higher (p < 0.05) peak drug concentration (Cₘₐₓ: 74.13 ± 6.73 ng mL⁻¹), area under the drug concentration–time curve (AUC₀–₂₄ ₕ: 560.93 ± 27.85 h ng mL⁻¹) and mean residence time (MRT: 7.1 ± 0.13 h) of ANLC compared to ASM in the brain via an intranasal route. The results of behaviour studies of ANLC showed a significant decrease in extra-pyramidal side effects with increasing antipsychotic effect after 1–2 week(s) of treatment. These findings demonstrate that nanostructured lipid carriers could be a new promising drug delivery system for intranasal delivery of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abrain 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3akinetics 3alipids 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3aschizophrenia 3azeta potential1 aDadhania, Parth1 aVuddanda, Parameswara Rao1 aJain, Achint1 aVelaga, Sitaram1 aSingh, Sanjay0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 6, no. 3 p.2032-2045dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra19793g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007200147245009700219520171700316592002802033650001602061650003602077650001202113650001402125650002602139650002902165650001702194650002502211650002402236650001602260653000902276653001002285653002102295653002102316653002002337700006602357700005902423700002802482700007502510700003902585700007502624773011802699856008102817852000902898655001202907IND60744785320221121154640.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Faria, Alvaro José Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2817-590810aElemental analysis of biochar-based fertilizers via portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry  aA complete elemental characterization of biochar samples is needed prior to their use for agronomic and/or environmental purposes. Elemental analyses of biochar are still a challenge mainly due to some difficulties to achieve a total digestion of the samples for clearly identifying and quantifying elements of interest. The hypothesis of this study is that X-ray fluorescence spectrometry will be a useful, fast, and accurate alternative method to obtain the total elemental composition of biochars. Thus, this work aimed to evaluate the performance of pXRF for the determination of P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, Al, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu in 31 biochar-based fertilizers, comparing these results with the standard method of biochar samples digestion (modified dry-ashing method — MDA). Moreover, the biochar samples were also characterized via wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) for comparison with portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry. For all elements and biochar samples, adequate linear regression adjustments between methods were achieved. For the lightest elements (P, Ca, Mg, S, Na, and Al) the concentrations obtained via MDA were higher followed by WDXRF and pXRF. Conversely, for the heaviest elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu), XRF results (pXRF and WDXRF) were higher than MDA. Significant linear regressions between methods were obtained, mainly for plant micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu), suggesting that standard-curves can be obtained in order to develop pXRF applications like a “Biochar Mode” by the manufacturers. Portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry showed encouraging results allowing a rapid and environmentally-friendly characterization of biochar-based fertilizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3abiochar 3adigestion 3aelemental composition 3aenvironmental technology 3afluorescence 3aplant micronutrients 3aregression analysis 3awavelengths 0apXRF 0aWDXRF 0aProximal sensors 0aPyrogenic carbon 0aGreen chemistry1 ado Amaral Leite, Aline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0813-46311 aRufini, Márcia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-57221 aRibeiro, Bruno Teixeira1 aSilva, Sérgio Henrique Godinho1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2750-59761 aGuilherme, Luiz Roberto Guimarães1 aMelo, Leônidas Carrijo Azevedo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4034-42090 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101788-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009800169520113400267592002801401650001601429650001301445650001201458650001801470650000701488653003001495653002801525653002101553653000901574653001601583653001201599700001401611700001901625700006401644773011701708856008601825852000901911655001201920IND60731416420221120214336.0211003e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073141642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1067632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiafeng10aWater-in-water-in-water emulsions formed by cooling mixtures of guar, amylopectin and gelatin  aWater-in-water emulsions were formed by mixing aqueous solutions of the neutral polysaccharides guar and amylopectin. The effect of adding gelatin B on emulsions, both of a dispersed guar rich phase in a continuous amylopectin phase and the inverse, were investigated using confocal scanning laser microscopy as a function of the gelatin concentration between 0.25 and 1.5 wt% and the pH between pH 4 and pH 6. Gelatin was found to phase separate upon cooling below about 25 °C in a narrow pH range around pH 5 both in the pure guar phase and in the pure amylopectin phase forming distinct spherical domains. The phase diagram was established as a function of the gelatin concentration and the pH. In the emulsions, the gelatin phase separated first at the interface between the two phases forming a continuous layer at the droplet surface. In some conditions the layer persisted, but in others it broke up into distinct domains. Excess gelatin phase separated in the bulk amylopectin phase, particularly when it was the continuous phase. The gelatin redispersed into the bulk phases when the emulsions were heated to 30 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3adroplets 3agelatin 3ahydrocolloids 3apH 0aAqueous multiphase system 0aWater-in-water emulsion 0aPhase separation 0aGuar 0aAmylopectin 0aGelatin1 aGuo, Jian1 aYang, Xiaoquan1 aNicolai, T.q(Taco),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-19750 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 Sept., v. 118 p.106763-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.1067633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013800163520135500301592002801656650001301684650001101697650001101708650001201719650001501731650001701746650001301763650001701776650002101793650001101814700002201825700001901847700002201866773012001888856007402008852000902082655001202091IND60682711920221121194646.0200131e20191129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271192DNAL7 a10.3390/fib71201032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrara, Giuseppe 10aExperimental Study on the Adhesion of Basalt Textile Reinforced Mortars (TRM) to Clay Brick Masonry: The Influence of Textile Density  aTextile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) composite systems are gaining consensus within the scientific and technical communities as a viable and advantageous alternative to the most conventional Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites. Due to the good compatibility both in terms of stiffness and vapor permeability between the inorganic matrix and the substrate, the TRMs appear to be particularly well suited for strengthening masonry members and enhancing their capacity to withstand tensile and shear stresses, such as those induced by seismic shakings. This paper aims to investigate the mechanical response of a TRM system featuring an internal reinforcement made of basalt fiber textile. Therefore, the paper reports the results of an experimental campaign carried out by single-lap shear bond tests on masonry substrate reinforced by TRM strips. Three different kinds of TRM have been taken into account, each one characterized by a variable number of fabric plies. The results show that, in all cases, TRMs fail prematurely due to debonding between fabric and matrix. However, the aforementioned premature failure is the main concern emerging from these test results, and further work is requested in reformulating the matrix composition towards enhancing their tensile strength and, hence, restraining the occurrence of fabric-to-matrix debonding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abasalt 3abricks 3afabrics 3ageophysics 3apermeability 3apolymers 3ashear stress 3atensile strength 3avapors1 aCaggegi, Carmelo 1 aGábor, Áron,1 aMartinelli, Enzo 0 tFibers.g2019 Nov. 29, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27134x2079-64397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fib71201033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012000162520158700282592002801869650001701897650001001914650001301924650001101937650001301948650001801961650001901979650002301998700001702021700002302038700002402061700002102085700002102106773012002127856007402247852000902321655001202330IND60682712120221120195642.0200131e20191130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271212DNAL7 a10.3390/fib71201052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeber, Alexander 10aNano-Structured Optical Fibers Made of Glass-Ceramics, and Phase Separated and Metallic Particle-Containing Glasses  aFor years, scientists have been looking for different techniques to make glasses perfect: fully amorphous and ideally homogeneous. Meanwhile, recent advances in the development of particle-containing glasses (PCG), defined in this paper as glass-ceramics, glasses doped with metallic nanoparticles, and phase-separated glasses show that these “imperfect” glasses can result in better optical materials if particles of desired chemistry, size, and shape are present in the glass. It has been shown that PCGs can be used for the fabrication of nanostructured fibers—a novel class of media for fiber optics. These unique optical fibers are able to outperform their traditional glass counterparts in terms of available emission spectral range, quantum efficiency, non-linear properties, fabricated sensors sensitivity, and other parameters. Being rather special, nanostructured fibers require new, unconventional solutions on the materials used, fabrication, and characterization techniques, limiting the use of these novel materials. This work overviews practical aspects and progress in the fabrication and characterization methods of the particle-containing glasses with particular attention to nanostructured fibers made of these materials. A review of the recent achievements shows that current technologies allow producing high-optical quality PCG-fibers of different types, and the unique optical properties of these nanostructured fibers make them prospective for applications in lasers, optical communications, medicine, lighting, and other areas of science and industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3afiber optics 3aglass 3aindustry 3alasers 3amedicine 3ananoparticles 3aoptical fibers 3aoptical properties1 aLu, Zhuorui 1 aVermillac, Manuel 1 aPigeonneau, Franck 1 aBlanc, Wilfried 1 aPetit, Laeticia 0 tFibers.g2019 Nov. 30, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27134x2079-64397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fib71201053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014300162300001800305500001900323520194800342592002802290650001302318650002102331650001602352650002602368650001602394650001802410650001302428650002002441650001102461650002702472650002902499650002602528650002002554650001802574650001502592651001202607700001902619700002102638773013502659856004802794852000902842655001202851IND6036691320221121221749.0210726e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603669132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-011-0707-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHass, Ulrike10aOccurrence of psychoactive compounds and their metabolites in groundwater downgradient of a decommissioned sewage farm in Berlin (Germany)  ap. 2096-2106.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Psychoactive compounds—meprobamate, pyrithyldione, primidone, and its metabolites, phenobarbital, and phenylethylmalonamide—were detected in groundwater within the catchment area of a drinking water treatment plant located downgradient of a former sewage farm in Berlin, Germany. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of the psychoactive compounds in anoxic groundwater and to assess the risk of drinking water contamination. Groundwater age was determined to achieve a better understanding of present hydrogeological conditions. METHODS: A large number of observation and production wells were sampled. Samples were analyzed using solid-phase extraction and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Groundwater age was estimated using the helium–tritium (3He–3H) dating method. RESULTS: Concentrations of psychoactive compounds up to 1 μg/L were encountered in the contamination plume. Generally, concentrations of phenobarbital and meprobamate were the highest. Elevated concentrations of the analytes were also detected in raw water from abstraction wells located approximately 2.5 km downgradient of the former sewage farm. Concentrations in the final drinking water were below the limit of quantification owing to dilution. The age of shallow groundwater samples ranged from years to a decade, whereas groundwater was up to four decades old at 40 m below ground. Concentrations of the compounds increased with groundwater age. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated concentrations of psychoactive drugs indicate a strong persistence of these compounds in the environment under anoxic aquifer conditions. Results suggest that the heritage of sewage irrigation will affect raw water quality in the area for decades. Therefore, further monitoring of raw and final drinking water is recommended to ensure that contaminant concentrations remain below the health-based precautionary value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achemical species 3agroundwater 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aphenobarbital 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3asewage 3asolid phase extraction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awastewater irrigation 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aGermany1 aDünnbier, Uwe1 aMassmann, Gudrun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2012 July, v. 19, no. 6 p.2096-2106dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0707-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245017600167300001800343520044300361592002800804650002300832650002300855650002000878650001700898650001100915700001800926773013400944856007401078852000901152655001201161IND60638657220221119035815.0190430e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063865722DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc09612j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarashimada, Ryunosuke10aThiacalixarene assembled heterotrinuclear lanthanide clusters comprising Tbᴵᴵᴵ and Ybᴵᴵᴵ enable f–f communication to enhance Ybᴵᴵᴵ-centred luminescence  ap. 3139-3142.  aA mixture of heterotrinuclear lanthanide cluster complexes, Tb₃₋ₓYbₓTCAS₂ (x = 1, 2), was obtained by mixing thiacalix[4]arene-p-tetrasulfonate (TCAS), Tbᴵᴵᴵ, and Ybᴵᴵᴵ, which shows enhanced Ybᴵᴵᴵ-centred luminescence and shortened lifetime for Tbᴵᴵᴵ-centred luminescence as compared to Yb₃TCAS₂ and Tb₃TCAS₂, indicating f–f communication, i.e., energy transfer from Tbᴵᴵᴵ to Ybᴵᴵᴵ.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aenergy transfer 3aluminescence 3amixing1 aIki, Nobuhiko0 tChemical communications.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 52, no. 15 p.3139-3142dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cc09612j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013000157500002000287520188400307592002802191596007102219650002302290650001402313650001402327650001702341650001802358650003202376650001502408650001702423650001802440650002102458650000902479650001702488700005402505700001202559700001302571700005502584773012802639856007402767852000902841655001202850IND60749855220221121233935.0210908e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985522DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.138922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Shuying10aAtractylenolide III alleviates isoflurane‐induced injury in rat hippocampal neurons by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe use of anesthetics relieves discomfort in patients during operation, but extensive application of anesthetics can cause damage to the nervous system. Atractylenolide III (ATL‐III) is an active ingredient derived from Baizhu, which is a kind of traditional Chinese medicines. Recent studies have shown that ATL‐III alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress in various tissues by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. However, whether or not the application of ATL‐III could relieve isoflurane‐induced damage in rat hippocampal neurons remains unclear. In this study, rats were stimulated with isoflurane and treated with ATL‐III (intragastric administration) simultaneously. After rats were sacrificed, apoptosis and autophagy in the hippocampal neurons were assessed using TUNEL assays and western blotting, respectively. Then, the expression of inflammatory factors was determined by q‐PCR and ELISA. The levels of p‐PI3K, p‐Akt, and p‐mTOR were quantified by western blotting. We found that ATL‐III relieved isoflurane‐induced apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation in hippocampal neurons in rats. ATL‐III treatment also inhibited the expression of TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and IL‐6 in these cells. Furthermore, ATL‐III promoted the expression of p‐PI3K, p‐Akt, and p‐mTOR in the hippocampal neurons. All these results indicated that ATL‐III alleviated isoflurane‐induced injury in rat hippocampal neurons by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Whether or not Atractylenolide III (ATL‐III) could alleviate neurotoxicity induced by anesthetics is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATL‐III on anesthetic‐induced nervous system damage. The findings from this study could also provide a novel therapy for the treatment of patients with anesthetic‐induced nerve injury.  aPublisher supplied data  a17PJ217cHealth and Family Planning Commission of Sichuan Province 3aactive ingredients 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintragastric administration 3aisoflurane 3anerve tissue 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Zeru1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7277-46601 aYu, Jun1 aYin, Lin1 aZhu, Anding1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7794-44780 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.e13892-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.138923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01582naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245011800205300001800323506007600341520032500417592002800742506003700770650001700807650001100824650002500835700002500860700002000885700002400905700002400929700001400953700002500967773012700992856008001119852000901199655001201208IND60117733220221207122219.0141126e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011773322DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00526-142doi7 aPMC40640222pmcid7 a249487572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzanera, M.10aGenome Sequence of Arthrobacter siccitolerans 4J27, a Xeroprotectant-Producing Desiccation-Tolerant Microorganism  ap. e00526-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the first genome sequence for Arthrobacter siccitolerans 4J27, a newly described desiccation-tolerant species.

A systematic strategy encompassing source reduction, process retention, nutrient reuse, and water restoration for controlling agricultural non-point source pollution was applied to a 1.5 km² intensive rice-wheat rotation area at Yaoqiao county, Zhenjiang city, Jiangsu Province, in the downstream reach of the Yangtze River, China, from 2016 to 2018. The results showed that the use of organic and controlled-release fertilizers reduced the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) input for rice and wheat by 20 % and 27 %, respectively, without any yield loss. The N and P concentration in the ecological ditches declined by 8%–50.4% for TN and 12%–69.7% for TP in comparison with that in the control ditches, and then further declined after the purification of eco-ponds. The removal efficiency was positive related with the N and P centration of inflow. TN concentration in the drainage water finally flow into the Shangshe River was lower than 2 mg/L during three out of 19 times. The river water quality was distinctly improved, wherein the TN, NH₄⁺-N, TP, and chemical oxygen demand (CODCᵣ) concentrations were lower by 28.9 %, 30.4 %, 21.9 %, and 35.5 %, respectively following implementation of ecological water restoration technologies. The water quality improvement was mainly attributed to reduced pollutant load from agricultural fields and the aquatic plant uptake. This study found that the systematic “4R” approach is a promising method for decreasing the N and P loads from agricultural fields and improving the downstream water eutrophication problem, and can be extended to other agricultural intensive regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3aaquatic plants 3aarea 3achemical oxygen demand 3adegradation 3adrainage water 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3aflow 3anonpoint source pollution 3apollution control 3arice 3ariver water 3arivers 3arural areas 3aslow-release fertilizers 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awheat 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aAgricultural non-point source 0aReduce-Retain-Reuse-Restore strategy 0aFertilizer reduction 0aYield1 aHou, Pengfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3630-99291 aZhang, Zhiyong1 aShen, Mingxing1 aLiu, Fuxing1 aYang, Linzhang0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 304 p.107148-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.1071483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007400161520109300235592002801328650001701356650002501373650001801398650001001416650002601426650001901452650001601471650002301487650002101510650001301531650002301544650001201567650001401579700002001593700001501613700001301628700002001641773011901661856007401780852000901854655001201863IND60682712520221120195537.0200718e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271252DNAL7 a10.3390/fib80100012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Ramandeep 10aStructural Features, Modification, and Functionalities of Beta-Glucan  a-glucan is a strongly hydrophilic non-starchy polysaccharide, which, when incorporated in food, is renowned for its ability to alter functional characteristics such as viscosity, rheology, texture, and sensory properties of the food product. The functional properties of β-glucans are directly linked to their origin/source, molecular weight, and structural features. The molecular weight and structural/conformational features are in turn influenced by method of extraction and modification of the β-glucan. For example, whereas physical modification techniques influence only the spatial structures, modification by chemical agents, enzyme hydrolysis, mechanical treatment, and irradiation affect both spatial conformation and primary structures of β-glucan. Consequently, β-glucan can be modified (via one or more of the aforementioned techniques) into forms that have desired morphological, rheological, and (bio)functional properties. This review describes how various modification techniques affect the structure, properties, and applications of β-glucans in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-glucans 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afood industry 3afoods 3afunctional properties 3ahydrophilicity 3airradiation 3amechanical methods 3amolecular weight 3arheology 3asensory properties 3atexture 3aviscosity1 aSharma, Minaxi 1 aJi, Dawei 1 aXu, Min 1 aAgyei, Dominic 0 tFibers.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27134x2079-64397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fib80100013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245017800168300001600346500001900362520061600381592002800997650002201025650001901047650001601066650001901082651001001101653001501111653002101126653001501147653001601162773015501178856008801333852000901421655001201430IND60713609420221120222347.0201023e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071360942DNAL7 a10.3161/00034541ANZ2020.70.3.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dong10aArphthicarus olszanowskii sp. nov.

If fracture size is comparable to the wavelength or fluid diffusion length, the P wave anisotropy is frequency dependent. By solving the Biot's equations of dynamic poroelasticity and using the Foldy approximation, we investigate the frequency‐dependent P wave anisotropy in a fluid‐saturated porous rock with a set of aligned penny‐shaped fractures. This approach includes the effects of both wave‐induced fluid flow (WIFF) and elastic scattering on P wave anisotropy. The results show that the velocity and attenuation anisotropy in the WIFF and elastic scattering regimes have quite different features and are affected by various factors. In particular, the background permeability and fluid viscosity primarily affect the frequency‐dependent anisotropy caused by WIFF. The fracture geometry (radius and thickness) and fracture density have significant effects on both WIFF and elastic scattering‐induced frequency‐dependent anisotropy. The fluid bulk modulus also affects the frequency‐dependent anisotropy. With the vanishing fluid bulk modulus, the frequency dependency vanishes in the WIFF regime but is the largest in the elastic scattering regime. Predictions of the model agree with previous models in all known limiting cases. Comparison with experimental data shows that WIFF and elastic scattering are important causes for frequency‐dependent P wave anisotropy, and our model is capable to account for these effects.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019M650149cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2018YFC0310105cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41904099cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  cSUSTech Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship 3aanisotropy 3ageometry 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporous media 3aresearch 3aviscosity 3awavelengths1 aGurevich, Boris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2752-35280 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB020320-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0203203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245015900179300001600338520173300354592002802087650001202115650001602127650001102143650001202154650002502166650002502191650001602216650001302232650001302245650001402258650001302272650001502285650001502300650002602315650003102341650000902372650001602381650001102397650002202408650000802430650001502438650002502453650002402478650003802502650001002540650003302550650001102583650002802594650001302622650005902635650001102694650002102705650003602726650004202762650000802804773013302812856007302945852000903018655001203027IND60080462620221121004511.0150206e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008046262DNAL7 a250995032pmid7 a10.1111/jhn.121722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuxton, C. H. S.14aThe suitability of caffeinated drinks for children: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials, observational studies and expert panel guidelines  ap. 342-357.  aBACKGROUND: The increased availability of caffeinated drinks raises questions about the level of caffeine that is appropriate for children, as well as the benefits and risks associated with their consumption. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines, this systematic review evaluates evidence from randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of caffeine on cognition, behaviour, mood and exercise performance in children. Observational studies and expert panel guidelines are also discussed. RESULTS: One hundred and nine studies were found, with 11 randomised controlled trials and 13 observational studies meeting the criteria. High caffeine intakes (e.g. >5 mg kg–¹body weight day–¹) were associated with an increased risk of anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. However, smaller amounts were not linked with such effects and may benefit cognitive function and sports performance based on adult studies. The evidence suggests that children and adolescents should limit daily caffeine consumption to 2.5 mg kg–¹body weight day–¹, equating to one or two cups of tea or one small cup of coffee. Lower contributors of caffeine, such as tea, may be more appropriate for children because they contribute to daily fluid intakes and provide flavonoids. By contrast, caffeinated soft drinks may be less suitable options for children as a result of their acidity, higher caffeine content, presence of added sugar (in some cases) and absence of bioactive compounds. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are needed to determine the intakes that represent a risk and whether there may be benefits for alertness and sports performance with moderate intakes of caffeine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aadolescents 3aadults 3aanxiety 3aathletic performance 3abioactive properties 3abody weight 3acaffeine 3achildren 3acognition 3aexercise 3aflavonoids 3aguidelines 3aobservational studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk 3asoft drinks 3asugars 3asystematic review 3atea 2aAdolescent 2aAffectxdrug effects 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aCaffeinexadministration & dosage 2aChild 2aChild Behaviorxdrug effects 2aCoffee 2aCognitionxdrug effects 2aExercise 2aFood Labelingxlegislation & jurisprudencexstandards. 2aHumans 2aNutrition Policy 2aObservational Studies as Topic. 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aTea0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2014 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.342-357dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0952-38717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.121723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010600204520118900310592002801499650002301527650002901550650000901579650001701588650001801605650001401623650001901637650002101656650002101677650001101698653003401709653001201743653004201755700002001797700003201817773011801849856008201967852000902049655001202058IND60744786120221121044356.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsim, Nilofar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4736-495810aReview of the valorization options for the proper disposal of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only human health and economies but also the environment due to the large volume of waste in the form of discarded personal protective equipment. The remarkable increase in the global usage of face masks, which mainly contain polypropylene, and improper waste management have led to a serious environmental challenge called microplastic pollution. Potential practices for waste management related to waste valorization of discarded face masks as the major type of waste during the COVID-19 pandemic are explored in this study. Recommendations based on governmental practices, situation of state facilities, and societal awareness and engagement applicable to emergency (including COVID-19 pandemic) and postpandemic scenarios are offered while considering potential solutions and available waste management practices in different countries during emergency conditions. However, multicriteria decision making for a country must determine the optimal solution for waste management on the basis of all affecting factors. Awareness of scientific, governments, and communities worldwide will successfully eradicate this important environmental issue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aenvironmental technology 3aface 3ahuman health 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolypropylenes 3asafety equipment 3awaste management 3awastes 0aPersonal protective equipment 0aPlastic 0aMulti-criteria decision making method1 aBadiei, Marzieh1 aSopian, K.q(Kamaruzzaman),0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101797-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245005300164520118800217592002801405650002401433650000901457650001301466650001601479650001901495650000901514650003401523650003301557650002301590650002101613700001901634700002601653773011901679856007501798852000901873655001201882IND60682712820221120195621.0200718e20191228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271282DNAL7 a10.3390/fib80100042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutrisno, Widayani 10aThermal Properties of Sago Fiber-Epoxy Composite  aThe aim of this study is to analyze the thermal properties of sago fiber-epoxy composite. The sago fiber-based composite has been prepared using epoxy resin as the matrix, via a simple mixing followed by compression. The compression process includes hot compression (100 °C/10 kgf cm⁻²) and cold compression (ambient/10 kgf cm⁻²). The composite series was prepared with 9%, 13%, 17%, 20%, and 23% (w/w) of epoxy resin. Microstructures of all materials used were observed using an SEM (scanning electron microscope) instrument. The thermal properties of the composite and its components were examined through TG/DTA characterization. The samples were heated using the heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 400 °C, except for epoxy resin, which was heated to 530 °C. TG/DTA results depict three stages of thermal processes of sago fiber-epoxy composite: evaporation of water molecules at below 100 °C with the peak point within the range of 51.3 and 57.3 °C, the damage of sago fiber within the range of 275 and 370 °C with the peak point within the range of 333.3 and 341.3 °C and the damage of epoxy resin at above 350 °C with the peak point at 376.2 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acold 3aepoxides 3aevaporation 3amicrostructure 3asago 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry1 aRahayu, Mitra 1 aAdhika, Damar  Rastri0 tFibers.g2019 Dec. 28, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27134x2079-64397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fib80100043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010500163520129300268592002801561650001901589650001401608650001101622650000901633650002501642650001301667650001801680650002001698650001601718700001601734700002601750700002101776700002401797700002201821773011901843856007401962852000902036655001202045IND60682712920221120195654.0200718e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271292DNAL7 a10.3390/fib80100052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBamigboye, Gideon 10aCompressive Behaviour of Coconut Fibre (Cocos nucifera) Reinforced Concrete at Elevated Temperatures  aFire outbreaks in buildings have been a major concern in the world today. The integrity of concrete is usually questioned due to the fact that after these fire outbreaks the strength of the concrete is reduced considerably. Various methods have been adopted to improve the fire resistance property of concrete. This study focused on the use of coconut fibre to achieve this feat. In this study, varying percentages of treated and untreated coconut fibres were incorporated into concrete and the compressive strength was tested for both before heating and after heating. The percentages of replacement were 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1% fibre content by weight of cement. Concrete cubes that had 0% fibre served as control specimens. After subjecting these concrete cubes to 250 °C and 150 °C for a period of 2 h, the compressive strength increased when compared to the control. The compressive strength increased up to 0.5% replacement by 3.88%. Beyond 0.5% fibre, the compressive strength reduced. Concrete having coconut fibre that had been treated with water also exhibited the highest compressive strength of 28.71 N/mm². It is concluded that coconut fibres are a great material in improving the strength of concrete, even after it was exposed to a certain degree of elevated temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCocos nucifera 3abuildings 3acement 3acoir 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3afiber content 3afire resistance 3atemperature1 aNgene, Ben 1 aAladesuru, Omotolani 1 aMark, Oluwaseun 1 aAdegoke, Dunmininu 1 aJolayemi, Kayode 0 tFibers.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 8, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27134x2079-64397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fib80100053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245013400176300001600310500001900326520171900345592002802064650002402092650001602116650002402132650002402156650002202180650001302202650001102215650001502226650001102241700006802252773015902320856008202479852000902561655001202570IND60727884620221119225525.0210213e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072788462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01902-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhry, Sandeep Kumar10aStudents exposure assessment towards PM number concentration while commuting from different transport modes during school timings  ap. 371-388.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmong the various daily activities, commuting to school is considered as an important activity for the students. While commute, students are exposed to elevated particle concentrations that make significant contributions to their daily personal exposures. Present study compares the student exposure towards particle number concentration (PNC) and inhaled doses while commuting from different transports during morning (MT) and afternoon (AT) trips. PNC was measured from four different transport modes: two-wheeler (2W), three-wheeler (3W), passenger car (PC) and school bus (SB) during summer and winter seasons. In summer season, average total PNC was highest for 3W and SB during MT (5.53E+07 # m⁻³) and AT (5.29E+07 # m⁻³) trips respectively. However, in winter season, 3W has the highest average total PNC during MT (1.04E+08 # m⁻³) and AT (7.92E+07 # m⁻³) trips. Ventilation settings greatly influence the in-cabin PNC and found to be highest under window open (WO) scenario for PC and least under WO and window closed scenarios for SB during MT and AT trips respectively. The PNC exposure varies significantly with student seating positions inside SB and followed different trends during MT (front > middle > rear) and AT (rear > front > middle) trips. The mixed-effect multivariate linear regression model was used to estimate the effects of multiple predictor variables that influence the PNC measured from different transport modes while commuting. Background concentration (PNC) and meteorological variables (wind speed, ambient temperature and relative humidity) were important predictors of PNC measured while commuting and explained the variability between 0.04–27.31%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aautomobiles 3aexposure assessment 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3aresearch 3asummer 3awind speed 3awinter1 aElumalai, Suresh Pandian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4104-17760 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.371-388dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01902-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245013300171300001600304500001900320520101500339592002801354596006001382596004201442596004201484596004201526596003801568650000901606650002101615650001101636650001401647650001701661650001301678650002001691650001601711650003101727700001801758700006001776773015901836856008201995852000902077655001202086IND60727884720221119225454.0210213e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072788472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01901-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoca-Pardiñas, J.10aNonparametric location–scale model for the joint forecasting of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] pollution episodes  ap. 231-244.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe present a method to forecast pollution episodes with a bivariate response. The method simultaneously estimates the concentrations of two pollutants, using historical data. It is based on a location–scale model where the means and the standard deviations are approximated by kernel smoothers in additive models, while the variance–covariance matrix is obtained from the residuals of the previous models. The method provides not only an estimation of the concentration of both pollutants over time but also uncertainty regions covering a specific percentage of the data. The suitability of the model was tested with both simulated and real data (specifically [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] concentrations from a coal-fired power station). The results have proved highly satisfactory in both cases. The percentage of data covered by the uncertainty region, its area and a new loss function, a variant of the pinball loss function, were used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.  aPublisher supplied data  aMTM2017-89422-PcMinisterio de Ciencia e Investigación  a2019-2022 ED431G/06cXunta de Galicia  aGRC ED431C 2016/040cXunta de Galicia  a2016-2019 ED431G/02cXunta de Galicia  aED481A-2018/154cXunta de Galicia 3acoal 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apollution 3apower plants 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3auncertainty 3avariance covariance matrix1 aOrdóñez, C.1 aLado-Baleato, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9592-48790 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2021 Feb., v. 35, no. 2 p.231-244dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01901-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006200154245009200216300001600308500001900324520078500343592002801128650002401156650001901180650001401199650001001213650001601223650002201239651001801261653001601279653001501295653001601310653001401326700006001340773015501400856008801555852000901643655001201652IND60713609820221120234227.0201023e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071360982DNAL7 a10.3161/00034541ANZ2020.70.3.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmilov, Sergey G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0913-131X10aNew Faunistic and Taxonomic Data on Oribatid Mites (Acari: Oribatida) of Côte d'Ivoire  ap. 371-380.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study is based on oribatid mite material collected from secondary forest in southern part of Côte d'Ivoire in 2013.

An ortho-phenylphenol-based smoke generator sanitizer, liquid chemical sanitizers (benzalkonium chloride, biguanide, iodine, peracetic acid, and sodium hypochlorite), and acidic and alkaline electrolyzed water were used against Aspergillus australensis (MB 2579; NFF 02), Aspergillus aureoluteus (NFC1), Paecilomyces fulvus (PFF 01), Paecilomyces niveus (PNT 01; PNDC 01; PNB1 01), and Paecilomyces variotii (PV 01; PV 01; PVCH 03). The fungal strains were exposed separately to liquid sanitizers and electrolyzed water in stainless steel discs for 15 min following the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) recommendations. Moreover, the fungal strains were exposed to the smoke generator sanitizer for 7 h following French protocol NF-T-72281. The best results of fungal inactivation were achieved when the highest concentration specified in the label of these sanitizers was tested. On the opposite, the lowest concentration specified in the label should be avoided since it was ineffective in most cases (94%). The ortho-phenyphenol-based smoke generator sanitizer and peracetic acid (1%) showed the best results of spore inactivation, while iodine and benzalkonium chloride achieved satisfactory results against the strains evaluated. Sodium hypochlorite and biguanide were ineffective against most of the fungi studied at all concentrations tested. Acidic and basic electrolyzed water was also ineffective to achieve the 3-log CFU reduction required in the concentrations tested. In general, Paecilomyces spp. was more sensitive than Aspergillus spp. against all sanitizers evaluated, whereas A. aureoluteus NFC1 was resistant to all agents and concentrations tested. The heat-resistant fungal strains showed varied sensitivity against the different agents. Notably, the two most effective commercial sanitizers against the heat-resistant strains were ineffective against the filamentous fungi recommended for sanitizer testing (A. brasiliensis ATCC 16404), which demonstrates the relevance of testing fungal isolates that cause spoilage to choose the most effective compound and obtain the best results of fungal control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaecilomyces variotii 3abenzalkonium chloride 3aelectrolyzed water 3afood industry 3afood microbiology 3afungi 3aiodine 3aliquids 3aperacetic acid 3asanitation 3asanitizers 3asmoke 3asodium hypochlorite 3aspoilage 3aspores 3astainless steel 0aSanitization 0aSmoke Tech1 aMagrini, Lísia Nicoloso1 aLemos, Jéssica Gonçalves1 aGarcia, Marcelo Valle1 aBernardi, Angélica Oliver1 aCichoski, Alexandre José1 aCopetti, Marina Venturini0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2020 Dec. 16, v. 335 p.108856-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.1088563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009400168506002800262520069900290592002800989506003701017650001101054650001001065650002201075650001501097650001701112650000901129650001101138650001001149650001701159650002501176700002001201700002001221700002301241700001901264700001601283700002101299700002301320773009601343856008301439852000901522655001201531IND60739348120221207081214.0190411s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073934812DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201913040182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElisa, Luciani10aEffects of a new arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (Glomus iranicum) on grapevine development  aResource is Open Access  aDuring the spring of 2016, one-year-old own-rooted and 3-year-old grafted vines of cv.

In the estuarine mixing zone, the strong physico-chemical gradients resulting from the interaction between river freshwater and seawater may affect the distribution, mobility and fate of several potentially toxic compounds, among which trace elements are of major concern. Knowledge regarding the partitioning behaviour of trace elements would provide essential scientific support for the environmental management of estuaries. In this study, trace element occurrence and phase partitioning among suspended particulate matter, colloidal material and the truly dissolved fraction were investigated in the main Italian and Slovenian estuarine environments of the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea). Further information about the water quality at the river mouths was provided and, in addition to the traditional evaluation of single chemical parameters, a multi-way principal component analysis was employed in order to depict disparities among sampling sites, water layers and seasonal conditions with the final aim of evaluating trace element phase partitioning.Results indicated that the suspended particulate matter acts as the main effective vehicle for Cu, Cr, Fe, Ni and Pb, and enhanced adsorption processes resulted in elevated partitioning coefficients, especially for Fe and Pb. Although disparities occurred between sampling sites and seasons, trace elements showing affinity for the solid phase appeared to be partially bound to the colloidal material. Conversely, As and Cs prevailed in the truly dissolved fraction, especially in seawater and showed scarce affinity for both the suspended particles and colloids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3achemometrics 3achromium 3acolloids 3acopper 3aenvironmental management 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahydrodynamics 3airon 3alead 3amixing 3anickel 3aparticulates 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3aseawater 3atoxic substances 3awater flow 3awater quality 3aAdriatic Sea 0aTrace elements 0aEstuary 0aSuspended matter 0aColloids 0aMulti-way data analysis1 aCrosera, Matteo1 aPetranich, Elisa1 aOliveri, Paolo1 aKlun, Katja1 aFaganeli, Jadran1 aCovelli, Stefano1 aAdami, Gianpiero0 tChemosphere.g2020 Aug., v. 252 p.126517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1265173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245014100210520175200351592002802103650002302131650002602154650001402180650002002194650001302214650002202227650001202249650001302261650001302274650002802287650001802315650001702333650001802350650001602368651001002384653002102394653002202415653002402437653004402461700001802505700002002523773009402543856008202637852000902719655001202728IND60725256320221120034351.0210329e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072525632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1059142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrar, Harjeet Singh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1414-304010aDataset of source-sink manipulation through growth retardant for enhancing productivity and profitability of cotton in north west, India  aTwo different field experiments were conducted at Punjab Agricultural University, Regional Research Station, Bathinda, (1) to manage optimum source-sink relationship through mepiquat chloride (MC) in Bt cotton hybrid and (2) to find feasibility of MC application on non hybrid compact cotton genotype under high density planting system (HDPS) with varied nitrogen levels. Raw data for growth and yield parameters was recorded from each treatment and statistically analysed. In experiment (1), application of MC 75 g active ingredient per hectare (a.i./ha) irrespective of splits between 60 and 90 days after sowing (DAS) was effective for significant reduction in plant height, increase in bolls per plant as compared to control and de-topping treatments. All these led to significantly highest seed cotton yield (SCY) and monetary returns under MC 75 g a.i./ha as compared to de-topping treatment. In experiment (2) of high density planting of cotton, sympods per plant, bolls per plant, SCY as well as nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and monetary returns were increased significantly with 25% increase in recommended dose of nitrogen. Among the growth retardants, application of MC 20 g a.i./ha once and twice reduced plant height, increased sympods and boll per plant significantly which led to significantly higher SCY production as compared to control. Similarly, NUE and monetary returns were also significantly higher under MC treatments as compared to control. Application of MC 75 g a.i./ha in either two or three splits on Bt cotton hybrid under normal plant density and MC 20–40 g a.i./ha on non Bt compact genotype under high plant density optimized source-sink relationship which improve crop productivity and profitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aagricultural colleges 3achlorides 3adata collection 3agenotype 3agrowth inhibitors 3ahybrids 3amepiquat 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant density 3aplant height 3aprofitability 3aseed cotton 3aIndia 0aGrowth retardant 0aMepiquat chloride 0aReproductive growth 0aSeed cotton yield and vegetative growth1 aKumar, Deepak1 aSingh, Paramjit0 tData in Brief.g2020 Aug., v. 31 p.105914-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1059143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013700167300001400304520089300318592002801211650001601239650001001255650001801265650001201283650001501295650001201310650001101322650001301333650000901346650001101355650001201366650001101378651001101389700001701400700002201417700001601439700002101455773011801476856008201594852000901676655001201685IND60590349520221122100710.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059034952DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293180100392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarabanov, A.T.10aSurface Runoff and Snowmelt Infiltration into the Soil on Plowlands in the Forest-Steppe and Steppe Zones of the East European Plain  ap. 66-72.  aLong-term series of observations over the spring water balance elements on fields with hydrologically contrasting agricultural backgrounds―a loose soil after fall moldboard plowing and a plowland compacted by 12–16% compared to the former soil (perennial grasses, winter crops, stubble)―have been analyzed. The values of surface runoff and water infiltration into the soil in the steppe and forest-steppe zones of European Russia have been calculated for the spring (flooding) period and the entire cold season. The hydrological role of fall plowing has been shown, and water balance elements for the current (1981–2016) and preceding (1957–1980) periods have been compared. A significant decrease in runoff and an increase of water reserve in the soil have been revealed on all plowland types.

In total, 105, 96 and 55 specimens of these three Fish species were sampled, respectively, by the use of bottom trawls operated in the sectors of El-Dabaa and Sidi Abd El Rahman. The morphological characteristic and related index ratio were determined. The results showed that T. araneus total length varied from 10.9 to 30.0 cm TL with mean length of 19.87 ± 5.43 cm TL and a number of horizontal dots appear to be distributed along the lateral line, T. draco total length was 11.8 to 27.6 cm TL with a mean length of 17.85 ± 4.23 cm TL, and specimens of this Fish species showed yellow vertical oblique lines on the body. On the other hand, T. radiatus is characterized by a total length of 10.6 to 35.0 cm TL with a mean length 18.04 ± 4.87 cm TL, and by circular brown dots spread on the whole body and head. Furthermore, these three Fish species have poisonous spines, one on each operculum, and both spines on the internal border of the dorsal part of each eye orbit. The morphometric regression of each morphometric character showed close agreement between the observed and calculated values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrachinus 3aeyes 3afish 3ahead 3amorphometry 3aresearch 0aBiometric 0aCharacteristics 0aTrachinus araneus 0aTrachinus draco 0aTrachinus radiatus 0aMediterranean waters 0aEgypt1 aRizkalla, Samir Ibrahim0 tEgyptian Journal of Aquatic Research (Online).g2021 June, v. 47, no. 2 p.199-206dElsevier B.V.aNational Institute of Oceanography and FisherieswJournal:21572x1687-42857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejar.2020.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009600168300001600264520221700280592002802497650001802525650001902543650001102562650000902573650001502582650000902597650002202606650001402628650003102642650001002673650001902683650001302702650002302715650001102738650000902749650001102758650001602769650002002785650001602805650002902821650001002850650001002860650001102870700002002881700002202901700002002923700002602943773009302969856008103062852000903143655001203152IND60479649820221120113646.0160122e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047964982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-015-2415-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVergara, Ricardo10aRelationship between endodormancy, FLOWERING LOCUS T and cell cycle genes in Vitis vinifera  ap. 411-419.  aMAIN CONCLUSION : In grapevines, the increased expression of VvFT , genes involved in the photoperiodic control of seasonal growth (VvAP1, VvAIL2) and cell cycle genes (VvCDKA, VvCDKB2, VvCYCA1, VvCYCB, VvCYCD3.2) in the shoot apex relative to the latent bud, suggests a high mitotic activity of the apex which could prevent them to enter into endodormancy. Additionally, the up-regulation of these genes by the dormancy-breaking compound hydrogen cyanamide (H ₂ CN ₂) strongly suggests that VvFT plays a key role in regulating transcriptionally cell cycle genes. At the end of the growing season, short-day (SD) photoperiod induces the transition of latent grapevine buds (Vitis vinifera L) from paradormancy (PD) to endodormancy (ED), which allows them to survive the cold temperatures of winter. Meanwhile, the shoot apex gradually decreases its growth without entering into ED, and as a result of the fall of temperatures at the beginning of autumn, dies. To understand developmental differences and contrasting responses to environmental cues between both organs, the expression of cell cycle genes, and of genes involved in photoperiodic control of seasonal growth in trees, such as FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), APETALA1 (AP1) and AINTEGUMENTA-like (AIL) was analyzed at the shoot apex and latent buds of vines during the transition from PD to ED. After shift to SD photoperiod, increased expression of cell cycle genes in the shoot apex suggests a high mitotic activity in this organ which could prevent them from entering into ED. Additionally, the increased expression of VvFT, VvAP1and VvAIL2 in the shoot apex, and the up-regulation of VvFT, VvAP1and cell cycle genes VvCDKA, VvCDKB2, VvCYCA.1, by the dormancy-breaking compound hydrogen cyanamide (H₂CN₂), strongly suggests that VvFT plays a key role in regulating transcriptionally cell cycle genes, giving thus, more support to the model for photoperiodic control of seasonal growth in trees. Furthermore, downregulation of VvFT by the SD photoperiod detected in leaves and buds of grapevines highlights the importance of VvFT in the induction of growth cessation and in ED development, probably by regulating the expression of cell cycle genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aVitis vinifera 3aautumn 3abuds 3acell cycle 3acold 3adormancy breaking 3aflowering 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowing season 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen cyanamide 3aleaves 3aloci 3amodels 3aphotoperiod 3aseasonal growth 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atrees 3avines 3awinter1 aNoriega, Ximena1 aParada, Francisca1 aDantas, Débora1 aPérez, Francisco J.,0 tPlanta.g2016 Feb., v. 243, no. 2 p.411-419dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2415-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245010300176500002200279520082500301592002801126650003201154650000801186650003401194650001901228650000901247650001001256650002001266650001501286650004301301650001701344651001001361653002101371653002101392700002401413700002201437700002001459700002401479700002101503700002001524700001901544700001901563700001901582700001801601700002301619700001901642773009501661856008501756852000901841655001201850IND60670337220221118022518.0191002e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067033722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.1084262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaringella, Francesca10aPrevalence and risk factors for Felis catus gammaherpesvirus 1 detection in domestic cats in Italy  aPre-press version  aFelis catus gammaherpesvirus 1 (FcaGHV1), a novel gammaherpesvirus of domestic cats identified in 2014, has been detected in different countries demonstrating a worldwide distribution. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of FcaGHV1 in Italy using a molecular epidemiological approach. FcaGHV1 DNA was detected with virus-specific real-time PCR in 1% of 2659 feline blood samples tested. Analysis of risk factors showed that being male and coinfection with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) increase the likelihood of FcaGHV1 detection. One-third of FcaGHV1-positive cats also tested positive for FIV provirus, whereas coinfections with feline panleukopenia virus were not demonstrated. Further studies are necessary to confirm the risk factors for FcaGHV1 detection and the pathobiology of the virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aDNA 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3ablood sampling 3acats 3amales 3amixed infection 3aproviruses 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aItaly 0agammaherpesvirus 0amolecular survey1 aDesario, Costantina1 aLorusso, Eleonora1 aPallante, Ivana1 aFurlanello, Tommaso1 aLanave, Gianvito1 aElia, Gabriella1 aMartella, Vito1 aIatta, Roberta1 aBarrs, Vanessa1 aBeatty, Julia1 aBuonavoglia, Canio1 aDecaro, Nicola0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2019 Sept. 20, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.1084263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010600167300001400273520171400287592002802001650002102029650002102050650001702071650001002088650001202098650002002110650001102130650001702141650000902158650001302167650000902180650001502189650001002204650004302214650001202257650001502269650001202284650001402296650001502310653001602325653001502341653002202356653001702378653001802395653001902413653001702432653001102449653000902460700003502469700003102504773011902535856008302654852000902737655001202746IND60566647720221123000610.0180904e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056664772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaradas, Filiz12aA comparison of fat-soluble antioxidants in wild and farm-reared chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar)  ap. 89-94.  aThis study assessed differences in antioxidant (carotenoid, retinol, retinol-ester, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10) composition of egg yolk and tissue in chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) newly hatched from eggs of birds maintained in captivity on commercial maize-soybean based diets and birds from the wild whose diet was obtained from the natural environment. All eggs were incubated in a commercial hatchery. Day-old chicks from both groups were sacrificed and dissected for antioxidant analysis. Fat soluble antioxidant concentrations of egg yolk and tissues were determined by HPLC. Total carotenoids, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, and total vitamin E concentration of wild egg yolks were significantly higher compared to yolks from farm-reared birds (p<0.05). However, gamma tocopherol, and coenzyme Q10 were not significantly different in the yolks of either wild or farmed birds (p>0.05). The concentration of total carotenoids in all tissues of wild chukar one-day old partridges was significantly higher than in farmed one-day old chukar partridge tissues (p<0.05). Alpha tocopherol, free-retinol, retinol-esters and total vitamin A were significantly higher in most tissues of wild chukar when compared to farmed chicks (p<0.05). Coenzyme Q10 concentrations of heart, kidney and brain tissues of farm-reared chukar day old chicks were significantly higher than tissues from wild birds, although leg and breast tissues of wild chicks were significantly higher than in farmed birds (p<0.05).These findings suggest that maternal access to antioxidants in the diet of farmed chukar partridges could positively influence fat soluble antioxidant concentrations in the egg yolk and tissues of day old chicks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlectoris chukar 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3abrain 3abreasts 3acaptive animals 3achicks 3acoenzyme Q10 3adiet 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3ahatcheries 3aheart 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akidneys 3apartridges 3atissues 3avitamin A 3awild birds 0aAntioxidant 0aCarotenoid 0aChukar partridges 0aCoenzyme Q10 0aNewly hatched 0aRetinol-esters 0aVitamin A, E 0aReared 0aWild1 aMøller, A.

The objective of this study was to overcome these obstacles using optimization of a procedure for short-term storage of pikeperch semen at 4°C using two immobilizing media (IM): (a) IM1, 180mM NaCl, 2.68mM KCl, 1.36mM CaCl₂⋅2H₂O and 2.38mM NaHCO₃, 343mOsm/kg; and (b) IM2, 200mM NaCl, 2.68mM KCl, 1.36mM CaCl₂⋅2H₂O and 2.38mM NaHCO₃, 381mOsm/kg. Undiluted sperm was used as the control. At 6h poststorage, there were no substantial changes in spermatozoa motility and velocity at 30s postactivation in all groups. Over 48h of storage, the highest spermatozoa motility and velocity were obtained in sperm diluted in IM2 compared to the other groups. IM2 could maintain a significantly higher ATP content of diluted sperm than IM1 and undiluted treatment for 2days. Similarly, the highest values of eyeing and hatching rates were observed in sperm diluted in IM2 compared to sperm in the other studied groups. It can be concluded that the obtained result is a novel and applicable approach to maintain semen quality of pikeperch during short-term storage, suggesting IM2 as a promising medium for short-term storage. The present study also opens possibilities for ensuring a reliable source of semen as a convenient approach for increasing genetic diversity in hatcheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander lucioperca 3aanimals 3agenetic variation 3asemen quality 3aspermatozoa 3astorage time 3aurine 0aFish 0aImmobilizing media 0aSperm motility1 aDadras, H.1 aPolicar, T.0 tAnimal.g2021 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.100001-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011800166500002200284520124000306592002801546650002001574650005601594650001501650650000901665650001701674650003201691650001801723650001801741650002401759650001001783650001601793650002101809650005001830650001801880650004401898650001601942650001001958650001701968650003201985650001302017653001002030653001602040653002302056700001402079700002002093700001902113700002002132700001902152700001602171773009502187856008502282852000902367655001202376IND60670337320221118022658.0191004e20190925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067033732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.1084312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuewei10aTherapeutic effect of Xanthohumol against highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses  aPre-press version  aThe infection by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has a severe impact on the world swine industry. However, commercially available vaccines provide only incomplete protection against this disease. Thus, novel approaches to control PRRSV infection are essential for the robust and sustainable swine industry. In our previous study, Xanthohumol (Xn), a prenylated flavonoid extracted for hops (Humulus lupulus L), was screened from 386 natural products to inhibit PRRSV proliferation and alleviate oxidative stress induced by PRRSV via the Nrf2-HMOX1 axis in Marc-145 cells. In this study, we furtherly found that Xn could inhibit PRRSV different sub-genotype strains infection with a low IC50 value in porcine primary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). In addition, it caused decreased expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α in PAMs infected with PRRSV or treated with lipopolysaccharide. Animal challenge experiments showed that Xn effectively alleviated clinical signs, lung pathology, and inflammatory responses in lung tissues of pigs induced by highly pathogenic PRRSV infection. The results demonstrate that Xn is a promising therapeutic agent to combat PRRSV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHumulus lupulus 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aflavonoids 3ahops 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amacrophages 3aoxidative stress 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asubgenotype 3aswine 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccines 0aPRRSV 0aXanthohumol 0aAntiviral activity1 aBai, Juan1 aJiang, Chenlong1 aSong, Zhongbao1 aZhao, Yongxiang1 aNauwynck, Hans1 aJiang, Ping0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2019 Sept. 25, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.1084313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010200167300001800269520102200287592002801309650000801337650001801345650002001363650001401383650000901397650001601406650001001422650001501432650003301447650001201480650003001492650001701522653002001539653002101559653001701580700001301597700001801610700005601628700001801684700002001702700001401722700001801736700001801754700001301772700001901785700001701804773011901821856008601940852000902026655001202035IND60112599920221120064301.0190410e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011259992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2013.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Tianyi10aSuper food Lycium barbarum (Solanaceae) traceability via an internal transcribed spacer 2 barcode  ap. 1699-1704.  aThe recent “horsemeat scandal” and “fish fraud” have focused extensive attention on food safety worldwide. Plant-origin food safety must also be examined. Lycium barbarum, commonly known as Goji (or wolfberry), is considered a “super food” because of its nutritive properties, and it is much more expensive than L. chinense and other varieties. However, distinguishing them merely by sight is difficult. Thus, developing a useful tool for tracing food is crucial. In this study, we utilized an internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) as a DNA barcode for distinguishing L. barbarum, L. chinense, and L. ruthencium. The genomic DNA from 67 fruit samples collected from the field and market was extracted. Ideal ITS2 barcodes were obtained by PCR amplification and sequencing. Based on the ITS2 barcode, the neighbor-joining (NJ) tree, BLAST1, and nearest distance methods were able to differentiate the three above-mentioned species. Therefore, we present the ITS2 barcode as a powerful tool for tracing Goji.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aLycium barbarum 3abarcoding 3afish 3afood safety 3afraud 3ahorse meat 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amarkets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atraceability 0aLycium barbarum 0aITS2 DNA barcode 0aTraceability1 aYao, Hui1 aGao, Huanhuan1 aZhou, Xinzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3009-95881 aMa, Xiaochong1 aXu, Chang-Qing,1 aChen, Jun1 aHan, Jianping1 aPang, Xiaohui1 aXu, Rong1 aSong, Jingyuan1 aChen, Shilin0 tFood research international.g2013 Dec., v. 54, no. 2 p.1699-1704dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015000172300001400322520084700336592002801183650002201211650002901233650001701262650001901279650001501298650002501313650002001338650001501358650001001373650001301383650001901396650001701415651001301432653002201445653002001467653002001487653003001507653001301537653002501550700002801575773010701603856008501710852000901795655001201804IND60626874420221120204207.0190102e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062687442DNAL7 a10.1080/01426397.2017.14165992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, Lindsey10aLake extent changes in Basotu, Tanzania: a mixed-methods approach to understanding the impacts of anthropogenic influence and climate variability  ap. 35-47.  aIncompatible land use is a major contributor to ecosystem degradation, and is often exacerbated by climate change impacts. We investigate Lake Basotu, Tanzania as a case study where natural lake variability has been affected by agricultural land use. Comparisons between a satellite-derived history of lake surface area, local precipitation records, and corresponding anthropogenic activity show the impacts of agricultural and historical practices. We argue that insufficient consideration to the wider ecological impacts of large agricultural projects has lasting implications. This is particularly true in semi-arid environments where food production demands need to be continuously met. In the future, major conservation strategies should be investigated to maintain the environmental integrity and sustainability of freshwater resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afood production 3afreshwater 3alakes 3aland use 3asemiarid zones 3asurface area 3aTanzania 0aMethod chronology 0aland-use change 0awater resources 0aenvironmental variability 0aTanzania 0aecosystem management1 aCaretta, Martina Angela0 tLandscape research.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 44, no. 1 p.35-47dRoutledgewJournal:J000000120x1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2017.14165993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008000167520112300247592002801370650000801398650005001406650001501456650001501471650001301486650001301499650001001512650002001522650001001542650001901552650002501571650001401596653001101610653002801621653002501649700003001674700003101704773009401735856008201829852000901911655001201920IND60725256920221120034440.0210329e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072525692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1059202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiksing, Calvin10aDraft genome sequence data of two Salmonella bacteria from serogroup C type  aSalmonella is a gram-negative rod-shape bacterium from the family of Enterobacteriaceae that can cause a wide range of human disease such as enteric fever, gastroenteritis and bacteremia.

The chemical composition of essential oil from leaves was evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. GC/MS revealed that the essential oil of O. gratissimum contained 51 compounds. The major chemical constituents identified were 3-allyl-6-methoxyphenol (19.30 %), 4-(5-ethenyl-1-azabicyclo (2, 2, 2) octan-2) (16.82 %), 1-(2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-propanol (12.23 %) and 1-(1-hydroxybutyl)-2, 5-dimethoxybenzene (5.53 %). The essential oil showed pertinent larvicidal effect, and the LC₅₀ value in 24 h was 26.10 ppm (LC₉₀ = 82.83 ppm). Aromatic plants and their essential oils are very important sources of many compounds that are used for different applications, and they are more promising pesticides or insecticides for control of mosquito populations than synthetic ones. The results of the present investigation justify the larvicidal potential of leaf essential oil of O. gratissimum as a safer and more effective larvicide against A. albopictus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aOcimum gratissimum 3achemical composition 3achemical compounds 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainsecticides 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3aleaves 3alethal concentration 50 3amosquito control 3avector control1 aThoppil, John E.0 tParasitology research.g2016 Feb., v. 115, no. 2 p.673-680dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4786-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012300172300001800295520155100313592002801864650002401892650001801916650001801934650001101952650001301963650002101976650003001997650001102027650000902038650002102047650000902068650001702077650001302094653000802107653001502115653001602130653001702146653001502163653002702178700002902205700001802234700001902252700002502271700002302296773009902319856008602418852000902504655001202513IND60531456820221120092029.0190319e20160725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053145682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaveh, Daryan A.10aParenteral adenoviral boost enhances BCG induced protection, but not long term survival in a murine model of bovine TB  ap. 4003-4011.  aBoosting BCG using heterologous prime-boost represents a promising strategy for improved tuberculosis (TB) vaccines, and adenovirus (Ad) delivery is established as an efficacious boosting vehicle. Although studies demonstrate that intranasal administration of Ad boost to BCG offers optimal protection, this is not currently possible in cattle. Using Ad vaccine expressing the mycobacterial antigen TB10.4 (BCG/Ad-TB10.4), we demonstrate, parenteral boost of BCG immunised mice to induce specific CD8+ IFN-γ producing T cells via synergistic priming of new epitopes. This induces significant improvement in pulmonary protection against Mycobacterium bovis over that provided by BCG when assessed in a standard 4week challenge model. However, in a stringent, year-long survival study, BCG/Ad-TB10.4 did not improve outcome over BCG, which we suggest may be due to the lack of additional memory cells (IL-2+) induced by boosting. These data indicate BCG-prime/parenteral-Ad-TB10.4-boost to be a promising candidate, but also highlight the need for further understanding of the mechanisms of T cell priming and associated memory using Ad delivery systems. That we were able to generate significant improvement in pulmonary protection above BCG with parenteral, rather than mucosal administration of boost vaccine is critical; suggesting that the generation of effective mucosal immunity is possible, without the risks and challenges of mucosal administration, but that further work to specifically enhance sustained protective immunity is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3acattle 3aepitopes 3ainterferon-gamma 3aintranasal administration 3amemory 3amice 3amucosal immunity 3arisk 3atuberculosis 3avaccines 0aBCG 0aAdenovirus 0aPrime-boost 0aTuberculosis 0aProtection 0aParenteral vaccination1 aGarcia-Pelayo, M.

First, fine dispersed emulsions (5–60% (w/w) Miglyol; 2, 5, and 8% (w/w) aqueous Na-Cas) were prepared using a high pressure homogenizer. Second, microbial transglutaminase was added to Na-Cas-stabilized emulsions (37°C, 15h, pH6.8) to initiate Na-Cas crosslinking. Texture profile analysis and rheological measurements indicated that at low protein concentrations droplet–droplet inter-crosslinking occurred above a critical oil volume concentration (coil>0.6) yielding particle gels. There, strength of the droplet networks formed depended on oil droplet. At high Na-Cas contents, crosslinking of excess Na-Cas in the aqueous phase occurred and particle-filled continuous gels were formed instead. Theoretical calculations of mean distances between droplets and diffusion coefficients of droplets indicate that a certain probability of contact was required for microbial transglutaminase to be able to crosslink droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3agelation 3agels 3aoils 3aprobability 3aprotein content 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3asodium caseinate 3atexture 0aTransglutaminase 0aOil-in-water emulsion 0aCrosslinking 0aCritical concentration 0aDroplet network 0aProtein1 aBeicht, Johanna1 aEisele, Thomas1 aGibis, Monika1 aFischer, Lutz1 aWeiss, Jochen0 tFood research international.g2013 Dec., v. 54, no. 2 p.1712-1721dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014600168300001600314520095300330592002801283650002201311650002601333650000901359650001101368650000901379650001101388650002001399700002001419700002101439700001801460700002501478700002501503773011601528856008101644852000901725655001201734IND60083162420221119132548.0141101e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008316242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2011.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelli, Silvia10aInhibition of human DNA topoisomerase IB by a Cyclometalated Gold III compound: Analysis on the different steps of the enzyme catalytic cycle  ap. 108-112.  aA gold(III) compound [Au(C^N^C)(IMe)]CF₃SO₃ (Gold III) has been reported to have anticancer properties as it is able to reduce topoisomerase IB activity in vitro and suppress tumor growth in nude mice model. Here we have investigated the mechanism of inhibition of human topoisomerase IB activity by this compound, analyzing the various steps of the catalytic cycle. DNA supercoiled relaxation and the cleavage reaction are inhibited, but Gold III does not perturb the religation reaction, in contrast to what has been observed for camptothecin. Pre-incubation of enzyme with the inhibitor before adding DNA substrate increases the inhibitory effect. In addition, when Gold III is preincubated with the enzyme it prevents the stabilization of the cleavable complex by camptothecin. The analysis of the DNA-topoisomerase binding reaction indicates that the compound acts as a topoisomerase I inhibitor by preventing the enzyme–DNA interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aantineoplastic agents 3agold 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3asupercoiled DNA1 aVassallo, Oscar1 aKatkar, Prafulla1 aChe, Chi-Ming1 aSun, Raymond Wai-Yin1 aDesideri, Alessandro0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 516, no. 2 p.108-112dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2011.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010100159520113800260592002801398650002501426650000801451650001401459650002301473650001701496650001101513650001501524650001101539650001001550650001201560651002301572700001801595700002501613700002401638773012201662856007401784852000901858655001201867IND60760893820221121030828.0211223e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076089382DNAL7 a10.3390/v131223942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmman, Brian R.10aMarburg Virus Persistence on Fruit as a Plausible Route of Bat to Primate Filovirus Transmission  aMarburg virus (MARV), the causative agent of Marburg virus disease, emerges sporadically in sub-Saharan Africa and is often fatal in humas. The natural reservoir for this zoonotic virus is the frugivorous Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) that when infected, sheds virus in the highest amounts in oral secretions and urine. Being fruit bats, these animals forage nightly for ripened fruit throughout the year, including those types often preferred by humans. During feeding, they continually discard partially eaten fruit on the ground that could then be consumed by other Marburg virus susceptible animals or humans. In this study, using qRT-PCR and virus isolation, we tested fruit discarded by Egyptian rousette bats experimentally infected with a natural bat isolate of Marburg virus. We then separately tested viral persistence on fruit varieties commonly cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa using a recombinant Marburg virus expressing the fluorescent ZsGreen1. Marburg virus RNA was repeatedly detected on fruit in the food bowls of the infected bats and viable MARV was recovered from inoculated fruit for up to 6 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarburg marburgvirus 3aRNA 3aRousettus 3aetiological agents 3afluorescence 3aforage 3afrugivores 3afruits 3aurine 3aviruses 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aSchuh, Amy J.1 aAlbariño, César G.1 aTowner, Jonathan S.0 tViruses.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131223943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04350naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001300137245018600150300001600336520248600352592002802838650002802866650003102894650001402925650002302939650000802962650002202970650001702992650003203009650002703041650002303068650001603091650002503107650002803132650001403160650000903174650000703183650001903190650001703209650001403226650001103240650001003251650002403261650001903285651001003304653001403314653002203328653003303350653001103383653003703394700001603431700001403447700001603461700001603477700001203493700001303505773011403518856007103632852000903703655001203712IND60626874820221120183401.0190102s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062687482DNAL7 a10.1071/AN160622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, L.10aEffects of applying lactic acid bacteria and propionic acid on fermentation quality, aerobic stability and in vitro gas production of forage-based total mixed ration silage in Tibet  ap. 376-383.  aTotal mixed ration (TMR) silage technology has been practically used to feed ruminants in Tibet. This study was conducted on forage-based TMR to evaluate the effects of supplementing lactic acid bacteria and propionic acid on its fermentation characteristics, aerobic stability and in vitro gas production kinetics and digestibility. Experimental treatments included four variants: (1) TMR supplemented with 10 mL deionised water per kilogram fresh matter (Control); (2) TMR supplemented with 1 × 106 cfu/g Lactobacillus plantarum (L); (3) TMR supplemented with 0.3% propionic acid (P); (4) TMR supplemented with a combination of 1 × 106 cfu/g Lactobacillus plantarum and 0.3% propionic acid (LP). The latter three additives were first dissolved in deionised water and then applied as a water solution (10 mL/kg fresh matter). All treatments were ensiled in laboratory-scale silos for 45 days, and then exposed to air for 12 days to evaluate the aerobic stability of TMR silage. Further, the four experimental treatments were fermented with buffered rumen fluid to measure in vitro gas production and nutrients’ digestibility. The results indicated that all TMR silages possessed good fermentation characteristics with low pH values (<4.18) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) contents (<100 g/kg total nitrogen), and high lactic acid contents (>66 g/kg DM) and Flieg points (>80). The addition of L and LP stimulated a more efficient homofermentation of TMR silage than in the variant without L, as evidenced by higher ratios of lactic:acetic acid. The addition of P had no effect (P > 0.05) on lactic acid production of TMR silage compared with the Control, whereas it decreased NH3-N content (P < 0.05). Under aerobic conditions, L silage showed less aerobic stability compared with the Control silage, whereas P and LP silages were more (P < 0.05) aerobically stable. Compared with the Control, all additives elevated (P < 0.05) the total gas production and in vitro dry matter digestibility of TMR silages. L silage had a higher (P < 0.05) in vitro neutral detergent fibre digestibility than the Control silage. Data obtained from this study suggested that TMR silage based on oat and common vetch can be well conserved with or without additives. Lactic acid bacteria were compatible with propionic acid, and addition of lactic acid bacteria together with propionic acid can improve the fermentation quality, aerobic stability and in vitro dry matter digestibility of TMR silage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aVicia sativa subsp. sativa 3aadditives 3aaerobic conditions 3aair 3aammonium nitrogen 3afermentation 3agas production (biological) 3ain vitro digestibility 3ain vitro digestion 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrients 3aoats 3apH 3apropionic acid 3arumen fluids 3aruminants 3asilage 3asilos 3atotal mixed rations 3atotal nitrogen 3aChina 0aadditives 0aaerobic stability 0afermentation characteristics 0aforage 0ain vitro gas production kinetics1 aYuan, X.

They were examined in terms of their composition and emulsion stabilizing capacity in model acidic emulsions (hexadecane-in-water at pH3.0). Extracted polysaccharides were assessed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and FTIR spectroscopy. The properties and stability of the resulting emulsions were examined by means of droplet size distribution and ζ-potential measurements, viscometry, fluorescence microscopy and protein interface concentration. As emulsifiers, both extracts produce emulsions of initially monomodal size distribution and of similar average droplet size, while ζ-potential was negative for both. The emulsions prepared using OE6 are relatively stable in terms of droplet size distribution and average droplet size after 30days of storage, while emulsions prepared with OE4 increase in droplet size, in part attributable to Ostwald ripening. Determination of the protein interface coverage Γ suggests that the increased stability of the OE6 emulsions should be attributed to the higher protein load of the interfaces prepared using this extract, resulting to increased rigidity of the interface. Viscosity of emulsions containing OE6 was two times greater than OE4 while aging increases the viscosity of both emulsions. The present work suggests that okra extracts can be strong candidates for emulsification in acidic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbelmoschus esculentus 3aokra 3apectins 3aemulsifying 3adroplet size 3aviscosity 3aviscometry 3aemulsifiers 3agel chromatography 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aripening 3aemulsions 3afluorescence microscopy 3apods 0aMicroscopy 0aOkra 0aOstwald ripening 0aPectins 0asize exclusion chromatography 0aEmulsions 0aRheology1 aRitzoulis, C.1 aGeorgiadis, N.1 aKontogiorgos, V.0 tFood research international.g2013 Dec., v. 54, no. 2 p.1730-1737dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245013700156300001600293520169600309592002802005650001502033650001002048650003002058650001302088650001502101650002502116650001502141650002002156650000902176650001202185650002302197650002002220651001402240653002502254653002202279653002202301653002302323653002302346700001902369773011702388856007102505852000902576655001202585IND60626351620221121140315.0181220s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062635162DNAL7 a10.1071/BT180562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilcock, J. L.10aUsing evidence of decline and extinction risk to identify priority regions, habitats and threats for plant conservation in Australia  ap. 541-555.  aThreatened species lists are used at global, national and regional scales to identify species at risk of extinction. Many species are listed due to restricted population size or geographic distribution, and decline is often inferred rather than quantified. Vascular plants comprise over 70% of nationally listed threatened species, but there is an incomplete picture of which species are most at risk of extinction, where these occur and the factors behind their declines. We compiled published information and the best available field knowledge including 125 expert interviews to identify declining and at risk species. The candidate list comprised 1135 taxa, which were mostly listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered under Federal and/or State legislation, but included 80 that are currently unlisted but considered to be highly threatened. In total, 418 taxa were assessed as having a documented, suspected or projected continuing decline. These were ranked based on extinction risk and magnitude of continuing decline, which suggest that 296 are at risk of extinction under current management regimes, including 55 at high risk of extinction. Declining and imperilled taxa are concentrated in a relatively small number of regions and habitats, and six threatening processes are driving the majority of declines. Field surveys and robust, repeatable monitoring are required to better inform population trends and extinction risk, as well as inform the status of almost 200 taxa that are potentially imperilled but poorly known. Identification of declining taxa can identify key issues for flora conservation across a continent, and allow for targeted and efficient recovery efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextinction 3aflora 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ainterviews 3alaws and regulations 3amonitoring 3apopulation size 3arisk 3asurveys 3athreatened species 3avascular plants 3aAustralia 0aconservation biology 0aendangered plants 0aplant communities 0aplant conservation 0aspecies extinction1 aFensham, R.

E. gyrotis had overlapping-generations, and the density of larvae and pupae of E. gyrotis varied seasonally. Analysis of the temporal relationship between the density of E. gyrotis and the percentage parasitism revealed a tendency toward positive density-dependent attack by the parasitoid Apanteles sp. (ater-group) (Braconidae) on early-stage E. gyrotis larvae, and inverse density-dependent attack by Goniozus japonicus (Bethylidae) in late-stage larvae. However, no temporal density-dependent attack was observed by the pupal parasitoids Brachymeria excarinata (Chalcididae), B. lasus, and Itoplectis alternans spectabilis (Ichneumonidae). These different responses to host density by the parasitoid species were discussed in terms of the mode of parasitism, the host stages attacked, host-searching behavior, and the effect on the host population. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aHymenoptera 3ahost-parasite relationships 3adevelopmental stages 3aTortricidae 3aseasonal variation 3apopulation density 3aJapan 0aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests 0adensity dependence1 aOsawa, N.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2002 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.988-994dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-31.6.9883Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02285naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245020500170300001200375500001500387520106800402592002801470650002201498650001101520650002101531650001201552650001601564650001701580650001201597650001901609650001301628650002301641653001801664700002401682773007801706856008301784990002301867852000901890655001201899IND60094624020221119032925.0141104e20120416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009462402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokhtari, Bahram10aInclusion desalination of alkali metal cations by emulsion liquid membranes and nano-baskets of p-tert-calix[4]arene bearing di-[N-(X)sulfonyl carboxamide] and di-(1-propoxy) in para-cone conformation  ap. 1-8.  a2019-12-06  aNano-assisted inclusion separation of alkali metal cations from basic aqueous solutions was reported by inclusion-facilitated emulsion liquid membrane process.

The dosing level and frequency of omalizumab are guided by a dosing table based on the total serum IgE and bodyweight. Nonlinear mixed-effect pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulation techniques described the binding between omalizumab and its target IgE. The population PKPD analysis was conducted using data from the nine studies included originally in the European application of dosing table expansion together with three Japanese clinical studies to assess the influence of the ethnicity. Statistically significant differences between the ethnic groups were detected. These were small, within or close to bioequivalence criteria. The model described the primary pharmacology in Caucasian and Japanese patients, both adult and paediatric, with simulations showing that the interplay between the clearance, volume and binding affinity parameters was such that there was no clinical impact of the Japanese ethnic differences on either drug PK or free IgE suppression and hence the required posology.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAllergic asthma 0aAnti-immunoglobulin E 0aDosing table 0aModeling and simulation 0aOmalizumab1 aGautier, Aurélie1 aPaule, Ines1 aYamaguchi, Masayuki1 aLowe, Philip J.0 tDrug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics.g2016 June, v. 31 p.173-184dElsevier LtdaThe Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobioticsx1347-43677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dmpk.2015.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245014600171300001400317520122400331592002801555650001701583650002001600650002001620700001601640700001501656700001701671700001801688773008001706856008301786990002301869852000901892655001201901IND60094624120221119032732.0141104e20120416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009462412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zheng-Qing14aThe performance of the PVDF-Fe₃O₄ ultrafiltration membrane and the effect of a parallel magnetic field used during the membrane formation  ap. 64-72.  aA series of PVDF–Fe₃O₄ ultrafiltration membranes with different amounts of Fe₃O₄ were prepared in a parallel magnetic field or without a magnetic field from suspensions, using the phase inversion process. A comparison of membrane properties was conducted. When the Fe₃O₄ content in a membrane was below 65wt%, both of the Fe₃O₄ content and the magnetic field used during the formation of membrane had no dramatic influence on the flux and the fouling-resistance ability of a PVDF–Fe₃O₄ ultrafiltration membrane. However, the initial rejection of a PVDF–Fe₃O₄ ultrafiltration membrane increased with the Fe₃O₄ content in a membrane. When the Fe₃O₄ content in a membrane reached 65wt%, the external magnetic field forced magnetic Fe₃O₄ particles in a casting solution to arrange along the direction of the magnetic field during the membrane formation. As a result, a novel membrane with “lamellar macrovoids” in the sublayer could be prepared. The PVDF–Fe₃O₄ membrane of 70wt% Fe₃O₄ with“lamellar macrovoids” in the sublayer had the best comprehensive performance in terms of pure water flux, rejection and fouling- resistance and compaction-resistance ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3amagnetic fields 3aultrafiltration1 aZheng, Feng1 aZhang, Zhi1 aXu, Hong-Tao1 aZhou, Kai-Mei0 tDesalination.g2012 Apr. 16, v. 292 p.64-72dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.02.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01816naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009300158520092200251592002801173650003101201650000801232650000801240650001501248700001901263700002201282700001701304773012201321856007401443852000901517655001201526IND60760894220221120230141.0211223e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076089422DNAL7 a10.3390/v131223982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaolei 10aSystemic and Intestinal Viral Reservoirs in CD4+ T Cell Subsets in Primary SIV Infection  aThe HIV reservoir size in target CD4+ T cells during primary infection remains unknown.

Collectively, memory CD4+ T cells appear to be the major targets for primary infection, and viral reservoirs are equally distributed in systemic and lymphoid compartments in acutely SIV-infected macaques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aintestines1 aZiani, Widade 1 aVeazey, Ronald S.1 aXu, Huanbin 0 tViruses.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131223983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011200172520193200284592002802216650001202244650001302256650001302269650002102282650001602303650001102319650001302330650001102343650001802354650000902372650001302381650002302394650001802417650001502435650001502450650002502465650002502490651001002515653000902525653002002534653001202554653001702566653001602583700002402599700001902623700002502642773011602667856008402783852000902867655001202876IND60670338220221118022558.0191227e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067033822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1058292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVisconti, Fernando10aEffects of three irrigation systems on ‘Piel de sapo’ melon yield and quality under salinity conditions  aThe melon crop is moderately sensitive to soil salinity and, as a consequence, its yield decreases under saline conditions. Nevertheless, the exposure to moderate salinity also influences the melon quality by improving it, which offers compensation to the farmer. As a consequence, in moderately salt-affected lands, like the traditional irrigation area of the ‘Vega Baja del Segura’ (Alicante, Spain), melons are being grown. In this area the modernization of the secular irrigation system through the replacement of flood by drip systems, is currently being fostered. This fact, however, is generating some controversy, due to the known salt leaching effect that flood irrigation followed by drainage makes in the soil. In this study, the effects of three irrigation systems, namely, drip (DI), subsurface drip (SDI) and flood (FI), on soil salinity and thus, on the yield and quality of the melon, were compared. According to the results, the FI system kept the soil salt levels during the growth period at 4.1 ± 0.3 dS/m, that is, significantly lower than the 4.7 ± 0.2 dS/m attained with the DI and SDI systems. Nevertheless, the DI and, overall, SDI, provided higher and more homogenous soil moisture completely counteracting the effect of salinity as revealed by the soil water potential calculations. As a result, the SDI gave 27 ± 5 Mg/ha of total yield in comparison to 23 ± 2 Mg/ha (DI) and 20 ± 6 Mg/ha (FI). Besides, the SDI system reduced the number of damaged melons, thus additionally contributing to the significant higher marketable yield of the SDI (25 ± 4 Mg/ha) in comparison to the DI (20 ± 1 Mg/ha) and the FI (19 ± 7 Mg/ha). On the contrary, in the SDI treatment the fruit soluble solids content, tritatable acidity and pulp firmness decreased a bit, however, in the sensory evaluation no differences among irrigation treatments were observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3adrainage 3afirmness 3aflood irrigation 3afruit yield 3afruits 3aleaching 3amelons 3amodernization 3apulp 3asalinity 3asensory evaluation 3asoil salinity 3asoil salts 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3atotal soluble solids 3aSpain 0aDrip 0aSubsurface drip 0aTrickle 0aCucumis melo 0aPostharvest1 aSalvador, Alejandra1 aNavarro, Pilar1 ade Paz, José Miguel0 tAgricultural water management.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 226 p.105829-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1058293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04086naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011600172500001900288520230200307592002802609650001002637650001302647650001402660650000902674650002002683650001602703650001802719650001802737650001802755650002202773650001302795650001702808650001102825650001702836650001302853650002802866650001302894650002302907650002002930650001902950650001802969650001902987650001103006650001103017650001403028650001503042653001203057653002203069653002303091653002503114700002403139700002503163700002403188700002403212700001903236773009903255856008503354852000903439655001203448IND60722480020221119221943.0210311e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072248002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTayengwa, Tawanda10aComparative effects of feeding citrus pulp and grape pomace on nutrient digestibility and utilization in steers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFeedlot beef production in tropics and subtropics is being limited by shortage of feed ingredients due to prolonged droughts resulting in high prices of cereal grains and reduced profitability. To alleviate feed shortages and increase profitability for the feedlot industry, it is important to explore underutilized non-conventional resources such as fruit by-products. The current study compared the nutrient intake, digestibility and utilization effects of feeding either 150 g/kg of dried citrus pulp (DCP) or grape pomace (DGP) as alternative dietary fibre sources to 7 months-old Angus steers (281 ± 15.7 kg) under feedlot conditions. Twenty-four steers were assigned to three dietary treatments (8 steers/treatment) in a completely randomised design. Each steer was treated as an experimental unit. Steers were adapted to diets for 21 d followed by 7 d of sample collection during which nutrient intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation parameters, nitrogen retention and microbial N supply were determined. All the data were analysed using the GLIMMIX procedures. Overall, steers fed DGP had the greatest dry matter intake (DM), organic matter (OM) crude protein (CP), ash free neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom), ether extract (EE) and starch intake followed by DCP and control (CON) diets (P ≤ .05). Apparent digestibilities of DM, OM and aNDFom were higher (P ≤ .05) for DCP diet compared to DGP and CON diets. Feeding DCP and DGP diets increased ruminal concentrations of total volatile fatty acids, acetate and isovalerate, and acetate to propionate ratio, and reduced propionate concentrations compared to the CON diet (P ≤ .05). The steers fed the CON diet had the greatest urinary excretions of allantoin, uric acid and total purine derivatives followed by those fed the DCP and DGP diets (P ≤ .05). Nitrogen intake, faecal nitrogen (N), N retention and N efficiency utilization were in the order of DGP > DCP > CON diets (P ≤ .05). Overall, feeding DGP as alternative fibre source to wheat bran improved nutrient intake, retention and efficiency of N utilization but reduced apparent nutrient digestibility compared to DCP. Current finding suggests that DGP may be a better fibre substitute for wheat bran in beef diets than DCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aacetates 3aallantoin 3abeef 3abeef production 3acitrus pulp 3acrude protein 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3afeedlots 3afermentation 3afruits 3agrape pomace 3aindustry 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3anitrogen retention 3anutrient intake 3aorganic matter 3aprofitability 3apropionic acid 3astarch 3asteers 3auric acid 3awheat bran 0aPectins 0aProanthocyanidins 0aPurine derivatives 0aVolatile fatty acids1 aChikwanha, Obert C.1 aRaffrenato, Emiliano1 aDugan, Michael E.R.1 aMutsvangwa, Timothy1 aMapiye, Cletos0 tAnimal.g2021 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.100020-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2020.1000203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245010500179300001500284520122900299592002801528650001501556650001701571650001101588650001501599650001801614650001401632650002001646650003301666650001001699650001501709650002201724700001701746700002001763700001501783700002001798700001901818773008101837856008301918990002302001852000902024655001202033IND60094624320221119032950.0141104e20120416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009462432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2012.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanghorban Esfahani, Iman10aModeling and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization of the MED-TVC desalination system  ap. 87-104.  aThis study proposes a systematic approach of analysis and optimization of the multi-effect distillation-thermal vapor compression (MED-TVC) desalination system. The effect of input variables, such as temperature difference, motive steam mass flow rate, and preheated feed water temperature was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) and partial least squares (PLS) technique. Mathematical and economical models with exergy analysis were used for total annual cost (TAC), gain output ratio (GOR) and fresh water flow rate (Q). Multi-objective optimization (MOO) to minimize TAC and maximize GOR and Q was performed using a genetic algorithm (GA) based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Best Pareto optimal solution selected from the Pareto sets showed that the MED-TVC system with 6 effects is the best system among the systems with 3, 4, 5 and 6 effects, which has a minimum value of unit product cost (UPC) and maximum values of GOR and Q. The system with 6 effects under the optimum operation conditions can save 14%, 12.5%, 2% in cost and reduces the amount of steam used for the production of 1m³ of fresh water by 50%, 34% and 18% as compared to systems with 3, 4 and 5 effects, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adesalination 3aexergy 3afreshwater 3aleast squares 3amass flow 3aneural networks 3aresponse surface methodology 3asteam 3awater flow 3awater temperature1 aAtaei, Abtin1 aShetty K, Vidya1 aOh, TaeSuk1 aPark, Jae Hyung1 aYoo, ChangKyoo0 tDesalination.g2012 Apr. 16, v. 292 p.87-104dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013400164300001800298520127800316536011701594592002801711596011701739650001501856650002601871650002201897650003001919650002701949650002201976650001601998650001202014650001102026650000902037650000902046650001402055650001502069650002102084650001102105650002202116650001802138650002002156650001802176650000902194651001002203653001102213653002502224653002802249653002802277700001702305700001602322700001202338700001602350700001402366700001402380700001902394773013102413856008502544852000902629655001202638IND60667718020221118070420.0190919e20191003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066771802DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2018.14752142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Jing10aStudy on ecological protection and rehabilitation technology of a reservoir-type water source in the northeastern region of China  ap. 1802-1815.  aSurface water is the main source of water for human life and production.

The organic silicone nanomicelles containing highly dispersed dyes were prepared. Organic silicone oil as a polymer organic phase was successfully used as nanoemulsion by solvent evaporation technique. Three nanomicelles containing three dyes are all homogeneous liquid nanospheres with regular shape and size 40–60 nm, respectively. The dyes were highly dispersed in the nanoemulsion in molecules. Dyeing for PET fabrics can be carried out in low liquor ratio. The dye was slowly released from the nanomicelle in the dyeing process and improved the leveling property of the disperse dyes. The color yields of the polyester fabrics dyed by the nanomicelle dyeing were higher than those of the samples dyed by the traditional dyeing. During the dyeing process, the organic silicon was also as softening agent, which adsorbed on the surface of the fabric to provide a good soft handle. This technique combined dyeing and finishing processes together. The nanomicelle dyeing improved the dyeing properties of polyester fabrics and to save time and reduce the water consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adyeing 3adyes 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3afabrics 3aliquids 3amicelles 3ananoemulsions 3ananospheres 3aoils 3apets 3apolyesters 3asampling 3ashape 3asilicon 3asilicone 3asolvents 3awater 3ayields 0aSilicone nanoemulsion 0aNanomicelle dyeing 0aPolyester fabric 0aDispersive dyes 0aWater conservation1 aHu, Liu1 aZhang, Hongjuan1 aFu, Danna1 aHou, Aiqin1 aXie, Kongliang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 200 p.48-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.07.3123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245012900156300001600285520178500301592002802086650001302114650002102127650001502148650002002163650002402183650001202207650001602219650001302235650001902248650000902267650001002276650001602286653001402302653001602316653002002332653001602352700002102368700002302389700002102412700002402433773011402457856007102571852000902642655001202651IND60626875420221120173328.0190102s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062687542DNAL7 a10.1071/AN165712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomán, Lorena10aShade access in combination with sprinkling and ventilation effects performance of Holstein cows in early and late lactation  ap. 347-358.  aThe negative effect of heat stress on dairy cows, with a temperature humidity index (THI) over 72, has been extensively studied.

Thirty-nine multiparous, non-pregnant Holstein cows with more than 30 kg/cow.day of solid-corrected milk were used in a randomised complete block design to evaluate six treatments. The experimental design had a 3 by 2 factorial arrangement with three heat stress mitigation strategies: No shade (CON), access to shade only, and access to shade combined with sprinkling and ventilation, and two stages of lactation: early (S1) and late (S2), 12 ± 10.3 and 201 ± 45.8 days in milk respectively, for a duration of 81 consecutive days. All treatments, except CON had access to artificial shade from 0900 hours to 0500 hours next day. From 0500 hours to 0900 hours all cows were managed together in a grazing session. Additionally, sprinkling and ventilation cows had two 30-min sessions of ventilation and spray (0900 hours, 1530 hours). The average THI was 70.1 ± 4.46 (minimum THI: 60.4; maximum THI: 81.7) and the average hours above 72 were 7.8 ± 5.98. Animals in S1 presented higher solids-corrected milk reduction (P < 0.0001; 5.4 and 1.9 kg/cow.day), and protein yield (<0.0001; 0.13 and 0.54 kg/cow.day) than animals in S2 when shade was not allowed (CON). It was concluded that under these conditions, animal productivity is more negatively affected in early lactation animals. The use of shade with or without spray and ventilation mitigates heat stress effects on both stages of lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial shade 3adairy cows 3aearly lactation 3aexperimental design 3agrazing 3aheat stress 3ahumidity 3alate lactation 3amilk 3ashade 3atemperature 0adairy cow 0aheat stress 0amilk production 0atemperature1 aSaravia, Celmira1 aAstigarraga, Laura1 aBentancur, Oscar1 aLa Manna, Alejandro0 tAnimal production science.g2019, v. 59, no. 2 p.347-358dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl37620x1836-09397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN165713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245007900154300001800233520145900251592002801710650002101738650002401759650001201783650002001795650003101815650001001846650001901856650001101875653001301886653001501899653002701914653002601941653002001967653002401987700002202011700002802033700002402061700002502085700001902110700002202129700002702151773011602178856007102294852000902365655001202374IND60626352220221121173600.0181220s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062635222DNAL7 a10.1071/FP172472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaina, Danae10aExogenous induction of thermogenesis in Arum concinnatum by salicylic acid  ap. 1195-1204.  aArum concinnatum Schott is a highly thermogenic species, with the temperature of the appendix exceeding ~10.9°C above the ambient temperature during thermogenesis, whereas the rates of respiration of the male florets in intact inflorescences peak at 0.92μmol s-1 g-1, which is the highest rate so far measured among the plants. Here, we attempt the ex situ exogenous induction of thermogenesis in whole inflorescences and in separate appendices of the spadix, and explore the thermogenic patterns under controlled laboratory conditions of light and temperature. Mature but unopened inflorescences and appendices showed thermogenic responses when treated with salicylic acid (SA), but not when treated with distilled water (control). With regard to light conditions, the responses revealed only one significant difference for inflorescences, which concerns the higher maximum temperature in the continuous light treatment compared with continuous dark. Along the ambient temperature gradient, at the lowest temperature edge individuals remained stable close to ambient temperature and to control. These findings suggest that, in general, ex situ exogenous induction of thermogenesis can be achieved in whole inflorescences and in separate appendices of spadix of A. concinnatum using SA. This study also indicates that SA acts independently of light conditions, while exogenous induction of thermogenesis takes place within an ambient temperature range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArum concinnatum 3aambient temperature 3aflorets 3aheat production 3alaboratory experimentation 3amales 3asalicylic acid 3aspadix 0aappendix 0abiophysics 0alight/dark photoperiod 0aswitching temperature 0atolerance range 0awhole inflorescence1 aOikonomou, Ioanna1 aKoutroumpa, Konstantina1 aBariotakis, Michael1 aKotzabasis, Kiriakos1 aIto, Kikukatsu1 aSeymour, Roger S.1 aPirintsos, Stergios A.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2018, v. 45, no. 12 p.1195-1204dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP172473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245013600198300001800334500001900352500002000371520127500391592002801666596007401694650001801768650001201786650002001798650001701818650001301835650001301848700006201861700001701923700002101940700002401961700001901985700001702004773013602021856007402157852000902231655001202240IND60739343920221121041551.0210527e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073934392DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.138212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEntrican, Gary1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8822-233110aConstruction of generic roadmaps for the strategic coordination of global research into infectious diseases of animals and zoonoses  ap. 1513-1520.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Strategic Alliance for Research into Infectious Diseases of Animals and Zoonoses (STAR‐IDAZ) International Research Consortium (IRC) coordinates global animal health research to accelerate delivery of disease control tools and strategies. With this vision, STAR‐IDAZ IRC has constructed four generic research roadmaps for the development of candidate vaccines, diagnostic tests, therapeutics and control strategies for animal diseases. The roadmaps for vaccines, diagnostic tests and therapeutics lead towards a desired target product profile (TPP). These interactive roadmaps describe the building blocks and for each the key research questions, dependencies, challenges and possible solution routes to identify the basic research needed for translation to the TPP. The control strategies roadmap encompasses the vaccine, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic roadmaps within a wider framework focusing on the inter‐dependence of multiple tools and knowledge to control diseases for the benefit of animal and human health. The roadmaps are now being completed for specific diseases and complemented by state‐of‐the‐art information on relevant projects and publications to ensure that the necessary research gaps are addressed for selected priority diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a727494cEuropean Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme 3aanimal health 3aanimals 3adisease control 3atherapeutics 3avaccines 3azoonoses1 aCharlier, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1332-14581 aDalton, Luke1 aMessori, Stefano1 aŚarmā, Sādhanā,1 aTaylor, Robert1 aMorrow, Alex0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2021 May, v. 68, no. 3 p.1513-1520dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.138213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245012500200500002000325520169300345592002802038596006302066596003402129596002802163596002802191650001902219650002002238650001502258650000902273650001402282650001202296650001602308650001102324650001302335650001102348650001502359650001902374651001002393700005902403700002002462700002502482773013602507856007702643852000902720655001202729IND60790229120221122034824.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079022912DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0194752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlug, Jacob D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4293-979110aStorage and Evolution of Laguna del Maule Rhyolites: Insight From Volatile and Trace Element Contents in Melt Inclusions  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInterpreting unrest at silicic volcanoes requires knowledge of the magma storage conditions and dynamics that precede eruptions. The Laguna del Maule volcanic field, Chile, has erupted ~40 km³ of rhyolite over the last 20 ka. Astonishing rates of sustained surface inflation at >25 cm/year for >12 years reveal a large, restless system. Integration of geochronologic, petrologic, geomorphic, and geophysical observations provides an unusually rich context to interpret ongoing and prehistoric processes. We present new volatile (H₂O, CO₂, S, F, and Cl), trace element, and major element concentrations from 109 melt inclusions hosted in quartz, plagioclase, and olivine from seven eruptions. Silicic melts contain up to 8.0 wt. % H₂O and 570 ppm CO₂. In rhyolites melt inclusions track decompression‐driven fractional crystallization as magma ascended from ~14 to 4 km. This mirrors teleseismic tomography and magnetotelluric findings that reveal a domain containing partial melt spanning from 14 to 4 km. Ce and Cl contents of rhyolites support the generation of compositionally distinct domains of eruptible rhyolite within the larger reservoir. Heat, volatiles, and melt derived from episodic mafic recharge likely incubate and grow the shallow reservoir. Olivine‐hosted melt inclusions in mafic tephra contain up to 2.5 wt. % H₂O and 1,140 ppm CO₂ and proxy for the volatile load delivered via recharge into the base of the silicic mush at ~14 to 8 km. We propose that mafic recharge flushes deeper reaches of the magma reservoir with CO₂ that propels H₂O exsolution, upward accumulation of fluid, pressurization, and triggering of rhyolitic eruptions.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Wisconsin‐Madison Department of Geoscience  cGeological Society of America  aEAR‐1322595cU.S. NSF  aEAR‐1411779cU.S. NSF 3acarbon dioxide 3acrystallization 3ageophysics 3aheat 3ainflation 3aolivine 3aplagioclase 3aquartz 3aresearch 3atephra 3atomography 3atrace elements 3aChile1 aSinger, Brad S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3595-51681 aKita, Noriko T.1 aSpicuzza, Michael J.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB019475-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0194753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009800164300001400262520154600276592002801822650002501850650001701875650002701892650001501919650002001934650001901954650001301973650002001986650001702006650001302023650002702036650001102063650002202074650002602096650001002122650002002132650001902152650001202171650001402183650001002197650002502207653001902232653002402251653001802275653000902293653001002302653001802312700002502330700001902355700002302374773011802397856008302515852000902598655001202607IND60639411220221116163219.0190624e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063941122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2019.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMami, Sajad10aEvaluation of Biological Indicators of Fatigue and Muscle Damage in Arabian Horses After Race  ap. 74-78.  aThe aim of this study was to assay changes in blood biochemical parameters that resulted from exercise-induced muscle fatigue in horses participating in the two races (1,250 and 1,400 meters). Six male Arabian horses (3 to 6 years old) were used in this study. Blood samples were collected at time intervals including 1 hour before the race, immediately after the race, 1 and 24 hours after the end of race. Catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities, the blood level of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured, as well as muscle damage biomarkers including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) activities, and myoglobin were measured. The results showed that CAT activity and plasma TAC in the horse increased immediately after the race and then gradually decreased. The highest GPX activity in red blood cells was recorded 1 hour before the start of the race. Superoxide dismutase showed an incremental pattern after the race. Immediately after the race, there was a significant increase in the plasma levels of AST, which continued until 1 hour after the race. The activity of LDH and CK reached its highest value 1 hour after the race. According to our findings, it can be concluded that the horses were tired and antioxidant enzymes altered under fatigue conditions. Muscle damage biomarkers have increased, but these increases were in their natural ranges and did not indicate muscle damage in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiomarkers 3ablood chemistry 3ablood sampling 3acatalase 3acreatine kinase 3aerythrocytes 3aexercise 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahorses 3aindicator species 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amuscle fatigue 3amuscles 3amyoglobin 3araces 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aMuscle fatigue 0aAntioxidant defense 0aArabian horse 0aRace 0aBlood 0aMuscle damage1 aKhaje, Gholamhossein1 aShahriari, Ali1 aGooraninejad, Saad0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2019 July, v. 78 p.74-78dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2019.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245014100197300001600338500001100354520123600365592002801601596005901629650001501688650001801703650002101721650001701742650001101759650001101770650002101781650001701802700001201819700001501831700001701846700001601863700002601879700001601905700001501921700001801936773015201954856007302106852000902179655001202188IND60749852820221121222732.0210908e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074985282DNAL7 a10.1111/jvp.129762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Kaixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1411-953110aApplication of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models to promote the development of veterinary drugs with high efficacy and safety  ap. 663-678.  aREVIEW  aPhysiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have become important tools for the development of novel human drugs. Food‐producing animals and pets comprise an important part of human life, and the development of veterinary drugs (VDs) has greatly impacted human health. Owing to increased affordability of and demand for drug development, VD manufacturing companies should have more PBPK models required to reduce drug production costs. So far, little attention has been paid on applying PBPK models for the development of VDs. This review begins with the development processes of VDs; then summarizes case studies of PBPK models in human or VD development; and analyzes the application, potential, and advantages of PBPK in VD development, including candidate screening, formulation optimization, food effects, target‐species safety, and dosing optimization. Then, the challenges of applying the PBPK model to VD development are discussed. Finally, future opportunities of PBPK models in designing dosing regimens for intracellular pathogenic infections and for efficient oral absorption of VDs are further forecasted. This review will be relevant to readers who are interested in using a PBPK model to develop new VDs.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aabsorption 3aaffordability 3adrug development 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amodels 3apharmacokinetics 3atherapeutics1 aMi, Kun1 aMa, Wenjin1 aXu, Xiangyue1 aHuo, Meixia1 aAlgharib, Samah Attia1 aPan, Yuanhu1 aXie, Shuyu1 aHuang, Lingli0 tJournal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics.g2021 Sept., v. 44, no. 5 p.663-678dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51172x0140-77837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvp.129763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013500168300001600303520096700319592002801286650002701314650002001341650001501361650001101376650002401387650001501411650001001426650001201436650001201448650001101460650001101471650001501482650001001497650001901507650001001526650002201536650001001558650001201568651001101580653001801591653002801609653002401637653003101661700002501692700002301717700002601740700002901766773017401795856008201969852000902051655001202060IND60581001720221118001023.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058100172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rbe.2017.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Maria G.A.10aIdentification and pest status of Holopothrips fulvus (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) on dwarf-cashew crops in northeastern Brazil  ap. 271-274.  aCashew, Anacardium occidentale L. (Anacardiaceae), is one of the most important sources of agricultural income in northeastern Brazil, but many of the arthropods associated with the crop have yet to be identified. We describe here for the first time the damage caused by Holopothrips fulvus (Morgan) (Thysanoptera: Phlaeothripidae) to dwarf-cashew trees cultivated in the municipality of Pacajús, Ceará, Brazil. Leaf tissue injuries were caused by the sucking mouthparts of the insect and were characterized by dark necrotic spots on the epidermis that resulted in yellowing, wilting and, ultimately, abscission of the leaves. H. fulvus also fed on developing kernels and pseudofruits producing injuries that manifested in the form of chlorotic specks. Additional information is given on the pest status and important aspects of the morphology of the insect, including sexual dimorphism, redescription of the adults and description of the second instar larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aPhlaeothripidae 3aabscission 3aadults 3aagricultural income 3aarthropods 3acrops 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amouthparts 3apests 3aredescriptions 3aseeds 3asexual dimorphism 3atrees 3awilting 3aBrazil 0aAnacardiaceae 0aCashew crop infestation 0aLeaf-feeding thrips 0aPlant–insect association1 aDias-Pini, Nívia S.1 aLima, Élison F.B.1 aMaciel, Gabriela P.S.1 aVidal-Neto, Francisco C.0 tRevista Brasileira de entomologia.g2017 Oct.,  Dec., v. 61, no. 4 p.271-274dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de EntomologiawJournal:22106x0085-56267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbe.2017.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017700158300001800335520208700353592002802440650001502468650001502483650001902498650002002517650003002537650002202567650001402589650001702603650001102620700001802631700001702649700002002666700001202686700001302698773012102711856007402832852000902906655001202915IND60640058320221121223143.0190504e20160105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064005832DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra19660d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Changmin10aAdsorption and gas-sensing characteristics of a stoichiometric α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film for carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide with and without pre-adsorbed O₂  ap. 3514-3525.  aHerein, for the first time, the adsorption and gas-sensing characteristics of the CO₂ and CO molecules on a stoichiometric α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film with and without pre-adsorbed O₂ molecules have been studied using the density functional theory (DFT) method. Without pre-adsorbed O₂ molecules, the CO₂ molecule plays the role of an acceptor and obtains electrons from the stoichiometric α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film. For the O₂ pre-adsorption α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film system, the CO₂ molecule also plays the role of an acceptor. However, less number of electrons are transferred to the CO₂ molecule as compared to the pre-adsorbed O₂ molecules. Different from the CO₂ molecule, the CO molecule always plays the role of a donor for the α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film system with and without pre-adsorbed O₂. The theoretical results verify that the CO molecule can react with the lattice oxygen or adsorbed oxygen of the α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film. The electrons transferred to the stoichiometric α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film from the CO molecule or newly formed CO₂ molecule are more than that transferred to the O₂ pre-adsorption α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film. For the stoichiometric or O₂ pre-adsorption α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film, the CO₂ and CO molecules exhibited opposite behaviors of charge transformation. In addition, pre-adsorbed O₂ molecules displayed competitive adsorption with the CO₂ or CO molecule. The pre-adsorbed O₂ molecules hinder electron transfer to the CO₂ molecules from the α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film or hinder electron transfer to the α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film from the CO molecule. Theoretical results demonstrate that the surface of α-Fe₂O₃ materials (0 0 1) could be prepared for use as adsorbents or gas sensors for CO₂ and CO molecules. Their structures are stable after CO₂ molecules are adsorbed or after the reaction of CO molecules with the lattice oxygen or adsorbed oxygen of the α-Fe₂O₃ (0 0 1) nano thin film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aferric oxide 3aoxygen1 aChen, Yanping1 aLiu, Hongmei1 aCui, Guangliang1 aJu, Lin1 aChen, Li0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 05, v. 6, no. 5 p.3514-3525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra19660d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245011300208300001200321520164700333592002801980596005402008650001202062650001502074650001402089650001502103650000902118650001802127650002002145650001102165650003302176650001102209650001902220651001202239700001602251700002102267700002202288773011902310856008202429852000902511655001202520IND60669556720221119174127.0191017e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066955672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-019-3579-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaeza, J.

Lysmata boggessi was predicted to engage in APC given that the egg masses spawned by hermaphrodites are > 1 mm thick, the theoretical limit that allows sufficient oxygen supply by diffusion in living tissue. Furthermore, APC was predicted to increase in intensity with embryo development. Lastly, the ultrastructure of appendages used for APC was examined and it was predicted that these appendages will bear specialized structures to aid in this function. Hermaphrodites brooding early and late embryos were collected August–November 2017 from near Tavernier, Florida, USA (25.0115°N, 80.5151°W), transported to the laboratory, and maintained in aquaria to describe and quantify APC during day and night. The morphology of an appendage involved in APC was compared with two other appendages not associated with APC using scanning electron microscopy. Lysmata boggessi engaged in APC likely using some behaviors to clean (e.g., grooming using second pereiopods) and provide oxygen to the eggs (e.g., pleopod fanning). Pleopod fanning was performed more frequently by hermaphrodites carrying late compared to early embryos, likely permitting hermaphrodites to minimize problems related to oxygen limitation in older more metabolically active embryos. Lysmata boggessi also engaged in APC both day and night. The 2nd pereiopods have setae that may be well suited for aiding in APC. This study supports evidence that small brooding marine invertebrates that produce small but compact embryo masses engage in APC.  aPublisher supplied data  aCreative Inquiry 1560107cClemson University (US) 3aLysmata 3aappendages 3aaquariums 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3ahermaphroditism 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrimp 3aultrastructure 3aFlorida1 aLiu, Xiaomi1 aKostecka, Laurie1 aWortham, Jennifer0 tMarine biology.g2019 Oct., v. 166, no. 10 p.132-132dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-019-3579-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009900173520150200272592002801774650002901802650002701831650001401858650001401872650001701886650001501903650001201918650001301930650001601943650001601959650002601975650001502001650002202016650001302038650002502051650001902076700002002095700002402115700002202139700002502161700002902186773012502215856008302340852000902423655001202432IND60682709920221120154852.0200131e20191127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068270992DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation50400982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwalm, Nathan  D.10aDeveloping a Microbial Consortium for Enhanced Metabolite Production from Simulated Food Waste  aFood waste disposal and transportation of commodity chemicals to the point-of-need are substantial challenges in military environments. Here, we propose addressing these challenges via the design of a microbial consortium for the fermentation of food waste to hydrogen. First, we simulated the exchange metabolic fluxes of monocultures and pairwise co-cultures using genome-scale metabolic models on a food waste proxy. We identified that one of the top hydrogen producing co-cultures comprised Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 and Yokenella regensburgei ATCC 43003. A consortium of these two strains produced a similar amount of hydrogen gas and increased butyrate compared to the C. beijerinckii monoculture, when grown on an artificial garbage slurry. Increased butyrate production in the consortium can be attributed to cross-feeding of lactate produced by Y. regensburgei. Moreover, exogenous lactate promotes the growth of C. beijerinckii with or without a limited amount of glucose. Increasing the scale of the consortium fermentation proved challenging, as two distinct attempts to scale-up the enhanced butyrate production resulted in different metabolic profiles than observed in smaller scale fermentations. Though the genome-scale metabolic model simulations provided a useful starting point for the design of microbial consortia to generate value-added products from waste materials, further model refinements based on experimental results are required for more robust predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aYokenella regensburgei 3abutyrates 3acoculture 3afermentation 3afood waste 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3amunicipal solid waste 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3aslurries 3avalue-added products 3awaste disposal1 aMojadedi, Wais 1 aGerlach, Elliot  S.1 aBenyamin, Marcus 1 aPerisin, Matthew  A.1 aAkingbade, Katherine  L.0 tFermentation.g2019 Nov. 27, v. 5, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation50400983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001700187245016700204300001800371506007600389520038900465592002800854506003700882650002700919650003100946650001900977650001100996650001301007650002501020650001701045650001901062650001801081650002001099651001201119700002401131700002501155700002101180700001701201700002301218773012701241856008001368852000901448655001201457IND60117731120221207140145.0141126e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011773112DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00491-142doi7 aPMC40388832pmcid7 a248746782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThijs, Sofie10aDraft Genome Sequence of Raoultella ornithinolytica TNT, a Trinitrotoluene-Denitrating and Plant Growth-Promoting Strain Isolated from Explosive-Contaminated Soil  ap. e00491-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the draft genome of Raoultella ornithinolytica TNT, a Gram-negative bacterium of the Enterobacteriaceae isolated from military soil in Belgium.

There is evidence that eagle nests are sometimes visited by conspecifics. Are these visitors involved in extra pair-paternity? More than 400 feather samples of nestlings and full-grown White-tailed Eagles were obtained in May at 13 nest sites in the Czech Republic, mainly during the years 2010–2016. The samples were genotyped at six microsatellite loci to determine the identity and number of individuals occurring at each nest site and to test genetic monogamy. In the end, 110 unique genotypes of possible parents were identified from moulted feathers found below nests and were used in a parentage analysis together with 86 offspring genotypes. Interestingly, more than two adult genotypes were sampled from shed feathers in one-third of 64 checks of 11 nests, but nest success was not affected by the number of genotypes. No case of extra-pair paternity was recorded. The results showed that feathers of individuals other than the parent pair can be found below nests of White-tailed Eagles during a single breeding season, and the identity of parents at individual nests can change even during seven years of study, which is inconsistent with the expected longevity, lifelong monogamy and presumed territoriality of White-tailed Eagles. We cannot recommend DNA sampling of nesting pairs on the basis of feathers found below eyries, because the most likely parent was recorded in the appropriate year only in 58% of cases with this method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHaliaeetus albicilla 3aadults 3aeagles 3agenotyping 3alongevity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonogamy 3anest success 3anesting sites 3anests 3apaternity 3aprogeny 3aterritoriality 3aCzech Republic 0amicrosatellite 0araptor 0afidelity 0aextra-pair young1 aPavlíček, Dalibor1 aKirner, Jan1 aMráz, Jakub1 aPapoušek, Ivo1 aLiterák, Ivan0 tActa ornithologica.g2020 Oct. 19, v. 55, no. 1 p.41-52dMuseum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:6275x0001-64547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161/00016454AO2020.55.1.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245017600172520163200348592002801980650002802008650002502036650000802061650001402069650001802083650002202101650002002123650002002143650003102163650001002194650002002204650002202224650001802246650001502264650002402279650002002303650002002323653002002343653001502363653002202378700001802400700001302418700001702431700001402448773009902462856009002561852000902651655001202660IND60687291020221119010334.0200601e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068729102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Hongtao10aTranscriptomic analysis of Ruditapes philippinarum under aerial exposure and reimmersion reveals genes involved in stress response and recovery capacity of the Manila clam  aThe Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, is an economically and scientifically important bivalve mollusk. Its tolerance of aerial exposure has long been considered an important trait for its survival under acute environmental stress. In this study, the transcriptome sequencing of Manila clam under air exposure and reimmersion stresses were conducted, and the differential expression of stress responsive genes in R. philippinarum were investigated. The expression of metabolic and immune-related genes were significantly affected by aerial exposure and reimmersion (recovery in water). The mRNA expression of Dynein light chain 1 was also significantly affected by aerial exposure, which is enriched in the Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption pathway. The CTL, C1q, IAP, TLR6, BIRC, BDF and HSP70 were all up-regulated, demonstrating their involvement in stress defense response to aerial exposure. In addition, a number of genes related to apoptosis between AE vs Control, a high rich factor in genes related to primary immunodeficiency between RE vs Control, and a number of genes related to Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption and energy metabolism were identified. These genes are related to complement pathway, apoptosis, focal adhesion, and HSP signaling pathway, indicating these pathways probably play significant roles in the immune response associated with the aerial exposure stress. This study deepen present understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning tolerance to aerial exposure and provides useful information for future work on the molecular basis of tolerance of aerial exposure stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aToll-like receptor 6 3aair 3aapoptosis 3adynein ATPase 3aenergy metabolism 3afocal adhesions 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunosuppression 3amessenger RNA 3aresorption 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atranscriptomics 0aAerial exposure 0aReimersion 0aRecovery capacity1 aJiang, Kunyin1 aLi, Ning1 aLi, Dongdong1 aYan, Xiwu0 tAquaculture.g2020 July 15, v. 524 p.735271-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003400189245007100223300002200294506007600316520111500392592002801507506003701535650001801572650001801590650002801608650001101636650002201647650001801669650002101687650001301708650001401721650002801735653002401763653002101787653002501808653001701833653002701850653001801877653002701895653000901922700001901931700002201950700001801972700002201990700002202012700001902034700002602053700001802079700001802097700001802115700002402133700002202157700002202179700002202201700002102223700002102244700002402265773008002289856008202369852000902451655001202460IND60581002020221207103734.0171005e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058100202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.0052doi7 aPMC55093322pmcid7 a285523482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOveracre-Delgoffe, Abigail E.10aInterferon-γ Drives Treg Fragility to Promote Anti-tumor Immunity  ap. 1130-1141.e11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegulatory T cells (Tregs) are a barrier to anti-tumor immunity. Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is required to maintain intratumoral Treg stability and function but is dispensable for peripheral immune tolerance. Treg-restricted Nrp1 deletion results in profound tumor resistance due to Treg functional fragility. Thus, identifying the basis for Nrp1 dependency and the key drivers of Treg fragility could help to improve immunotherapy for human cancer. We show that a high percentage of intratumoral NRP1+ Tregs correlates with poor prognosis in melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using a mouse model of melanoma where Nrp1-deficient (Nrp1–/–) and wild-type (Nrp1+/+) Tregs can be assessed in a competitive environment, we find that a high proportion of intratumoral Nrp1–/– Tregs produce interferon-γ (IFNγ), which drives the fragility of surrounding wild-type Tregs, boosts anti-tumor immunity, and facilitates tumor clearance. We also show that IFNγ-induced Treg fragility is required for response to anti-PD1, suggesting that cancer therapies promoting Treg fragility may be efficacious.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterferon-gamma 3amelanoma 3aprognosis 3asquamous cell carcinoma 0aregulatory T cells 0atumor immunology 0acancer immunotherapy 0aneuropilin-1 0atumor microenvironment 0ainterferon-γ 0ainterferon-γ receptor 0aPD-11 aChikina, Maria1 aDadey, Rebekah E.1 aYano, Hiroshi1 aBrunazzi, Erin A.1 aShayan, Gulidanna1 aHorne, William1 aMoskovitz, Jessica M.1 aKolls, Jay K.1 aSander, Cindy1 aShuai, Yongli1 aNormolle, Daniel P.1 aKirkwood, John M.1 aFerris, Robert L.1 aDelgoffe, Greg M.1 aBruno, Tullia C.1 aWorkman, Creg J.1 aVignali, Dario A.A.0 tCell.g2017 June 01, v. 169 p.1130-1141.e11dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245005700163300001600220520070900236592002800945650001800973650002300991650001301014700002001027700001601047773009901063856004801162852000901210655001201219IND4483803520221119052814.0120715e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448380352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-011-4945-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, HaiPeng10aDensity and structure of undercooled liquid titanium  ap. 719-723.  aFor liquid Ti, it is difficult to achieve high undercooling because of its chemical reactivity; as a result, there is little information available on its properties and structure in the undercooled state.

The density increases quadratically for undercooling. At the melting temperature, the density is 4.14 g/cm3, and first and second temperature coefficients are obtained.

Usually, social media sentiment (SMS) is lexically determined, manually or by machine learning. However, these methods are either slow or based on a pre-established dictionary, thus not providing a customised analysis. We propose a methodology that, after having mined the topic-related Tweets, filters relevant words based on the mean and standard deviation frequency in positive and negative market days to remove neutral terms. Subsequently, through an ad hoc perceptual mapping, we assign a polarity to the dataset. This method allows the building of a dictionary associated with the investor sentiment customised to that organisation. A practical application was carried out to test the proposed methodology. The results were significant and in line with the behavioural finance theory, confirming that irrational investor feelings—expressed via social media—drive a portion of asset prices. Results also confirm the investor asymmetric behaviour under gain or loss scenarios, with the latter generating more impact than the former because people are risk-averse. The proposed method is expected to identify patterns of behaviour in social media linked to market oscillations, thereby contributing to risk management and optimising decision-making in the stock market.•The use of both statistical and perceptual map filters allows a specific asset dictionary to be built;•Textual sentiment analysis based on social media;•The proposed method efficiently overcomes generic dictionaries and language issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3adata collection 3adecision making 3apeople 3arisk management 3astandard deviation 3astock exchange 0aSocial Media Customised Dictionary 0aSocial media sentiment 0aSentiment measurement 0aBehavioural finance 0aSentiment perceptual map1 aMaia, Vinicius Mothé1 aTommasetti, Roberto1 aLeite, Rodrigo de Oliveira0 tMethodsX.g2021, v. 8 p.101449-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.1014493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011000176520156300286592002801849650001101877650002201888650001501910650001601925650001601941650001301957650002501970650002101995650001302016650001002029650001802039651001202057653001502069653001502084653001602099653002202115653003302137700002202170700002002192700002402212700002002236700002302256700002402279773009602303856008902399852000902488655001202497IND60731414820221120061537.0220726e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073141482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1053982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoeser, Andrew K.10aMunicipal response to state legislation limiting local oversight of private urban tree removal in Florida  aMany cities actively manage their urban trees in an effort to increase canopy coverage, manipulate species and size distributions, and maximize associated environmental and social benefits. As development is one of the most significant factors limiting tree abundance and health, many local governments have enacted policies or ordinances which attempt to reduce tree loss during construction activities through preservation or replacement requirements. Recently, the state of Florida passed a state statute which significantly limits local government oversight of trees on private residential properties – a land use type which can often account for the majority of a municipality’s urban forest. In this study, we accessed ordinance databases to assess the potential impact of this law on urban forest governance in Florida’s 300 largest cities (by population). We also surveyed urban tree managers in the largest 150 cities to assess the range of strategies being developed to function under this new political normal. Ordinances that regulate the removal of urban trees were the most likely to be impacted by the new state legislature and were in place in 46% of the communities assessed. Despite this, very few responding cities had changed their ordinances to comply with the new statute – though several indicated such changes were in progress. Other changes in policies and ordinances ranged from maintaining business as usual to actually investing more into urban forest management through increased inventory and management plan activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aforest management 3agovernance 3ainventories 3aland policy 3aland use 3alaws and regulations 3alocal government 3apolitics 3atrees 3aurban forests 3aFlorida 0aGovernance 0aOrdinances 0aTree canopy 0aTree preservation 0aUrban and community forestry1 aHauer, Richard J.1 aDowney, Erin E.1 aHilbert, Deborah R.1 aMcLean, Drew C.1 aAndreu, Michael G.1 aNorthrop, Robert J.0 tLand use policy.g2021 June, v. 105 p.105398-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1053983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04021naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245014700179520209100326592002802417650002602445650003002471650002702501650001602528650000902544650001102553650002002564650002002584650002302604650001302627650003602640650002102676650001802697650001802715650001802733650001702751650002002768650002202788650001102810650002502821650003202846650001602878653003002894653001702924653001102941653002602952653002102978700001602999700001203015700002803027700002303055700001703078700001403095700001803109700001203127700001803139700001603157773009903173856009003272852000903362655001203371IND60687291220221119011524.0201104e20200830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068729122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadese, Dawit Adisu10aCombined effects of emodin and Clostridium butyricum on growth and non-specific immunity of giant freshwater prawns, Macrobrachium rosenbergii  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the individual and combined effects of emodin and Clostridium butyricum on growth and non-specific immunity of giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) for eight weeks with the initial body weight of 0.19 ± 0.5 g. Nine trial diets were prepared to contain three emodin levels (0, 25 and 50 mg/kg) and three C. butyricum levels (0, 250 and 500 mg/kg, 2 × 10⁷ CFU/g) following a 3 × 3 factorial design. The diets were named as 0/0, 250/0, 500/0, 0/25, 250/25, 500/25, 0/50, 250/50 and 500/50 (C. butyricum/emodin), respectively. The results showed an interactive effect on the weight gain (WG) and feed conversion ratio were observed in prawns fed a diet containing 250 mg/kg C. butyricum and 50 mg/kg emodin, respectively. Besides, WG and specific growth rate (SGR) of prawns fed 250 mg/kg C. butyricum were both significantly (P < .05) higher than that of the other treatments regarding C. butyricum. Higher values of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO), and respiratory burst were observed with the increasing level of dietary emodin. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities and total protein (TP) contents improved directly with the increasing levels of C. butyricum (P < .05). Furthermore, the content of interferon-γ (INF-γ), IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 were augmented by the dietary emodin and the interaction of C. butyricum and emodin was found in the contents of IL-1 and TNF-α. The mRNA expression of relish was affected significantly by emodin and the interaction of C. butyricum and emodin (P < .05). The mRNA expression of peroxiredoxin-5 was affected significantly by individual and interactional effects of emodin and C. butyricum (P < .001). The present study indicated that the individual or combined effects of C. butyricum and emodin could significantly improve the growth performance and improve the antioxidative status of M. rosenbergii.

However, little research has quantified the magnitude of the deviations between measured and “true” stress (defined as soil stress in the absence of a probe). The objectives of this study were to use a finite element model to quantify how stress readings by cylindrical probes are influenced by probe design (material properties, dimensions), probe spacing in multi-probe set-ups, probe installation depth, and soil mechanical behaviour. We show that soil stress is typically overestimated by transducer probes. Overestimation decreased with probe diameter to height ratio, and increased with the ratio of probe to soil elastic modulus. Overestimation was smaller but dependent on soil strength under plastic soil conditions and higher but independent of soil strength under elastic soil behaviour. Probes interfere with each other when the vertical gap between adjacent probes is closer than about three times probe diameter. Moreover, we found that measured stress is influenced by soil depth and size of the loaded area. Some of the factors influencing stress readings are easily controlled (e.g. probe material properties, dimensions and spacing). However, other sources of deviations between measured and true soil stress are more difficult to account for. Our findings show that the ratio of measured to true soil stress is dependent on soil deformation behaviour as well as on relationships between probe depth, radius of loaded area and ratio of soil stress to applied surface stress implies that the ratio of measured to true stress is not constant when measuring soil stress at various depths in situ under field conditions. We therefore suggest that future studies should especially address how stress readings are affected by soil mechanical behaviour, soil depth, the size of the loaded area, and interactions among these factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3afinite element analysis 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aresearch 3asoil compaction 3asoil depth 3asoil strength 3atillage 3atraffic 0aSoil stress 0aStress transducer 0aElastic modulus1 aKeller, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9383-32090 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 Jan., v. 205 p.104796-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.1047963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245013300200500002000333520129400353592002801647596005701675596005701732596005701789650002601846650001301872650001501885650001701900650001301917650001301930650001601943651000901959700005501968700006102023700001902084700002002103700005902123700005702182700005402239700002302293700002902316700006202345700002102407710005202428773013602480856007702616852000902693655001202702IND60790230020221120035619.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023002DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0186982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatayama, Ikuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8664-040910aPermeability Profiles Across the Crust‐Mantle Sections in the Oman Drilling Project Inferred From Dry and Wet Resistivity Data  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPermeability profiles in the crust‐mantle sequences of the Samail ophiolite were constructed based on onboard measurements of the electrical resistivity of cores recovered during the Oman Drilling Project. For each sample, we measured dry and brine‐saturated resistivity during the description campaign on the drilling vessel Chikyu. Owing to the conductive brine in the pore space, wet resistivity is systematically lower than dry resistivity. The difference between dry and wet resistivity is attributed to the movement of dissolved ions in brine that occupies the pore space. We applied effective medium theory to calculate the volume fraction of pores that contribute to electrical transport. Using an empirical cubic law between transport porosity and permeability, we constructed permeability profiles for the crust‐mantle transition zone and the serpentinized mantle sections in the Samail ophiolite. The results indicate that (1) the gabbro sequence has a markedly lower permeability than the underlying mantle sequence; (2) serpentinized dunites have higher permeability than serpentinized harzburgites; and (3) discrete sample permeability is correlated with ultrasonic velocity, suggesting that the permeability variations predominately reflect crack density and geometry.  aPublisher supplied data  a16H06347cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H01321cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H03733cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aelectrical resistance 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aresearch 3aultrasonics 3aOman1 aAbe, Natsue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2734-00351 aHatakeyama, Kohei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5405-15811 aAkamatsu, Yuya1 aOkazaki, Keishi1 aUlven, Ole Ivar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7646-04821 aHong, Gilbert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1126-68191 aZhu, Wenlu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8166-73571 aCordonnier, Benoit1 aMichibayashi, Katsuyoshi1 aGodard, Marguerite1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3097-51351 aKelemen, Péter,2 athe Oman Drilling Project Phase 2 Science Party0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2019JB018698-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0186983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02952naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245014500202300001800347500001900365500002000384520099200404592002801396596003001424596004801454650002301502650002501525650005201550650001801602650002101620650002401641650001501665650001101680650002201691650001301713650001701726650001401743650002301757650001801780650001601798650002201814700006201836700006101898700006001959700006002019700006502079700005902144773013602203856007402339852000902413655001202422IND60739344820221121051929.0210527e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073934482DNAL7 a10.1111/tbed.138372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertzbach, Luca D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0698-539510aSARS‐CoV‐2 infection of Chinese hamsters (Cricetulus griseus) reproduces COVID‐19 pneumonia in a well‐established small animal model  ap. 1075-1079.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic has caused a yet unresolved global crisis. Effective medical intervention by vaccination or therapy seems to be the only possibility to control the pandemic. In this context, animal models are an indispensable tool for basic and applied research to combat SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Here, we established a SARS‐CoV‐2 infection model in Chinese hamsters suitable for studying pathogenesis of the disease as well as pre‐clinical testing of vaccines and therapies. This species of hamster is susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as demonstrated by robust virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract accompanied by bronchitis and pneumonia as well as significant body weight loss following infection. The Chinese hamster features advantages compared to the Syrian hamster model, including more pronounced clinical symptoms, its small size, well‐characterized genome, transcriptome and translatome data and availability of molecular tools.  aPublisher supplied data  cFreie Universität Berlin  aSFB‐TR84cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aCricetulus griseus 3aMesocricetus auratus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aanimal models 3aapplied research 3abody weight changes 3abronchitis 3agenome 3amedical treatment 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3apneumonia 3arespiratory system 3atranscriptome 3avaccination 3avirus replication1 aVladimirova, Daria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1562-42681 aDietert, Kristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5667-67501 aAbdelgawad, Azza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8165-828X1 aGruber, Achim D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4502-03931 aOsterrieder, Nikolaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5313-21761 aTrimpert, Jakob1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1616-08100 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2021 May, v. 68, no. 3 p.1075-1079dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.138373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245021300154300001800367520158300385592002801968650001701996650002002013650002402033650003102057650001002088650001102098650001802109650001902127650001302146650001102159700001402170700001202184700001702196700001602213700001802229773012102247856007402368852000902442655001202451IND60640059020221121012322.0190504e20160112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064005902DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra19716c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Zheng10aTunable composite architecture and homogeneous dispersion of charged SiO₂ in polymer matrix assisted by poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (P2EHA) latex prepared by self-assembly through electrostatic interactions  ap. 5621-5630.  aWe report a simple and environmentally friendly approach for preparing a homogeneous dispersion of poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate)–silicon dioxide (P2EHA–SiO₂) composites by self-assembly of negatively charged P2EHA and charged SiO₂. The P2EHA latex particles were prepared by miniemulsion polymerization using a free-radical initiator. As auxiliary monomer, acrylic acid created the positive charges on the surface of the P2EHA latex. By mixing P2EHA latex particles with positively charged SiO₂ (pSiO₂) particles, negatively charged P2EHA latex particles easily assembled with pSiO₂ particles through electrostatic interactions. The presence of P2EHA latex particles assisted the homogeneous dispersion of pSiO₂ particles in the polymer matrix. After film formation process, the film exhibited excellent thermal-tolerance and adhesive properties. A three-component system of P2EHA latex particles, pSiO₂, and negatively charged SiO₂ (nSiO₂) was also achieved successfully due to the mutual assistance effect. A better thermal-tolerance and adhesive properties were obtained. Through the establishment of the film formation mechanism, we found that the architecture of the composite film has a significant influence on thermal-tolerance and adhesive properties. This composite material has great application potential as a PSA (pressure sensitive adhesive).

The decline was attributed to a decrease in the number of air travellers from China and amount of restaurant food waste.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Ito Foundation 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aJapan 3aair 3afood waste 3amodels 3apandemic 3aprediction 3arestaurants 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aswine 3aChina1 aKure, Katsumasa1 aKato, Takuma1 aKyutoku, Fumiaki1 aHaga, Takeshi0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2021 May, v. 68, no. 3 p.1700-1703dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.138363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015800162520171900320592002802039650002602067650001602093650001502109650002102124650002602145650002302171650001402194650002902208650001402237653010102251653002302352653002502375653003002400653003102430653003502461653003502496653000802531653000902539653000802548653000902556700002102565700001702586773008302603856008202686852000902768655001202777IND60744784020221121232737.0220214s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2021.1014532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jade10aCategorizing microbial growth inhibition through quantification of 16S rRNA growth marker with stripwells covering a spectrum of antimicrobial conditions  aCulture-based microdilution and disk diffusion tests are two commonly used reference methods for determining the susceptibility of causative bacteria to antibiotics. However, these methods are slow and laborious. Automated antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) instruments are extensively used in clinical microbiology labs, replacing manual methods to perform gold standard microdilution or disk diffusion methods. These automated instruments require the use of isolated bacteria grown in pure culture against a fixed antimicrobial panel, and the susceptibility tests are based on measuring bacterial growth or turbidity changes over a range of pre-determined antimicrobial conditions. As a result, these automated technologies remain inherently inflexible to frequent adjustment of minimum inhibitory concentrations published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and are limited by the detection methods that consumables were designed for. Here, we present a stripwell that is compatible with the 96-well format of most lab automation systems to provide a streamlined workflow to inoculate microorganisms for a customized or routine AST. The main goal of this method of stripwell preparation with various antibiotic conditions is to enable the utility of lab automation for phenotypic antibiotic response assays to address the reproducibility issues due to manual operation. • A standardized and scalable solution from inoculation to antimicrobial incubation • Microplates in stripwell format offer the advantage of greater flexibility in clinical microbiology and diagnostics • Customized antimicrobials and dilution ranges tailored to unique specifications for research and development  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aautomation 3abacterial growth 3adiagnostic techniques 3agrowth retardation 3aphenotype 3aresearch and development 3aturbidity 0aMicrodilution with customized antimicrobial incubation stripwells compatible with 96-well format 0a1 × 8 stripwell 0a96-well plate format 0aCustomized antimicrobials 0aCustomized dilution ranges 0aScalable antibiotic incubation 0a96-well standard heating block 0aAST 0aCLSI 0aMIC 0aDEPC1 aTomasek, Michael1 aGau, Vincent0 tMethodsX.g2021, v. 8 p.101453-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.1014533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014500164300001600309500001900325520171000344592002802054596007002082650000802152650002202160650001402182650001202196650003102208650001602239650002002255650002402275650002902299650002902328650001902357650001802376650001702394700002202411700001902433700001802452700002202470700001802492700002002510700001602530700005802546773012202604856008202726852000902808655001202817IND60727882220221120140640.0210213e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072788222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-020-02651-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jae Ho10aIdentification and analysis of a differentially expressed wheat RING-type E3 ligase in spike primordia development during post-vernalization  ap. 543-558.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: We identified a RING-type E3 ligase (TaBAH1) protein in winter wheat that targets TaSAHH1 for degradation and might be involved in primordia development by regulating targeted protein degradation. Grain yield per spike in wheat (Triticum aestivum), is mainly determined prior to flowering during mature primordia development; however, the genes involved in primordia development have yet to be characterized. In this study, we demonstrated that, after vernalization for 50 days at 4 °C, there was a rapid acceleration in primordia development to the mature stages in the winter wheat cultivars Keumgang and Yeongkwang compared with the Chinese Spring cultivar. Although Yeongkwang flowers later than Keumgang under normal condition, it has the same heading time and reaches the WS9 stage of floral development after vernalization for 50 days. Using RNA sequencing, we identified candidate genes associated with primordia development in cvs. Keumgang and Yeongkwang, that are differentially expressed during wheat reproductive stages. Among these, the RING-type E3 ligase TaBAH1 (TraesCS5B01G373000) was transcriptionally upregulated between the double-ridge (WS2.5) stage and later stages of floret primordia development (WS10) after vernalization. Transient expression analysis indicated that TaBAH1 was localized to the plasma membrane and nucleus and was characterized by self-ubiquitination activity. Furthermore, we found that TaBAH1 interacts with TaSAHH1 to mediate its polyubiquitination and degradation through a 26S proteasomal pathway. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that TaBAH1 might play a prominent role in post-vernalization floret primordia development.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017R1D1A1B06030349cMinistry of Science, ICT and Future Planning 3aRNA 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3aflorets 3agene expression regulation 3agrain yield 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein degradation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 3avernalization 3awinter wheat1 aKhan, Irfan Ullah1 aLee, Cheol Won1 aKim, Dae Yeon1 aJang, Cheol Seong1 aLim, Sung Don1 aPark, Yong Chan1 aKim, Ju Hee1 aSeo, Yong Weon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6702-29120 tPlant cell reports.g2021 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.543-558dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-020-02651-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245006100206300001800267506007600285520029600361592002800657506003700685650002600722650000800748650001000756650002500766700001900791700002200810700001900832700002200851773012700873856008001000852000901080655001201089IND60117731620221207123329.0141126e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011773162DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00499-142doi7 aPMC40388862pmcid7 a248746812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSassi, Mohamed10aDraft Genome Sequence of Mycobacterium triplex DSM 44626  ap. e00499-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe announce the draft genome sequence of Mycobacterium triplex strain DSM 44626, a nontuberculosis species responsible for opportunistic infections.

In response, ongoing soil and water conservation and ecological restoration efforts have been conducted. A review of the region's development history indicates that the utilization mode of cropland in rural areas played an important role in the course of soil and water conservation and socioeconomic development. As a representative area, this study evaluated the status of the Yangjuangou catchment of Liqu Town, Baota District, Shaanxi Province. The dynamic processes, driving factors, variation characteristics, and intrinsic mechanisms of changes in cropland use since the 1980s were analyzed using remote sensing and participatory interview survey data. The results showed that changes in cropland use in Yangjuangou catchment occurred in four stages, including slope cropland utilization stage (1985–1998), the Grain for Green Project stage (1999–2007), agricultural structure adjustment stage (2008–2012), and cropland abandonment stage (2013–2017). These changes in cropland use were driven by policy, economic, socio-cultural, and environmental factors and showed certain characteristics. Specifically, cropland exhibited a “core-margin" funnel-shaped pattern in vertical space, with its changes tending to “flow” toward the core; its utilization intensity generally increased, and the area of intensive utilization and intensive elements gradually shifted. In recent years, spatial patterns gradually developed a sustainable “ecology-production" spatial pattern and abandoned cropland exhibited “contagion” spatial patterns. Finally, based on the behavior mechanisms of farmers and government, we found that the driving force for changes in cropland has changed over time. Initially, food demand on farmers and the goal of ecological safety promoted by the government were dominant. But more recently, the drivers have changed to development demand on farmers and the equal government objectives of promoting ecological safety, rural development, and food security. This study provides a microcosmic perspective on understanding the process and rules of changes in cropland use in the loess hilly and gully region. It also helps to understand the rural transition, providing a reference for developing rural development strategies and policies in this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3aloess 3aremote sensing 3arural areas 3arural development 3asocioeconomic development 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asurveys 3awater conservation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aRural transition 0aRural man-land system 0aCropland use 0aLoess plateau 0aLoess hilly and gully region1 aLiu, Yansui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6636-73131 aLi, Yurui0 tJournal of rural studies.g2022 July, v. 93 p.326-335dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03858naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010800176520215300284592002802437650002502465650002702490650001102517650002902528650001102557650002502568650000902593650001702602650001502619650001702634650001002651650001602661650002302677650001902700650001202719650001502731650002002746650000902766650001402775650003602789650002502825650001702850650000902867651001102876651001102887653001602898653002202914653002702936653002302963700001802986700001803004700001803022700001803040773009903058856009003157852000903247655001203256IND60687291520221119011231.0200601e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068729152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSclodnick, Tyler10aEnvironmental impacts of brass mesh nets on open ocean aquaculture pens in tropical marine environments  aAquaculture pens with brass mesh were installed at commercial fish farms in two locations, Panama and Mexico. Measurements of copper and zinc levels in the water and sediments were monitored over 468 and 435 days for the Panama and Mexico sites respectively. Additional chemical parameters were also measured including dissolved organic carbon in the water column and total solids, total organic carbon, total sulfides, redox potential and acid volatile sulfides and simultaneously extracted metals in the sediments. Measurements were taken at a reference site 1000 m away from the pens perpendicular to the dominant current direction, as well as 50 m upstream, 50 m downstream and adjacent to the pens. Muscle, skin and liver samples were taken from cobia (Rachycentron canadum) produced at the Panama site and analyzed for copper content.The dissolved copper levels at both farms stayed below 1 μg/L at all times. There was no significant difference in the dissolved copper levels between the reference site and other measurement sites at either location. There was also no observable increase in dissolved copper levels over time at the Mexico location although there was a significant difference in dissolved copper levels between the sampling days at the Panama location. Zinc concentrations also remained within safe levels, never exceeding 0.82 μg/L at any point. Copper and zinc levels in the sediments did not show a significant increase over time. The copper levels in tissue samples from the muscle tissue of the cobia raised in a brass mesh pen at the Panama site were 19% higher than those raised in the plastic mesh pen. The elevated copper levels are well below recommended daily intake levels and do not pose a risk to human health. There was no significant difference in copper levels of the skin or liver tissue samples. The absence of any increase in liver copper levels suggests that the fish's physiology and welfare are not impacted by brass mesh.The findings suggest that brass mesh is environmentally compatible with high energy marine environments and a commercially viable product for open ocean aquaculture farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRachycentron canadum 3aacid volatile sulfides 3acopper 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3afish culture 3afish farms 3ahuman health 3aliver 3amariculture 3amarine environment 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3aphysiology 3aredox potential 3arisk 3asediments 3asimultaneously extracted metals 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal solids 3azinc 3aMexico 3aPanama 0aAquaculture 0aCopper alloy mesh 0aOpen ocean aquaculture 0aAquatic toxicology1 aSutton, Steve1 aSelby, Thomas1 aDwyer, Robert1 aGace, Langley0 tAquaculture.g2020 July 15, v. 524 p.735266-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003900147245011100186520131700297592002801614650001501642650001401657650001501671650001601686650001601702653003501718653003101753653002901784653003201813653005101845700003201896773008301928856008202011852000902093655001202102IND60744784120221121232556.0220214s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074478412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2021.1014542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarazúa-Carbajal, María Cristina12aA MATLAB App for calculating the age-dependent degree of erosion of monogenetic scoria cones from DEM data  aWe present a MATLAB App aimed to characterize the degree of erosion of monogenetic scoria cones from two independent sets of morphometric parameters. One quantifies the shape and size of undulations in DEM level contours through a novel parameter, the Average Erosion Index (AEI), using Elliptical Fourier Descriptors to calculate the wavelength spectra of undulations in selected contours over an ample range of resolutions of the database. The other is a more conventional set of parameters characterizing the vertical profiles of cones. This algorithm permits correcting those parameters for terrain inclination.•These methods aim for a consistent assessment of the erosion-related relative ages of volcanoes in extensive monogenetic fields, from DEM data.•The age-related degree of erosion is revealed by two main parameters: The Average Erosion Index (AEI), calculated from the Elliptic Fourier Descriptor spectrum of a scoria cone contour lines; and the aspect ratio of a scoria cone vertical profile, considering terrain inclinations, if it is assumed that all cones acquired the same morphology at the time of their formation eruptions.•The Method provides erosion metrics from a sizable range of DEM resolutions. For age-related applications, it is recommended to use resolutions better than 12 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3alandscapes 3amorphometry 3awavelengths 0aElliptical Fourier Descriptors 0aErosional features metrics 0aMorpho-chronometric tool 0aMonogenetic volcanic fields 0aErosion metrics for monogenetic volcanic cones1 aCruz Reyna, Servando de la,0 tMethodsX.g2021, v. 8 p.101454-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.1014543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002100187245008400208300001800292506007600310520031500386592002800701506003700729650001000766650001500776650001300791651002100804700002700825700002200852700002100874700002900895700002700924773012700951856008001078852000901158655001201167IND60117731720221207122310.0141126e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011773172DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00500-142doi7 aPMC40474482pmcid7 a249038692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaronti, Cécile10aComplete Coding Sequence of Zika Virus from a French Polynesia Outbreak in 2013  ap. e00500-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aZika virus is an arthropod-borne Flavivirus member of the Spondweni serocomplex, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.

However, no information is available on the pharmacokinetic characteristics and absolute availability of neomycin sulfate after intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administrations in swine. Here, these parameters were studied in swine after i.v. and p.o. doses of single 15 mg/kg body weight doses. The blood samples were assessed using ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography‐tandem mass/mass spectrometry (UPLC‐MS/MS) and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using a non‐compartmental model. In swine, after the p.o. administration, the elimination half‐life, mean residue time from t0 to the last collection point, mean maximum concentration, mean time to reach maximum concentration and area under concentration–time curve from t0 to the last collection point values were 12.43 ± 7.63 h, 10.25 ± 4.32 h, 0.11 ± 0.07 μg/ml, 1.92 ± 0.97 h and 1.23 ± 0.78 μg·h/ml, respectively, whereas after the i.v. administration, the values were 5.87 ± 1.12 h, 6.07 ± 0.49 h, 15.80 ± 1.32 μg/ml, 0.30 ± 0.38 h and 76.14 ± 3.52 μg·h/ml, respectively.

Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of allergic reactions. Here, we investigated how HYP regulates the levels of TSLP in a human mast cell line, HMC‐1 cells. We analyzed the levels of TSLP by treatment with HYP in phorbol myristate acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187‐stimulated HMC‐1 cells with ELISA and a polymerase chain reaction analysis. We also analyzed the pathway that HYP regulates TSLP by measuring the level of fluorescent intracellular calcium and using a Western blot analysis. HYP decreased the level of intracellular calcium in stimulated HMC‐1 cells. It also significantly decreased the production and mRNA expression of TSLP in stimulated HMC‐1 cells. It significantly decreased the levels of receptor‐interacting protein 2 and active caspase‐1 in stimulated HMC‐1 cells. HYP significantly decreased the translocation of NF‐κB into the nucleus and degradation of IκBα in the cytoplasm in stimulated HMC‐1 cells. Furthermore, it significantly decreased the production and mRNA expression of interleukin‐1β and interleukin‐6 in stimulated HMC‐1 cells. Taken together, our findings establish HYP as a potential agent for the treatment of allergic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrataegus pinnatifida 3aWestern blotting 3aacetates 3acalcium 3acytoplasm 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenesis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 2aCalcimycin 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Ionophores 2aCalcium Signaling 2aCaspase 1xmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCrataegusxchemistry 2aCytokinesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-1betaxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aMast Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aQuercetinxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aReceptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2xmetabolism 2aTetradecanoylphorbol Acetate1 aGo, Ji‐Hyun1 aKim, Hyung‐Min1 aJeong, Hyun‐Ja0 tPhytotherapy research.g2014 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.1077-1081dJ.

Cowpea is a staple legume important for food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where its production is limited by the key pest, legume pod borer (Maruca vitrata). Cowpea varieties resistant to M. vitrata are not known, hence, development of Maruca pod borer resistance cowpea through genetic engineering is a promising approach to improve its production. In the present study, transgenic cowpea plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Cry2Aa insecticidal protein were developed for the first time using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of cotyledonary explants. T₀ plants recovered from Agrobacterium cocultured explants on medium containing 120 mgl⁻¹ of kanamycin were identified on the basis of the presence of transgenes by PCR, their integration into genome by Southern hybridization and expression of their transcripts by semi quantitative PCR (sqRT-PCR) and quantitative Real–time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and protein by Western blot analysis. The transformation efficiency obtained was 3.47% with 11 independent T₀ transgenic lines. The bioefficacy of Cry2Aa protein expressed in randomly selected four T₀ plant’s leaves and pods was evaluated by feeding Maruca pod borer demonstrated a significant lower damage and a high level of Maruca mortality (more than 90%) for all these Bt lines. The inheritance of transgenes from T₀ to T₁ progeny plants was demonstrated by PCR analysis. The transgenic plants generated in this study can be used in cowpea breeding program for durable and sustainable legume pod borer resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.No.-42-189/2013(SR)cUniversity Grants Commission 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aMaruca testulalis 3aSouthern blotting 3aWestern blotting 3acowpeas 3afood security 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal proteins 3akanamycin 3amortality 3aprogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxins 3atransgenes 3aAsia 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aJaiwal, Ranjana1 aSreevathsa, Rohini1 aChaudhary, Darshna1 aJaiwal, Pawan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3143-41030 tPlant cell reports.g2021 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.583-594dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-020-02657-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005900142245011700201500002000318520162100338592002801959596008801987596002702075650002702102650002402129650001502153650001302168650001702181650001502198651001002213773013602223856007702359852000902436655001202445IND60790230520221120035605.0220824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079023052DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0200182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhong‐Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1968-512910aFlat Subduction Versus Big Mantle Wedge: Contrasting Modes for Deep Hydration and Overriding Craton Modification  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSubduction‐induced deep hydration and water cycling may strongly control the modification of overriding cratonic lithosphere. Two contrasting modes are generally proposed: (1) flat subduction (FS) regime with slab subducting subhorizontally beneath the overriding lithosphere and (2) big mantle wedge (BMW) regime with slab flattening at the bottom of mantle transition zone. Here, systematic numerical models are built to study the subduction‐induced deep hydration processes in the contrasting FS and BMW regimes as well as their effects on the modification of overriding lithosphere. The model results indicate that the dehydration process in the FS regime can significantly modify the overriding lithosphere for a region of about 600 km from the trench. During the progressive flat subduction, the partial melting and magmatism migrate toward the inner land of the overriding plate, which will be reversed and backward to the trench during the transition from flat to steep slab subduction. On the other hand, the deep hydration in the BMW regime is strongly dependent on the subcrustal serpentinite layer in the subducting slab, whereas the oceanic crust cannot carry water to the transition zone. The modification of the overriding lithosphere in the BMW regime occurs in a larger region of >1,000 km from trench, which is, however, generally slower and weaker. Thus, the flat subduction of Izanagi plate may play a more significant role in the modification of North China Craton in the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous, which could be accompanied by the effects of deep water cycling in the BMW regime.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDB18000000cStrategic Priority Research Program (B) of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41688103cNSFC project 3aEarly Cretaceous epoch 3aLate Jurassic epoch 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3aserpentinite 3asubduction 3aChina0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 Aug., v. 125, no. 8 p.e2020JB020018-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0200183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012200168520098500290592002801275650002401303650001301327650002001340650002501360650001101385650001201396650002101408650001301429650002301442650001501465650002601480650001101506700002001517700002401537700001701561700002401578773012601602856008301728852000901811655001201820IND60682710820221120233025.0200131e20190930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068271082DNAL7 a10.3390/fermentation50400882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoloman, Anna 10aAugmentation of Granular Anaerobic Sludge with Algalytic Bacteria Enhances Methane Production from Microalgal Biomass  aThe efficiency of anaerobic digestion relies upon activity of the inoculum converting organic substrate into biogas. Often, metabolic capacity of the inoculum needs to be augmented with new capabilities to accommodate changes in the substrate feed composition. However, bioaugmentation is not a widely used strategy possibly due to the lack of studies demonstrating successful applications. This study describes the bioaugmentation of granular anaerobic sludge digesting mixed algal biomass in batch-scale reactors. The addition of an algalytic bacterial mixture to the granular consortium increased methane yield by 11%. This study also investigated changes in the microbial 16SrRNA composition of the augmented and non-augmented granular inoculum, which demonstrates a significant change in the hydrolytic microbial community. Overall, the studies’ results aim to provide a feasible checklist to assess the success rates of bioaugmentation of anaerobic digestion applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogas 3abiomass 3afeed composition 3ainoculum 3amethane production 3amicroalgae 3amicrobial communities 3asludge1 aPererva, Yehor 1 aCortez, Michael  H.1 aSims, R.

Consequently, turfgrass irrigation with reclaimed water has become a regular practice in these regions. The main goal of this research was to assess the effects of reclaimed water (RW) irrigation in Madrid urban parks by studying changes in grass nutrient balance and its biomass production.Irrigation with reclaimed water led to a grass biomass increase, mainly due to the high proportion of nutrients received through the irrigation water. The main nutrient input in RW irrigation were of Cl, S, K and Na. RW also contributed to a significant increase in nutrient removal by grass.Thus, all this information generated should be taken into account by park managers in order to fulfill the grass aesthetic value and its nutritional requirements in those urban parks irrigated with RW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetic value 3abiomass production 3achlorine 3airrigation water 3anutrient balance 3anutrient requirements 3anutrients 3apotassium 3asodium 3asulfur 3aturf grasses 3aurban parks 3awastewater irrigation 3awastewater treatment 3awater resources 0aReclaimed water 0aIrrigation 0aTurfgrass 0aUrban park1 aMartínez-Pérez, Silvia1 aBienes, Ramón1 aGarcía-Díaz, Andrés1 aSastre-Merlín, Antonio0 tChemosphere.g2019 Dec., v. 237dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1244813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245018900171520201700360592002802377650002802405650001602433650001702449650001802466650001502484650001802499650001402517650003102531650001002562650001602572650001102588650001902599650002102618650002902639650002602668650001802694650002002712653002802732653002602760653003302786653002402819653001302843700001702856700001702873700001302890700001702903700001602920773009902936856009003035852000903125655001203134IND60687291820221119011147.0201104e20200830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068729182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Dandan10aComparative transcriptome analysis unveils mechanisms underlying the promoting effect of potassium iodide on astaxanthin accumulation in Haematococcus pluvialis under high light stress  aAstaxanthin produced by Haematococcus pluvialis is an economically valuable ketocarotenoid pigment that benefits the health of human being. Astaxanthin can be accumulated in H. pluvialis cells up to 3% under high light stress. In this study, by adding 1 mM potassium iodide (KI) into the culture media of H. pluvialis cells under high light condition (HK), 26%–35% more astaxanthin than that of high light alone (HL) was obtained. As compared with HL that all cells turned into astaxanthin-rich non-motile ones at day 5 and day 10, about 30%–35% cells in HK remained flagella, which were motile without thickened secondary cell wall. Notably, these astaxanthin-rich motile cells contained more astaxanthin than astaxanthin-containing non-motile cells. The maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was higher in HK while the actual photochemical efficiency (Fv’/Fm') was lower in HK as compared with those in HL. Transcriptomes of cells in HK and HL groups were significantly different, especially at day 5 and day 10, which were consistent with above-mentioned morphological differences between HK and HL cells. KI promoted astaxanthin accumulation by up-regulating the transcription levels of astaxanthin biosynthetic genes and by simultaneously down-regulating the transcription levels of genes involved in other pathways that compete for precursors of astaxanthin biosynthesis. Transcriptomic data also revealed significant changes between HK and HL cells in genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis (57), flagella biosynthesis and cell movement (620), ROS homeostasis (42), and transcriptional factors (42). The possible mechanisms underlying KI's promoting role in H. pluvialis cells under high light were discussed based on morphological and transcriptomic data. In summary, this study provides a new method to increase astaxanthin accumulation in H. pluvialis, and its output expands current understanding of survival strategies and astaxanthin accumulation of H. pluvialis under high light stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aastaxanthin 3abiosynthesis 3acell movement 3acell walls 3aculture media 3aflagellum 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aphotochemistry 3apotassium iodide 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0aHaematococcus pluvialis 0aPotassium iodide (KI) 0aAstaxanthin-rich motile cell 0aSecondary cell wall 0aFlagella1 aHu, Chaoyang1 aZou, Zhaomin1 aSun, Xue1 aShi, Jianxin1 aXu, Nianjun0 tAquaculture.g2020 Aug. 30, v. 525 p.735279-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7352793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245010600195300001800301500001900319500002000338520167700358592002802035596005302063596005302116596005302169596005302222596005502275650001802330650002102348650001802369650001802387650002202405650001302427650001602440650002302456650002002479700005402499700005702553773011902610856007302729852000902802655001202811IND60694127220221119031109.0200510e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069412722DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.153382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalden, Nora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3078-679110aLineage‐specific adaptation to climate involves flowering time in North American Arabidopsis lyrata  ap. 1436-1451.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdaptation to local climatic conditions is commonly found within species, but whether it involves the same intraspecific genomic variants is unknown. We studied this question in North American Arabidopsis lyrata, whose current distribution is shaped by post‐glacial range expansion from two refugia, resulting in two distinct genetic clusters covering comparable climatic gradients. Using pooled whole‐genome sequence data of 41 outcrossing populations, we identified loci associated with three niche‐determining climatic variables in the two clusters and compared these outliers. Little evidence was found for parallelism in climate adaptation for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and for genes with an accumulation of outlier SNPs. Significantly increased selection coefficients supported them as candidates of climate adaptation. However, the fraction of gene ontology (GO) terms shared between clusters was higher compared to outlier SNPs and outlier genes, suggesting that selection acts on similar pathways but not necessarily the same genes. Enriched GO terms involved responses to abiotic and biotic stress, circadian rhythm and development, with flower development and reproduction being among the most frequently detected. In line with GO enrichment, regulators of flowering time were detected as outlier genes. Our results suggest that while adaptation to environmental gradients on the genomic level are lineage‐specific in A. lyrata, similar biological processes seem to be involved. Differential loss of standing genetic variation, probably driven by genetic drift, can in part account for the lack of parallel evolution on the genomic level.  aPublisher supplied data  aPP00P3_123396cSwiss National Science Foundation  aPP00P3_146342cSwiss National Science Foundation  a31003A_140979cSwiss National Science Foundation  a31003A_166322cSwiss National Science Foundation  cFondation Pierre Mercier pour la Science, Lausanne 3abiotic stress 3acircadian rhythm 3agene ontology 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aoutcrossing 3aparallel evolution 3arefuge habitats1 aLucek, Kay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2253-25561 aWilli, Yvonne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7654-32610 tMolecular ecology.g2020 Apr., v. 29, no. 8 p.1436-1451dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.153383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001800260520163000278592002801908650001601936650002501952650001801977650001001995650002202005650003102027650001102058650001402069650001902083700002102102700002102123700002102144700001902165700001902184773011302203856008102316852000902397655001202406IND60081703620221119065148.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008170362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-014-1778-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesthus, Claudia10aIncreased grooming after repeated brood care provides sanitary benefits in a clonal ant  ap. 1701-1710.  aRepeated pathogen exposure is a common threat in colonies of social insects, posing selection pressures on colony members to respond with improved disease-defense performance. We here tested whether experience gained by repeated tending of low-level fungus-exposed (Metarhizium robertsii) larvae may alter the performance of sanitary brood care in the clonal ant, Platythyrea punctata. We trained ants individually over nine consecutive trials to either sham-treated or fungus-exposed larvae. We then compared the larval grooming behavior of naive and trained ants and measured how effectively they removed infectious fungal conidiospores from the fungus-exposed larvae. We found that the ants changed the duration of larval grooming in response to both, larval treatment and their level of experience: (1) sham-treated larvae received longer grooming than the fungus-exposed larvae and (2) trained ants performed less self-grooming but longer larval grooming than naive ants, which was true for both, ants trained to fungus-exposed and also to sham-treated larvae. Ants that groomed the fungus-exposed larvae for longer periods removed a higher number of fungal conidiospores from the surface of the fungus-exposed larvae. As experienced ants performed longer larval grooming, they were more effective in fungal removal, thus making them better caretakers under pathogen attack of the colony. By studying this clonal ant, we can thus conclude that even in the absence of genetic variation between colony members, differences in experience levels of brood care may affect performance of sanitary brood care in social insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetarhizium 3aPlatythyrea punctata 3abrood rearing 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3alarvae 3apathogens 3asocial insects1 aUgelvig, Line V.1 aTourdot, Edouard1 aHeinze, Jürgen,1 aDoums, Claudie1 aCremer, Sylvia0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2014 Oct., v. 68, no. 10 p.1701-1710dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-014-1778-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245014600158300002000304520113000324592002801454650002301482650002401505650001901529650001901548650001501567653002501582653002901607653003201636653002101668653002901689700005701718700001101775700001601786700001701802700005801819700005501877773014201932856007802074852000902152655001202161IND60746144220221119135857.0210729e20210716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074614422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c055362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yuzhi10aHydrogen Evolution Prediction for Alternating Conjugated Copolymers Enabled by Machine Learning with Multidimension Fragmentation Descriptors  ap. 34033-34042.  aHydrogen evolution by alternating conjugated copolymers has attracted much attention in recent years. To study alternating copolymers with data-driven strategies, two types of multidimension fragmentation descriptors (MDFD), structure-based MDFD (SMDFD), and electronic property-based MDFD (EPMDFD), have been developed with machine learning (ML) algorithms for the first time. The superiority of SMDFD-based models has been demonstrated by the highly accurate and universal predictions of electronic properties. Moreover, EPMDFD-based, experimental-parameter-free ML models were developed for the prediction of the hydrogen evolution reaction, displaying excellent accuracy (real-test accuracy = 0.91). The combination of explainable ML approaches and first-principles calculations was employed to explore photocatalytic dynamics, revealing the importance of electron delocalization in the excited state. Virtual designing of high-performance candidates can also be achieved. Our work illustrates the huge potential of ML-based material design in the field of polymeric photocatalysts toward high-performance photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrogen production 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aprediction 0aconjugated copolymer 0afragmentation descriptor 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0amachine learning 0apolymeric photocatalysts1 aJu, Cheng-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2250-85481 aLi, Bo1 aMa, Qiu-Shi1 aChen, Zhenyu1 aZhang, Lianjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3555-43721 aChen Junwu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0190-782X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 16, v. 13, no. 29 p.34033-34042dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c055363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245008700209500002000296520168800316592002802004596007502032650001402107650001802121650001002139650002002149650001302169650000902182650002002191650001302211650002302224650001102247651001402258700002202272700001902294700002602313773012702339856008402466852000902550655001202559IND60790624820221122232314.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062482DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2018-0003132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVissio, Claudina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4799-803710aPreference of veterinarians to select an udder health programme for milk producers  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This investigation was carried out to gain more insight about the preference of veterinarians on the implementation of an udder health programme (UHP) in a dairy farm. METHODS: A choice experiment was designed to elicit the preferences of the participants. The study population consisted of 36 veterinarians from Argentina specialised on milk quality. The choice experiment offered several UHPs, which were combinations of some of the interventions included in the so‐called five‐point plan. To reduce bias among the participants, the UHPs offered were unlabelled and considered two farm contexts: one was on a pasture system and the other was on a dry‐lot with pasture access system. The basic criteria (the so‐called attribute) to describe veterinarians’ preferences for each UHP proposed were efficacy on clinical mastitis (CM) and bulk milk somatic cell count (BMSCC) reduction, cost and technical support. The data collected were analysed using conjoint analysis. RESULTS: UHP cost and UHP efficacy on BMSCC and CM had a significant influence on veterinarians’ ranking decisions under both dairy production contexts. The efficacy on CM was the most important attribute to prefer a particular UHP, while technical assistance was the least important attribute considered. The attributes related to efficacy on both BMSCC and CM explained over 60 per cent of the total importance of all attributes. CONCLUSION: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research in South America focused on studying veterinarians’ preferences to suggest a UHP. The cost and efficacy attributes were the veterinarians’ top priority attributes to decide the best UHP.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstituto de Investigación de la Universidad Nacional de Villa María 3abulk milk 3adairy farming 3afarms 3ahealth programs 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilk production 3apastures 3asomatic cell count 3audders 3aArgentina1 aRichardet, Melina1 aChaves, Javier1 aLarriestra, Alejandro0 tVeterinary record open.g2019 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e000313-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2018-0003133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015000169300001600319520122600335592002801561596006401589596006401653596004401717650001801761650001301779650001101792650004401803650002201847700002201869700001601891700002201907700006101929700002601990773012702016856008202143852000902225655001202234IND60704974220221122232658.0200728e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070497422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10858-019-00233-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, Ryan W.10aAccuracy and precision of protein structures determined by magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy: for some ‘with a little help from a friend’  ap. 333-346.  aWe present a systematic investigation into the attainable accuracy and precision of protein structures determined by heteronuclear magic angle spinning solid-state NMR for a set of four proteins of varied size and secondary structure content. Structures were calculated using synthetically generated random sets of C-C distances up to 7 Å at different degrees of completeness. For single-domain proteins, 9–15 restraints per residue are sufficient to derive an accurate model structure, while maximum accuracy and precision are reached with over 15 restraints per residue. For multi-domain proteins and protein assemblies, additional information on domain orientations, quaternary structure and/or protein shape is needed. As demonstrated for the HIV-1 capsid protein assembly, this can be accomplished by integrating MAS NMR with cryoEM data. In all cases, inclusion of TALOS-derived backbone torsion angles improves the accuracy for small number of restraints, while no further increases are noted for restraint completeness above 40%. In contrast, inclusion of TALOS-derived torsion angle restraints consistently increases the precision of the structural ensemble at all degrees of distance restraint completeness.  aPublisher supplied data  aP50GM082251cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aP30GM110758cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  aCHE0959496cNational Science Foundation 3acoat proteins 3ajournals 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein structure1 aFritz, Matthew P.1 aKraus, Jodi1 aQuinn, Caitlin M.1 aPolenova, Tatyana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0346-11311 aGronenborn, Angela M.0 tJournal of biomolecular NMR.g2019 July, v. 73, no. 6-7 p.333-346dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52412x0925-27387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10858-019-00233-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012500169300001400294520236900308592002802677650001102705650002002716650001402736650001302750650001302763650000902776650001402785650001102799650001902810650002002829650002202849650001702871650001102888650002202899650001202921650002102933650001002954651000902964653001802973653002402991653001703015653001503032653002303047700002303070700002003093773010703113856008403220852000903304655001203313IND60568575220221122042839.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056857522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2017.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaezi, Ali Reza10aInteraction of land use, slope gradient and rain sequence on runoff and soil loss from weakly aggregated semi-arid soils  ap. 22-31.  aThe effects of land use, tillage methods and slope gradient on soil erosion have been widely investigated. However, there is limited information about their effects on very weakly aggregated soils that can be found in semi-arid, nutrient limited regions of low productivity. This study was carried out to investigate the interaction of land use, tillage method and slope gradient on runoff and soil loss in a weakly aggregated soil in the north-west of Iran. Plots (3m×10m) with three treatments and two replicates were installed in each of four slopes gradient categories (12.6, 15.3, 17.0, 19.4%). The three treatments were pasture with poor vegetation cover (27%) and rainfed wheat either cultivated up to down slope or along the contour. Wheat was sown in early autumn and runoff and soil loss was measured under natural rainfall during the eight months long growing period. Out of 53 precipitation events, 8 storms were classified erosive. The susceptibility of all plots to produce runoff and soil loss increased pronouncedly and highly significantly with subsequent rainfalls. The potential of a rainfall to produce runoff and soil loss was thus highly dependent on preceding rainfalls. Wheat cultivation increased runoff 13 times and soil loss 60 times compared to pasture. Runoff and soil loss increased about 5.5 and 35 times in plots cultivated up to down slope as compared with contour cultivated plots. The effects of land use increased pronouncedly with increasing slope gradient. These results showed that erosivities of rainfalls separated by several months were not independent from each other and that the effects of land use and slope gradient interacted. Also the effect of slope gradient on soil loss was much larger than estimated by current equations. All effects could be explained by the extremely weak aggregates. Soil erosion was thus not detachment limited but transport limited. Transport limitation decreased in the sequence of rainfalls due to loss of surface roughness and with increasing slope gradient due to increasing failure of roughness elements. Under conditions leading to extremely weak soil aggregates, land use and slope gradient thus exert a much larger impact on runoff and soil loss than what is commonly assumed. This should be better considered in soil conservation efforts but also in runoff and erosion modelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acrop production 3aequations 3aland use 3apastures 3arain 3aroughness 3arunoff 3asemiarid soils 3asoil aggregates 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3astorms 3asurface roughness 3atillage 3avegetation cover 3awheat 3aIran 0aRainfed wheat 0aAggregate stability 0aSoil erosion 0aContouring 0aRainfall erosivity1 aZarrinabadi, Ehsan1 aAuerswald, Karl0 tSoil & tillage research.g2017 Sept., v. 172 p.22-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2017.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017700170300001800347520140600365592002801771650002301799650002101822650002101843650002001864650001201884650001501896650001301911650002001924650001601944650001301960700001901973700002301992700001902015700002102034700006102055700006402116700006702180700005902247773012002306856008502426852000902511655001202520IND60754858220221122063059.0211026e20211007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c015032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScoponi, Giulia10aVersatile Preparation of Branched Polylactides by Low-Temperature, Organocatalytic Ring-Opening Polymerization in N-Methylpyrrolidone and Their Surface Degradation Behavior  ap. 9482-9495.  aWe describe how the organocatalytic, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)-based lactide ring-opening polymerization can be effectively performed in a very polar solvent, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). Due to a low ceiling temperature, this “living” mechanism has been unreported to date, but we here demonstrate that through a combination of low temperature and repeated monomer additions (starve-fed process), this mechanism enables the generation of a plethora of multifunctional homo- and (stereo)block-poly(lactide)s (PLAs) with exquisite control of the molecular weight dispersity (typically Đ < 1.1) and topology (from linear through 4-, 6-, or 8-armed stars and up to ∼140 armed combs). They are scarcely obtainable or inaccessible through more classical synthetic methods due to the poor solubility of multifunctional initiators (polyols) in most organic solvents and monomer melts. In these precisely designed structures, branching significantly altered the nature of the materials’ hydrolytic degradation, allowing them to acquire a pronounced surface character (as opposed to the bulk degradation of linear polymers). Finally, we have assessed the amenability of this method to in situ block copolymerization by using the tacticity of PLLA blocks in PLLA-b-PDLLA versus PDLLA-b-PLLA (L-LA polymerized before or after DL-LA) as a sensitive method to detect (stereochemical) defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acopolymerization 3amolecular weight 3apolylactic acid 3apolyols 3asolubility 3asolvents 3astereochemistry 3atemperature 3atopology1 aFrancini, Nora1 aParadiso, Veronica1 aDonno, Roberto1 aGennari, Arianna1 ad’Arcy, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8567-368X1 aCapacchione, Carmine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7254-86201 aAthanassiou, Athanassia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6533-32311 aTirelli, Nicola1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4879-39490 tMacromolecules.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 54, no. 20 p.9482-9495dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c015033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013600169520164700305592002801952650004401980650001802024650001102042650003902053650001802092650001802110650001202128650003302140650002502173650002102198650002602219650001702245650001602262650003702278653001902315653002602334653002202360653001402382653003302396700001902429700001602448700002702464700001802491700001602509700001502525700001702540773011002557856008602667852000902753655001202762IND60768920920221123043708.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076892092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Xianyan10aEffects of “nine steaming nine sun-drying” on proximate composition, protein structure and volatile compounds of black soybeans  aNine steaming nine sun-drying is a traditional processing technology for food or medicinal materials. The dynamic changes of the proximate composition, protein structure and volatile compounds during nine-time steaming and sun-drying of black soybeans (BS) were studied. The proximate composition results showed that the content of protein, carbohydrate and fat of BS decreased after processing, whereas the relative content of amino acids remained basically unchanged. Protein structure was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UV) and Fluorescence spectroscopy. FT-IR result revealed that the relative contents of β-sheet and β-turn of the secondary structure of black soybean protein isolate (BSPI) decreased but the relative contents of α-helix and random coil increased after steaming and sun-drying. The results of UV and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed changes in the protein conformation. In addition, SPME-GCMS analysis demonstrated that hydrocarbons, alcohols and aldehydes were the main volatile compounds. The relative contents of 1-octen-3-ol and hexanal, which are the main sources of beany flavor decreased significantly compared with raw BS. Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed that the volatile compounds of nine steamed and nine sun-dried BS could be well distinguished during the process. These findings may therefore provide a scientific basis for the application of nine-time steamed and sun-dried BS in food industry and contribute to the understanding of process-induced chemical transformations in this ancient processing technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbohydrates 3aflavor 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afood industry 3afood research 3aoctenol 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein conformation 3aprotein isolates 3aproximate composition 3asolar drying 3asoy protein 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aBlack soybeans 0aHeat treatment method 0aProtein structure 0aSPME-GCMS 0aPrincipal component analysis1 aWang, Shanshan1 aLi, Yingqiu1 aMichael Olajide, Tosin1 aZhai, Xiaolin1 aQian, Jiana1 aMiao, Song1 aHuang, Junyi0 tFood research international.g2022 May, v. 155 p.111070-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011700175520178900292592002802081650002002109650001302129650002902142650002202171650002102193650005802214650001702272653004302289653002802332653001302360653002402373653002402397653003202421700006002453700006102513700006002574773011102634856008602745852000902831655001202840IND60736472220221119151848.0210904e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1227502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpuni, Kwabena F.M.10aHigh performance liquid chromatography: A versatile tool for assaying antiepileptic drugs in biological matrices  aEpilepsy is a recurrent long-term illness occurring in approximately 1.0% of the world’s population. There are currently about 29 approved antiepileptic drugs for the management of epilepsy. Due to narrow therapeutic indices of most antiepileptic drugs, clinical pharmacokinetic characteristics and therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs are imperative. The objectives of this review were to identify common chromatographic principles, requirements and/or conditions for high-performance liquid chromatography as applied to assay of antiepileptic drugs in biological matrices. The review was conducted using 66 peer reviewed articles (1990 to 2020) from 29 journals that were sought via PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar. In all, 29 antiepileptic drugs were assayed from 6 different biological matrices. Forty-three of the reviewed articles estimated the concentration of only one antiepileptic drug, whilst 23 articles focused on simultaneous determination of two or more antiepileptic drugs. Thirty-four, 20, and 14 articles reported using liquid–liquid extraction, protein precipitation, or solid phase extraction for sample clean up, respectively. The ratio of reversed-phase to normal phase, LC-UV to LC-MS and isocratic elution to gradient elution were 61:3, 43:7 and 55:11, respectively. With the exception of one article the reported recoveries ranged from 60.3% to 109.6%. It is noteworthy, that, the performance metrics of high-performance liquid chromatography are better compared to other assays of antiepileptic drugs in biological matrices. This review describes the relevant liquid chromatographic method conditions over the past 30 years for the analysis of this class of drugs, which provides a basis for further method development and optimization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticonvulsants 3aepilepsy 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amass spectrometry 3apharmacokinetics 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atherapeutics 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography 0aPharmacokinetic studies 0aEpilepsy 0aAntiepileptic drugs 0aBiological matrices 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring1 aBoadu, Joseph A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1285-36361 aAmponsah, Seth K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7411-09721 aOkai, Charles A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8220-90720 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 1179 p.122750-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1227503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245006600174300001600240520181000256592002802066650001902094650002002113650001502133650001102148650000802159650001402167650002402181651001902205700001502224700001602239700001902255773010202274856008702376852000902463655001202472IND60084093620221119081940.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmes, Jonathan10aRapid climate change: lessons from the recent geological past  ap. 157-162.  aRapid, or abrupt, climate change is regarded as a change in the climate system to a new state following the crossing of a threshold. It generally occurs at a rate exceeding that of the change in the underlying cause. Episodes of rapid climate change abound in the recent geological past (defined here as the interval between the last glacial maximum, dated to approximately 20,000years ago, and the present). Rapid climate changes are known to have occurred over time periods equal to or even less than a human lifespan: moreover, their effects on the global system are sufficiently large to have had significant societal impacts. The potential for similar events to occur in the future provides an important impetus for investigating the nature and causes of rapid climate change. This paper provides a brief overview of rapid climate change and an introduction to this special issue, which presents results generated by the palaeoclimatic component of the UK Natural Environment Research Council's rapid climate change programme, called RAPID. The papers in the special issue employ palaeoclimatic proxy data-sets obtained from marine, ice core and terrestrial archives to reconstruct rapid climate change during the last glacial cycle, its subsequent termination and the ensuing Holocene interglacial; some papers also report new attempts to match the palaeoclimate data to hypothesised causes through numerical modelling. The results confirm the importance of freshwater forcing in triggering changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and the close links between MOC and rapid climate change. While advancing our understanding of these linkages, the RAPID research has highlighted the need for further research in order to elucidate more specific details of the mechanisms involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aice 3alongevity 3amathematical models 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLowe, John1 aWolff, Eric1 aSrokosz, Meric0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Dec., v. 79, no. 3-4 p.157-162dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245014300184520211800327592002802445650001702473650001202490650001002502650001302512650002302525650002102548650000902569650001702578650001502595650002202610650001702632650002402649650001902673650003602692653002302728653002302751653003102774653001702805653001302822700002702835700002402862700003302886700002802919773009302947856008603040852000903126655001203135IND60688982020221121185537.0201223e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068898202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1210332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelo Cardozo, Ingrid Marcela10aDetermination of free- and bound-carbonyl compounds in airborne particles by ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  aThis study presents the development and application of a new analytical methodology for determination of free- and bound-carbonyl compounds (CC) (as the CC themselves and as the hydroxyalkylsulfonic acids – HASA, respectively) in airborne particles. Free- and bound-CC determination were done through reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH) and analysis by UFLC-MS. The method was successfully validated, showing good figures for linearity (R² ≥ 0.9937), sensibility (3 fg ˂ LOD ˂ 20 fg for methacrolein and heptanal, respectively) and repeatability (5.9% ˂ RSD ˂ 13%). The proposed method was successfully applied in real samples of inhalable atmospheric particulate matter (PM₁₀) and urban dust certified reference material (SRM 1649 b). The main CC determined in the SRM 1649 b was formaldehyde (75.4 μg g⁻¹ in the free form, and 1898 μg g⁻¹ in the bound form). In addition, for the bound-CC form (HASA), concentrations were determined for acetaldehyde (60.3 μg g⁻¹), acetone (20.5 μg g⁻¹), acrolein (9.15 μg g⁻¹), propionaldehyde (17.1 μg g⁻¹) and valeraldehyde (12.2 μg g⁻¹). For PM₁₀ samples, formaldehyde (148 μg g⁻¹) and acetaldehyde (28.9 μg g⁻¹) were quantified as free aldehydes and as HASA (hydroxymethanelsulfonic acid and hydroxyethanesulfonic acid were 432 μg g⁻¹ and 211 μg g⁻¹, respectively). Other bound-CC were, on average, within 19.2 μg g⁻¹ (acrolein) and 62.1 μg g⁻¹ (valeraldehyde). For all samples, acetone, acrolein, propionaldehyde and valeraldehyde were quantified only as HASA (bound-CC). Therefore, we could identify and quantify six carbonyl compounds using the proposed method. It is worth mentioning the hydrolysis step was crucial for the correct quantification of the HASAs. This was, in turn, what enabled the quantification of a greater number of analytes in the airborne samples. Hence, this procedure was found to be comprehensive, precise, accurate and suitable to be employed for determination of free-CC and HASA (bound-CC) in atmospheric particulate samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aacids 3aacrolein 3acarbonyl compounds 3achemical species 3adust 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3aparticulates 3areference standards 3asulfonic acids 3aultrafast liquid chromatography 0aParticulate matter 0aCarbonyl compounds 0aHydroxyalkylsulfonic acids 0aFormaldehyde 0aAcrolein1 aSousa, Eliane Teixeira1 ada Rocha, Gisele O.1 aPereira dos Anjos, Jeancarlo1 aAndrade, Jailson B. de,0 tTalanta.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 217 p.121033-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1210333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014800170500001900318520116100337592002801498650001301526650001501539650001301554650001701567650002101584653001401605653001301619653001401632653001401646653002601660653002101686653000901707653002101716653002501737700002701762773011101789856008601900852000901986655001201995IND60736472320221119152111.0210527e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1227512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndré, Claire10aDevelopment of a new nano arginase HPLC capillary column for the fast screening of arginase inhibitors and evaluation of their binding affinity  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA simple and rapid Nano LC method has been developed for the screening of arginase inhibitors. The method is based on the immobilization of biotinylated arginase on a neutravidin functionalized nano HPLC capillary column. The arginase immobilization step performed by frontal analysis is very fast and only takes a few minutes. The miniaturized capillary column of 170 nL (length 5 cm, internal diameter 75 μm) significantly decreased the required amount of used enzyme (25 pmol). This was of significance importance when working with less available or expensive purified enzyme. Non-selective adsorption of the organic monolith matrix was reduced (<6%) and the arginase efficient yield was high (92%). The resultant affinity capillary columns showed excellent repeatability and long lifetime. The arginase reaction product was achieved within 60 s and the immobilized arginase retained 97% of the initial activity beyond 90 days. This novel approach can thus be used for the fast evaluation of recognition assay induced bya series of inhibitor molecules (caffeic acid phenylamide, chlorogenic acid, piceatannol, nor-NOHA acetate) and plant extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3aarginase 3acaffeic acid 3achlorogenic acid 0aNano HPLC 0aMonolith 0aInhibitor 0aScreening 0aDissociation constant 0aBinding affinity 0aIC50 0aFrontal analysis 0aCompetitive analysis1 aGuillaume, Yves Claude0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 June 15, v. 1175 p.122751-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1227513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011500168300001600283520143000299592002801729650001201757650001901769650000901788650000901797650001101806650000901817650001501826700001601841700002301857773010201880856008701982852000902069655001202078IND60084093720221119081823.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, I.R.10aDeep water flow speed and surface ocean changes in the subtropical North Atlantic during the last deglaciation  ap. 255-263.  aClimate fluctuations during the last deglaciation have been linked to changes in the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) through its modulation of northward marine heat transport. Consequently, much research into the causes of rapid climate change has focused on the northern North Atlantic as a key component of global ocean circulation. The production of cold, deep waters in the Southern Ocean is an important factor in the Earth's heat budget, but the involvement of deep Southern Sourced Water (SSW) in deglacial climate change has yet to be fully established. Here we use terrigenous silt grain size data from two ocean sediment cores retrieved from the western subtropical North Atlantic to reconstruct past changes in the speed of deepwater flow. The first core site is located under the influence of Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW), and is representative of changes in the MOC. The second core site is close to the modern boundary between LNADW/SSW and is therefore ideally positioned to detect changes in SSW delivery to the North Atlantic. We find evidence for a broad-scale difference in flow speed changes at the two sites, with the presence of a vigorous, but poorly ventilated SSW mass at ~4200m water depth during the cold episodes of the last deglaciation when shallower (2975m water depth) grain size and geochemical data suggest that Northern Sourced Water (NSW) was suppressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold 3aheat 3aoceans 3asilt 3awater flow1 aEvans, H.K.1 aThornalley, D.J.R.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Dec., v. 79, no. 3-4 p.255-263dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245011000173300001600283520109100299592002801390650002301418650002501441650001301466650001001479650001301489650001801502650001001520650002401530650001301554650001101567650002201578650001601600700003201616700001601648700001701664700002001681773011301701856005501814852000901869655001201878IND50067418520221120065353.0130626e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006741852DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01130.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjörklöf, K.10aColonization strategies and conjugal gene transfer of inoculated Pseudomonas syringae on the leaf surface  ap. 423-432.  aSurvival, colonization and activity of Pseudomonas syringae bacteria inoculated onto the leaf surface of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was studied. Inoculated Ps. syringae cells shortened by half their size in 100% humidity and by an average of one fifth in 40–60% humidity. The respiring portion of the population, measured by the formation of 5‐cyano‐2,3‐ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC)‐formazan crystals, decreased more in 40–60% humidity than in 100% humidity. In scanning electron micrographs, the bacterial cells on leaf surfaces were seen embedded in a mucoid matrix. Intraspecies conjugation of plasmid RP1 also occurred in 40–60% humidity conditions. The portion of transconjugants temporally rose higher than the same portion in 100% humidity conditions. Therefore, although only a small proportion of the inoculated cells remained active on the leaf surface in 40–60% humidity, a relatively high rate of conjugation was still seen. Gene spreading was thus efficient on the leaf surface also when conditions did not allow bacterial population growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPseudomonas syringae 3abacteria 3abeans 3acrystals 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenetic conjugation 3ahumidity 3aleaves 3apopulation growth 3atetrazolium1 aNurmiaho‐Lassila, E.‐L.1 aKlinger, N.1 aHaahtela, K.1 aRomantschuk, M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Sept., v. 89, no. 3 p.423-432dBlackwell Science Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01130.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03996naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019000168500001900358520200700377592002802384650002102412650002102433650004602454650001602500650001402516650001102530650002902541650001902570650001802589650001702607650001302624653003102637653001302668653005002681653003202731653000902763653001002772653000802782653001302790653001002803653000802813653000802821653000802829653000802837700001802845700001502863700001702878700001502895700001602910700001502926700001802941700001702959700001702976700005602993700001703049700001703066700001603083700001703099773011103116856008603227852000903313655001203322IND60736472420221119151826.0210527e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1227522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lijuan10aSimultaneous and rapid determination of 12 tyrosine kinase inhibitors by LC-MS/MS in human plasma: Application to therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with non-small cell lung cancer  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, more than 50 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was indicated against numerous cancers, especially outstanding advantages in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and several studies have shown that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of TKIs can improve treatment efficacy and safety. The present study aimed to develop and validate a LC-MS/MS method for the TDM of 12 TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, dacomitinib, icotinib, osimertinib, crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, dabrafenib, trametinib, anlotinib) in patients with NSCLC. The analytes of interest and internal standard were extracted from human plasma. Salting-out assisted liquid–liquid extraction (SALLE) with 5 M ammonium acetate solution was optimized for method validation and compared to simple protein precipitation (PPT). Chromatographic separation was conducted on Waters X bridge C18 column (100 × 4.6 mm, 3.5 μm) using a gradient elution of acetonitrile/5mM ammonium acetate in pure water with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at 40 °C within 6 min. The total flow was maintained at 1 mL/min, 30% of the post column flow was split into the mass spectrometer and the rest to waste via a 3-way tee. The mass analysis was performed by positive ion electrospray ionization (ESI) in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The assay was validated based on the guidelines on bioanalytical methods by FDA. This quantification method was proved to be satisfactory in selectivity, accuracy, precision, linearity (r² > 0.995), recovery, matrix effect and stability and the accuracy was further assessed in plasma with a degree of hemolysis of 4%. The described method to simultaneously quantify the 12 selected anticancer drugs in human plasma was successfully validated and applied to routine TDM of gefitinib, erlotinib, icotinib, osimertinib, crizotinib and anlotinib in cancer patients. TKIs plasma monitoring helps to individualize dose adjustment and manage adverse effects in NSCLC patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium acetate 3achemical species 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aformic acid 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3alung neoplasms 3aspectrometers 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine 0aTyrosine kinase inhibitors 0aLC-MS/MS 0aSalting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring 0aTKIs 0aNSCLC 0aTDM 0aLC-MS/MS 0aSALLE 0aPPT 0aESI 0aMRM 0aFDA1 aWang, Shuowen1 aChen, Ming1 aHuang, Shiqi1 aZhang, Min1 aBao, Wuping1 aBao, Aihua1 aZhang, Pengyu1 aGuo, Haiying1 aLiu, Zhenwei1 aXie, Guogang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2167-19761 aGao, Jianwei1 aWu, Zhenghua1 aLou, Yuefen1 aFan, Guorong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 June 15, v. 1175 p.122752-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1227523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245010000187300001600287520097400303592002801277650002901305650001201334650001301346650001101359650001101370650001201381650003501393650001701428650001301445650000901458650002601467650001101493650001501504650002001519650001101539650001201550650001701562650000901579650004001588650002901628650001401657650001101671650002101682650002001703650003001723651001201753651001201765653001601777653002201793653001601815653002201831653002701853700001601880700001601896773008901912856008402001852000902085655001202094IND60086735020221121062510.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673502DNAL7 a235000472pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzolnoki, Zs.10aCumulative impacts of human activities on urban garden soils: Origin and accumulation of metals  ap. 106-115.  aThe concentration of heavy metals and soil properties in fifty urban garden soils of Szeged (SE Hungary) were determined to evaluate the cumulative impacts of urbanization and cultivation on these soils. Using two enrichment factors (EFs) (based on reference horizon; Ti as reference element) and multivariate statistical analysis (PCA), the origin of the studied elements was defined.According to statistical coincidence of EFs confirmed by t-test, anthropogenic enrichment of Cu (EF = 4), Zn (EF = 2.7) and Pb (EF = 2.5) was significant in topsoils. Moreover, PCA also revealed the geogenic origin of Ni, Co, Cr and As and differentiated two groups of the anthropogenic metals [Pb, Zn] [Cu]. Spatial distribution of the metals visualized by GIS reflected the traffic origin of Pb; while based on ANOVA, the anthropogenic source of Cu is relevant (mainly pesticides) and there is a statistically significant difference in its concentration depending on land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3agardens 3ageographic information systems 3aheavy metals 3aland use 3alead 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3apesticides 3asoil properties 3at-test 3atraffic 3aurbanization 3azinc 2aCitiesxstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGardening 2aHumans 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aHungary 0aHungary 0aGarden soil 0aEnrichment factor 0aHeavy metal 0aUrban environment 0aMultivariate statistic1 aFarsang, A.1 aPuskás, I.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 June, v. 177 p.106-115dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245010600170300001600276520121700292592002801509650002701537650002701564650001601591650002901607650001201636650001201648650001501660650001401675650002401689650001401713650001301727650002401740650001601764650001901780700002401799773011301823856005501936852000901991655001202000IND50067418920221120065301.0130626e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006741892DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01127.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamouda, T.10aAntimicrobial mechanism of action of surfactant lipid preparations in enteric Gram‐negative bacilli  ap. 397-403.  aTwo surfactant lipid preparations (SLPs) were investigated to determine their mechanism of antimicrobial action. 8N8, a water‐in‐oil emulsion, and W60C, a liposome, both have bactericidal activity against Gram‐positive bacteria and non‐enteric Gram‐negative bacteria. Additionally, W60C is bactericidal for enteric Gram‐negative bacilli when suspended in deionized water. Zeta potential measurements suggested that the resistance of Gram‐negative bacilli to 8N8 might be caused by ionic repulsion. Addition of 50 µmol l⁻¹ ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid in 100 mmol l⁻¹ Tris buffer to either SLPs yielded efficient bactericidal activity against Gram‐negative bacilli. This appeared to be due to disruption of the outer membrane and the chelation of divalent cations, as the addition of excess calcium inhibited the antimicrobial effect. Electron microscopy studies documented that 8N8 disrupts the bacterial cell wall, lysing the bacteria, while W60C fuses and internalizes within the cell, causing damage without immediate cell lysis. Understanding the mechanisms of action of these biocidal formulations will help to produce improved formulations with broader spectra of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aacetic acid 3aantibacterial properties 3acalcium 3acations 3acell walls 3achelation 3aelectron microscopy 3aemulsions 3aethylene 3amechanism of action 3asurfactants 3azeta potential1 aBaker, J.R., JrcJr0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Sept., v. 89, no. 3 p.397-403dBlackwell Science Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01127.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014200163520150800305592002801813650002201841650001701863650002201880650003101902650000701933650001201940650002601952650002201978650001602000653003102016653005002047653002602097653001702123700001602140700001802156700001902174773009302193856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60688982320221121151816.0201223e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068898232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1210362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Li10aThree–level simultaneous component analysis for analyzing the near–infrared spectra of aqueous solutions under multiple perturbations  aQuantitative analysis under various perturbations is a difficult problem because the analytical signal changes with different factors. In this work, three–level simultaneous component analysis (3–MSCA) was used for analyzing the near–infrared (NIR) spectra of aqueous solutions under different perturbations. The spectral data of aqueous proline solutions at different pH, concentration and temperature were measured, and a three–level model was built to describe the effects of the three perturbations on the spectra, respectively. The first level model describes the change of the spectra with pH, from which significant aggregation of proline was observed around the isoelectric point. The second and third level model show the spectral change with concentration and temperature, respectively, and the spectral feature has a very good linear relationship with the corresponding influencing factors. Therefore, the pH and concentration scores can be used as the calibration curve for quantitative analysis of the pH and the content of proline, and the temperature scores can be used to predict the temperature of the solutions. In addition, the structural change of water molecules under different conditions is obtained from the loadings. A decline of the bulk water was found with the increase of concentration, implying an ascending trend of the bonded water due to the interaction of proline and water. The dissociation of water clusters with the increase of temperature is also displayed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adissociation 3aisoelectric point 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apH 3aproline 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aThree–level simultaneous component analysis 0aQuantitative analysis 0aPerturbation1 aCui, Xiaoyu1 aCai, Wensheng1 aShao, Xueguang0 tTalanta.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 217 p.121036-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1210363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04098naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245011000176300001400286500001500300520215700315592002802472650002102500650002002521650001202541650002402553650001502577650001402592650001402606650001902620650001102639650002302650650001102673650001702684650001202701650002302713650001902736650001502755650001702770650001702787650003502804650001502839650002702854653003202881653002602913653003702939653000902976653001302985653001802998653001903016653002503035653004203060700002503102700002203127700002303149700002603172700005903198773009903257856008303356852000903439655001203448IND60568575720221120132438.0170708e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056857572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2017.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErnstsen, Christina L.10aDetection and quantification of intracellular bacterial colonies by automated, high-throughput microscopy  ap. 37-44.  a2019-12-06  aTo target bacterial pathogens that invade and proliferate inside host cells, it is necessary to design intervention strategies directed against bacterial attachment, cellular invasion and intracellular proliferation. We present an automated microscopy-based, fast, high-throughput method for analyzing size and number of intracellular bacterial colonies in infected tissue culture cells.Cells are seeded in 48-well plates and infected with a GFP-expressing bacterial pathogen. Following gentamicin treatment to remove extracellular pathogens, cells are fixed and cell nuclei stained. This is followed by automated microscopy and subsequent semi-automated spot detection to determine the number of intracellular bacterial colonies, their size distribution, and the average number per host cell. Multiple 48-well plates can be processed sequentially and the procedure can be completed in one working day.As a model we quantified intracellular bacterial colonies formed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) during infection of human kidney cells (HKC-8). Urinary tract infections caused by UPEC are among the most common bacterial infectious diseases in humans. UPEC can colonize tissues of the urinary tract and is responsible for acute, chronic, and recurrent infections. In the bladder, UPEC can form intracellular quiescent reservoirs, thought to be responsible for recurrent infections. In the kidney, UPEC can colonize renal epithelial cells and pass to the blood stream, either via epithelial cell disruption or transcellular passage, to cause sepsis. Intracellular colonies are known to be clonal, originating from single invading UPEC.In our experimental setup, we found UPEC CFT073 intracellular bacterial colonies to be heterogeneous in size and present in nearly one third of the HKC-8 cells.This high-throughput experimental format substantially reduces experimental time and enables fast screening of the intracellular bacterial load and cellular distribution of multiple bacterial isolates. This will be a powerful experimental tool facilitating the study of bacterial invasion, drug resistance, and the development of new therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepithelial cells 3adrug resistance 3abladder 3ainfectious diseases 3ablood flow 3ascreening 3apathogens 3amicrobial load 3ahumans 3abacterial adhesion 3amodels 3acell nucleus 3akidneys 3asepsis (infection) 3atissue culture 3amicroscopy 3akidney cells 3atherapeutics 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 3agentamicin 3aurinary tract diseases 0aGentamicin protection assay 0aUropathogenic E. coli 0aIntracellular bacterial colonies 0aUPEC 0aCystitis 0acell invasion 0aPyelonephritis 0aColony forming units 0aQuantitative high through-put imaging1 aLogin, Frédéric H.1 aJensen, Helene H.1 aNørregaard, Rikke1 aMøller-Jensen, Jakob1 aNejsum, Lene N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4368-88210 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2017 Aug., v. 139 p.37-44dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2017.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245011400177300001600291520120100307592002801508650002301536650002001559650002301579650001301602650001001615650003001625650001801655650004501673650001401718650001301732700001801745700001701763700001901780773011301799856005501912852000901967655001201976IND50067418720221120065259.0130626e200009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006741872DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01134.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShangkuan, Y.‐H.10aComparison of PCR–RFLP, ribotyping and ERIC–PCR for typing Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus strains  ap. 452-462.  aPCR–RFLP analysis of the vrrA gene and cerAB gene was used to investigate the genomic diversity in 21 strains of Bacillus anthracis and 28 strains of Bacillus cereus, and was compared with results obtained by ribotyping and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus–PCR (ERIC–PCR) analysis. VrrA‐typing divided the B. anthracis into four groups. Except for one Pasteur vaccine strain, the vrrA PCR–RFLP profiles of the B. anthracis were separated into three groups, which were different from those of the B. cereus strains. Ribotyping separated the B. anthracis isolates into seven ribotypes, and a common fragment of an approximately 850 bp band from the ERIC–PCR fingerprints separated most B. anthracis strains into two groups. VrrA/cerAB PCR–RFLP, ribotyping and ERIC–PCR generated 18, 22 and 23 types, respectively, from B. cereus strains. The results suggest that a combination of all three methods provides a high resolution typing method for B. anthracis and B. cereus. Compared with ribotyping and ERIC–PCR, PCR–RFLP is simple to perform and has potential as a rapid method for typing and discriminating B. anthracis strains from other B. cereus group bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus cereus 3aDNA fingerprinting 3abacteria 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribotypes 3avaccines1 aYang, J.‐F.1 aLin, H.‐C.1 aShaio, M.‐F.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2000 Sept., v. 89, no. 3 p.452-462dBlackwell Science Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2000.01134.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012900161300001600290520123600306592002801542650002201570650002701592650001901619650001201638650001201650650002101662650002201683650001301705650002101718650002001739650001601759650002001775650000901795650001801804650001001822700001701832700001701849700001401866700005401880773012801934856008302062852000902145655001202154IND60675135320221119034949.0191231e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067513532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04235-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Ran10aStem aqueous extracts of accumulator Bidens tripartita L. strongly promoted Solanum nigrum L. Cd hyperaccumulation from soil  ap. 401-411.  aAIMS: The effects of aqueous extracts from bio-resources on Solanum nigrum L. Cd hyperaccumulation were determined with EDTA as control. METHODS: Soil pot culture experiment and Leaching experiment were arranged and conducted. RESULTS: The results showed that stem extracts of Bidens tripartita L. (BT-S) significantly increased (by 61.0%) Cd shoot concentration in S. nigrum, which was higher compared (p < 0.05) to EDTA addition (32.4%), and the plants grew well. However, S. nigrum shoot biomass significantly decreased by 23.9% (p < 0.05) in the case of EDTA addition. The extraction rate of BT-S was 56.2% in the soil leaching experiment, and the extractable Cd concentration in soil in BT-S treatment was 69.7% higher compared to control. The concentrations of soluble polysaccharides, total organic acids and reducing sugars in the BT-S treatment were much higher than for other extracts, which may partly be the reason for it strong stimulation of S. nigrum Cd hyperaccumulation from the soil. CONCLUSIONS: The aqueous extracts of B. tripartita stems (BT-S) significantly increased (p < 0.05) S. nigrum hyperaccumulating Cd. This new chelator that can replace EDTA is of great significance for phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBidens tripartita 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aSolanum nigrum 3abiomass 3acadmium 3achelating agents 3ahyperaccumulators 3aleaching 3aphytoremediation 3apolysaccharides 3apot culture 3areducing sugars 3asoil 3astem extracts 3astems1 aDai, Huiping1 aSkuza, Lidia1 aZhan, Jie1 aWei, Shuhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6983-43940 tPlant and soil.g2019 Oct., v. 443, no. 1-2 p.401-411dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04235-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007000170520132600240592002801566650001501594650001901609650001901628650001401647650001501661650001901676650001901695650001401714650002101728650001701749650001501766650001301781653001201794653001101806653001401817653002901831700001701860700001501877700002001892700001401912700001701926773009301943856008602036852000902122655001202131IND60688982420221121151811.0201223e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068898242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1210372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Yingying10aAptamer AS1411 utilized for super-resolution imaging of nucleolin  aNucleolin (NCL) is a multifunctional protein that mainly localizes in the nucleolus and also distributes in the nucleoplasm, cytoplasm and cell membrane. Most studies focus on its biofunctions in cell activities and diseases, however, its detailed distribution and organization pattern in situ remains obscure. Moreover, antibodies were commonly used to investigate NCL in cells. It is worth noting that antibody labeling of intracellular proteins needs detergents to permeabilize the membrane, which could disrupt the membrane structure and proteins. The emergence of aptamer AS1411 provides us a good choice to recognize the NCL without permeabilization owing to its superior cellular uptake and enhanced stability. Therefore, we applied aptamer AS1411 to super-resolution imaging to visualize the distribution of NCL at a nanometer level. Aptamer achieved a better recognition of intracellular NCL and displayed the detailed structure of NCL in different parts of cells. Significantly, cytoplasmic and membrane NCL have higher expression and larger clusters in cancer cells than that in normal cells. Our work presented a detailed organization of NCL in cells and revealed the distribution differences between cancer cells and normal cells, which promote the understanding of its functions in physiology and pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acell membranes 3acell nucleolus 3acytoplasm 3adetergents 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3apermeability 3aphysiology 3aproteins 0aAptamer 0adSTORM 0aNucleolin 0aSuper-resolution imaging1 aCai, Mingjun1 aZhou, Lulu1 aJiang, Junguang1 aGao, Jing1 aWang, Hongda0 tTalanta.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 217 p.121037-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1210373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01248naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007500154300001800229520029400247592002800541650001600569650002300585650002100608650001300629650001300642700001600655700001400671700003100685773013400716856007500850852000900925655001200934IND60658928120221119042406.0190826e20110329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065892812DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10584a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aFacile synthesis of 3,4-dihalofurans via electrophilic iodocyclization  ap. 4541-4543.  aA facile, efficient, and general synthetic method for 3,4-dihalofurans has been developed via the electrophilic iodocyclization of various 4-hydroxy-2-but-2-yn-1-ones.

METHODS: This study sought to describe and provide an overview of animal poison exposures in South Africa. Poisoning episodes reported to the Poisons Information Helpline of the Western Cape, jointly run by the Poisons Information Centres at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital and Tygerberg Hospital over a period of approximately 2.5 years, from June 2015 to November 2017, were analysed to identify exposure patterns, severity and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Alien plant species accounted for most cases (n=10) of reported poison exposures. Among the 26 recorded animal poisoning episodes, the dog was the most commonly implicated species (n=24), whereas just two enquiries were related to other animals (one rabbit and one cow). There were 20 plant cases and 6 mushroom cases (all dogs). There was only one fatal case involving cycad in a dog. CONCLUSION: Features of animal poisoning in South Africa were similar to those in other countries. The reported cases of animals exposed to poisonous plants and mushrooms could represent only a fraction of the actual exposures. Since most reported cases involved taxa that could not be identified to species level, more attention should be paid in case reporting and in animal poisoning prevention, engaging the public to enable people to recognise potentially hazardous plants and reduce the risk of poisoning in animals.  aPublisher supplied data  cSouth African National Department of Environment Affairs 3aCycadopsida 3acows 3adogs 3ahospitals 3aintroduced plants 3amushrooms 3arabbits 3arisk reduction 3aSouth Africa1 aBertero, Alessia1 aMarks, Carine1 aStephen, Cindy1 aMothapo, Natasha Palesa1 aMiddleton, Lorraine1 aCaloni, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2527-77540 tVeterinary record open.g2020, v. 7, no. 1 p.e000402-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2020-0004023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245011700210520119900327592002801526650002801554650002201582650002101604650001301625650002101638650002401659651001601683653002301699653002301722653002101745653002001766653001001786700006001796700005701856773011001913856008802023852000902111655001202120IND60768921420221123043704.0220412e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076892142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1061022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yi hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9991-249610aPolicy translation and dynamics: The role of Dutch ideas in developing South Korea's coastal management policies  aIn the literature on coastal land reclamation and ecological restoration policies, the role of policy translation has received limited attention vis-à-vis domestic political factors. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by clarifying the role of Dutch actors in developing South Korea's coastal management policies. To do so, we first develop an analytical framework that operationalizes the ‘policy translation’ concept into distinguishable components. This framework is used in the analysis of Korean land reclamation and wetland restoration policies. Our analysis reveals that in both cases no full-fledged policy transfer has occurred but that powerful domestic actors used other countries' policy elements to shape national discourses. Based on our analysis, we discuss the role of policy translation in understanding domestic policy change. We conclude that developing large water management projects is inherently political and the input of external ideas are no exclusion to this. Therefore, our paper makes a case for a more combined and integrated assessment of the role of both foreign and domestic factors in future studies on the development of coastal management policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3aissues and policy 3aland restoration 3apolitics 3awater management 3awetland restoration 3aSouth Korea 0aCoastal management 0aPolicy translation 0aLand reclamation 0aThe Netherlands 0aKorea1 aDieperink, Carel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1926-46421 aHegger, Dries1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2721-35270 tOcean & coastal management.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 221 p.106102-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.1061023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014200169300001600311520196000327592002802287650003102315650002802346650002002374650001102394650001902405650001202424650001702436650001802453650001402471650001302485650001102498650001502509650001102524650002102535650000902556650000902565650002002574650001602594651001302610700001602623700002202639700001802661700002202679700001702701700002002718700001702738773010202755856008702857852000902944655001202953IND60084094120221119081704.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Andy10aHigh resolution δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C records from an annually laminated Scottish stalagmite and relationship with last millennium climate  ap. 303-311.  aHigh-resolution (annual to decadal) stable isotope records of oxygen and carbon are analysed from an annually laminated stalagmite from NW Scotland. The sample, which was deposited for ~1000yrs until 1996AD, has previously provided annual resolution climate reconstructions of local rainfall and regional winter North Atlantic Oscillation (wNAO) from variations in annual growth rate. For our stalagmite, for which modern cave monitoring demonstrates that equilibrium deposition is highly likely for δ¹⁸O but not for δ¹³C, stalagmite δ¹³C originally derives from soil CO₂ produced predominantly by microbial respiration, modified by degassing-related kinetic fractionation, and δ¹⁸O from the composition of infiltrating water during periods of infiltrating water. Both the presence of fluorescent laminae and modern drip-water monitoring demonstrate a drip hydrology that comprises both event and storage components. Over the instrumental period, no correlations between stalagmite or rainfall δ¹⁸O and precipitation amount or temperature are observed, but correlations are observed between rainfall δ¹⁸O and 500mb height at regional IAEA monitoring stations. However, no correlations are observed between stalagmite δ¹⁸O and instrumental and reconstructed atmospheric circulation, preventing a simple palaeoclimate interpretation of the stalagmite δ¹⁸O proxy. Stalagmite δ¹³C has a stronger temporal autocorrelation than δ¹⁸O, indicative of soil mixing of respired CO₂ and significant variability between drips and at different times; correlations with instrumental climate data are therefore not possible. The relative timing of changes in growth rate, δ¹⁸O and δ¹³C are discussed, and interpretations compared with other regional climate records. We conclude that, over the last millennium at this mid-latitude cave site, neither δ¹⁸O nor δ¹³C cannot be interpreted as a simple paleoclimate proxy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aatmospheric circulation 3aautocorrelation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3afluorescence 3afractionation 3ahydrology 3alatitude 3amixing 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3arain 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3aScotland1 aWilson, Rob1 aFairchild, Ian J.1 aFranke, Joerg1 aSpötl, Christoph1 aMattey, Dave1 aTrouet, Valerie1 aFuller, Lisa0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Dec., v. 79, no. 3-4 p.303-311dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005900149245009100208500002000299520105400319592002801373650002701401650001501428650001201443650001101455650001501466650002801481650001201509650000901521650001401530650001401544651001601558700001701574700001801591700002101609700005901630700001801689700001801707773012201725856008401847852000901931655001201940IND60790625920221121011824.0220826s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062592DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2020-0004372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStalder, Sandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1077-292310aDetection of Chlamydiaceae in Swiss wild birds sampled at a bird rehabilitation centre  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Annually, 800–1500 wild birds are admitted to the rehabilitation centre of the Swiss Ornithological Institute, Sempach, Lucerne, Switzerland. The workers of the centre come in close contact with the avian patients and might therefore be exposed to zoonotic agents shed by these birds, such as Chlamydia psittaci. METHODS: In the present study, 91 choanal, 91 cloacal and 267 faecal swabs from 339 wild birds of 42 species were investigated using a stepwise diagnostic approach. RESULTS: Chlamydiaceae were detected in 0.9 per cent (0.3–2.6 per cent) of birds (n=3), all of them members of the Columbidae family. The Chlamydiaceae species of two of these birds (one Eurasian collared dove, one fancy pigeon) were identified as C psittaci types B and E by PCR and outer membrane protein A genotyping. CONCLUSION: The findings of the current study suggest that zoonotic transmission of Chlamydiaceae is very unlikely for songbird and waterfowl species tested herein, while pigeons might pose a risk to workers at rehabilitation centres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydophila psittaci 3aColumbidae 3aalfalfa 3acloaca 3agenotyping 3aouter membrane proteins 3apigeons 3arisk 3asongbirds 3awaterfowl 3aSwitzerland1 aMarti, Hanna1 aBorel, Nicole1 aMattmann, Prisca1 aVogler, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8330-52691 aWolfrum, Nina1 aAlbini, Sarah0 tVeterinary record open.g2020, v. 7, no. 1 p.e000437-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2020-0004373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001600282520135100298592002801649650000801677650001601685650001401701650002401715650001301739650001901752650001101771650001001782650001101792650001501803650001001818650001201828650002401840653001301864653001401877653003601891653002201927653002901949653003001978700001802008700001602026700001302042700001402055700001502069700001502084700001802099700001602117700001802133700005602151700001902207700001402226700002002240700002002260700006002280773022902340856008202569852000902651655001202660IND60736473020221119151551.0210806e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2021.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lijing12aA high-resolution cell atlas of the domestic pig lung and an online platform for exploring lung single-cell data  ap. 411-425.  aThe genetically engineered pig is regarded as an optimal source of organ transplantation for humans and an excellent model for human disease research, given its comparable physiology to human beings. A myriad of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data on humans has been reported, but such data on pigs are scarce. Here, we apply scRNA-seq technology to study the cellular heterogeneity of 3-month-old pig lungs, generating the single-cell atlas of 13,580 cells covering 16 major cell types. Based on these data, we systematically characterize the similarities and differences in the cellular cross-talk and expression patterns of respiratory virus receptors in each cell type of pig lungs compared with human lungs. Furthermore, we analyze pig lung xenotransplantation barriers and reported the cell-type expression patterns of 10 genes associated with pig-to-human immunobiological incompatibility and coagulation dysregulation. We also investigate the conserved transcription factors (TFs) and their candidate target genes and constructed five conserved TF regulatory networks in the main cell types shared by pig and human lungs. Finally, we present a comprehensive and openly accessible online platform, ScdbLung. Our scRNA-seq atlas of the domestic pig lung and ScdbLung database can guide pig lung research and clinical applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acoagulation 3adatabases 3agenetic engineering 3agenomics 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3alungs 3amodels 3aphysiology 3aswine 3aviruses 3axenotransplantation 0aPig lung 0ascRNA-seq 0aTranscription factor regulation 0aSignaling pathway 0aCross-species comparison 0aLung single-cell platform1 aZhu, Jiacheng1 aWang, Haoyu1 aXia, Jun1 aLiu, Ping1 aChen, Fang1 aJiang, Hui1 aMiao, Qiuling1 aWu, Weiying1 aZhang, Lingli1 aLuo, Li-Hua,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2129-42261 aJiang, Xiaosen1 aBai, Yong1 aSun, Chengcheng1 aChen, Dongsheng1 aZhang, Xingliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1247-74230 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2021 May 20, v. 48, no. 5 p.411-425dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2021.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001800289520140800307592002801715650001501743650001401758650002401772650002201796650001801818650002601836650001001862650002101872650001001893650002101903650002101924700001801945773015401963856008102117852000902198655001202207IND60624220620221120214629.0181202e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062422062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-5075-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwaikambo, L.

The results were then analysed with respect to the diameter and internal structure such as cellulose content, crystallinity index and micro-fibril angle. The tensile strength and stiffness were found to vary with varying concentration of caustic soda, which also had a varying effect on the cell wall morphological structure such as the primary wall and secondary wall. The optimum tensile strength and Young’s modulus were obtained at 0.16% NaOH by weight. The stiffness of the sisal fibre bundles obtained using the cellulose content also referred to as the micro-fibril content was compared with the stiffness determined using the crystallinity index. The stiffness obtained using the crystallinity index was found to be higher than that obtained using the cellulose content however, the difference was insignificant. Alkalisation was found to change the internal structure of sisal fibres that exhibited specific stiffness that was approximately the same as that of steel. These results indicates that the structure of sisal fibre can be chemically modified to attain properties that will make the fibre useful as a replacement for synthetic fibres where high stiffness requirement is not a pre-requisite and that it can be used as a reinforcement for the manufacture of composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3amanufacturing 3amodulus of elasticity 3asisal 3asodium hydroxide 3asteel 3asynthetic fibers 3atensile strength1 aAnsell, M.

The block ratio in terms of the degree of polymerization (the subscripts) was designed to be close to 1 in order to promote formation of two-dimensional micelles by self-assembly in poor solvents for the PFS block. The amphiphilic corona-forming block is soluble in a wide variety of solvents of distinct hydrophilicities and polarities (e.g., 2-propanol, 1-pentanol, 1-octanol, and decane). This property enabled us to examine self-assembly of the block copolymer by the seeded growth protocol in this wide range of different solvents. In 2-propanol, self-assembly was difficult to study except at very low seed micelle concentrations and led to the formation of rounded rectangular platelets. Nearly circular but uniform disks formed in 1-pentanol, and leaf-shaped structures with irregular edges formed in 1-octanol. In 1-pentanol, 3D circular spirals were formed at elevated levels of unimer addition, presumably due to screw dislocations. These structures are all very different from the spherulite objects that we reported previously (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, 2021, 60, 10,950–10,956) for similar self-assembly experiments with this polymer in decane. We also examine the transition in morphology in mixtures of decane and 1-octanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adecane 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amicelles 3apentanols 3apolymerization1 aZhou, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4284-96541 aHicks, Garion1 aJiang, Jingjie1 aZhang, Yefeng1 aManners, Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3794-967X1 aWinnik, Mitchell A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2673-21410 tMacromolecules.g2021 Oct. 08, v. 54, no. 20 p.9761-9772dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c017153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012500169300001600294500001500310520225500325592002802580650002802608650002602636650001102662650001202673650001502685650001302700650001402713650001702727650002102744650001702765650000902782650001102791650001802802650002202820650001502842650001002857650001002867650001702877651001302894653002402907653001602931653001902947653001502966653001602981653003002997700002603027773011603053856008503169852000903254655001203263IND60542603720221120064413.0190403e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054260372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEarl, Julia E.10aImportance of forestry practices relative to microhabitat and microclimate changes for juvenile pond-breeding amphibians  ap. 151-160.  a2019-12-06  aBalancing the goals of forest management and species conservation is a major challenge. Forestry practices could be refined with greater understanding of the importance of large-scale forestry practices versus smaller-scale microhabitat and microclimate variables in driving demographic vital rates for species of conservation concern. We examined the relative importance of forestry practices, microhabitat, and microclimate on juvenile anuran survival and growth. To do so, we examined three different species: wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), American toads (Anaxyrus americanus), and southern leopard frogs (Lithobates sphenocephalus), in three different years using terrestrial enclosures. Terrestrial enclosures were placed in forestry treatment plots with unharvested forest, partial cut forest, early successional forest (ESF; i.e. 4–6year old clearcut) with downed wood removed, and ESF with downed wood retained in central Missouri, USA. We ranked models using an information-theoretic approach to determine whether forestry treatment, microhabitat (logs, canopy cover, leaf litter depth), or microclimate (temperature and soil moisture) best predicted juvenile survival and growth. We found that microhabitat and microclimate, but not forestry practices, were important for survival and growth. However, small sample sizes may have limited our ability to detect forestry treatment effects. Most associations with growth and survival involved microclimate variables. Effects of microhabitat showed positive associations of survival with canopy cover and downed wood and of growth with leaf litter depth. All effects varied by species/year and season, as is common for studies on the effects of forestry practices on amphibians, indicating that it would be useful to maintain a variety of different microhabitats and microclimates to support a diverse anuran community. Because juvenile survival is a population-regulating parameter for many amphibians, it may be prudent to focus on creating favorable microhabitats and microclimates within areas under active forest management. However, it would be useful to repeat this type of study in different eco-regions with different species to determine the generalizability of these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilvicultural practices 3aLithobates sylvaticus 3acanopy 3aforests 3aecoregions 3aAnaxyrus 3ajuveniles 3aplant litter 3asoil temperature 3amicroclimate 3awood 3amodels 3amicrohabitats 3aforest management 3asoil water 3afrogs 3atoads 3aclearcutting 3aMissouri 0aCoarse woody debris 0aPartial cut 0aRana sylvatica 0aLithobates 0aTemperature 0aEarly successional forest1 aSemlitsch, Raymond D.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 357 p.151-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009700172300001600269520243500285592002802720650001202748650002002760650002402780650001102804650001602815650001402831650001302845650002502858700001802883700001802901700002002919700002402939700001702963773010202980856008703082852000903169655001203178IND60084094520221119081800.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanford, J.D.10aSea-level probability for the last deglaciation: A statistical analysis of far-field records  ap. 193-203.  aPulses of ice-sheet meltwater into the world ocean during the last deglaciation are of great current interest, because these large-scale events offer important test-beds for numerical models of the responses of ocean circulation and climate to meltwater addition. The largest such event has become known as meltwater pulse (mwp) 1a, with estimates of about 20m of sea-level rise in about 500years. A second meltwater pulse (mwp-1b) has been inferred from some sea-level records, but its existence has become debated following the presentation of additional records. Even the use of the more ubiquitous mwp-1a in modelling studies has been compromised by debate about its exact age, based upon perceived discrepancies between far-field sea-level records. It is clear that an objective investigation is needed to determine to what level inferred similarities and/or discrepancies between the various deglacial sea-level records are statistically rigorous (or not). For that purpose, we present a Monte Carlo style statistical analysis to determine the highest-probability sea-level history from six key far-field deglacial sea-level records, which fully accounts for realistic methodological and chronological uncertainties in all these records, and which is robust with respect to removal of individual component datasets. We find that sea-level rise started to accelerate into the deglaciation from around 17kaBP. Within the deglacial rise, there were two distinct increases; one at around the timing of the Bølling warming (14.6kaBP), and another, much broader, event that just post-dates the end of the Younger Dryas (11.3kaBP). We interpret these as mwp-1a and mwp-1b, respectively. We find that mwp-1a occurred between 14.3kaBP and 12.8kaBP. Highest rates of sea-level rise occurred at ~13.8ka, probably (67% confidence) within the range of 100–130cm/century, although values may have been as high as 260cm/century (99% confidence limit). Mwp-1b is robustly expressed as a broad multi-millennial interval of enhanced rates of sea-level rise between 11.5kaBP and 8.8kaBP, with peak rates of rise of up to 250cm/century (99% confidence), but with a probable rate of 130–150cm/century (67% confidence) at around 9.5kaBP. When considering the 67% probability interval for the deglacial sea-level history, it is clear that both mwp-1a and -1b were relatively subdued in comparison to the previously much higher rate estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3amathematical models 3aoceans 3aprobability 3asea level 3asnowmelt 3astatistical analysis1 aHemingway, R.1 aRohling, E.J.1 aChallenor, P.G.1 aMedina-Elizalde, M.1 aLester, A.J.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 Dec., v. 79, no. 3-4 p.193-203dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010700159300001600266520128000282592002801562650001901590650001201609650001701621650002401638700001601662700002001678700001501698773012401713856007401837852000901911655001201920IND60656711420221120045123.0190814e20131205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065671142DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41534a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiao-gui12aA general method for optimizing the parameter of α/β discrimination in liquid scintillation counting  ap. 115-119.  aIn the application of liquid scintillation counting (LSC), the α/β discrimination is carried out with the function of pulse shape analysis (PSA), which requires the setting of the optimum PSA level. The optimum PSA is usually determined by the generation of cross-over plots (referred as Conventional Method), whereby a pair of pure α and β emitters is essential. However, in some cases, a pure α or β emitter is not available. In order to deal with this problem, we have developed a new approach (referred as Present Method) to set the optimum PSA by measuring the sample itself of mixed α/β emitters. The results from Present Method are in good agreement with those from Conventional Method when a pair of pure α and β emitters is available. Besides the obvious advantage that Present Method can be applied no matter whether a pure α emitter or a pure β emitter is available or not, Present Method has another important advantage that it is not necessary to prepare the quench curves for the measurement of samples with different quench levels. Therefore, Present Method is a general method for optimizing the parameter of α/β discrimination in LSC. In addition, the application of Present Method can be broadened by combining the method with α spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflow cytometry 3aliquids 3aspectroscopy 3asystem optimization1 aHe, Qian-ge1 aWang, Jian-chen1 aChen, Jing0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Dec. 5, v. 6, no. 1 p.115-119dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41534a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010500167300001600272520212200288536018202410592002802592650002302620650001402643650001702657650002802674650001102702650002002713650001802733650001302751650001402764651001102778651002202789651002502811653001702836653001302853653002602866653001802892653002202910700001902932700002302951700001602974700001702990773011103007856008603118852000903204655001203213IND60781156820221119124702.0220623e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078115682DNAL7 a10.1080/08920753.2022.20781772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegal, Yael14aThe State of Beach Litter Pollution during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of the Israeli Coasts  ap. 372-384.  aThis research examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine litter pollution along the Israeli coast, which constitutes a terminal area in the Mediterranean Sea large-scale circulation. Surveys for litter were conducted on four beaches along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. Sampling was done pre-pandemic in June, September, and December of 2019; during the first year of the pandemic in March, June, September, and December of 2020; and during the second year of the pandemic in March 2021. The study revealed that during the first year of the pandemic, beach litter concentration was reduced by 47 ± 27% on all beaches. The decrease in beach litter continued during the second year on most beaches (34 ± 22% reduction) and was most observable for plastic products, which have a high potential to float and travel long distances. The decline in beach litter concentration in the Israeli beaches during the pandemic was statistically significant. The barcode analysis indicates the appearance of non-Israeli debris on the shores (22-81% pre-COVID-19 and 5-47% during-COVID-19), which supports the assumption that the reduction in marine litter pollution was affected by the decline in beach activity both locally and in other coastal neighboring countries. An additional effect of the pandemic was the appearance of single-use plastic masks and gloves in April 2020, influenced by the epidemic’s regulations and restrictions. Despite the decline in beach marine litter concentration during COVID-19, plastic pollution is a high concern in this heavily populated coastal region. Our data set provides an indication for the potential of local and regional regulations to reduce further beach litter pollution and a baseline for continuous monitoring of these processes.HighlightsThe impact of COVID-19 on beach litter pollution along Israel’s coast was studied Significant decline in beach litter concentration during the Covid-19 pandemic. Barcode analysis reveals debris is 22-57% from non-local sources.

Unfortunately, congestion in diffusion path during plating process damages the effects of current collectors. Herein, we developed a 3D Cu skeleton with open micrometer-sized pores by NaCl-assisted powder-sintering method. The unobstructed pores of 3D Cu skeleton help to reduce congestion during plating, thus most of Li deposited inside the current collector. Besides, the large smooth surface promotes the deposition of Li with smooth spherical shape, which mitigating Li dendrite growth. As a result, better safety and rechargeability of Li metal anode were achieved in this design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acollectors 3acopper 3alithium 0a3D Cu skeleton 0acurrent collector 0aLi metal anodes 0ahigh Coulombic efficiency 0aspherical Li 0apowder-sintering method1 aWang, Zhijie1 aLei, Danni1 aLv, Wei1 aZhao, Qiang1 aNi, Bin1 aLiu, Yong1 aLi, Baohua1 aKang, Feiyu1 aHe, Yan-Bing1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5787-54980 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 04, v. 10, no. 24 p.20244-20249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b048813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003600134024002500170024004000195024002300235040001800258100006200276245013200338300001200470520151500482592002801997650002402025650002402049650002802073650001302101650000902114650002502123650001602148650002702164650001302191650001502204650002602219650001202245650002402257650002102281650001702302650001602319700002302335773011102358856011402469856008302583961001302666852000902679655001202688IND60720791020221214225604.0210807e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072079102DNAL7 a3683932aris7 a10113/72079102hdl7 a10.1186/s12863-020-00942-32doi7 a4300812aris_accn_no7 a6036-22000-030-00D2aris_project_no7 a3683932seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHandler, Alfred M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2644-603814aThe hAT-family transposable element, hopper, from Bactrocera dorsalis is a functional vector for insect germline transformation  ap. 137.  aBACKGROUND: The hopper hAT-family transposable element isolated from the Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is distantly related to both the Drosophila hobo element and the Activator element from maize. The original 3120 bp hopperᴮᵈ⁻ᴷᵃʰ element isolated from the Kahuku wild-type strain was highly degenerate and appeared to have a mutated transposase and terminal sequences, while a second 3131 bp element, hopperᴮᵈ⁻ʷᵉ, isolated from a white eye mutant strain had an intact transposase reading frame and terminal sequences consistent with function. RESULTS: The hopperᴮᵈ⁻ʷᵉ element was tested for function by its ability to mediate germline transformation in two dipteran species other than B. dorsalis. This was achieved by creating a binary vector/helper transformation system by linking the hopperᴮᵈ⁻ʷᵉ transposase reading frame to a D. melanogaster hsp70 promoter for a heat-inducible transposase helper plasmid, and creating vectors marked with the D. melanogaster mini-white⁺ or polyubiquitin-regulated DsRed fluorescent protein markers. CONCLUSIONS: Both vectors were successfully used to transform D. melanogaster, and the DsRed vector was also used to transform the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa, indicating a wide range of hopper function in dipteran species and, potentially, non-dipteran species. This vector provides a new tool for insect genetic modification for both functional genomic analysis and the control of insect populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnastrepha suspensa 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aZea mays 3acorn 3afluorescent proteins 3afruit flies 3agenetic transformation 3agenomics 3agerm cells 3aheat-shock protein 70 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3apromoter regions 3atransposases 3atransposons1 aSchetelig, Marc F.0 tBMC genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no.

Conclusions from a case study. I: Energy production and carbon dioxide abatement  ap. 454-469.  aThis study examines the renewable energy production of crops used for phytoremediation. Our analysis is based on a case study in the Campine region (Belgium and The Netherlands), where agricultural soils are diffusely contaminated with cadmium, lead, and zinc, with an enhanced risk for uptake of these metals in crops and leaching to the groundwater. However, the area has such a large extent (700 km²) that conventional remediation is not applicable. Cultivation of crops for energy purposes on such land offers the opportunity to come up with an approach that efficiently uses contaminated agricultural land and that can be beneficial for both farmer and society. Performing a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), we examined the energy and CO₂ abatement potential of willow (Salix spp.), silage maize (Zea mays L.), and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) originating from contaminated land. Taking into account the marginal impact of the metals in the biomass on the energy conversion efficiency and on the potential use of the biomass and its rest products after conversion, digestion of silage maize with combustion of the contaminated digestate shows the best energetic and CO₂ abating perspectives. The replacement of cokes based electricity by willow is more efficient in CO₂ abatement than willow used in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit, despite lower net energy production in the former option. Willow reaches the same energy production and same CO₂ abatement per hectare per year as silage maize when its biomass yield is respectively 13 and 8.7 Mg dm ha⁻¹ y⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aSalix 3aZea mays 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3abioenergy 3acadmium 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acombustion 3acorn silage 3adigestion 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy crops 3afarmers 3agroundwater 3aheat 3aleaching 3alead 3alife cycle assessment 3aphytoremediation 3arisk 3asociety 3azinc 3aBelgium 3aNetherlands1 aMendelsohn, R.O.1 aVan Slycken, S.1 aWeyens, N.1 aSchreurs, E.1 aMeers, E.1 aTack, F.1 aCarleer, R.1 aVangronsveld, J.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Apr., v. 39 p.454-469dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005900188245008500247300001100332506007600343520194500419592002802364506003702392650001902429650001502448650002802463650002702491650002302518650001502541650001402556650001202570650001402582650001202596650001502608650002402623650001002647650002302657651001102680700003102691773012702722856008102849852000902930655001202939IND60586873820221207094643.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058687382DNAL7 a10.1186/s13006-017-0140-y2doi7 aPMC57213882pmcid7 a292344572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhasawneh, Wasim1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3291-019410aPredictors and barriers to breastfeeding in north of Jordan: could we do better?  ap. 49.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Despite the ongoing recommendations for breastfeeding, we continue to see a decrease in exclusive breastfeeding among Jordanian women during infant follow up visits at the pediatric outpatient clinic. The purpose of our study is to determine the prevalence, predictors and barriers to exclusive breastfeeding in north of Jordan. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving mothers with infants six to twelve months old, at two hospitals in Irbid city in north of Jordan, between December 2016 and March 2017. Questions included demographics, feeding pattern, and reasons for non-exclusive breastfeeding. RESULTS: Five hundred women were included. Twenty four percent of women were employed and 87% initiated breastfeeding within three hours of birth. The proportion of women with any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding at six months was 76 and 33%. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, predictors of exclusive breastfeeding at six months include the mother’s previous experience (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 7.9, 95% CI 4.69, 13.36) and multiparity (AOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.2, 4.28), while barriers include maternal employment (AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.22,0.72), Cesarean delivery (AOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35, 0.86) and infant’s hospitalization (AOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23,0.82). Inadequate breastmilk supply and short maternity leave were the main reported reasons for non-exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: In north of Jordan, the majority of women initiate breastfeeding, half practice exclusive breastfeeding after birth while one third continue for six months, particularly those with previous experience. Cesarean delivery and infant’s hospitalization, together with maternal employment are among the main barriers. Implementing educational programs and lactation consultant counselling together with work environment support, should be helpful to improve the breastfeeding practice among Jordanian women.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3acounseling 3across-sectional studies 3ademographic statistics 3aeducation programs 3aemployment 3ahospitals 3ainfants 3alactation 3amothers 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3awomen 3aworking conditions 3aJordan1 aKhasawneh, AyatAbdelrahman0 tInternational breastfeeding journal.g2017 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.49-49dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001833x1746-43587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-017-0140-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015000171300001600321520139100337592002801728650001501756650002501771650003501796650001401831650001901845650002201864650002401886653001701910653002501927653002701952653002401979653002802003700002402031773010802055856008502163852000902248655001202257IND60610311920221117082752.0190613e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061031192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadotte, Marc W.10aDifficult decisions: Strategies for conservation prioritization when taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity are not spatially congruent  ap. 128-133.  aPreventing further loss of biodiversity is the most important challenge for conservation biology. The loss of species and the functions and services they provide has negative implications for human well-being. However, conservation efforts focussed on sites with high numbers of species may inadvertently under-represent other facets of biodiversity such as phylogenetic and functional diversity. Further, because these different biodiversity facets vary in their degree of spatial congruence, methods of site selection that maximize phylogenetic, functional, and species diversity are necessary to represent biodiversity in a holistic fashion. In this paper we discuss approaches to such multi-faceted site-level prioritization. Specifically, we examine complementarity algorithms and provide strategies to weight species selection by their trait or phylogenetic distinctiveness. Further, we explore approaches that integrate diversity facets into a single measure of prioritization and incorporate complementarity such that the goal is not just optimizing the protection of biodiversity, but to prioritize the addition of sites representing unprotected biodiversity across different facets. We highlight the strengths and limitations of such an approach. These types of holistic approaches to reserve design should provide flexibility in the face of changing knowledge and priorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3afunctional diversity 3anatural resources conservation 3aphylogeny 3aprioritization 3aspecies diversity 3awildlife management 0aBiodiversity 0aFunctional diversity 0aPhylogenetic diversity 0aSite prioritization 0aConservation trade-offs1 aTucker, Caroline M.0 tBiological conservation.g2018 Sept., v. 225 p.128-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009200166300001400258520224500272592002802517650001502545650002402560650001702584650001702601650001502618650001802633650002002651650001002671650001202681650002002693650002102713650001302734650002002747650001802767650001902785650001802804650001202822650001502834650001002849651001602859653001202875653001602887653001802903653001202921653001502933700001902948700001502967700001602982700001602998773012303014856008303137852000903220655001203229IND60532397920221118014823.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnett, A.L.10aSoil C and N contents in a paired survey of dairy and dry stock pastures in New Zealand  ap. 34-40.  aA previous temporal sampling study of New Zealand soils under different grazing systems indicated that soils on flat land under dairy farming had lost significant amounts of C and N in the last few decades, while soils under drystock farming on flat land had not. This result suggested that dairy farms would have lower soil C stocks than adjacent drystock farms. To test this hypothesis, we sampled 25 adjacent dairy and drystock farms to 0.6m depth and analysed samples for C, N and soil dry bulk density by horizon. Paired sampling sites were on average 108m apart, on the same soil with similar slope, aspect and topography and had been in that farming system for at least 10 years prior. The average stocking rate for dairy farms (24 stock units ha−1) was higher (P<0.01) than drystock farms (14 stock units ha−1). The mean total C and total N stocks for the whole soil profile (0–0.6m) were 173tCha−1 and 15.7tNha−1 for the dairy farms and 183tCha−1 and 16.1tNha−1 for the drystock farms and these were not significantly different. However, when the soil horizons were considered separately, the A horizon of dairy farms had significantly lower C (8tCha−1, P<0.05) than drystock farms. The A horizon thickness under dairy farming was also shallower (P<0.05) with a greater soil dry bulk density (P<0.05) than the drystock farms indicating soil compaction, presumably due to higher stocking rates and heavier animals on dairy farms. Changes in soil dry bulk density and A horizon depth offset one another and the total mass of soil sampled from the A horizons was the same (0.14±0.01tm−2). Therefore, the significant difference in soil C of the A horizon was likely to be a consequence of land management rather than as a result of sampling different masses of soil. Lower soil C content of the A horizon in this paired site study is consistent with an earlier sampling using temporal comparisons. We do not know the causes for these differences in C, but they might be linked to the higher stocking rates of dairy systems, where large dairy cows exert greater physical pressure on the soil, consume more above ground biomass, and deposit more intense urine patches that have been linked to solubilisation of soil C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aaboveground biomass 3abulk density 3acarbon sinks 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3afarming systems 3afarms 3agrazing 3aland management 3anitrogen content 3apastures 3asoil compaction 3asoil profiles 3asolubilization 3astocking rate 3asurveys 3atopography 3aurine 3aNew Zealand 0aPasture 0aSoil carbon 0aSoil nitrogen 0aGrazing 0aManagement1 aSchipper, L.A.1 aTaylor, A.1 aBalks, M.R.1 aMudge, P.L.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.34-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005700188245010800245300001600353506007600369520172400445592002802169506003702197650001202234650002202246650002002268650004102288700002302329700002402352700002002376700002402396700002702420700002002447700002002467700002502487700002002512773014502532856008202677852000902759655001202768IND60627248220221207093908.0190514e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1526-42doi7 aPMC64699332pmcid7 a306121772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobus, Jon R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0740-660410aUsing prepared mixtures of ToxCast chemicals to evaluate non-targeted analysis (NTA) method performance  ap. 835-851.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNon-targeted analysis (NTA) methods are increasingly used to discover contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), but the extent to which these methods can support exposure and health studies remains to be determined.

We then performed an unblinded evaluation to identify limitations of our NTA method. Overall, at least 60% of spiked substances could be observed using selected methods. Discounting spiked isomers, true positive rates from the blinded and unblinded analyses reached a maximum of 46% and 65%, respectively. An overall reproducibility rate of 75% was observed for substances spiked into more than one mixture and observed at least once. Considerable discordance in substance identification was observed when comparing a subset of our results derived from two separate reversed-phase chromatography methods. We conclude that a single NTA method, even when optimized, can likely characterize only a subset of ToxCast substances (and, by extension, other CECs). Rigorous quality control and self-evaluation practices should be required of labs generating NTA data to support exposure and health studies. Accurate and transparent communication of performance results will best enable meaningful interpretations and defensible use of NTA data.

Aggregation phenomena are central to such bioprocesses affecting the viability, proliferation and differentiation trajectory of stem cells but a quantitative framework is currently lacking. A population balance equation (PBE) model was used to describe the temporal evolution of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) cluster size distribution by considering collision-induced aggregation and cell proliferation in a stirred-suspension vessel. For ESC cultures at different agitation rates, the aggregation kernel representing the aggregation dynamics was successfully recovered as a solution of the inverse problem. The rate of change of the average aggregate size was greater at the intermediate rate tested suggesting a trade-off between increased collisions and agitation-induced shear. Results from forward simulation with obtained aggregation kernels were in agreement with transient aggregate size data from experiments. We conclude that the framework presented here can complement mechanistic studies offering insights into relevant stem cell clustering processes. More importantly from a process development standpoint, this strategy can be employed in the design and control of bioreactors for the generation of stem cell derivatives for drug screening, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagitation 3abioreactors 3acell aggregates 3acell proliferation 3adrugs 3aembryonic stem cells 3aequations 3amanufacturing 3amedicine 3amodels 3ascreening 3aseeds 3atissue engineering 3aviability 0aStem cells 0aBioreactors 0aPopulation balance equation model 0aInverse problem 0aAggregation kernel 0aTissue engineering1 aWu, Jincheng1 aTzanakakis, Emmanuel S.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 208 p.70-79dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006200170300001500232520190300247592002802150650001802178650001702196650002102213650001002234650001302244650001602257650003502273650002002308650001502328650002202343651001202365653003002377653001102407653002002418653000902438653001802447653002302465700002402488700002302512700002102535700002302556700006702579700002202646700006202668773010702730856008502837852000902922655001202931IND60610312020221117083314.0190613e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061031202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEjrnæs, Rasmus10aUniquity: A general metric for biotic uniqueness of sites  ap. 98-105.  a1.Species richness is unrivalled as the most reported biodiversity metric in ecological and conservation research. Unfortunately, species richness ignores the scale-dependency of biodiversity.2.We propose the metric uniquity, a quantitative and spatially scalable measure of uniqueness of a site based on a species-by-site matrix and a site-by-habitat type classification with area weights for habitat types correcting for sampling biases.3.An example of uniquity is presented using vascular plant data from 130 sites representing a larger region (Denmark). We demonstrate the importance of the scale parameter of uniquity for the prediction of independent uniqueness indices calculated from species distribution data and the number of recorded red listed species.4.We compare the performance of uniquity with the performance of the indices Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) and Range Rarity Richness (RRR), and we investigate its sensitivity to small sample size and poorly resolved habitat classification.5.We assess the performance of the uniquity metric applied to DNA metabarcoding data for plants, fungi and eukaryotes from the same set of study sites.6.Uniquity is a strong predictor of site uniqueness based on national distribution data and also correlates neatly with the observed number of red listed species. Uniquity based on DNA metabarcoding corresponds well with the number of red listed species observed.7.Perspective: Uniquity is generally applicable to biotas sampled with comparable effort, including field inventories, trap sampling, and DNA metabarcoding data. To our knowledge uniquity is the first index of uniqueness that explicitly considers spatial scale and sampling biases, while simultaneously accepting non-annotated DNA-data as input. Based on our study we offer general recommendations for further use and testing of uniquity as conservation value metric.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3abiogeography 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3ahabitats 3ainventories 3anatural resources conservation 3aplants (botany) 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3aDenmark 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aRarity 0aVascular plants 0aeDNA 0aMetabarcoding 0aRed listed species1 aFrøslev, Tobias G.1 aHøye, Toke Thomas1 aKjøller, Rasmus1 aOddershede, Andrea1 aBrunbjerg, Ane Kirstine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0666-65351 aHansen, Anders J.1 aBruun, Hans Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0674-25770 tBiological conservation.g2018 Sept., v. 225 p.98-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245012200159300001600281500002000297520165300317592002801970596003201998650001702030650001802047650002002065650001202085650001502097650001002112650001202122650001302134650001502147651001302162700001902175700002502194700002002219700002002239773013302259856007602392852000902468655001202477IND60786391820221118210222.0220803e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078639182DNAL7 a10.3732/ajb.17000952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarran, Myall10aTwo fossil species of Metrosideros (Myrtaceae) from the Oligo‐Miocene Golden Fleece locality in Tasmania, Australia  ap. 891-904.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE OF THE STUDY: The capsular‐fruited genus Metrosideros (Myrtaceae) is one of the most widely distributed flowering plant genera in the Pacific but is extinct in Australia today. The center of geographic origin for the genus and the reason for and timing of its extinction in Australia remain uncertain. We identify fossil Metrosideros fruits from the newly discovered Golden Fleece fossil flora in the Oligo‐Miocene of Tasmania, Australia, shedding further light on these problems. METHODS: Standard paleopalynological techniques were used to date the fossil‐bearing sediments. Scanning electron microscopy and an auto‐montage camera system were used to take high‐resolution images of fossil and extant fruits taken from herbarium specimens. Fossils are identified using a nearest‐living‐relative approach. KEY RESULTS: The fossil‐bearing sediments are palynostratigraphically dated as being Proteacidites tuberculatus Zone Equivalent (ca. 33–16 Ma) in age and provide a confident Oligo‐Miocene age for the macrofossils. Two new fossil species of Metrosideros are described and are here named Metrosideros dawsonii sp. nov. and Metrosideros wrightii sp. nov. CONCLUSIONS: These newly described fossil species of Metrosideros provide a second record of the genus in the Cenozoic of Australia, placing them in the late Early Oligocene to late Early Miocene. It is now apparent not only that Metrosideros was present in Australia, where the genus is now extinct, but that at least several Metrosideros species were present during the Cenozoic. These fossils further strengthen the case for an Australian origin of the genus.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Research Council 3aMetrosideros 3aMiocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3acameras 3aextinction 3aflora 3afossils 3aherbaria 3aprovenance 3aTasmania1 aWilson, P.

A Comparative Study in Soybean, Sunflower, and Maize  ap. 748-754.  aepub  aSeed number, the main yield component of cereals and oil-seed species, strongly depends on the physiological status of the crop during a critical period for seed set. Using a comparative approach including three species with contrasting reproductive strategies, we investigated the relationship between seed number per plant (SNP) and plant growth rate during the critical period for seed set (PGRC). Indeterminate soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) crops were grown under a wide range of plant densities to generate contrasting availability of resources per plant. Growth of individual plants was estimated by a novel, nondestructive method based on relationships between actual shoot dry matter and morphometric variables, including stem diameter, plant height, and dimensions of reproductive structures. Seed number per plant ranged from 0 to 890 in soybean, 0 to 4096 in sunflower, and 0 to 1348 in maize and PGRC (g d⁻¹) from 0.01 to 4.3 in soybean, 0.3 to 17.6 in sunflower, and 0.4 to 12.3 in maize. Our study showed that (i) the relationship between SNP and PGRC was linear in soybean, reflecting the reproductive plasticity of this species, and curvilinear in sunflower and maize, reflecting morphogenetic restrictions to generate reproductive sinks under favorable growing conditions; (ii) the PGRC threshold below which no seed was set varied among species, being negligible in soybean, close to 0.35 g d⁻¹ in sunflower, and 1 g d⁻¹ in maize. Quantitative relationships between seed number and plant growth rate during the critical period of seed set could be useful for crop modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aHelianthus annuus 3aZea mays 3acomparative study 3acorn 3acrop models 3acrops 3amorphometry 3anondestructive methods 3aphysiological state 3aplant density 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aseed set 3asoybeans 3ayield components1 aAndrade, Fernando H.1 aSadras, Víctor O.1 aUhart, Sergio A.1 aValentinuz, Oscar R.0 tCrop science.g2001 May, v. 41, no. 3 p.748-754dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.413748x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008900168300001400257520215600271592002802427650001702455650001102472650001102483650001502494650001802509650001502527650001202542650001502554650001102569650001102580650001702591650000902608653002302617653002202640653001202662653001402674653001102688653001002699700005902709700002002768700001902788773012302807856008302930852000903013655001203022IND60532398120221118014837.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNolte, Stefanie10aHerbivore species and density affect vegetation-structure patchiness in salt marshes  ap. 41-47.  aThe importance of spatial patterns for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity has long been recognized in ecology. Grazing by herbivores is an important mechanism leading to spatial patterns in the vegetation structure. How different herbivore species and their densities affect vegetation-structure patchiness is, however, poorly understood, and very few studies have simultaneously incorporated the underlying abiotic patterns. We investigated how different herbivore species and densities affect vegetation-structure patchiness. We conducted an experiment in a semi-natural grassland using horses and cattle in two densities each (0.5LU/ha and 1.0LU/ha). Transects of 25m in length were positioned within the study salt marsh, and canopy and canopy height and soil elevation were measured every 25cm to explore patterns in canopy height. Geostatistical variogram models were fitted to all transects with the elevation as a covariable to correct for the underlying abiotic patterns. The range (as a measure for patch size of short or tall canopy) and sill (as a measure for heterogeneity) of the variogram model were compared between horses and cattle and between two densities. Canopy height was lower in horse-grazed compared to cattle-grazed treatments and lower in higher herbivore densities. Patch size (range) (tall and short canopy) was significantly larger in horse-grazed treatments, and a trend of larger patch size was found for higher densities with both herbivore species. While herbivore species had no clear effect on heterogeneity, a trend of a higher heterogeneity (sill) was found in low densities. We found that the two herbivore species and densities have differential effects on canopy height, patch size and heterogeneity. Although some of these results were only found as trends, our study has important implications for conservation management of grazed salt marshes. To form heterogeneous small-scaled vegetation patterns we would generally recommend applying grazing with (1) cattle rather than horses, and (2) at low rather than high densities. We further discuss the relevance of our findings for other grazed ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acanopy 3acattle 3aecosystems 3ageostatistics 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3ahorses 3amodels 3asalt marshes 3asoil 0aCoastal salt marsh 0aNature management 0aGrazing 0aGrassland 0aCattle 0aHorse1 aEsselink, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1242-56341 aSmit, Christian1 aBakker, Jan P.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.41-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009300166300001600259520131600275592002801591650001301619650000801632650001801640650001601658650001301674650002601687650002001713650002401733651001001757653001501767653002301782653002901805653003501834700005101869700001701920700001801937700001801955700001401973773010401987856008702091852000902178655001202187IND60608121420221119112338.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060812142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Feng10aVertical structure of foggy haze over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area in January 2013  ap. 192-204.  aIn January 2013, frequent episodes of intense air pollution occurred in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area (BTH), China. Besides the occurrence of region-wide dry haze pollution, foggy haze conditions also developed across the region on numerous days, lasting into the afternoon. Synergistic analysis, using multisatellite datasets, air sounding and surface meteorological observations, indicated that there was a vertical overlap of fog and aerosol layers during the foggy haze episodes in the region. Fog appeared at a low level of the atmosphere. The altitude of the upper boundary of the fog differed across the region, but it was always below 1 km. The aerosol layer that closely contacted with the top of the underlying fog was rather dense, having a high concentration comparable to that during severe pollution on the ground. Above the dense aerosol layer, aerosol with a concentration equivalent to that of moderate pollution stretched up to an altitude of 2 km. Beyond that, a tenuous aerosol layer extended 5 km into the atmosphere. This overlapping of fog and haze layers frequently occurred across the region in January 2013. The occurrence of a foggy haze over BTH could worsen the regional air quality, and its appearance across this region would have notable effects on the radiation balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adata collection 3ameteorological data 3aChina 0aFoggy haze 0aVertical structure 0aAerosol above smoggy fog 0aBeijing–Tianjin–Hebei area1 aXu, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7458-96881 aHe, Youjiang1 aDang, Hongyan1 aYang, Xuezhen1 aMeng, Fan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Aug., v. 139 p.192-204dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245019700165300001600362520087500378592002801253650001901281650003101300650002001331650001601351650002201367650001501389650001901404650002001423650003601443653001101479653002001490653001001510653001101520653001201531653002301543700001801566700001701584700001901601700001601620700001901636700001801655700002101673700001801694773014601712856008201858852000901940655001201949IND60628045920221116195109.0190129e20180602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jia-Hui10aVisceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor accelerates cholesterol efflux by up-regulating ABCA1 expression via the NF-κB/miR-33a pathway in THP-1 macropahge-derived foam cells  ap. 318-324.  aAtherosclerosis is a dyslipidemia disease characterized by foam cell formation driven by the accumulation of lipids. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (vaspin) is known to suppress the development of atherosclerosis via its anti-inflammatory properties, but it is not yet known whether vaspin affects cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. Here, we investigated the effects of vaspin on ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux, and further explored the underlying mechanism. We found that vaspin decreased miR-33a levels, which in turn increased ABCA1 expression and cholesteorl efflux. We also found that inhibition of NF-κB reduced miR-33a expression and vaspin suppressed LPS-mediated NF-κB phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that vaspin is not only a regular of inflammasion but also a promoter of cholesterol efflux.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afoam cells 3ahyperlipidemia 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aVaspin 0aAtherosclerosis 0aABCA1 0aNF-κB 0amiR-33a 0aCholesterol efflux1 aZeng, Meng-Ya1 aYu, Xiao-Hua1 aZeng, Gao-Feng1 aHe, Lin-Hao1 aZheng, Xi-Long1 aZhang, Da-Wei1 aOuyang, Xin-Ping1 aTang, Chao-Ke0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 02, v. 500, no. 2 p.318-324dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014300167300001600310520171900326592002802045650001302073650002602086650002102112650001502133650000902148650001102157650002602168650001702194650001202211650002502223651001002248653001002258653002102268653002502289653002002314653000802334700001902342700001402361700001802375700002002393700001302413700001902426700002102445700001402466700001202480700006102492700002002553773010402573856008702677852000902764655001202773IND60608121520221119112338.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060812152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Xing10aCharacteristics and sensitivity analysis of multiple-time-resolved source patterns of PM2.5 with real time data using Multilinear Engine 2  ap. 113-121.  aWith real time resolved data of Particulate matter (PM) and chemical species, understanding the source patterns and chemical characteristics is critical to establish controlling of PM. In this work, PM2.5 and chemical species were measured by corresponding online instruments with 1-h time resolution in Beijing. Multilinear Engine 2 (ME2) model was applied to explore the sources, and four sources (vehicle emission, crustal dust, secondary formation and coal combustion) were identified. To investigate the sensitivity of time resolution on the source contributions and chemical characteristics, ME2 was conducted with four time resolution runs (1-h, 2-h, 4-h, and 8-h). Crustal dust and coal combustion display large variation in the four time resolutions runs, with their contributions ranging from 6.7 to 10.4 μg m⁻³ and from 6.4 to 12.2 μg m⁻³, respectively. The contributions of vehicle emission and secondary formation range from 7.5 to 10.5 and from 14.7 to 16.7 μg m⁻³, respectively. The sensitivity analyses were conducted by principal component analysis-plot (PCA-plot), coefficient of divergence (CD), average absolute error (AAE) and correlation coefficients. For the four time resolution runs, the source contributions and profiles of crustal dust and coal combustion were more unstable than other source categories, possibly due to the lack of key markers of crustal dust and coal combustion (e.g. Si, Al). On the other hand, vehicle emission and crustal dust were more sensitive to time series of source contributions at different time resolutions. Findings in this study can improve our knowledge of source contributions and chemical characteristics at different time solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aatmospheric chemistry 3achemical species 3acombustion 3adust 3amodels 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3asilicon 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aTime resolutions 0aSource apportionment 0aSource patterns 0aME21 aShi, Guo-Liang1 aGao, Jian1 aLiu, Jia-Yuan1 aHuangFu, Yan-Qi1 aMa, Tong1 aWang, Hai-Ting1 aZhang, Yue-Chong1 aWang, Han1 aLi, Hui1 aIvey, Cesunica E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4740-26271 aFeng, Yin-Chang0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Aug., v. 139 p.113-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166500001900305520150100324592002801825650001801853650002101871650001301892650003001905650001101935650001701946650002201963650001601985650001302001650001502014650002502029650002302054653003302077653001202110653002202122653002302144653002202167700001402189700001702203700001702220700001902237700001202256700001602268773010802284856008502392852000902477655001202486IND60694035720221121045556.0200614e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069403572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1147412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dang,10aLinking aerosol characteristics of size distributions, core potential pathogens and toxic metal(loid)s to wastewater treatment process  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play important roles in water purification but are also important source of aerosols. However, the relationship between aerosol characteristics and wastewater treatment process remains poorly understood. In this study, aerosols were collected over a 24-month period from a WWTP using a modified anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process. The aerated tank (AerT) was characterized by the highest respiratory fraction (RF) concentrations (861–1525 CFU/m³) and proportions (50.76%–65.96%) of aerosol particles. Fourteen core potential pathogens and 15 toxic metal(loid)s were identified in aerosols. Mycobacterium was the genus that aerosolized most easily in fine grid, pre-anoxic tank, and AerT. High wastewater treatment efficiency may increase the emission of RF and core potential pathogens. The median size of activated sludge, richness of core potential pathogens in wastewater, and total suspended particulates were the most influential factors directly related to the RF proportions, core community of potential pathogens, and composition of toxic metal(loid)s in WWTP aerosols, respectively. Relative humidity, temperature, input and removal of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and mixed liquor suspended solids could also directly or indirectly affect the aerosol characteristics. This study enhances the mechanistic understanding of linking aerosol characteristics to treatment processes and has important implications for targeted manipulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium 3aactivated sludge 3aaerosols 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aoxygen 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater purification 0aWastewater treatment process 0aAerosol 0aSize distribution 0aPotential pathogen 0aToxic metal(loid)1 aJiang, Lu1 aHan, Yunping1 aLiu, Jianwei1 aWang, Xiaodong1 aYan, Xu1 aLiu, Junxin0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Sept., v. 264 p.114741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1147413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03953naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245013700212300001100349520227600360592002802636650001802664650001702682650001402699650001902713650001002732650003402742650001302776650000902789650002702798650001802825650000902843650001302852650001302865650001402878650001402892650002802906650001502934700001902949700002402968700001902992700002003011700002103031700002103052700002303073700002103096700002103117700002603138700002103164773012203185856008303307852000903390655001203399IND60701237020221122005819.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070123702DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-020-00556-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerg, Irene van den,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9292-863610aMeta-analysis for milk fat and protein percentage using imputed sequence variant genotypes in 94,321 cattle from eight cattle breeds  ap. 37.  aBACKGROUND: Sequence-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide high statistical power to identify candidate causal mutations when a large number of individuals with both sequence variant genotypes and phenotypes is available. A meta-analysis combines summary statistics from multiple GWAS and increases the power to detect trait-associated variants without requiring access to data at the individual level of the GWAS mapping cohorts. Because linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers is conserved only over short distances across breeds, a multi-breed meta-analysis can improve mapping precision. RESULTS: To maximise the power to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL), we combined the results of nine within-population GWAS that used imputed sequence variant genotypes of 94,321 cattle from eight breeds, to perform a large-scale meta-analysis for fat and protein percentage in cattle. The meta-analysis detected (p ≤ 10⁻⁸) 138 QTL for fat percentage and 176 QTL for protein percentage. This was more than the number of QTL detected in all within-population GWAS together (124 QTL for fat percentage and 104 QTL for protein percentage). Among all the lead variants, 100 QTL for fat percentage and 114 QTL for protein percentage had the same direction of effect in all within-population GWAS. This indicates either persistence of the linkage phase between the causal variant and the lead variant across breeds or that some of the lead variants might indeed be causal or tightly linked with causal variants. The percentage of intergenic variants was substantially lower for significant variants than for non-significant variants, and significant variants had mostly moderate to high minor allele frequencies. Significant variants were also clustered in genes that are known to be relevant for fat and protein percentages in milk. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a large number of QTL associated with fat and protein percentage in dairy cattle. We demonstrated that large-scale multi-breed meta-analysis reveals more QTL at the nucleotide resolution than within-population GWAS. Significant variants were more often located in genic regions than non-significant variants and a large part of them was located in potentially regulatory regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle breeds 3adairy cattle 3aevolution 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype 3alead 3alinkage disequilibrium 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aprecision 3aquantitative trait loci 3astatistics1 aXiang, Ruidong1 aJenko, J.q(Janez),1 aPausch, Hubert1 aBoussaha, Mekki1 aSchrooten, Chris1 aTribout, Thierry1 aGjuvsland, Arne B.1 aBoichard, Didier1 aNordbø, Øyvind1 aSanchez, Marie-Pierre1 aGoddard, Mike E.0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2020 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.37-37dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-020-00556-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008500158300001800243500002000261520145100281592002801732650001401760650001101774650002101785650002301806650001101829650001401840650002201854650001301876650001801889651001101907700001801918700001901936700002001955773013001975856007202105852000902177655001202186IND60653052420221120090441.0190713e20140814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065305242DNAL7 a10.3390/w60824492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chen-Jia14aThe Impact of Building Coverage in the Metropolitan Area on the Flow Calculation  ap. 2449-2466.  aJournal Article  aDue to the special hydrographic and physiographic conditions in Taiwan, flooding is likely to occur in the middle and lower reaches of a plain whenever serious rainstorm events occurred. Note worthily, the loss of lives and property caused by flooding are always most considerable in a metropolitan area, and the densely distributed buildings would, not only increase the impervious area, but also decrease the water storage area. Furthermore, a large number of intensive buildings have changed the original land flow conditions, resulting in a beam shrinking flow and the additional form drag phenomenon, which makes the flooding phenomenon more serious. The main purpose of this research is to find the correlation between building coverage and the Manning’s coefficient n through a water flume model experiment. To probe into this issue, the Manning’s roughness adjustment is further divided into a part caused by the surface impedance and a part caused by the building impedance. Thus, building coverage can be added to the general computing grid to reflect the flooding situation with buildings. The two-dimensional inundation model, based on this research, was applied to Taichung City for an actual case simulation. The simulation result of Typhoon Kalmaegi showed that the presented model can obtain a more accurate flooding situation in urban area by considering the blockage effects of buildings and adjusting the surface roughness.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3afloods 3ahydraulic flumes 3ametropolitan areas 3amodels 3aroughness 3asurface roughness 3atyphoons 3awater storage 3aTaiwan1 aHsu, Ming-Hsi1 aDeng, Weixian,1 aWang, Yanxiang,0 tWater.g2014 Aug. 14, v. 6, no. 8 p.2449-2466dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w60824493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008600171300001600257520160500273592002801878650002201906650001001928650002501938650001501963650001301978650001501991650001502006650001702021650002202038650001502060650002202075651001102097653003202108653001102140653003302151653001502184653002302199653002502222700001902247700002102266700002402287700002002311773012502331856008302456852000902539655001202548IND60532398420221118014708.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiron, François,10aPesticide doses, landscape structure and their relative effects on farmland birds  ap. 153-160.  aAgricultural changes related to the intensification of farming practices and the simplification of landscape elements often occur simultaneously. Their respective effects on biodiversity are thus difficult to disentangle and are poorly understood. This study assessed the relative contribution of each component of agricultural intensification on taxonomic and functional bird communities.The bird communities studied were composed of 70 species, both farmland and non-farmland birds, found in 66 fields covering three main cereal departments of France. Herbicide dose was related to measurable negative effects on the Community Specialization Index (CSI). Overall, the proportion of habitat specialists, particularly of herbivorous species, decreased, and the proportion of generalists increased as pesticide doses increased. Pesticides also had a positive effect on total abundance and richness, whereas no influence of insecticide or fungicide doses could be detected. Landscape simplification was associated with a loss of bird species diversity and an increase in the CSI.Our findings suggest that the intensification of agriculture in this area, as reflected by increasing pesticide doses, modified communities by homogenizing species assemblages, whereas landscape element simplification led to the selection of only a few typical farmland birds enabled to persist in a simplified arable landscape. These results highlight the importance of combining taxonomic with functional diversity indices to fully understand changes in communities that occur in response to agricultural intensification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abirds 3afunctional diversity 3afungicides 3ahabitats 3aherbicides 3aherbivores 3ainsecticides 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3aFrance 0aAgriculture intensification 0aFrance 0aStandardized treatment index 0aPesticides 0aIntegrated farming 0aFunctional responses1 aChargé, Rémi1 aJulliard, Romain1 aJiguet, Frédéric,1 aMuratet, Audrey0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.153-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008400173500001900257520197300276592002802249650002302277650005202300650001802352650001602370650002102386650002102407650001702428650000902445650002802454650001202482651001002494651001002504700002202514773010802536856008502644852000902729655001202738IND60694035920221121055147.0200614e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069403592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1147322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFattorini, Daniele10aRole of the chronic air pollution levels in the Covid-19 outbreak risk in Italy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAfter the initial outbreak in China, the diffusion in Italy of SARS-CoV-2 is exhibiting a clear regional trend with more elevated frequency and severity of cases in Northern areas. Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO₂, O₃, PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010–2019) in which the limits have been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a viral outbreak could be of limited utility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3achronic exposure 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3arisk 3asustainable development 3aviruses 3aChina 3aItaly1 aRegoli, Francesco0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 Sept., v. 264 p.114732-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1147323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245007400199300001600273500001100289520220800300592002802508596001102536596003802547650002302585650001002608650001302618650000902631650001102640650001302651650001702664650002102681650001302702650001202715650001302727700005802740700001902798700001802817700005702835700006202892700005602954700007003010773012603080856007903206852000903285655001203294IND60631674020221122031714.0190312e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063167402DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.133062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoren, Lee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7425-501X10aTowards the validation of endogenous steroid testing in wildlife hair  ap. 547-561.  aREVIEW  aHair analysis is emerging as a popular tool to examine stress and reproduction hormone levels in wild mammals. The reliability of this approach, however, depends on an understanding of steroid hormone incorporation into hair as well as appropriate validations. We reviewed studies that have examined steroid hormones in wildlife hair with the goal of summarizing the analytical, physiological, and biological evidence that this approach is meaningful. Accordingly, we differentiated among validations aimed at evaluating the reliability of the analytical method versus those designed to assess whether hormone levels in hair reflect physiologically meaningful processes in the target species. Our literature survey revealed that endogenous steroids have been examined in hair from 40 species of nonhuman animals across seven mammalian classes. Although the majority (85%) of 72 studies reported analytical validations of the method, physiological validations have only been reported for five species. Moreover, results of physiological validations were inconsistent among studies. This highlights the need for further research, carefully designed to differentiate between the multiple purported models of steroid incorporation into hair in species with different types of hair and different hair growth patterns. To complement our review of published studies, we present new data supporting a positive relationship between levels of the steroid, cortisol, in hair and blood across eight mammalian species. In addition, we present novel results from a laboratory‐based study showing variable hair growth in genetically identical laboratory mice that were kept under controlled conditions. Synthesis and applications. Collectively, this Review reveals substantial progress towards the validation of stress hormone assays in hair from a variety of wildlife species. Further validations of reproductive steroids, combined with appropriate physiological validations, would expand the potential applications of hair analyses in wildlife research. As a key example, physiological data can provide mechanistic insights into species’ responses to change and may therefore contribute to conservation planning.  aPublisher supplied data  cMitacs  cRaincoast Conservation Foundation 3aanalytical methods 3ablood 3acortisol 3amice 3amodels 3aplanning 3areproduction 3asteroid hormones 3asteroids 3asurveys 3awildlife1 aBryan, Heather1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5120-95151 aMatas, Devorah1 aTinman, Simon1 aFahlman, Åsa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9092-55141 aWhiteside, Douglas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4447-94181 aSmits, Judit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5341-40881 aWynne‐Edwards, Katherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2944-45160 tJournal of applied ecology.g2019 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.547-561dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.133063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009600174300001600270520159600286592002801882650000801910650001601918650002001934650001301954650002401967650002201991650000902013650002402022650001102046650001902057650000902076650001502085650001602100653001602116653001702132653002202149653001202171653001002183653002502193700002102218700002002239773010402259856008702363852000902450655001202459IND60552625120221119133806.0161021e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055262512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Emilie M.14aThe effect of common imaging and hot water maceration on DNA recovery from skeletal remains  ap. 189-195.  aIdentifying human remains often begins with cleaning and imaging the material. Hot water maceration is used to remove adherent soft tissue from bone and radiographs are taken to better visualize osseous details. Heat and radiation are known to have harmful effects on DNA, but their ability to degrade DNA when used for cleaning and imaging has not been well studied. To better understand their individual and combined effects on the recoverability of DNA from bone, skeletal samples were subjected to (1) hot water maceration (62°C for 45min); (2) CT scanning (0.6mm slices, 120kV, 10.4s); (3) X-ray (50kVp, 150mA, 0.03s, 40in); and (4) all 3 treatments combined. Forty-eight DNA samples were extracted, quantified and amplified with the AmpFLSTR® Identifiler® system.Nearly all of the processed samples had reduced RFU values relative to the unprocessed samples, indicating some amount of genetic loss. This loss did not always translate into loss of profile completeness, since only a few samples had a reduction in the number of loci detected after processing. DNA yields were not significantly reduced by any one of the processing methods, however the results indicate that the damaging effects are additive. It is possible that processing may reduce a bone's DNA reservoir and as more procedures are preformed, the pool of available genetic information might be diminished. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors can affect the recoverability of DNA from bone. Collecting a DNA sample prior to processing avoids the negative effects from hot water maceration and radiological imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aX-radiation 3aadverse effects 3acleaning 3acomputed tomography 3aforensic sciences 3aheat 3ahot water treatment 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aloci 3amaceration 3aradiography 0aDNA quality 0aDNA quantity 0aSkeletal elements 0aCT scan 0aX-ray 0aHot water maceration1 aMundorff, Amy Z.1 aDavoren, Jon M.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Dec., v. 257 p.189-195dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168300001400254520177600268592002802044650001502072650001302087650002502100650002502125650001002150650001302160650001002173650003502183650002402218650001102242650001602253650001302269651001402282653002402296653003402320653001602354653002202370653001702392653002102409700001302430700001802443700001302461700002002474773012002494856008502614852000902699655001202708IND60610312620221117082855.0190613e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061031262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandis, K.J.10aDecline in colonial waterbird breeding highlights loss of Ramsar wetland function  ap. 22-30.  aWater resource development on rivers significantly affects life cycles of species reliant on wetlands. However, assessing ecological impacts is often difficult because they are realised over long-time periods and large spatial scales, particularly on highly variable dryland rivers. Thirty percent of all Ramsar wetlands are in drylands. We examined the effects of diversions of water upstream on colonial waterbird breeding at the Narran Lakes, supplied by a highly variable dryland river. Narran Lakes is an important Ramsar-listed wetland in Australia for its provision of habitat for wetland fauna during key life history stages, including colonially breeding waterbirds. We use historical ibis breeding data over five decades (1970–2016) to determine the flow requirements for colonial waterbird breeding and modelled the impacts of water resource management options (current and restoration) on breeding. We identified thresholds (>154,000 ML in 90 days with a secondary threshold of >20,000 ML in the first 10 days) of river flow volume necessary to stimulate breeding. Water resource development reduced the frequency of large flows resulting in ibis breeding by 170%, from 1 in 4.2 years to 1 in 11.4 years. Restoration efforts by government to recover water for the environment was predicted to improve colonial waterbird breeding frequency associated with large flow events to 1 in 6.71 years, representing a 59% reduction from pre-development periods. Our framework has global application as a method for identifying long-term impacts of water resource development on key Ramsar wetland areas. This is important, as few mechanisms exist for assessing impacts and identifying restoration options on the listed criteria for many Ramsar wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abreeding 3adevelopmental stages 3aenvironmental impact 3afauna 3ahabitats 3alakes 3anatural resources conservation 3aresource management 3arivers 3awater birds 3awetlands 3aAustralia 0aBreeding thresholds 0aEnvironmental flow management 0aFlow models 0aStraw-necked ibis 0aNarran Lakes 0aRiver regulation1 aBino, G.1 aSpencer, J.A.1 aRamp, D.1 aKingsford, R.T.0 tBiological conservation.g2018 Sept., v. 225 p.22-30dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04034naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011600166300001600282520204800298592002802346650003002374650001802404650001602422650002302438650001002461650003402471650002802505650001202533650001502545650001002560650002402570650002102594650001702615650001502632650002202647650001802669650002402687650001702711650001902728650002502747651001002772653000802782653000802790653000802798653000802806653000802814653001002822653000702832653000802839653000802847653002602855653002302881653002702904653002302931653001902954700001602973700001602989700001703005700001403022700001603036700001603052700001703068700001703085773010403102856008503206852000903291655001203300IND60593301120221119041537.0190131e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059330112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing14aThe burden of ischemic heart disease related to ambient air pollution exposure in a coastal city in South China  ap. 255-261.  aAir pollution is considered one of the most important risk factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD), which is a major public health concern. The disease burden of IHD has continued to rise in China in the past two decades. However, epidemiological studies examining the associations between air pollution and IHD have been scarce in China, and the only studies were conducted in severe air pollution areas, where air pollution levels seriously exceed the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines. Whether the influence of air pollution on IHD in areas with relatively low levels of air pollution differs from the influence of high pollution levels in heavily studied areas was unknown until now. Furthermore, the estimation of the disease burden of IHD related to air pollution has been very limited.We conducted a time-series study to estimate the short-term burden of ambient air pollution on IHD using the indicator of years of life lost (YLL), based on 10 322 IHD deaths from 2011 to 2015 in Ningbo, a coastal city in South China.The mean concentrations of fine particle (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were 49.58 μg/m3, 21.34 μg/m3 and 43.41 μg/m3, respectively. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 was associated with changes in YLL of 0.71 (95%CI: − 0.21,1.64), 3.31 (95%CI: 0.78, 5.84), and 2.27 (95%CI: 0.26, 4.28) years, respectively. Relatively stronger impacts were found for gaseous pollutants than PM2.5. A larger increase in YLL was found in the younger population than in the older population for NO2 exposure. In addition, estimations of the effects of SO2 and NO2 on YLL were higher for males than females. SO2 exposure was positively associated with YLL in widowed group.The findings highlighted the importance of stringent air pollution control, especially for gaseous pollutants. Furthermore, using the indicator of YLL, considering the occurrence of death at different ages, provided more information for resource allocation and protection of vulnerable populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aat-risk population 3adeath 3adisability-adjusted life year 3aepidemiological studies 3afemales 3aguidelines 3amales 3amyocardial ischemia 3anitrogen dioxide 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apublic health 3aresource allocation 3arisk factors 3asulfur dioxide 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aACF 0aAIC 0aGAM 0aIHD 0aNO2 0aPM2.5 0aRH 0aSO2 0aYLL 0aAmbient air pollution 0aGaseous pollutants 0aIschemic heart disease 0aYears of life lost 0aDisease burden1 aLi, Guoxing1 aQian, Xujun1 aXu, Guozhang1 aZhao, Yan1 aHuang, Jian1 aLiu, Qichen1 aHe, Tianfeng1 aGuo, Xinbiao0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 July, v. 164 p.255-261dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03780naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006800145245012000213300001600333500002000349520223700369592002802606596005002634596010302684596009302787650001002880650001102890650002002901650002302921650001502944650002102959650002302980650002203003650002203025651001003047700002603057700002903083700003203112773012603144856007903270852000903349655001203358IND60631674220221122031531.0190312e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063167422DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.133402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz‐Alonso, Verónica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0642-036X10aLong‐term recovery of multifunctionality in Mediterranean forests depends on restoration strategy and forest type  ap. 745-757.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForest area is increasing in temperate biomes through active and passive restoration of old fields. Despite the large extension of restored forests, the success of contrasting restoration strategies (active – planted forests ‐ vs. passive – secondary forests ‐) over time has never been evaluated in Mediterranean forests. We studied how restoration strategy determined forest restoration success. We evaluated which restoration strategy resulted in forests more like references (i.e. forests with continuous canopy cover since at least the 1940s) in terms of structure, diversity, functional composition, and dynamics. We then assessed whether active restoration accelerated forest recovery compared to passive restoration. We studied a chronosequence of recovery in four forest types (mountain and Mediterranean pine forests and mesic and Mediterranean oak forests) using the data of the Spanish Forest Inventory in central Spain. Each plot was classified as planted, secondary or reference forest. We modelled the response ratios of 11 forest attributes and a multifunctionality index as a function of restoration strategy, forest age, and abiotic and biotic constraints. Secondary forests showed a greater likeness to references than planted forests in oak forests while minor differences between secondary and planted forests were found in pine forests. The recovery speed of most forest attributes in secondary and planted forests was similar. Multifunctionality was higher, and increased more rapidly, in planted than in secondary forests in Mediterranean oak forests. However, multifunctionality was similar for both restoration strategies in the other forest types. Synthesis and applications. The long‐term assessment of forest recovery in Mediterranean abandoned fields indicated that both planted forests and natural forest succession are successful restoration strategies, depending on the aim and the forest type. In our research, restoration strategy did not influence the magnitude and speed of forest recovery in pine forests. However, in oak forests, natural forest succession led to forests more alike to references, but planted forests can maximize and accelerate recovery of forest multifunctionality.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundación Tatiana Pérez de Guzmán el Bueno  aREMEDINAL‐3/S2013/MAE‐2719cConsejería de Educación, Juventud y Deporte, Comunidad de Madrid  a2016‐T2/AMB‐1665cConsejería de Educación, Juventud y Deporte, Comunidad de Madrid 3aPinus 3acanopy 3achronosequences 3aconiferous forests 3aecosystems 3aforest inventory 3aforest restoration 3aforest succession 3asecondary forests 3aSpain1 aRuiz‐Benito, Paloma1 aVillar‐Salvador, Pedro1 aRey‐Benayas, José María0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2019 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.745-757dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.133403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03993naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006300170300001400233500001500247520193300262592002802195650001402223650001602237650001702253650001402270650001302284650001002297650001002307650002102317650002502338650000902363650003102372650002402403650001702427650001402444650002602458650001102484650002602495650002402521650001202545650002202557650001802579650001002597650003702607650002502644650001502669650001402684650002602698650002202724650002202746650002202768650001302790653001802803653002302821653001602844653002002860653002002880653001702900653002402917700002202941700001802963700002102981700001703002773012303019856008303142961001303225852000903238655001203247IND60532398820221118014746.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgan, J.

These plant and arthropod communities may be at significant ecotoxicological risk from herbicides applied to nearby crop fields. Recent innovations in herbicide-resistant crop biotechnology may lead to major increases in the use of the herbicides dicamba and 2,4-D. These herbicides selectively affect broadleaf plants, and non-target exposures may therefore lead to a net reduction in the functional diversity and floral resources provided by semi-natural habitats. In multi-year experiments at two sites (a field edge and an old field), we exposed replicated plots to low doses of dicamba designed to simulate herbicide drift and monitored changes in plant and arthropod communities. At the field edge site, we observed a significant decline in forb cover (but not floral resources) in plots treated at doses (∼1% of the field application rate) that are substantially lower than those that have been documented to affect plant communities in previous research. We also observed declines in three herbivorous pest species (pea aphids, spotted alfalfa aphid, and potato leaf hopper), increases in one pest species (clover root curculio), and increases in beneficial seed predators (crickets) associated with dicamba exposure. In contrast, at the old field site, drift-level doses did not affect plant community structure but reduced flowering of a key species (Monarda fistulosa). Variability across sites and taxonomic groups makes it difficult to offer general conclusions about the risks of dicamba drift to plant and arthropod biodiversity. Factors including the successional age of the plant community and water stress at the time of herbicide exposure likely explain the differing responses at the two sites to simulated drift.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflowering 3apollinators 3aedge effects 3apredators 3apotatoes 3a2,4-D 3aforbs 3aapplication rate 3afunctional diversity 3arisk 3aagricultural biotechnology 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3awater stress 3aGryllidae 3abeneficial arthropods 3aleaves 3aarthropod communities 3acommunity structure 3adicamba 3aagricultural land 3aecotoxicology 3apests 3aTherioaphis trifolii f. maculata 3aherbicide resistance 3agranivores 3aplant age 3apesticide application 3aplant communities 3aMonarda fistulosa 3aSitona hispidulus 3ahabitats 0aBiotechnology 0aBiological control 0aPollination 0aHerbicide drift 0aPlant diversity 0abiodiversity 0aArthropod diversity1 aBohnenblust, Eric1 aGoslee, Sarah1 aMortensen, David1 aTooker, John0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.77-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245013800166300002000304520133500324592002801659650001701687650002601704650002801730650002101758650001501779650002201794650001501816650001101831650001701842650001601859650001301875653001501888653003101903653001101934653002101945653000901966653001001975700001701985700001802002700001702020700005402037773014202091856007802233852000902311655001202320IND60598292620221122050420.0180629e20180604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059829262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b049682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheong, Jun Young10aFeasible Defect Engineering by Employing Metal Organic Framework Templates into One-Dimensional Metal Oxides for Battery Applications  ap. 20540-20549.  aFacile synthesis of rationally designed nanostructured electrode materials with high reversible capacity is highly critical to meet ever-increasing demands for lithium-ion batteries. In this work, we employed defect engineering by incorporating metal organic framework (MOF) templates into one-dimensional nanostructures by simple electrospinning and subsequent calcination. The introduction of Co-based zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIF-67) resulted in abundant oxygen vacancies, which induce not only more active sites for Li storage but also enhanced electrical conductivity. Moreover, abundant mesoporous sites are formed by the decomposition of ZIF-67, which are present both inside and outside the resultant SnO₂–Co₃O₄ nanofibers (NFs). Attributed to the creation of vacancy sites along with the synergistic effects of SnO₂ and Co₃O₄, SnO₂–Co₃O₄ NFs exhibit an excellent reversible capacity for 300 cycles (1287 mA h g–¹ at a current density of 500 mA g–¹) along with superior rate capabilities and improved initial Coulombic efficiency compared with pristine SnO₂ NFs. This is an early report on utilizing MOF structures as the defect formation platform into one-dimensional nanostructures, which is expected to result in superior electrochemical performances required for advanced electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3alithium batteries 3ananofibers 3aoxygen 3aporous media 3atin dioxide 3azeolites 0ananofibers 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aanodes 0aLi ion batteries 0aSnO2 0aCo3O41 aKoo, Won-Tae1 aKim, Chanhoon1 aJung, Ji-Won1 aKim, Il-Doo1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9970-22180 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 04, v. 10, no. 24 p.20540-20549dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b049683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009900165300001600264520190800280592002802188650002502216650001402241650001902255650001602274650001602290650002102306650000902327650002102336650003702357650002302394650001302417650001402430650001902444653001402463653001802477653001502495653001502510653001402525653001302539653000702552653000902559653001802568653002102586700001802607773014602625856008202771852000902853655001202862IND60628046520221121121352.0190129e20180602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062804652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBae, Jin-Sil10aCytoprotective role of ubiquitin against toxicity induced by polyglutamine-expanded aggregates  ap. 344-350.  aUbiquitin (Ub) homeostasis is important for cellular function and survival, especially under stress conditions. Recently, we have demonstrated that Ubc−/− (Ub-deficient) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited reduced viability under oxidative stress induced by arsenite, which was not due to dysregulation of the antioxidant response pathway, but rather due to the potential toxicity caused by the misfolded protein aggregates. However, it is still not clear whether Ub deficiency is directly related to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, as arsenite itself triggers protein aggregation and renders cells into aberrant conditions such as reduced proteasome function and inhibition of autophagic flux. Therefore, under arsenite treatment, the outcome could be derived from the combination of multiple defective pathways. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that ubiquitination status of misfolded proteins may not be important for the formation of inclusion bodies composed of misfolded protein aggregates. We therefore wondered whether Ub deficiency is sufficient to trigger the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates inside the cells. In this study, we ectopically expressed polyQ-expanded aggregates (Q103) in MEFs and observed inclusion body formation at the juxtanuclear region, which was independent of cellular Ub levels. In contrast to arsenite treatment, polyQ expression did not affect proteasome function. However, we observed an increased accumulation of Q103 aggregates in Ubc−/− MEFs, which was due to impaired autophagic clearance. Finally, we demonstrated that the increased accumulation of Q103 aggregates under Ub deficiency dramatically reduced the viability of cells. Therefore, our results suggest that the maintenance of proper levels of cellular Ub is important to protect cells against the toxicity induced by the accumulation of protein aggregates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aarsenites 3acell viability 3afibroblasts 3ahomeostasis 3ainclusion bodies 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein aggregates 3atoxicity 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitination 0aUbiquitin 0aPolyglutamine 0aAggregates 0aProteasome 0aAutophagy 0aToxicity 0aUb 0aMEFs 0apolyglutamine 0ainclusion bodies1 aRyu, Kwon-Yul0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 June 02, v. 500, no. 2 p.344-350dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.04.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017100163300001400334520176700348592002802115650001602143650002302159650001102182650001302193650002302206650001202229650001002241650002102251650001502272650002202287650001302309650001302322650001502335650002702350650002102377650001802398650001302416651001602429653001502445653001302460653001402473653002002487653002702507700001902534700001802553773012302571856008302694852000902777655001202786IND60532398920221118014858.0190318e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053239892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodd, R.J.10aManipulation of fertiliser regimes in phosphorus enriched soils can reduce phosphorus loss to leachate through an increase in pasture and microbial biomass production  ap. 65-76.  aPhytoextraction of phosphorus (P) has been proposed as a strategy to reduce the potential for P loss from P enriched soils. Compared to pastures that receive adequate P fertilisers to maintain soil P concentrations, applying half maintenance rates, or no P, slowly decreases soil P concentration and P losses to water. We hypothesise that the quantity of P lost in leachate can be further decreased by the addition of nitrogen (N) fertiliser to stimulate plant-P uptake. A 451 day lysimeter trial investigated subsurface P losses from three New Zealand soil types (USDA soil taxonomy: Udand, Dystrudept and Vitrand) under three N fertiliser rates, zero, 150 and 300kgNha−1yr−1 and two rates of P fertiliser, zero and half maintenance application with regular cutting and removal of pasture. For two of the soil types (Dystrudept and Vitrand), N application increased pasture production and decreased the load of dissolved reactive P (DRP) leached by 53–76% and the load of total dissolved P (TDP) by 39–53% compared to when no N was applied. Furthermore, for these soils, compared to the no P and no N treatment, applying P at half the rate designed to maintain soil P concentration, decreased the load of DRP and TDP in leachate by a 62–68% and 54–59% due to immobilisation of P within the microbial biomass. A high sorption capacity, leading to slow but sustained release of P to the soil solution, was seen as the probable reason for the lack of treatment effect in the third soil (Udand). This study highlights the potential for manipulating fertiliser regimes and implementing a cut and carry system on critical source areas of P loss within a farm as a strategy to reduce P loss from P enriched pastoral soils without impacting on productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDystrudepts 3aU.S. Soil Taxonomy 3aUdands 3aVitrands 3abiomass production 3acutting 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3alysimeters 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aphytoremediation 3asoil solution 3asorption 3aNew Zealand 0aPhosphorus 0aLeaching 0aLysimeter 0aPhytoextraction 0aSoil microbial biomass1 aMcDowell, R.W.1 aCondron, L.M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 185 p.65-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012000168300001600288520164700304592002801951650001301979650001801992650001602010650002902026650002602055650001402081650002102095650001402116650002602130650001002156650002902166650001202195650001602207650003102223650000902254650001702263650001102280651001002291653002302301653002002324653001302344653003602357653003602393700001602429700001602445700002002461700001402481700001202495700001702507700001802524773010402542856008702646852000902733655001202742IND60608122220221119112228.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060812222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanjun10aAromatic compound emissions from municipal solid waste landfill: Emission factors and their impact on air pollution  ap. 205-213.  aAromatic compounds (ACs) are major components of volatile organic compounds emitted from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The ACs emissions from the working face of a landfill in Beijing were studied from 2014 to 2015 using a modified wind tunnel system. Emission factors (EFs) of fugitive ACs emissions from the working face of the landfill were proposed according to statistical analyses to cope with their uncertainty. And their impacts on air quality were assessed for the first time. Toluene was the dominant AC with an average emission rate of 38.8 ± 43.0 μg m⁻² s⁻¹ (at a sweeping velocity of 0.26 m s⁻¹). An increasing trend in AC emission rates was observed from 12:00 to 18:00 and then peaked at 21:00 (314.3 μg m⁻² s⁻¹). The probability density functions (PDFs) of AC emission rates could be classified into three distributions: Gaussian, log-normal, and logistic. EFs of ACs from the working face of the landfill were proposed according to the 95th percentile cumulative emission rates and the wind effects on ACs emissions. The annual ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol formation potential caused by AC emissions from landfills in Beijing were estimated to be 8.86 × 10⁵ kg year⁻¹ and 3.46 × 10⁴ kg year⁻¹, respectively. Toluene, m + p-xylene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene were the most significant contributors to air pollution. Although ACs pollutions from landfills accounts for less percentage (∼0.1%) compared with other anthropogenic sources, their fugitive emissions which cannot be controlled efficiently deserve more attention and further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3aozone 3aprobability distribution 3atoluene 3auncertainty 3avolatile organic compounds 3awind 3awind tunnels 3axylene 3aChina 0aAromatic compounds 0aEmission factor 0aLandfill 0aOzone formation potential (OFP) 0aSecondary organic aerosol (SOA)1 aLu, Wenjing1 aGuo, Hanwen1 aMing, Zhongyuan1 aWang, Chi1 aXu, Sai1 aLiu, Yanting1 aWang, Hongtao0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Aug., v. 139 p.205-213dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015700159300001600316520197600332592002802308650001902336650001702355650001702372650001902389650001302408650001102421650001402432650002402446650000902470650001602479650001402495700001602509700001602525700001702541700001302558700001402571773009402585856007402679852000902753655001202762IND60408517420221119085114.0150905e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851742DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.011632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnadón, J. D.10aIndividualistic response to past climate changes: niche differentiation promotes diverging Quaternary range dynamics in the subspecies of Testudo graeca  ap. 956-966.  aUnderstanding how species have responded to past climate changes might inform how current climate change may affect species. However, current perspectives on species’ response to Quaternary cycles mainly stem from studies on mid and high latitudes and limited information is available at lower latitudes. In these systems a greater variation in individual species’ responses to glacial cycles has been suggested, but we lack of clear case studies of such variations. Here, by means of ecological niche modelling, we characterized the niche differentiation of the five subspecies of the tortoise Testudo graeca in north Africa and described the range dynamics suffered by each of the subspecies since the Last Glacial Maxima. Molecular data was employed to infer past population dynamics. The five subspecies present a clear niche differentiation, particularly in relation to rainfall, covering a range from semiarid to humid species. The ecological differentiation among subspecies promotes very different, even opposite, post‐glacial range dynamics. Since the Last Glacial Maxima, the ranges have either expanded (T. g. graeca), contracted (T. g. marokkensis), shifted northwards (T. g. soussensis) or remained stable (T. g. cyrenaica and T. g. nabeulensis). Molecular data supported the majority of these range dynamics. Our work exemplifies how, in a climate change scenario, phylogenetically very close taxa (i.e. at the subspecies level) might experience strikingly different biogeographical dynamics due to former niche differentiation. Our work supports an individualistic response to glacial cycles, which can be particularly strong in lower latitudes. In these areas precipitation changes during glacial periods may have strongly affected distribution ranges in idiosyncratic ways. We hypothesize that in those species limited by precipitation the response to glacial cycles (and climate changes) is more unpredictable than in those limited by temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTestudo graeca 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3alatitude 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3apopulation dynamics 3arain 3atemperature 3atortoises1 aGraciá, E.1 aBotella, F.1 aGiménez, A.1 aFahd, S.1 aFritz, U.0 tEcography.g2015 Sept., v. 38, no. 9 p.956-966dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.011633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010800163300001800271520114000289592002801429650001601457650001801473650002201491650001901513650001101532650002101543650001501564650001601579650002101595650001501616650001301631650001301644650001601657700002501673773013601698856008101834852000901915655001201924IND60624217220221120114407.0181202e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-4438-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinner, J.,10aIn-situ acidification of electrosterically dispersed alumina suspensions: Effect of coagulant structure  ap. 1893-1903.  aThe effect of the acidification arising from the hydrolysis of a range of carboxylic acid derivative compounds on the behaviour of electrosterically dispersed alumina slurries has been studied and it has been demonstrated that they can be successfully coagulated in a time-dependent manner. The inherent coagulation rate is determined by a number of factors, including the precise molecular composition and conformation of the coagulant, as well as its concentration and the suspension temperature. For the cyclic compounds, the size of the ring exhibits a significant influence on the coagulation rate with factors that affect the ground and transition state energies responsible for the observed trends. The nature of the atom bonded to the carbonyl carbon also influences the coagulation rate, with substituent hydroxyl groups accelerating the process. These side group entities can adopt a range of spatial arrangements, however certain conformations result in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the attacking water nucleophile. These favourable interactions stabilise the transition state and hence reduce the activation energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aacidification 3aactivation energy 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acarboxylic acids 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrolysis 3amoieties 3aslurries 3atemperature1 aMcdermott, Andrew M.0 tJournal of materials science.g2006 Apr., v. 41, no. 7 p.1893-1903dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-4438-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01306naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245008200196500002000278520032500298592002800623650001600651650001500667651001000682651001200692700005500704700005900759773011600818856007300934852000901007655001201016IND60694125620221119031122.0200510e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069412562DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.026492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhe‐Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2832-811510aThree new synonyms of Rungia stolonifera (Acanthaceae) from China and Vietnam  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExamination of relevant type materials and living plants has revealed that Rungia axilliflora, R. densiflora and R. evrardii are conspecific with R. stolonifera.

Association between eating disorder symptoms and perfectionism in adolescent rhythmic gymnasts  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEating disorders are associated with perfectionism in adults, but evidence is lacking in adolescent competitive athletes. This study examined eating disorder symptoms and perfectionism in a sample of 13–15 years old, adolescent rhythmic gymnasts.Eighty-nine female rhythmic gymnasts (41 international and 48 recreational level gymnasts), completed the Eating Attitudes Tests 26 (EAT-26), the Sport Perfectionism Questionnaire (SPQ), the Social Desirability Scale (SDS) and provided information on their training.It was found that 41.46% of the international and 14.58% of the recreational level gymnasts scored ≥20 in EAT-26. International level gymnasts also scored higher than recreational in EAT-26 (p = 0.002), and its subscales Dieting (p = 0.012) and Oral Control (p ˂ 0.001) and in the Sport Perfectionism Questionnaire (p = 0.005) and the subscales Striving for Perfectionism (p ˂ 0.001) and Personal Standards (p ˂ 0.001). No differences were found between groups in the subscales Concerns over Mistakes (p = 0.429), and Negative Reactions to Imperfection (p = 0.096). Multiple regression analysis in international level gymnasts, showed that Negative Reactions to Imperfection, body mass index and training experience accounted for 33.2% of the variance in EAT-26 (adjusted R² = 0.332, F = 6.786, p ˂ 0.001). A negative association was observed between training experience and eating disorder symptoms in international level athletes. No association was found between the subscales of perfectionism and EAT-26 in recreational gymnasts (p ˃ 0.316).International level, adolescent rhythmic gymnasts show more eating pathology than recreational. Negative Reactions to Imperfection and BMI seem relevant for gymnasts' dieting behaviour while training experience may help adolescent athletes to cope with disturbed eating behaviours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3afemales 3ahealthy eating habits 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asports 3avariance 0aDisturbed eating attitudes 0aAdolescence 0aHealth 0aRhythmic gymnastics 0aPerfection1 aDonti, Anastasia1 aGaspari, Vasiliki1 aPleksida, Paraskevi1 aPsychountaki, Maria0 tEating behaviors.g2021 Apr., v. 41 p.101514-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.1015143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010200168300001800270520092200288592002801210650001401238650001301252650001301265650001701278650001301295650001701308650001901325650001301344700001601357700001501373700005101388700001401439700005301453700001601506700001501522700002201537700005601559700005701615700005801672773012001730856008501850852000901935655001201944IND60754856420221122044232.0211026e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c012742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Jincheng14aThe Intermittent Dormancy of Ethylene Polymerization with the Assistance of Nitrogen Microbubbles  ap. 9418-9426.  aThe inert nitrogen microbubbles are incorporated during ethylene slurry polymerization to retard the formation of chain entanglements through the intermittent dormancy of living polymer chains. This dormancy effect is endowed by the highly frequent and intensive collisions of countless microbubbles on the growing polyethylene particles, which blocks the transfer channel of reactants on the particle surface. It is evidenced that the transfer barrier slows down the chain propagation and provides extra time for the propagated chains to be crystallized. Thus, the nascent polyethylene with the reduced entanglements and a considerable amount of monoclinic lamellae is achieved by the catalyst with the original ability to synthesize the highly entangled polyethylene. The synchronous increment of stiffness, toughness, and strength is found for the synthesized polyethylene owing to the reduced chain entanglements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3adormancy 3aethylene 3amicrobubbles 3anitrogen 3apolyethylene 3apolymerization 3aslurries1 aYu, Chenjie1 aYe, Shuyao1 aLi, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4130-04751 aKang, Xue1 aYang, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3611-28591 aLiang, Peng1 aMa, Yulong1 aHuang, Zhengliang1 aJiang, Binbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7072-14821 aWang, Jingdai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8594-42861 aYang, Yongrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5598-69250 tMacromolecules.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 54, no. 20 p.9418-9426dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c012743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245005700194300001400251520106800265592002801333650001301361650002901374650001201403650001301415650001101428650002001439650002001459650000901479650001401488650001101502650001101513650001501524650000901539650002901548650003401577650002101611650002101632650003001653650004101683653002301724653001901747653002501766653002301791653003501814653002401849700002101873700002701894773008601921856008402007852000902091655001202100IND60086733420221120132845.0160903e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008673342DNAL7 a234167422pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgodawatta, Prasanna10aCharacterising metal build-up on urban road surfaces  ap. 87-91.  aReliable approaches for predicting pollutant build-up are essential for accurate urban stormwater quality modelling. Based on the in-depth investigation of metal build-up on residential road surfaces, this paper presents empirical models for predicting metal loads on these surfaces. The study investigated metals commonly present in the urban environment. Analysis undertaken found that the build-up process for metals primarily originating from anthropogenic (copper and zinc) and geogenic (aluminium, calcium, iron and manganese) sources were different. Chromium and nickel were below detection limits. Lead was primarily associated with geogenic sources, but also exhibited a significant relationship with anthropogenic sources. The empirical prediction models developed were validated using an independent data set and found to have relative prediction errors of 12–50%, which is generally acceptable for complex systems such as urban road surfaces. Also, the predicted values were very close to the observed values and well within 95% prediction interval.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3acalcium 3achromium 3acopper 3adata collection 3adetection limit 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3anickel 3aprediction 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aModels, Chemical 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aPollutant build-up 0aMetal build-up 0aStormwater pollution 0aStormwater quality 0aStormwater pollutant processes 0aUrban water quality1 aZiyath, Abdul M.1 aGoonetilleke, Ashantha0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2013 May, v. 176 p.87-91dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2013.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010200163300001600265520206300281592002802344650001502372650001302387650001502400650002402415650001602439650001502455650000902470650001302479650002102492650001402513650001402527650002202541650002102563651001502584700002002599700002002619700002102639773009402660856007402754852000902828655001202837IND60408517820221119084734.0150905e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040851782DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.013702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaimer, Bonnie B.10aFunctional and phylogenetic approaches reveal the evolution of diversity in a hyper diverse biota  ap. 901-912.  aAnt communities in tropical forests may be governed by varying assembly mechanisms, depending on the particular habitat investigated. We compared phylogenetic diversity and structure across two forest biomes (dry and humid) and two vertical layers (arboreal and terricolous) in ant communities in Madagascar, and assessed the influence of invasive species on this community structure. We estimated phylogenetic signal and correlated evolution for habitat and several functional traits and tested for conservatism in relevant functional and habitat traits. Ancestral states were reconstructed to illuminate the evolution of habitat traits. All analyses utilized phylogenies estimated from newly generated data from three nuclear markers for 290 Malagasy ant taxa. Dry forests, although lower in species richness, were found to support equally high lineage diversity as humid forests. In contrast, phylogenetic diversity was much lower in arboreal than in terricolous communities. We observed significant phylogenetic clustering in the combined humid forest and in the arboreal–humid, arboreal–dry and terricolous–humid communities, whereas the combined dry forest community was overdispersed. Among ant communities in Madagascar, overdispersion and competition therefore may be more prevalent in dry forest, and habitat filtering may be more dominant in humid forest. Excluding invasive ant species had little overall effect on community structure. All investigated traits showed low to intermediate conservatism; strong support for correlated evolution was found for increased eye size and an arboreal lifestyle. Habitat transitions from humid to dry and from terricolous to arboreal occurred more frequently, and ancestors of most lineages were predicted to be terricolous or humid‐forest adapted. We conclude that most Malagasy ant clades first colonized humid forests and subsequently transitioned into dry forests, indicating that previous hypotheses on the evolution of Madagascar's hyperdiverse biota may not apply to ants and other arthropods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aancestry 3aarthropods 3acommunity structure 3adry forests 3aecosystems 3aeyes 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3alifestyle 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3atropical forests 3aMadagascar1 aBrady, Seán G.1 aSchultz, Ted R.1 aFisher, Brian L.0 tEcography.g2015 Sept., v. 38, no. 9 p.901-912dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.013703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011400169520166200283592002801945650001601973650001401989650002402003653001602027653002002043653001002063653001002073653001402083653001602097700002302113700002502136700001502161700002002176700001702196700003102213700002102244700001702265700002102282773011002303856008502413852000902498655001202507IND60736470320221119151658.0210820e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073647032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.1015162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgan, Sarah J.10aExamining cognitive and behavioural symptoms across binge/purge profiles in adolescents with eating disorders  aBinge eating and purging profiles may vary in adolescents with eating disorders and this may potentially be a function of a range of cognitive and behavioural constructs. The aim was to determine whether cognitive and behavioural symptoms differed among purging profiles in 229 adolescent females (M age = 15.45). Differences were examined in three binge/purge profiles; (i) regular objective binge eating and purging (OBEP, n = 63), (ii) regular subjective binge eating and purging (SBEP, n = 41), and (iii) purging in the absence of any binge eating (P-noBE, n = 110). Adolescents with objective or subjective binge eating had significantly higher global eating disorder scores and eating, shape, and weight concerns than those without binge eating, but not more frequent compensatory behaviours. There were no significant differences on dietary restraint. The group with objective binge eating (OBEP) had significantly higher eating concerns and self-induced vomiting than adolescents with subjective binge eating (SBEP). Future research is required to understand the reasons for elevated symptoms in the OBE-P group, since the size of binge episodes is not thought to be a salient factor in binge eating. In contrast to the literature, we did not find support for a special relevance of dietary restraint to the purging only presentation (P-noBE), rather it was a universal characteristic of all binge/purge presentations. Eating concerns may be an important target in adolescents with objective binge symptoms. Future research should examine if treatment targeted at different binge/purge profiles improves efficacy of treatment in adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3acognition 3adietary restriction 0aAdolescents 0aEating disorder 0aBinge 0aPurge 0aCognitive 0aBehavioural1 aHessing, Breana H.1 aHoiles, Kimberley J.1 aShu, Chloe1 aJones, Emily J.1 aO'Brien, Amy1 aMorgan-Lowes, Katherine L.1 aMcCormack, Julie1 aLampard, Amy1 aWatson, Hunna J.0 tEating behaviors.g2021 Aug., v. 42 p.101516-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.1015163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245014200208300001800350520117400368592002801542650001401570650002101584650001301605650002601618700001301644700001301657700005801670700005801728773012001786856008501906852000901991655001202000IND60754856620221122021848.0211026e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075485662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c013242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yao-Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8031-913910aPerfectly Alternating Copolymerization of CO and Epoxides to Aliphatic Polyester Oligomers via Cooperative Organoboron–Cobalt Complexes  ap. 9427-9436.  aThe carbonylative polymerization of epoxides provides a promising but challenging strategy to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) which are of high commercial value in the field of biomedical materials and engineering plastics. Herein, a suite of well-defined bifunctional organoboron–cobalt catalysts, featuring simple preparation, high yields, and low metal content, are exploited for the carbonylative polymerization of epoxides to PHA oligomers. The organoboron–cobalt-mediated carbonylative polymerization exhibits high polyester selectivity (over 95%, four epoxide examples), and the obtained PHAs have more than 99% ester linkages on the polymer main chain. Detailed investigations based on in situ reactIR and ¹H NMR analyses first found the concurrence of the direct alternating copolymerization of epoxides/CO, the ring expansion carbonylation of the epoxides to afford β-lactones, and the in situ homopolymerization of β-lactones under a single catalyst. This rare discovery provides a fundamentally different mechanism in the preparation of PHAs from CO/epoxides, extending the arsenal of catalytic systems that can copolymerize CO with epoxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopolymerization 3aepoxides 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates1 aYang, Li1 aXie, Rui1 aYang, Guan-Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2471-29531 aWu, Guang-Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-964X0 tMacromolecules.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 54, no. 20 p.9427-9436dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c013243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245019300179520125000372592002801622650001801650650001701668650001501685650001301700650002501713650001701738650001401755650001801769650001401787650001701801650001001818650001801828650001701846650001101863650003001874650001501904650001101919650001501930650001901945653002701964653001801991653002302009653002402032653001502056653000802071653000802079653000902087653000802096653000802104653000902112700003302121700002602154700002302180700002302203700002702226700002202253700002102275773011102296856008602407852000902493655001202502IND60768919320221122053157.0220328e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076891932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-García, Ricardo10aPrebiotic effect, bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity of melon peel (Cucumis melo L. inodorus) flour subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and human faecal fermentation  aMelon peels are by-products derived from food processing industries, representing potential sources of new ingredients in particular dietary fibre and phenolic compounds, which in synergy could exert beneficial effects on human health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accessibility of bioactive compounds from melon peels throughout gastrointestinal digestion and evaluate their prebiotic effect when submitted to in vitro human faecal fermentation. Melon peels flour obtained from solid fraction showed an increase in antioxidant capacity at the gastric and intestinal phase, which was corroborated by the total phenolic content (126.91%) increase and the identified individual phenolics (tyrosol, luteolin-6-glycoside, chlorogenic and caffeic acids). Also, melon peels flour positively impacted the gut microbiota diversity, showing a similar ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes compared to the positive control (FOS) and promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids, mainly acetate > propionate > butyrate. Thus, these findings demonstrate that melon peels have antioxidant and prebiotic potential attributed to the phenolic compounds and the production of beneficial fatty acids, which could improve human gut health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aCucumis melo 3aFirmicutes 3aacetates 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abutyrates 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3afermentation 3aflour 3afood research 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amelons 3aprebiotics 3apropionic acid 0aFunctional ingredients 0aDietary fibre 0aPhenolic compounds 0aSimulated digestion 0aGut health 0aGIT 0aMPF 0aSCFA 0aFOS 0aRI% 0aACI%1 aSánchez-Gutiérrez, Mónica1 aFreitas-Costa, Célia1 aVilas-Boas, Ana A.1 aCampos, Débora A.1 aAguilar, Cristóbal N.1 aMadureira, Ana R.1 aPintado, Manuela0 tFood research international.g2022 Apr., v. 154 p.111045-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006700144245011500211300002000326520217100346592002802517650001002545650001302555650001902568650001802587650001702605650001302622650001402635650001902649650002602668650001602694650001702710650001502727653001702742653002102759653001902780653002402799700002002823700006602843700002302909700002302932700006502955700002503020700007003045700006003115773014203175856007803317852000903395655001203404IND60746142720221119135513.0210729e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074614272DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c036872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNouri-Goushki, Mahdiyeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1665-914410a3D-Printed Submicron Patterns Reveal the Interrelation between Cell Adhesion, Cell Mechanics, and Osteogenesis  ap. 33767-33781.  aThe surface topography of implantable devices is of crucial importance for guiding the cascade of events that starts from the initial contact of the cells with the surface and continues until the complete integration of the device in its immediate environment. There is, however, limited quantitative information available regarding the relationships between the different stages of such cascade(s) and how the design of surface topography influences them. We, therefore, used direct laser writing to 3D-print submicron pillars with precisely controlled dimensions and spatial arrangements to perform a systematic study of such relationships. Using single-cell force spectroscopy, we measured the adhesion force and the work of adhesion of the preosteoblast cells residing on the different types of surfaces. Not only the adhesion parameters (after 2–60 s) but also the formation of focal adhesions was strongly dependent on the geometry and arrangement of the pillars: sufficiently tall and dense pillars enhanced both adhesion parameters and the formation of focal adhesions. Our morphological study of the cells (after 24 h) showed that those enhancements were associated with a specific way of cell settlement onto the surface (i.e., “top state”). The cells interacting with tall and dense pillars were also characterized by numerous thick actin stress fibers in the perinuclear region and possibly high internal stresses. Furthermore, living cells with highly organized cytoskeletal networks exhibited greater values of the elastic modulus. The early responses of the cells predicted their late response including matrix mineralization: tall and dense submicron pillars significantly upregulated the expression of osteopontin after 21 days of culture under both osteogenic and nonosteogenic conditions. Our findings paint a detailed picture of at least one possible cascade of events that starts from initial cell adhesion and continues to subsequent cellular functions and eventual matrix mineralization. These observations could inform the future developments of instructive surfaces for medical devices based on physical surface cues and early markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aadhesion 3abone formation 3acell adhesion 3acytoskeleton 3ageometry 3amechanics 3amineralization 3amodulus of elasticity 3aosteopontin 3aspectroscopy 3atopography 0abiomaterials 0asurface patterns 0acell mechanics 0aosteogenic response1 aAngeloni, Livia1 aModaresifar, Khashayar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0391-85411 aMinneboo, Michelle1 aBoukany, Pouyan E.1 aMirzaali, Mohammad J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5349-69221 aGhatkesar, Murali K.1 aFratila-Apachitei, Lidy E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-44451 aZadpoor, Amir A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3234-21120 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 12, v. 13, no. 29 p.33767-33781dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c036873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001800293520120800311592002801519650001501547650001901562650001501581650002201596650002601618650001401644650001801658700002201676700002301698773011701721856008101838852000901919655001201928IND60081702120221119070039.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008170212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-7989-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbert, Anastasia10aPlasma-based ambient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry: state-of-the-art in qualitative and quantitative analysis  ap. 6111-6127.  aAmbient desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (ADI-MS) aims to enable direct analysis of gaseous, liquid, and/or solid samples under ambient conditions. In ADI-MS, different types of desorption/ionization sources are classified according to their basic method of operation, namely spray-based, laser-based, or plasma-based. This review discusses many of the plasma-based techniques coupled to mass spectrometry in terms of their current performance in fast qualitative screening and quantitative analysis. Critical aspects, for example sample preparation and introduction, quantification, and matrix effects, are addressed. Furthermore, the applicability of plasma-based sources to portable mass spectrometers and their capabilities in imaging experiments are summarized. The applications discussed are of two types. In one, direct screening is performed without any or with minimal sample pretreatment. Samples with low matrix content are qualitatively analyzed without interferences. The other, more challenging applications, namely samples with high matrix content and most quantitative analysis, typically require sample preparation ranging from simple dilution to extensive multi-step procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aquantitative analysis 3ascreening 3aspectrometers1 aShelley, Jacob T.1 aEngelhard, Carsten0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 406, no. 25 p.6111-6127dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7989-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245014200206500002000348520166500368592002802033650001102061650000902072650001102081650001402092650001902106650001002125650001402135650002602149650000902175650001902184651001602203700002402219700001902243700002002262773012702282856008402409852000902493655001202502IND60790622920221119184611.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062292DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFluen, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4008-473110aRetrospective study of the relative frequency of feline hepatobiliary disease in New Zealand based on 10 years of hepatic biopsy samples  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: To retrospectively determine the relative frequency of feline hepatobiliary diseases from biopsy specimens submitted to a single laboratory across a 10‐year period and to establish whether age, sex or breed associations exist. METHODS: Histopathological data from 154 liver biopsies of New Zealand cats sampled between 2008 and 2018 were analysed. The samples were allocated to primary, secondary and tertiary disease categories using criteria established by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association. Breed associations were derived using ORs and 95% CIs. Gender and age associations were also evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequently diagnosed hepatobiliary diseases were lymphocytic cholangitis (20 per cent), hepatitis (16.9 per cent), reversible hepatocellular injury (16.4 per cent), neutrophilic cholangitis (9.7 per cent), haematopoietic neoplasia (9.7 per cent), hepatocellular neoplasia (5.6 per cent) and cholangiocellular neoplasia (4.1 per cent). Burmese cats were found to be at significantly increased risk of both biliary and parenchymal diseases and Birman cats to be at significantly increased risk of parenchymal disease. Domestic longhair cats were at significantly increased risk of hepatobiliary neoplasia. Birman cats were at significantly increased risk of hepatitis while domestic shorthair cats were at significantly decreased risk of neutrophilic cholangitis, reversible hepatocellular injury and hepatitis.

Empirical antimicrobials are often prescribed while waiting urine culture and susceptibility results. Regional knowledge of bacterial prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns aids veterinarians in antimicrobial choice. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of uropathogens in canine urine tract isolates and to assess for changes in antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) over a 5‐year study period at a large multidisciplinary private referral hospital in Australia (January 2013–December 2017). The proportion of resistant isolates was compared across 5 years (Fisher's exact test and Cochran Armitage test for trend) for select antimicrobials towards E. coli. A total of 246 positive urine cultures were included. E. coli was the most prevalent uropathogen at 64%, followed by Proteus sp., Staphylococcus sp. and Enterococcus sp., respectively (9%, 8% and 7%). E. coli was most commonly resistant to amoxicillin at 41%. There was no statistically significant difference, nor trend, in resistance of E. coli isolates towards the selected antimicrobials over the 5 years. Resistance towards trimethoprim–sulfonamide was lower at 15%. This information will aid local veterinarians in selecting empirical antimicrobials pending culture results for the treatment of UTIs in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aProteus 3aStaphylococcus 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3adogs 3ahospitals 3aurinary tract diseases 3aurine 3aAustralia1 aWhite, Joanna1 aLam, Amy0 tVeterinary record open.g2019 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e000345-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245019400179300001600373520159800389592002801987650001802015650001302033650001102046650000902057650001902066650001502085650001202100650001302112650001302125650005902138650005602197650004602253700001502299700002202314700001702336700001702353700003102370773010102401856007302502852000902575655001202584IND50073603420221122140822.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007360342DNAL7 a237015062pmid7 a10.1111/vop.120512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKibbin, Martin10aSpectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging of the posterior segment of the eye in the retinal dysplasia and degeneration chicken, an animal model of inherited retinal degeneration  ap. 113-119.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate qualitative and quantitative differences in the structure of the posterior segment of the eye in 1‐day post‐hatch and 12‐month‐old retinal dysplasia and degeneration (rdd) and wild‐type chickens. ANIMAL STUDIED: Retinal dysplasia and degeneration and wild‐type chickens. PROCEDURE: Using a commercially available spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system, 15° horizontal line scans were performed in both eyes of 24 live birds. Qualitative differences in retinal lamination and choroidal structure were investigated, and retinal and choroidal thickness were measured. RESULTS: Progressive retinal thinning with loss of outer retinal lamination and changes in the appearance of the choroid were seen in the rdd birds. Mean total retinal thickness was 202 μm (SD 7.8) and 251 μm (SD 8.8) in the rdd and wild‐type chicks and 154 μm (SD 18) and 280 μm (SD 10.8) in the adult birds. Much of the difference was the result of loss of outer retinal lamination and thickness in the rdd birds. Mean choroidal thickness was 76 μm (SD 19.6) and 112 μm (SD 36.9) in the rdd and wild‐type chicks and 85 μm (SD 23.7) and 228 μm (SD 44.1) in the rdd and wild‐type adult birds, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in retinal and choroidal structure and thickness between rdd and wild‐type birds were evident on spectral domain OCT imaging at 1‐day post‐hatch and more marked at 1 year. Spectral domain OCT may provide a reliable end point for therapeutic intervention in this animal model of inherited retinal degeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3achickens 3achicks 3aeyes 3aimage analysis 3atomography 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aGenotype 2aRetinal Degenerationxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aRetinal Dysplasiaxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTomography, Optical Coherencexveterinary1 aAli, Manir1 aInglehearn, Chris1 aShires, Mike1 aBoyle, Kenny1 aHocking, P.

Likewise, fast analytical procedures are required in forensic sciences, for example at customs, to substantiate an initial suspicion. We here present the design and the optimization of an instrumental setup for rapid and non-invasive characterization of tablets by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (with a UV-laser (λ ₑₓ = 266 nm) as excitation source) in reflection geometry. The setup was first validated with regard to repeatability, bleaching phenomena, and sensitivity. The effect on the spectra by the physical and chemical properties of the samples, e.g. their hardness, homogeneity, chemical composition, and granule grain size of the uncompressed material, using a series of tablets, manufactured in accordance with design of experiments, was investigated. Investigation of tablets with regard to homogeneity, especially, is extremely important in pharmaceutical production processes. We demonstrate that multiplicative scatter correction is an appropriate tool for data preprocessing of fluorescence spectra. Tablets with different physical and chemical characteristics can be discriminated well from their fluorescence spectra by subjecting the results to principal component analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ableaching 3achemical composition 3adrug formulations 3aexperimental design 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aforensic sciences 3ahardness 3alasers 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprincipal component analysis1 aMeyer, Hans1 aWeigel, Diana1 aPritzke, Heinz1 aPosch, Tjorben N.1 aKler, Pablo A.1 aSchürmann, Klaus1 aRoscher, Jörg1 aHuhn, Carolin0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 406, no. 25 p.6347-6362dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8074-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007500166300001800241520096600259592002801225650001901253650001301272650001401285650002201299650002101321650001301342650003301355650001801388650002201406700001601428700001901444700001801463700001801481700001901499773013601518856008101654852000901735655001201744IND60624218120221122034930.0181202e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-4506-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yo-Seung10aCorrosion properties of plasma-sprayed Al2O3-TiO2 coatings on Ti metal  ap. 2059-2065.  aThree different oxides of CrO₂-TiO₂, Al₂O₃ and Al₂O₃-TiO₂ were plasma-sprayed on Ti substrate to evaluate the crystal structure and the corrosion properties of the coatings. No phase change of the coatings after corrosion test in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ solution at 25°C was found regardless of the presence of the NiCoCrAlY bond layer. Electrochemical measurements and SEM results revealed that the single coatings without the bond layer were always effective against corrosion resistance due to lower current density within the passive region. Pitting corrosion of the surface was observed for the Al₂O₃ coating. It can be concluded that the Al₂O₃-TiO₂ coating without the bond layer may be the best oxide among the oxides investigated due to low porosity (5.4%), smooth surface roughness (4.5 μm), low current density (6.3 × 10‒⁸ A/cm²) in the passive region, low corrosion potential (Ecₒᵣᵣ, ‒0.55 V) and no pitting corrosion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfuric acid 3asurface roughness1 aLee, In-Gyu1 aHong, Shin Nam1 aKim, Bae-Yeon1 aLee, Koo Hyun1 aLee, Deuk Yong0 tJournal of materials science.g2006 Apr., v. 41, no. 7 p.2059-2065dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-4506-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245015000168300001800318520172200336592002802058650002602086650002502112650001402137650002002151650001902171650001802190650001502208650002402223650001402247650001402261650002802275650002002303650001102323650001702334650001102351650001702362650001702379700003402396773012702430856007402557852000902631655001202640IND60656709220221120204048.0190814e20140213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065670922DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ay41483c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedroso, Tahisa Marcela10aDevelopment and validation of a microbiological assay by turbidimetry to determine the potency of cefazolin sodium in the lyophilized powder form  ap. 1391-1396.  aIn many countries, high rates of mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases represent high social and economic costs. Cefazolin sodium is a semi-synthetic β-lactam antimicrobial for parenteral use, belonging to the first-generation cephalosporin's group. Its use in clinical practice stands out for its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent and in surgical prophylaxis, having great importance in the fight against many diseases. This paper reports the development and validation of an efficient, accurate, reproducible, and low cost microbiological assay by a turbidimetric method to quantify cefazolin in the lyophilized powder form. These requirements are essential for the analysis of this cephalosporin in the pharmaceutical industry. The assay is based on the inhibitory effect of cefazolin sodium upon the strain of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 26923 used as the test microorganism. The method was validated according to the ICH guidelines and the results were treated by analysis of variance (ANOVA), proving to be linear (r² = 0.9999 for the reference substance and r² = 0.9995 for the sample), in the selected range from 6 to 11.76 μg mL⁻¹, precise (RSD values < 2.0%), robust and accurate (99.92%). The developed method showed excellent validation results, and the statistical analysis corroborated with its assessment. Furthermore, Student's t-test showed no statistically significant difference between the proposed turbidimetric method and an UV spectrophotometry method previously validated. Thus, the validated method is able to quantify cefazolin sodium in the powder form for injectable solution, while being an economical and rapid alternative for its routine analysis in quality control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanalysis of variance 3acefazolin 3adisease control 3aeconomic costs 3afreeze drying 3aguidelines 3ainfectious diseases 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apharmaceutical industry 3aquality control 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3at-test 3atherapeutics 3aturbidimetry1 aNunes Salgado, Hérida Regina0 tAnalytical methods.g2014 Feb. 13, v. 6, no. 5 p.1391-1396dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ay41483c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04195naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245004900216520260100265592002802866650001502894650001902909650001002928650002102938650001002959650002102969650001102990650001103001650001003012650001403022650001103036650001203047650002403059651001103083651001803094653001203112653001503124653001303139653001603152653001803168653002303186700006703209700007003276700004103346700003303387700004403420773011603464856008803580852000903668655001203677IND60743718120221118224700.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074371812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1054212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Laiza Bonela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2261-905010aDiagnosis of animal abuse: A Brazilian study  aDue to their intimate relationship with human beings, animals can experience abuse, especially in the family environment. Research on the variables involved in this topic is scarce in Latin America. The objective of this study was to identify the main types of animal abuse in Brazilian municipalities and to characterize animals and perpetrators in addition to identifying the socioeconomic factors associated with the incidents. The occurrences of animal abuse were analyzed from the records of the Police Station Specialized in Fauna Crimes Investigation Department of the Civil Police of Minas Gerais operating in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, from September 2016 to September 2018. Events involving cruelty to animals were categorized as active maltreatment, while acts of omission, which refer to neglected animals, were categorized as passive maltreatment, defined according to sets of nutritional, health, behavioral, and comfort indicators. Cruel crimes were the most frequently registered (45.7 %, 101/221), with intoxication and aggression being the most common types. Active maltreatment generated more deaths compared to passive maltreatment (OR: 3.900, 95 % CI: 1.873–8.588, p<0.05). Regarding abuse, dogs were the most affected animals (59.7 %, 132/221), followed by felines (14.9 %, 33/221), equine (5.4 %, 12/221), birds (5.8 %, 13/221), poultry (2.7 %, 6/221), reptiles (2.2 %, 5/221), and other groups of animals (9.0 %, 20/221). Adults were the most frequently reported (55.2 %, 122/221) age of abused animals. Cats were the main cruelty victims, with the highest chance of death (OR: 6.829, 95 %CI: 2.916–16.696, p<0.05) and were those who suffered most from intoxication abuse (OR: 4.72, 95 % CI 1.585–14.996, p=0.001). The perpetrators of abuse were predominantly males (66.8 %, 137/205) aged between 40 and 59 years (38.6 %, 53/137). Perpetrators of committing animal cruelty were 3.57 times more likely to be male and 2.5 times more likely to have no college education. The perpetrators of animal abandonment had a 25 times greater chance of being between 18 and 24 years old compared to the category between 40 and 59 years old and perpetrators of animal intoxication had 5 times greater chance of being also between 18 and 24 years old.Among all victimized animals, dogs and cats were the most affected, probably due to their close relationships with humans. Understanding the profile of victims and suspects involved in neglect maltreatment and cruelty to animals is fundamental to the establishment of policies and strategies to prevent and restrain these activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aanimal welfare 3adeath 3afamily relations 3afauna 3ahigher education 3ahorses 3ahumans 3amales 3apoisoning 3apolice 3apoultry 3aveterinary medicine 3aBrazil 3aLatin America 0aCruelty 0aNegligence 0aOmission 0aPet animals 0aAnimal rights 0aAssociated factors1 aPaiva, Marcelo Teixeira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6334-073X1 aLisboa, Luísa de Oliveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5557-72671 aOliveira, Camila Stefanie Fonseca de1 aGarcia, Rita de Cassia Maria1 aSoares, Danielle Ferreira de Magalhães0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2021 Sept., v. 194 p.105421-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1054213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245010800211500002000319520223400339592002802573650001902601650001902620650001502639650001702654650002002671650001502691650002802706650002902734650001502763650001002778650001502788650001102803650002102814650002502835650002402860651001102884700001602895700002302911700002102934700001502955700002002970773012702990856008403117852000903201655001203210IND60790623520221119184640.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062352DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIatridou, Despoina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8648-262310aMapping the teaching of honeybee veterinary medicine in the European Union and European Free Trade Area  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a very important species for human beings, animals, environmental biodiversity, crop production and economic sustainability in Europe and worldwide. This study investigates whether future veterinarians are trained to deal with the particular needs of the only traditional food‐producing insect in Europe. METHODS: This study analyses data collected from 77 European veterinary education establishments in EU and the European Free Trade Area. RESULTS: The results show that 75 per cent of those establishments (58 out of 77) teach honeybee veterinary medicine. There is a clear geographical differentiation. In north‐western countries only about half of the establishments include honeybee health, production and product inspection in their undergraduate curricula, while in eastern, central and southern countries, which are also important beekeeping countries, the great majority of the establishments incorporate honeybee veterinary medicine in their undergraduate curriculum. Eighty‐six per cent of all the establishments teaching honeybee veterinary medicine (50 of the 58) incorporate it in their core curriculum either as separate subject or as part of other subjects. Twenty‐five per cent of all the establishments (19 out of 77) organise postgraduate training courses in this field. CONCLUSIONS: Veterinarians have an important role in ensuring the health, sustainability and productivity of managed honeybee colonies as they do for other animal species. It seems however that teaching of honeybee veterinary medicine receives less attention in undergraduate veterinary curricula in EU compared with other fields of veterinary medicine. Seeing the increasing importance of honey bees for crop protection, environmental protection and economic sustainability, it would be beneficial to further strengthen the education of honeybee veterinary medicine in the future. Establishments should encourage and prepare veterinarians for practising science‐based veterinary medicine in honey bees by incorporating such teaching in undergraduate curricula and by providing postgraduate opportunities to qualified veterinarians wishing to enhance their basic skills in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aEuropean Union 3aapiculture 3abiodiversity 3acrop production 3acurriculum 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental protection 3afree trade 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3ahumans 3aplant protection 3aveterinary education 3aveterinary medicine 3aEurope1 aPohl, Laura1 aTlak Gajger, Ivana1 aDe Briyne, Nancy1 aBravo, Ana1 aSaunders, Jimmy0 tVeterinary record open.g2019 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e000343-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017200166300001800338500001500356520155700371592002801928650001801956650002001974650002001994650001602014650001302030650001602043650001602059650003502075650002202110650001902132650002602151650002702177653001702204700001702221700001902238700001902257773011702276856008102393852000902474655001202483IND60081702720221119065849.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008170272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-8086-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurrà, Miquel10aSolid-phase extraction and field-amplified sample injection–capillary zone electrophoresis for the analysis of benzophenone UV filters in environmental water samples  ap. 6189-6202.  a2019-12-06  aA field-amplified sample injection–capillary zone electrophoresis (FASI-CZE) method for the analysis of benzophenone (BP) UV filters in environmental water samples was developed, allowing the separation of all compounds in less than 8 min. A 9- to 25-fold sensitivity enhancement was obtained with FASI-CZE, achieving limits of detection down to 21–59 μg/L for most of the analyzed BPs, with acceptable run-to-run and day-to-day precisions (relative standard deviations lower than 17 %). In order to remove water sample salinity and to enhance FASI sensitivity, an off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure using a Strata X polymeric reversed-phase sorbent was used and afforded recoveries up to 72–90 % for most BPs. With the combination of off-line SPE and FASI-CZE, limits of detection in the range 0.06–0.6 μg/L in a river water matrix, representing a 2,400- to 6,500-fold enhancement, were obtained. Method performance was evaluated by quantifying a blank river water sample spiked at 1 μg/L. For a 95 % confidence level, no statistical differences were observed between found concentrations and spiked concentrations (probability at the confidence level, p value, of 0.60), showing that the proposed off-line SPE-FASI-CZE method is suitable for the analysis of BP UV filters in environmental water samples at low microgram per liter levels. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of BPs in river water samples collected up- and downstream of industrialized and urban areas, and in some drinking water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzophenones 3awater pollution 3adetection limit 3aprobability 3asalinity 3aurban areas 3ariver water 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3aindustrialization 3adrinking water 3aultraviolet radiation 3asolid phase extraction 0abenzophenone1 aCinca, Roser1 aLegaz, Jessica1 aNuñez, Oscar,0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 406, no. 25 p.6189-6202dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8086-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245022300173500002000396520171700416592002802133596003702161596004802198650002302246650000902269650001702278650001602295650001102311650001402322650000902336650002002345650001402365650001402379650004202393650000902435650002102444650001302465650003102478650002402509650000902533650001102542650001002553700001802563700001902581700003202600700002002632700006202652773012702714856008402841852000902925655001202934IND60790623720221119184616.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062372DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearson, Jennifer M12aA randomised controlled trial investigating the effects of administering a non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug to beef calves assisted at birth and risk factors associated with passive immunity, health, and growth  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of pain mitigation at birth to assisted beef calves and determine the risk factors associated with transfer of passive immunity (TPI), health, and growth. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty cow–calf pairs requiring calving assistance were enrolled. Calves were randomised to receive meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of placebo subcutaneously at birth. Calf blood samples were collected between one and seven days of age to determine serum immunoglobulin (IgG) concentration. Colostrum intake, treatment for disease, mortality, and weaning weights were recorded. Multilevel linear or logistic regression models were used to determine the effects of meloxicam and to identify risk factors. RESULTS: There was no effect of meloxicam on serum IgG concentrations, average daily gain (ADG), or risk of inadequate TPI (serum IgG concentration <24 g/l), treatment for disease, or mortality (P>0.05). Bottle or tube feeding calves were associated with decreased serum IgG concentrations (P=0.01) compared with nursing. Calves with an incomplete tongue withdrawal reflex had higher odds of being treated for disease compared with those with complete withdrawal (P=0.009). Being born meconium‐stained and having decreased serum IgG concentrations were associated with an increased risk of mortality (P=0.03). Being born of a mature cow, having a higher birth weight, and increased serum IgG concentrations were associated with greater ADG to weaning (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Vigour assessment at birth along with good colostrum management may be important to improve TPI and health in high‐risk calves such as those assisted at birth.  aPublisher supplied data  cAlberta Agriculture and Forestry  cUniversity of Calgary Eyes High Scholarship 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef 3abirth weight 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acolostrum 3acows 3aimmunoglobulins 3ameloxicam 3amortality 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apain 3apassive immunity 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atongue 3avigor1 aPajor, Edward1 aCampbell, John1 aLévy, Michel Louis,d1939-1 aCaulkett, Nigel1 aWindeyer, M Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9157-95530 tVeterinary record open.g2019 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e000364-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04336naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002100147040001800168072000900186072000900195100001900204245019000223300001600413500002400429500001500453520215100468650002002619650001302639650001202652650001402664650001602678650001502694650002702709650002102736650001902757650002302776650001202799650003702811650003302848650002102881650001202902650002502914650002302939650001002962650003802972650003303010650003803043651001403081653002003095653001303115653001703128700002003145700001603165700001803181700001803199700001603217773012403233852000903357856011203366856008603478930003303564945001303597946001303610961001503623655001203638IND2268137220221120075315.0010403e200102  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226813722DNAL7 a112331132pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-94.1.1972doi7 a10113/223702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF2001 aBurkness, E.C.10aField efficacy of sweet corn hybrids expressing a Bacillus thuringiensis toxin for management of Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 197-203.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aField studies were done in 1995-1996 to assess the efficacy of three sweet corn hybrids that express the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, Cry1Ab, against two lepidopteran pests, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) and Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). The Bt hybrids tested were developed by Novartis Seeds, using the event BT-11, which expresses Bt toxin in green tissue as well as reproductive tissues including the tassel, silk, and kernel. Bt hybrids were compared with a standard non-Bt control or the non-Bt isoline for each hybrid; none of the hybrids were treated with insecticides during the study. Hybrid efficacy was based on larval control of each pest, as well as plant or ear damage associated with each pest. In both years, control of O. nubilalis larvae in primary ears of all Bt hybrids was 99-100% compared with the appropriate non-Bt check. Plant damage was also significantly reduced in all Bt hybrids. In 1996, control of H. zea in Bt hybrids ranged from 85 to 88% when compared with the appropriate non-Bt control. In 1996, a University of Minnesota experimental non-Bt hybrid (MN2 x MN3) performed as well as the Bt hybrids for control of O. nubilalis. Also, in 1996, two additional University of Minnesota experimental non-Bt hybrids (A684su X MN94 and MN2 x MN3) performed as well as Bt hybrids for percent marketable ears (ears with no damage or larvae). In addition, compared with the non-Bt hybrids, percent marketable ears were significantly higher for all Bt hybrids and in most cases ranged from 98 to 100%. By comparison, percent marketable ears for the non-Bt hybrids averaged 45.5 and 37.4% in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Results from the 2-yr study strongly suggest that Bt sweet corn hybrids will provide high levels of larval control for growers in both fresh and processing markets. Specifically, Bt sweet corn hybrids, in the absence of conventional insecticide use, provided excellent control of O. nubilalis, and very good control of H. zea. However, depending on location of specific production regions, and the associated insect pests of sweet corn in each area, some insecticide applications may still be necessary. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3acorn ears 3acrop damage 3acrop yield 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3ainsect control 3aOstrinia nubilalis 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxins 2aChimera 2aEndotoxinsxgenetics 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aMoths 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aZea maysxgeneticsxparasitology. 3aMinnesota 0apest management 0aefficacy 0acry1ab toxin1 aHutchison, W.D.1 aBolin, P.C.1 aBartels, D.W.1 aWarnock, D.F.1 aDavis, D.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2001 Feb., v.  94, no.  1 p.197-203dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/223703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-94.1.1973Available from publisher's Web site  a20090113b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03543naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016500170300001400335520223000349592002802579650001102607650001202618650001902630650001202649650001602661650001802677650001102695650001302706650001402719650001602733650001502749651001402764651001602778651001702794651002202811700001702833700001802850700001802868700001902886773009602905856008703001852000903088655001203097IND60084092520221119081615.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008409252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarami, M.P.14aThe role of gateways in the evolution of temperature and salinity of semi-enclosed basins: An oceanic box model for the Miocene Mediterranean Sea and Paratethys  ap. 73-88.  aMarine gateways are important for semi-enclosed basins as they control exchange flows and influence water circulation. During much of the Early and Middle Miocene (~23–13Ma), the Paratethys (of which at present only the Black Sea and Caspian Sea remain) and the Mediterranean Sea were connected to both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The gateways to the Indian Ocean were closed ultimately in the Middle Miocene. Here, we apply an oceanic 4-box model to determine the temperature, salinity and exchange flows for the Paratethys and the Mediterranean Sea before and after closure of the Indian Ocean gateways. Our analysis forms a novel way of linking tectonics, climate and basin evolution. We investigate whether changes observed in the geological record of Paratethys are caused by changes in gateway configuration or in climate. We mainly focus on Paratethys which, because of the availability of a large variety of geological studies, presents an outstanding opportunity for studying the evolution of semi-enclosed basins and the impact of gateway closure. Moreover, Paratethys is considered to have played an important role in the evolution of Eurasian climate. Our analysis explores various values of the model parameters such as net evaporation and surface heat flux. Our main conclusions are: (1) Paratethys became more responsive to climate change after closure, (2) closure of the gateways to the Indian Ocean probably caused cooling of Paratethys and, in particular, accounted for the enigmatic Mid-Burdigalian cooling in Paratethys, (3) closure induced a change in salinity of Paratethys which is dependent on the net evaporation and size of the gateway connecting Paratethys to the Mediterranean, (4) Paratethys is sensitive to closure of both the gateway between Paratethys and the Indian Ocean, and the gateway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, (5) Paratethys is influenced by the water properties of the Mediterranean Sea, (6) the water properties of Paratethys have only very limited influence on the Mediterranean Sea, and (7) in the advanced stage of the closure, the Mediterranean/Paratethyan temperature and salinity became more responsive to the restriction of the eastern gateways.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acooling 3aevaporation 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3asalinity 3atectonics 3atemperature 3awater flow 3aBlack Sea 3aCaspian Sea 3aIndian Ocean 3aMediterranean Sea1 ade Leeuw, A.1 aKrijgsman, W.1 aMeijer, P.Th.1 aWortel, M.J.R.0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2011 , v. 79, no. 1-2 p.73-88dElsevier B.V.x0921-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04425naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016700172300001400339520257500353592002802928650002002956650001602976650002602992650001203018650001103030650001903041650002703060650002703087650001603114650002103130650002203151650002203173650001903195650001503214650002203229650002303251650001103274650001903285650002003304650001503324650002703339650001003366650001403376651001903390653001803409653001803427653002403445653001403469653002003483653002103503700002003524700001703544700002703561773012903588856008503717852000903802655001203811IND60542601820221117164055.0190403e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054260182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Stephen10aPatterns of vegetation composition and diversity in pine-dominated ecosystems of the Outer Coastal Plain of North Carolina: Implications for ecosystem restoration  ap. 64-73.  aTerrestrial ecosystems of the Atlantic coastal plain have experienced considerable change over the past two centuries, largely due to agricultural activities and fire suppression and exclusion. Many areas that were once dominated by open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands now support closed canopy stands of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) with a dense midstory of broadleaved shrubs and trees. In recent years, efforts to restore the herbaceous plant communities typically found in fire-maintained longleaf pine woodlands have focused on the use of midstory thinning to produce savanna-like conditions and to facilitate the restoration of historical fire regimes through prescribed burning. Previous efforts to restore longleaf pine stands have focused on the potential of fire-suppressed longleaf pine woodlands, which have been met with some success. However, it is unclear what the potential is for loblolly pine stands to act as a ’surrogate’ environment for the restoration of the often species-rich herbaceous layer of longleaf pine woodlands. To assess the effectiveness of longleaf pine restoration treatments in existing loblolly pine stands, we analyzed the drivers of plant community composition in loblolly pine stands with mechanical midstory removal treatments, untreated loblolly pine stands, longleaf pine stands, and pond pine dominated high-pocosin systems. We sampled 75 plots, from which more than 200 individual plant taxa were identified, with species richness (number of species per 0.1ha) ranging from 9 in pond pine pocosins to 118 in longleaf pine woodlands. Plant species richness and composition varied in response to soil properties, with the first NMS ordination axis correlated with soil properties related to soil moisture and organic matter content (SOM), and the second NMS ordination axis correlated to the concentration of certain soil nutrients (P, Ca), the variability of which may be due, in part, to historic fertilizer applications. While stand types were largely distinct from each other in their vegetation composition, there was nevertheless some compositional overlap among some longleaf and loblolly pine stands. Areas of compositional overlap appear to have somewhat similar soil properties, whereby the soils found in overlapping loblolly pine stands were closer to those found in longleaf pine stands (i.e. low SOM content). Thus, an assessment of the soil properties of loblolly pine stands may allow for an identification of candidate sites for which longleaf pine restoration treatments may be most effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus palustris 3aPinus taeda 3abotanical composition 3acalcium 3acanopy 3acoastal plains 3aecological restoration 3afertilizer application 3afire regime 3afire suppression 3aground vegetation 3aherbaceous plants 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3aprescribed burning 3ashrubs 3asoil nutrients 3asoil properties 3asoil water 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aNorth Carolina 0aLongleaf pine 0aLoblolly pine 0aRestoration ecology 0aPond pine 0aPrescribed fire 0aFire suppression1 aPalmquist, Kyle1 aCohen, Susan1 aChristensen, Norman L.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 356 p.64-73dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014100175300001200316520150800328592002801836650002401864650002001888650003001908650001701938650001801955650001101973650001001984650002001994650002502014650001402039650001302053650002102066650001202087650001402099651001902113651001402132651002202146651002202168651001802190653002402208653002502232653001702257653002602274653001502300700001902315700002202334700001802356700002002374700002102394700002002415773009902435856008602534852000902620655001202629IND60568574520221122033003.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056857452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancinelli, Giorgio10aOn the Atlantic blue crab (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun 1896) in southern European coastal waters: Time to turn a threat into a resource?  ap. 1-8.  aThe blue crab Callinectes sapidus is native to the coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean, and along the US coasts the species supports an important fishery. The crab was introduced to Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. To date, the species is considered invasive and it has been extensively recorded in southern European waters (SEW), where it is starting to penetrate the shellfish market. Here, an integrated management strategy is proposed for the blue crab in SEW, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea and the eastern Atlantic coasts of the Iberian Peninsula. Taking as introductory examples two case studies represented by the red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus and the green crab Carcinus maenas, a framework of key issues is reviewed, considering the double nature of the species as invaders and shellfish products. A SWOT analysis is eventually presented for C. sapidus, in order to perform a state-of-the-art synthesis of the proposed scenario, highlighting the potential opportunities as well as the weaknesses related with the limited knowledge of the ecological and economic impact of the species in invaded habitats. The review is concluded by an appraisal of the current trends in global and European crustacean fisheries. The ongoing expansion of C. sapidus might represent a useful management case study, where the need to control an invasive species and mitigate its ecological impact can be harmonized with the opportunity to value it as a fishery resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallinectes sapidus 3aCarcinus maenas 3aParalithodes camtschatica 3acase studies 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3acrabs 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3amarkets 3ashellfish 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBlack Sea 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean Sea 3aUnited States 0aCallinectes sapidus 0aBiological invasions 0aCrab fishery 0aIntegrated management 0aMitigation1 aChainho, Paula1 aCilenti, Lucrezia1 aFalco, Silvia1 aKapiris, Kostas1 aKatselis, George1 aRibeiro, Filipe0 tFisheries research.g2017 Oct., v. 194 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010300173500002000276520129700296592002801593596003601621650001801657650001401675650001401689650000901703650001201712700001901724700002001743700006101763773012701824856008401951852000902035655001202044IND60790624020221123004237.0220826e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079062402DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRioja‐Lang, Fiona10aRabbit welfare: determining priority welfare issues for pet rabbits using a modified Delphi method  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK, but little research into their welfare needs has been conducted. METHODS: A modified Delphi method was used to generate expert consensus on the most important welfare issues for rabbits in the UK. The study involved 11 experts, recruited from a range of disciplines. The experts generated an initial broad list of welfare issues via an online discussion board. Two rounds of online surveys were conducted to prioritise these issues. The final round was a workshop with a subsection of experts. The experts decided that welfare issues should be ranked considering: (1) severity, (2) duration, and (3) prevalence. RESULTS: Experts considered that rabbits were often kept in inadequate housing, were not handled or socialised properly, were fed inappropriate diets and owners failed to vaccinate their rabbits against preventable diseases. Rabbits were thought to experience a reduced life expectancy. Lack of owner knowledge of rabbit husbandry and behaviour and, in some cases, also lack of veterinary knowledge, contributed to poor rabbit welfare. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi process resulted in consensus on the most significant welfare challenges faced by rabbits and can help guide future research and education priority decisions.  aPublisher supplied data  cAnimal Welfare Foundation (AWF) 3aDelphi method 3aeducation 3alongevity 3apets 3arabbits1 aBacon, Heather1 aConnor, Melanie1 aDwyer, Cathy Mary1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7511-20560 tVeterinary record open.g2019 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e000363-dBritish Veterinary AssociationwJournal:27672x2399-20507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vetreco-2019-0003633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008000168300001800248520090000266592002801166650002201194650001301216650001101229650001401240650001301254650001801267650001101285650001801296650001101314650003701325700001901362700001901381700001401400700002601414773013601440856008101576852000901657655001201666IND60624218920221120104737.0181202e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062421892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-2150-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoudjahem, A.-G.10aStructural and surface propperties of Ni-Cu nanoparticles supported on SiO2  ap. 2025-2030.  aNickel (1%) and nickel (1%)-copper (0.2–0.75%) metal phases supported on silica have been prepared by aqueous hydrazine reduction of nickel acetate at 70°C. They were characterized by XRD, TEM, H₂-adsorption and TPD. The obtained results show that nickel is in a whisker-like shape or as a film of low density for the Ni/SiO₂ and Ni-Cu/SiO₂ systems respectively. The mean particle size is lower than 2 nm. Copper is in the shape of bigger facetted particles in the mono or bimetallic systems with a mean particle size of about 25 nm. The nickel phase dispersion, as determined by H₂-adsorption, decreased in the presence of copper, as probably a result of Ni-Cu interactions. All the solids were found to be good hydrogen reservoir through the formation of H-spiltover species. The amounts of hydrogen stored changed with the copper content due to changes in the Ni-Cu interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3acopper 3ahydrazine 3ahydrogen 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aparticle size 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aPietrowski, M.1 aMonteverdi, S.1 aMercy, M.1 aBettahar, Mohammed M.0 tJournal of materials science.g2006 Apr., v. 41, no. 7 p.2025-2030dKluwer Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-2150-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012800162300001800290520037300308592002800681650001400709650002200723650002300745650001300768650001600781650002200797650001800819650001300837700002200850700002200872700001900894700002100913700002100934700001800955773013200973856007501105852000901180655001201189IND60658926920221119044014.0190826e20110503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065892692DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc10558b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakabayashi, Koji10aHighly clear and transparent nanoemulsion preparation under surfactant-free conditions using tandem acoustic emulsification  ap. 5765-5767.  aA new technique for the preparation of a highly clear and transparent emulsified aqueous solution containing immiscible monomer droplets with diameters of a few tens of nanometres under surfactant-free conditions using tandem acoustic emulsification is described.

Glycosylation of rhEPO affects the biological activity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and in-vivo clearance rate of rhEPO. Characterization of the glycosylation status of rhEPO is of great importance for quality control. In this study, we established a fast and comprehensive approach for reliable characterization and relative quantitation of rhEPO glycosylation, which combines multiple-enzyme digestion, hydrophilic-interaction chromatography (HILIC) enrichment of glycopeptides, and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The N-linked and O-linked intact glycopeptides were analyzed with high-resolution and high-accuracy (HR–AM) mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap. In total, 74 intact glycopeptides from four glycosylation sites at N₂₄, N₃₈, N₈₃, and O₁₂₆ were identified, with the simultaneous determination of peptide sequences and glycoform compositions. The extracted ion chromatograms based on the HR–AM data enabled relative quantification of glycoforms. Our results could be extended to quality control of rhEPO or could help establish detection approaches for glycosylation of other proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3aerythropoietin 3aglycopeptides 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aimmune response 3apharmacokinetics 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aTian, Fang1 aCai, Yun1 aQian, Xiaohong1 aCostello, Catherine E.1 aYing, Wantao0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 406, no. 25 p.6265-6274dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8037-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245011100202300002000313520114800333592002801481650002301509650002401532650002801556650001601584650003101600650002101631650001301652650001901665650001601684650001901700650001601719653003601735653001701771653002601788653003401814653001901848700005701867700002101924700005701945700006002002773014202062856007802204852000902282655001202291IND60746143720220218000000.0210729e20210716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074614372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c050542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBláha, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3664-003710aTwo-Dimensional CVD-Graphene/Polyaniline Supercapacitors: Synthesis Strategy and Electrochemical Operation  ap. 34686-34695.  aNanocomposites of graphene materials and conducting polymers have been extensively studied as promising materials for electrodes of supercapacitors. Here, we present a graphene/polyaniline heterostructure consisting of a CVD-graphene and polyaniline monolayer and its electrochemical operation in a supercapacitor. The synthesis employs functionalization of graphene by p-phenylene sulfonic groups and oxidative polymerization of anilinium by ammonium persulfate under reaction conditions, providing no bulk polyaniline. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy showed the selective formation of polyaniline on the graphene. In situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and cyclic voltammetry (both in a microdroplet setup) confirm the reversibility of polyaniline redox transitions and graphene electrochemical doping. After an increase within the initial 200 cycles due to the formation of benzoquinone–hydroquinone defects in polyaniline, the specific areal capacitance remained for 2400 cycles with ±1% retention at 21.2 μF cm–², one order of magnitude higher than the capacitance of pristine graphene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aammonium persulfate 3aatomic force microscopy 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3apolyaniline 3apolymerization 3avoltammetry 0atwo-dimensional heterostructure 0aCVD-graphene 0apolyaniline monolayer 0aRaman spectroelectrochemistry 0asupercapacitor1 aBouša, Milan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1073-73861 aValeš, Václav,1 aFrank, Otakar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9661-62501 aKalbáč, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9574-43680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 16, v. 13, no. 29 p.34686-34695dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c050543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245013100176300002000307520113300327592002801460650002301488650002501511650002001536650001001556650005001566650002701616650002101643650001201664650004101676650001101717650001101728650002801739650003501767650001601802650001301818650001501831650001201846650001301858700002401871700002701895700002701922700002201949773014901971856008102120852000902201655001202210IND60586871520221120102219.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058687152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0297-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamasubburayan, Ramasamy10aEnvironmentally benign antifouling activity and toxic properties of bioactive metabolites from mangrove Excoecaria agallocha L  ap. 27490-27501.  aThis study was aimed to investigate the antifouling (AF) potentials and toxic properties of methanol extract from leaves of mangrove Excoecaria agallocha. Antimicrofouling activity results inferred that this extract strongly inhibited fouling bacterial and microalgal growth. This extract had also inhibited the settlement of brown mussel Perna indica and larvae of barnacle Balanus amphitrite. Further, EC₅₀ < LC₅₀ and therapeutic ratio > 1 together propagated non-toxic nature of the extract. Mollusk foot adherence assay result showed complete inhibition of foot spreading and loss of attachment of common rocky fouler Patella vulgata to the substrata. Field assay results affirmed that this extract effectively deterred settlement of biofoulers. Purification and GC-MS analysis of bioassay-guided active spot evidenced presence of three major compounds (> 85%) responsible for the promising AF activity. The identified lead compounds subjected to an estimation (BIOWIN™) program developed by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) predicts that they are biodegradable in nature.

However, their feeding habits, which determine the role of each species in the ecosystem, have not been sufficiently studied. Moreover, although a diet shift from necrophagy on vertebrate carcasses to predatory feeding on invertebrates is known to occur in this subfamily, the processes and mechanisms of this shift have also been inadequately addressed. We examined female fecundity and larval development on various diets in a Silphinae species, Necrophila (Eusilpha) japonica (Motschulsky). The experimental diets included a meat diet and various invertebrate diets, which reflect the ‘ancestral’ feeding habit in Silphinae, necrophagy, and the ‘derivative’ feeding habit, predatory feeding. Female fecundity was significantly higher on the meat diet (minced beef) than on an insect larvae diet (mealworms and dipteran larvae) but did not significantly differ from that on an earthworm diet. Larval developmental performance was significantly higher on the earthworm diet than on the meat and insect larvae diets. Our results for larval development were consistent with those of previous stable isotope analyses of the same species, in which isotopic values of larval samples agree with those of hypothetical consumers that utilize earthworms. The consistency of results among different methods indicates that N. japonica larvae are most likely earthworm feeders. In contrast, our results for the female fecundity experiment differed from those of previous stable isotope analyses, in which vertebrate carcasses unlikely serve as the staple diet of adults in the field; thus, the feeding habits of N. japonica adults remain unresolved. Our observations that females and larvae performed best on the meat and earthworm diets, respectively, may indicate that, in Silphinae, the diet shift from necrophagy to predatory habits occurs earlier in larvae than in adults.  aPublisher supplied data  a5830150cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  a17K15171cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 3aSilphidae 3aadults 3adead animals 3aearthworms 3aexperimental diets 3afecundity 3afemales 3ainsect larvae 3alarval development 3amacroinvertebrates 3aminced beef 3anecrophagy 3asoil ecosystems 3astable isotopes 3atemperate zones 3avertebrates1 aSasakawa, Kôji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9246-57770 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2019 Feb., v. 167, no. 2 p.85-90dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.127583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008400167300001600251520210600267592002802373650002502401650001902426650002502445650001202470650001102482650002702493650001102520650001002531650001902541650001602560650001502576650001702591650001602608650001302624653002302637653001902660653001002679653001402689653001502703773010402718856008502822852000902907655001202916IND60593298620221116153405.0190131e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059329862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKee, Lance10aMeeting the imperative to accelerate environmental bioelectromagnetics research  ap. 100-108.  aIn this article, the author draws on his experience in the world of geospatial information technology standards to suggest a path toward acceleration of bioelectromagnetics science. Many studies show biological effects of extremely low frequency (ELF) and radiofrequency (RF) radiation despite that fact that the radiation is too weak to cause temperature changes in biological features. Considered together in worst case scenarios, such effects, many of which appear to have long latencies, could have potentially disastrous consequences for the health and safety of humans and wildlife. Other studies show no such effects, and in both cases, often there are significant research quality deficits that make it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the data. The progress of bioelectromagnetics science is retarded by a lack of standard data models and experimental protocols that could improve the overall quality of research and make it easier for researchers to benefit from omics-related bioinformatics resources. "Certainty of safety" of wireless devices used in digital communications and remote sensing (radar) is impossible without dosimetry standards that reflect the effects of non-thermal exposures. Electrical signaling in biological systems, a poorly funded research domain, is as biologically important as chemical signaling, a richly funded research domain, and these two types of signaling are inextricably connected. Entreprenuerial scientists pursuing bioelectronic innovations have begun to attract new funding. With appropriate institutional coordination, this new funding could equally benefit those investigating environmental effects of ELF and RF radiation. The author proposes a concerted effort among both bioelectronics technology stakeholders and environmental bioelectromagnetics science researchers to collaborate in developing institutional arrangements and standard data models that would give the science a stronger bioinformatics platform and give researchers better access to omics data. What is proposed here is essentially a bioelectromagnetics omics initiative.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abioinformatics 3aenvironmental impact 3afunding 3ahumans 3ainformation technology 3amodels 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3astakeholders 3atemperature 3awildlife 0aBioelectromagnetic 0aBioelectronics 0aOmics 0aDosimetry 0aData model0 tEnvironmental research.g2018 July, v. 164 p.100-108dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245017300159300001600332520176900348592002802117596009802145650002002243650001902263650001802282650002702300650001002327650003302337650004302370650003002413650001202443650003002455650001802485700001702503700001702520700001402537700001402551700001402565700001202579700005202591773014502643856008202788852000902870655001202879IND60627246320221122043124.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062724632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-018-1472-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jia10aImprovement and evaluation of loop-mediated isothermal amplification combined with a chromatographic flow dipstick assay and utilization in detection of Vibrio cholerae  ap. 647-658.  aLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a specific, sensitive, and easy-to-perform nucleic acid analytical technique with wide application for diagnosis of disease. Recently, LAMP combined with use of a lateral chromatographic flow dipstick (LFD) has been widely used in nucleic acid detection. However, the LFD mechanism has not been systematically analyzed, and the optimal combination of labeled primers has not been adequately evaluated. We analyzed the LAMP mechanism and discovered that the labeled loop primers played a significant role in the LFD assay. To verify our hypothesis, we developed two LFD assays for Vibrio cholerae to detect the ctxA gene and the 16S–23S ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). We labeled the inner primers [forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP)] and loop primers [forward loop primer (LF) and backward loop primer (LB)]. Then the labeled and unlabeled primers were combined to form ten different primer sets. We assessed the specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency of LFD assays with use of different primer compositions. All triple-labeled primer sets resulted in false positive results in the LFD assay, as did the FIP and BIP double-labeled primer set. Other double-labeled-primer sets used in LFD assays showed higher sensitivity than the LAMP assays. Moreover, FIP and LF double-labeled and BIP and LB double-labeled sets had the highest sensitivity. In both cases, assays could be performed in 20 min. We also applied the ITS LFD assays in food samples. The enrichment broths of 112 oyster samples were tested, and the proportion that tested positive by the LFD assays was 6.25%, which was not lower than the rate for the conventional PCR method (5.36%).

Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) coexists with Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) – they infest stored cereal grains, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa, and cause significant losses in storage. Laboratory studies were carried out to determine the efficacy of Xylocoris flavipes (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and Theocolax elegans (Westwood) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), alone or in combination, in suppressing populations of R. dominica and S. oryzae in stored rice and wheat grains. The weight loss and moisture of the infested grains were assessed, for the various combinations of the two pest insects and the two natural enemies. In rice there was a synergistic effect of the combined release of T. elegans and X. flavipes against both R. dominica and S. oryzae compared to the effect of one natural enemy alone. With the combined release, only 2% F₁ progeny of the pest beetles emerged compared to the untreated control (100%), whereas 3.5 and 6% emerged when X. flavipes and T. elegans, respectively, were released alone. When the two natural enemies were released in combination, 0.4% R. dominica F₁ progeny emerged, compared to 1.6% with X. flavipes or T. elegans alone. In the combined release only 0.3% S. oryzae F₁ progeny emerged, whereas 65% emerged with X. flavipes alone and 41% with T. elegans alone. No synergistic effect of the combined release of the two natural enemies was detected in wheat. In stored rice, the lowest percentage of weight loss (44%) was found when both natural enemies and both beetle species were present. We conclude that the combination of the predator and the parasitoid should be recommended when R. domininca and S. oryzae coexist and feed on stored cereals, especially rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aTheocolax elegans 3aXylocoris flavipes 3abiological control 3afood security 3ahost-parasite relationships 3anatural enemies 3aparasitoids 3apostharvest technology 3apredator-prey relationships 3aprogeny 3arice 3astorage insects 3astored grain 3asynergism 3aweight loss 3awheat 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aObeng‐Ofori, Daniel1 aOpuni‐Frimpong, Emmanuel1 aUlrichs, Christian1 aSchöller, Matthias0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2019 Feb., v. 167, no. 2 p.118-128dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.127603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
